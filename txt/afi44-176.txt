                                              Chapter 1

                                     PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Definition of Access To Care (ATC) Management. ATC Management encompasses
myriad Military Treatment Facility (MTF) functions and is an integral part of healthcare
delivery, regardless of the care delivery model or platform, inpatient or outpatient. ATC
Management includes, but is not limited to: day-to-day management of templating, scheduling,
and appointing functions, including those made by telephone, in person, electronic secure
messaging, and the internet; information systems management, including provider network file
and table building, and clinic and provider profile management; empanelment and demand
management and analysis; referral management activities; appointing telephony management;
and effective and efficient personnel management in support of this mission. ATC is not limited
to a traditional appointment with a provider. It also includes the concept of Enhanced Access
which provides multiple opportunities for the MTF to provide appropriate, high quality, and
timely care in other venues by other team members. Enhanced Access will be incorporated into
MTF ATC strategy.
1.2. Goals of ATC Management. Implement and sustain a systematic, proactive,
programmatic, and responsive access program for all clinics and services. Appointment access
must meet standards as stated in 32 Code of Federal Regulations 199.17, implemented by the
Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6025.20
(Medical Management (MM) Programs in the Direct Care System (DCS) and Remote Areas).
The end result is the right patient is provided the right health care service, at the right time, in the
right setting. The right setting may include over the phone, in the office, or via internet, and it
may be with a provider other than a physician.
1.3. Objectives of ATC Management. A successful access management program is
commander led, with a multidisciplinary oversight approach including employment and
sustainment of a well-researched, efficient and effective plan that maintains access to services,
meets mission requirements, and satisfies the wellness needs of beneficiaries and ensures a
satisfactory experience with all health care services. Each MTF will place the following
objectives among its top priorities:
     1.3.1. Implementation of effective Enhanced Access strategies. (T-3)
1.3.2. Provide access to health care services/appointments within access standards. (T-3)

     1.3.3. Maximize provider-patient continuity. (T-3)
     1.3.4. Achieve patient and staff satisfaction through monitoring and proactive actions. (T-3)
     1.3.5. Provide a patient-centered appointment system, by telephone, in person, via internet,
     or through secure messaging. (T-3)
     1.3.6. Maximize first call resolution by resolving the patient’s request for health care
     services during their first contact, in person, telephone call, internet request or secure
     message, and with as few steps as possible. (T-3)
     1.3.7. Make needed capacity available and optimize internal appointment supply. (T-3)

                            APPOINTING AND SCHEDULING

3.1. Overview of Appointing.
   3.1.1. MTFs will construct templates and schedules using the nine Military Health System
   (MHS) Standard Appointment types (see chart below). Definitions can be found on the ATC
   AFMS Knowledge Exchange (Kx). (T-3)
   3.1.2. Appointing personnel will select one of the five ATC categories (see chart below) in
   the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) appointing search function in order to book
   scheduled appointments. The appropriate ATC standard is chosen based on one or more of
   the following: 1) the timeline of the patient’s request for care; 2) provider directive; 3)
   locally based protocols (T-3).

   3.1.3. MTF leadership will establish appointing processes that will successfully match the
   patient’s needs with the appropriate ATC category, while striving to maximize patient/PCM
   continuity. (T-0)
3.2. Use of Dollar Sign ($) Suffix on Appointment Types.
   3.2.1. Use of the $ suffix on appointment types is prohibited from use in all clinics that have
   PCMs assigned. (T-3)
   3.2.2. The $ may be used in specialty clinics, but will be limited to no more than 10% of
   initial specialty (SPEC) appointments. To the greatest extent feasible, the appointing
   function should be performed by the central appointing call center or Referral Management
   Center staff. (T-3)
AFI44-176 30 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     11


3.3. Maintaining PCM Continuity/Patient Centered Medical Home Team (PCMH)/PCM
Booking.
3.3.1. Continuity will remain the primary objective of MTF primary care access
policy. Standard booking protocols will be developed and executed to achieve the following:
       3.3.1.1. Patient - PCM (provider) continuity should be maintained at or greater than 70%
       in Family Health, Pediatrics and Internal Medicine clinics, and routine care continuity
       should be maximized in Flight and Operational Medicine clinics.
       3.3.1.2. Patient - PCMH Team continuity should be maintained at or greater than 90%.
       3.3.1.3. The AFMS cross booking goal is 0%. However, judicious use of cross booking
       within a clinic product line (Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Flight
       Medicine) may be used when necessary for acute access within the remaining 10% of
       available appointments to maintain patient-MTF continuity. Cross booking performance
       (percent total booked appointments) by provider, team and MTF aggregate will be
       incorporated in regular reviews by the ATC Team, and reported to the MTF Executive
       Committee monthly. (T-3)
       3.3.1.4. Under specific conditions of extended provider absences (deployment, hiring
       gaps, etc.), patients may be administratively re-empanelled equitably among the
       remaining PCMH providers for continuity purposes, with the expected impact on
       apparent cross booking.
       3.3.1.5. Active Duty Service Member (ADSMs) will not be sent to the network for
       primary care during the duty day unless no other option is available to provide care.
3.4. Booking Transactions.
   3.4.1. Not Meeting Access Standards. MTFs will use the ATC category search that best
   represents the patient's need, even if an appointment was not found within ATC standards.
   (T-0)
   3.4.2. Patients Refusing Care Within Access Standards. MTFs will allow patients to
   waive ATC standards and request appointments outside of ATC Standards for provider
   continuity/convenience/personal reasons, even though the MTF may have appointments
   available inside ATC Standards with their PCM or other providers in the team/clinic. (T-3)
       3.4.2.1. Patients Refusing All Appointment Times Offered. Appointing personnel
       will document patient refusals IAW current information system processes listed on the
       AFMS ATC Kx website to ensure it reflects the reason a patient refused all appointment
       times offered as opposed to not accepting care within ATC standards. (T-3)
   3.4.3. Un-booked Appointments. MTFs will use the Un-booked Appointment Request/
   Reporting functionality in CHCS to allow for the tracking and reporting of patients who
   requested an appointment, a search was performed by an appointing agent, but the
   appointment request did not result in a booked appointment. (T-3)
       3.4.3.1. Choosing Un-booked Appointment Reasons. Appointing personnel will
       choose the most accurate Un-booked Appointment Request reason from the list below,
       using the definitions that are listed on the AFMS ATC Kx website, best matching why
       the search attempt did not result in a booked appointment. (T-3)

4.1. Use of Detail Codes.
   4.1.1. MTFs may use detail codes to further define appointment type definitions on
   templates and schedules. (T-3)
   4.1.2. MTFs will use the tri-service approved operational definitions.(T-3)
4.2. Use of Patient Access Type Detail Codes.
   4.2.1. MTFs will use no more than one patient access type detail code per appointment slot.
   This ensures appointing personnel correctly identify the category of patient (i.e. Active Duty,
   Family Member, etc.) to be booked into a particular slot. (T-3)
4.3. Use of Web Enabled (WEA) Detail Codes.
   4.3.1. MTFs will use the WEA detail code to identify all the appointment slots the MTF

4.4. Use of Provider Book Only (PBO) Detail Codes.
   4.4.1. The use of the PBO detail code restricts booking by other members of the clinic and
   the central appointing function either at the MTF or the multi-market office. MTFs will have
   specific procedures for the use of the PBO detail code approved by the Access Management
   Team. (T-3)
   4.4.2. The use of the PBO detail code will be limited to those appointments in excess of
   required centrally bookable appointment levels for PCMH and specialty clinics. No more
   than 10% of each provider’s available appointments, as measured weekly, will use the PBO
   detail code. (T-3)

                               REFERRALS AND CONSULTS

10.1. Management of Referrals/Consults. All specialty/surgical care and Right of First
Refusal (ROFR) referrals/consults will be managed IAW current AFMS Referral Management
Business Rules and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD (HA)) referral
management (RM) guidance. (T-0)
10.2. Review and Booking of Referrals/Consults. The MTF’s Capability and ROFR reports
should be as unrestrictive as possible to retain/recapture the maximum number of specialty care
referrals to sustain clinical currency and minimize purchased care costs. These reports should be
updated as needed for accuracy. (T-3) The MTF Executive Staff or designee is the approval
authority for the MTF’s Capability and ROFR reports. (T-3) All referral requests will be routed
to the RMC or multiservice market referral center for administrative review, appointing to the
MTF, and processing to the Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC). Exceptions to this
process shall be approved by the Executive Staff or designee in writing. MTF specialty clinics
exempted by the Executive Staff are responsible for referral review, booking, & tracking of those
referrals. (T-3)
   10.2.1. If the patient cannot be booked within the appropriate ATC standard as indicated by
   the referring provider’s referral priority, and the patient does not waive the ATC standard, the
   patient will be referred to the purchased care system IAW current TRICARE and MCSC
   requirements. (T-0)
   10.2.2. If there is neither capability nor capacity within the MTF, referral requests will be
   deferred to the MCSC for Prime and ADSM beneficiaries. (T-0)
   10.2.3. Since the MCSCs do not process referral requests for Prime with Other Health
   Insurance, TRICARE-Plus, TRICARE for Life, and Standard beneficiaries, MTFs will have
   written processes in place to assist these beneficiaries with their referral requirements to the
   purchased care system providers. (T-3)
10.3. Management of Unused Referrals.
   10.3.1. The referring provider shall be notified by the RMC of all referrals not used or

   notified of the determination. (T-0)
   10.4.2. The MTF RMC or multiservice market referral center will determine if the MTF has
   specialty capability and capacity to accept ROFRs within ATC standards. (T-0)
   10.4.3. If action is not taken on the ROFR per the TOM time requirements, it will be
   considered to be an implied denial of the ROFR and the MCSC will appoint to the purchased
   care system. (T-0)
 22                                                             AFI44-176 30 OCTOBER 2014


10.5. Additional Referral Visits or Specialty Care Authorization.
   10.5.1. For services beyond the initial authorization, the MCSC will use its best business
   practices in determining the extent of additional services to authorize. (T-0)
   10.5.2. The MCSC shall not request a referral from the MTF, but shall provide the MTF’s
   single POC [the RMC] a copy of the authorization and clinical information that served as the
   basis for the new authorization. (T-0)
10.6. Management of ADSM Referrals.
   10.6.1. MTF leadership will ensure processes are in place and utilized to fully address the
   management of ADSM referrals. (T-0)
10.7. Management of Urgent and Routine Primary Care Referred to the Network.
   10.7.1. When patient demand for primary care services, including Enhanced Access
   opportunities, exceeds supply of an MTF to meet ATC standards , patients must be referred
   to the network/purchased care system. (T-0)
   10.7.2. MTF leadership will develop written instructions governing when and how acute
   and/or routine primary care services in the purchased care system will be accessed and used.
   (T-3)
   10.7.3. MTF leadership will work closely with their local MCSC management and nearby
   multi service market MTFs (if applicable) to ensure that the most effective and efficient
   utilization of MTF Direct Care/in-house resources are used. (T-3)
10.8. Referral Management Accountability and Tracking.
   10.8.1. Referral results will be uploaded into the Healthcare Artifact and Image Management
   Solution (HAIMS)/electronic health record. (T-0).
   10.8.2. Providers will be notified of new results via CHCS T-CON. The T-Con and the
   matching results will be titled: Network Results – Specialty MM/DD/YY, where the date is
   the encounter or results date. (T-3)
   10.8.3. The MTF shall have a process in place ensuring referral results are reviewed and
   signed by the referring provider/PCM within three business days of receiving the results.
   The MTF will establish written processes to monitor referring provider review of results and
   notify the SGH/designee of deficiencies. (T-3)
   10.8.4. For purchased care referral results, MTFs will have written processes in place for
   actively reconciling missing results to their conclusion on all initial specialty care referrals
   and urgent/primary care deferred to the network. (T-3)
   10.8.5. MTFs must use Referral Management Suite (RMS) to process and track all referrals
   (T-0)
10.9. RM Performance Measurement and Reporting.
   10.9.1. MTFs will implement established minimum performance measurement metrics as
   outlined in the AFMS Referral Management Business Rules. (T-3) These metrics report key
   indicators and outcomes of referral management functions.
AFI44-176 30 OCTOBER 2014                                                             23

HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR TRICARE PRIME BENEFICIARIES NOT ENROLLED
              TO THE MTF OR IN A TRANSITION STATUS

12.1. Establish Guidelines. MTF leadership will establish guidelines to ensure appointment
access to TRICARE Prime enrolled members who may be in a student status, travel status,
transitioning enrollment between MTFs, transferring enrollment between Manage Care Support
Contractors (MCSCs), or in a terminal/appellate leave status. (T-0)
12.2. Coordination with Other DoD MTFs. Leaders of MTFs located in multi-market areas
will develop guidelines to ensure that clear lines of responsibility are delineated in delivering
care to TRICARE Prime beneficiaries enrolled to other multi-market MTFs in their area. (T-0)
The goal is to maximize care provided by the PCM to which they are enrolled.
12.3. Same Level Enrollee Access. All TRICARE Prime enrollees will be given the same level
of access to appointments within the MTF regardless of their Prime enrollment location. (T-0)
12.4. Enrolled Elsewhere Access. If the MTF cannot provide care for beneficiaries enrolled
elsewhere within its direct care system, either because these beneficiaries cannot contact their
own PCM for consultation or gain care from the MTF to which they are enrolled, the MTF will
ensure that a referral is entered authorizing care to be provided by network/contract resources for
these beneficiaries. (T-0)

                                          Chapter 13

                AIR RESERVE COMPONENT (ARC) ACCESS TO CARE

13.1. Introduction.
   13.1.1. The following DoD and Air Force publications provide guidance for determining
   ARC eligibility: AFI 41-210, Patient Administration Functions; AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty
   (Misconduct) Determination; AFI 44-170 Preventive Health Assessment; Department of
   Defense Directive (DoDD) 1332.18 Separation for Retirement for Physical Disability; Air
   Force Reserve Command (AFRC) PHA Guide; and DoDI 1332.38 Physical Disability
   Evaluation. In addition, Title 10 USC Section 1074 and Title 37 USC Section 204 (g)(h) as
   well as AFRC/SG and Air National Guard (ANG)/SG can be used for references.
   13.1.2. ARC members who incur or aggravate an injury or illness in the line of duty while
   performing active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty for training or while
   traveling directly to or from such duty, shall be provided the medical or dental care
   appropriate for the condition until the member is found returned to duty, or the injury, illness
   or disease cannot be materially improved by further hospitalization or treatment and the
   member has been separated as a result of a Disability Evaluation System determination. (T-
   0)
13.2. ARC Health Care Benefits for Air Force required evaluation.
   13.2.1. ARC members assigned to ARC Units with sufficient medical assets will receive
   their required evaluations (e.g., Periodic Health Assessment (PHA), annual Dental exam,
   etc.) from their respective servicing Reserve Medical Unit or Guard Medical Unit or other
   approved source. (T-2)
   13.2.2. AFRC members attached to Regular Air Force (RegAF) units or assigned to ARC
   Units without a servicing AFRC Medical Unit will receive their required AFRC PHA
   evaluations from a RegAF MTF or other approved source. (T-2)
   13.2.3. Many ARC members travel considerable distances from their home to their unit of
   assignment or have limited time to complete these appointments on duty days. When an
   ARC member is seen in the MTF, clinic/ancillary services personnel must complete all
   physical and ancillary services on the same day. (T-3) This does not include the completion
   of the paperwork, only the actual testing and evaluation.
   13.2.4. ARC members residing outside the MTF catchment area or more than 40 miles from
   their units’ servicing MTF may also obtain these evaluations from any MTF close to their
   residence.
   13.2.5. ARC members are not required to be in military status to schedule an appointment;
   however, they must be in military status at the time of the examination, and must provide
   approved documentation to clinic staff that they are in military status. ARC members with
   an approved LOD do not need to be in a military status for examination. (T-2)
   13.2.6. ARC members will have the same level of access for these required evaluations as
   RegAF members. (T-0)
AFI44-176 30 OCTOBER 2014                                                                       27


13.3. ARC Access to Care for Line of Duty (LOD) Determinations.
   13.3.1. Access to care is allowed during the determination of the LOD, but only for the
   condition identified for LOD determination. (T-1) The ARC member must provide
   documentation of LOD(s) that are in process or have been determined LOD in order to
   receive follow-up care (e.g., AF Form 348). (T-3)
   13.3.2. The line of duty findings will determine eligibility for continued medical/dental care.
   (T-0) According to AFI 41-210, entitlement exists only for the medical condition determined
   to be In the Line of Duty. An AF Form 348, AFRC Form 348, or DD Form 261, Report of
   Investigation Line of Duty and Misconduct Status, or Provisional LOD with all signature
   blocks complete, is required to establish eligibility. LOD is valid for care only until the
   service member is found fit and returned to duty or separated by the DES system for the
   documented medical condition.
       13.3.2.1. ARC members will have the same level of access to care as RegAF members
       for treatment of those conditions identified as LOD or LOD/SA (Service Aggravated) in
       the LOD determination. (T-0)
       13.3.2.2. ARC members not on orders will normally show as ineligible in DEERS
       (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System). This does not, however, preclude the
       booking of an appointment for the ARC member by appointing agents. Should further
       verification of eligibility be required, appointing agents can contact the ARC member’s
       unit administrator/medical representative or by consulting the MTF access manager. (T-
       3)
   13.3.3. ARC members are not eligible for care when the determination is NOT in the Line of
   Duty. (T-0) Care received at this point is at the member’s expense.
13.4. ARC Referrals. ARC members who require follow-up care not in the area where the
initial treatment was rendered are referred to the closest MTF near their home. Appropriate
medical authority from the referring MTF will contact the appropriate medical authority at the
receiving MTF to ensure care is delivered. The referring MTF will notify the member’s
supporting ARC medical unit of the referral action for tracking purposes. (T-1)
   13.4.1. ARC members who are serving under Title 10 Contingency, Title 10, or Title 32
   orders who are identified with potential duty-related illness or injury should be referred in an
   urgent manner (72 hour consult), to include maximum utilization of both RegAF and off-base
   referral sites. (T-1) This practice will ensure timely identification and access to entitled
   healthcare prior to the end of mobilization or contingency orders and without a break in
   service that can result in loss of medical benefits.
   13.4.2. Any care referred outside the MTF will only be paid for if the LOD process has been
   initiated or completed. In addition, the referral must be coordinated with the Reserve and
   Service Member Support Office Great Lakes (R&SMSO-GL) (formerly MMSO) by MTF
   staff. (T-1) Coordination with the R&SMSO-GL will ensure services are rendered without a
   denial of claim.

              MANAGEMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS TO CARE

14.1. Mental Health ATC Management.
   14.1.1. MTF Access Manager/GPM Responsibilities. The GPM will provide at least a
   monthly consultation on the management of templates and schedules and the measurement of
   the Mental Health clinic’s performance in meeting ATC standards to the leadership and
   templating/scheduling staff of the Mental Health Clinic. (T-3)
   14.1.2. Guiding Principles. The overall management of mental health access will be IAW
   current ASD (HA) Policy. (T-0)
14.2. Emergent Mental Health Care. MTFs will establish processes to ensure that initial
requests for emergent care will be provided on an immediate basis as dictated by the threat. (T-
0)
14.3. Urgent Mental Health Care. Urgent mental health care will be provided within 24 hours
or less. Clinics can book these patients into ACUT appointments or walk them in. (T-0)
14.4. Routine Mental Health Care.
   14.4.1. Routine mental health care will be provided within one week/7 calendar days of the
   patient’s request. Beneficiaries will retain the option of deferring this routine mental health
   assessment past this 7 day standard. (T-0)
   14.4.2. Patients may be appointed to their assigned PCM, Behavioral Health Optimization
   Program (BHOP) Provider, or to the Mental Health Clinic.
   14.4.3. Mental Health Clinics will use ROUT appointment types in their templates and
   schedules and use the Routine ATC Category to book initial self-referral requests. (T-0)
14.5. Mental Health Clinic Appointment Types. Appointment types will be used IAW the
definitions of AFI 44-176, Chapter 3. Only five standard appointment types are permitted to be
used with or without $ suffixes as per the following:
   14.5.1. ACUT/ACUT$ slots will be used to book urgent mental health care requests within
   24 hours. (T-3)
   14.5.2. ROUT/ROUT$ slots will be used to book initial requests for a new mental health
   condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed condition for which intervention is
   required, but is not urgent, within 7 days, or when a patient self-refers. (T-3)
   14.5.3. SPEC/SPEC$ slots will be used to book any Routine priority referral/consult requests
   for initial mental health care evaluations within the time frame requested by the referring
   provider or not to exceed 28 days. SPEC will not be used when a patient self-refers. (T-3)
   14.5.4. EST/EST$ slots will be used to book appointments when providers direct the patient
   to come back (follow-up) for additional mental health care/course of therapy. These
   appointments will be booked within the time frame requested by the mental health provider.
   (T-3)
AFI44-176 30 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      29


   14.5.5. GRP/GRP$ slots will be used for patients who require group therapies, counseling,
   or teaching sessions where a mental health provider will perform the service in a group
   setting. The detail code fields can be used to provide further information about the care to be
   provided in the group appointment, (e.g., STRESS for a Stress Management Class). A group
   appointment should be scheduled per self-referral of the patient, the clinic's or referring
   provider's policy or designation. (T-3)
       14.5.5.1. Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM). GRP
       appointment slots can also be used for ANAM assessments for 1 to 50 personnel being
       scheduled during the same time slot. To clarify the care being provided in this group
       appointment, it is recommended that two additional detail codes be used in combination
       with the GRP standard appointment type. This will alert appointing agents to book the
       proper individuals into these slots. This coding will also provide a mechanism to monitor
       the number of ANAM assessments being performed. They are: (T-3)
          14.5.5.1.1. For Pre-deployment Assessments: Use MH detail code (for Mental
          Health) combined with the RPRE detail code (for Readiness Pre-Deployment). (T-3)
          14.5.5.1.2. For Post-deployment Assessments: Use the MH detail combined with
          the RPD (Readiness Post-deployment) detail code. (T-3)
14.6. Behavioral Health Optimization Program (BHOP) Appointing.
   14.6.1. Appointment types for BHOP: Family Health Clinic embedded service BHOP
   clinics are permitted to use four standard appointment types with or without $ suffixes as per
   the following: (T-3)
       14.6.1.1. ACUT/ACUT$ slots will be used to book urgent behavioral health care
       requests within 24 hours. (T-3)
       14.6.1.2. ROUT/ROUT$ slots will be used for self-referrals to book initial requests for a
       new behavioral health condition or exacerbation of a previously diagnosed condition for
       which intervention is required but is not urgent within 7 days. (T-3)
       14.6.1.3. SPEC/SPEC$ slots will be used to book any Routine priority referral/consult
       requests for initial mental health care evaluations within the time frame requested by the
       referring provider or not to exceed 28 days. SPEC will not be used when a patient self-
       refers. (T-3)
       14.6.1.4. EST/EST$ slots will be used to book appointments when providers direct the
       patient to come back (follow-up) for additional behavioral health care. These
       appointments will be booked within the time frame requested by the BHOP provider. (T-
       3)
       14.6.1.5. GRP/GRP$ (Group) appointment type will be used for patients who require
       therapy, counseling, or teaching sessions where a provider performs the service in a
       group setting. (T-3)
14.7. Unscheduled Visit Function of CHCS. WALK-IN visits are also allowed and will be
used when a patient urgently needs to be seen and there is no appointment available, but the
patient does not require care in the Mental Health Clinic. (T-3)

  MANAGEMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC AND ANCILLARY CARE ACCESS TO CARE

15.1. ATC Standards and Referral/Consult Priorities. AFMS Radiology, Laboratory and
Pharmacy (Ancillary) departments/services will provide diagnostic services, procedures, or tests
per the ATC time standard assigned if the test or service is requested by the provider’s referral/
consult priority or using the specific timeframe requested by the provider. (T-3)
15.2. Guidance if Referral Not Entered. If a consult/referral is not requested by the provider
for radiology, laboratory care, (input through order entry in CHCS/AHLTA) then no specific
ATC time standard is identified thus no time standard can be applied to when a test or service
needs to be performed. Additionally, there are no ATC standards applied in the Radiology,
Laboratory or Pharmacy scheduling functions of CHCS, therefore there are no ATC standards
that can be tracked. In the absence of a provider’s medical guidance, lab tests will be completed
IAW the College of American Pathology standards and radiology tests IAW the American
College of Radiology practice guidance. (T-0)

           MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) CARE ACCESS

16.1. Management of PT Care and Referrals. Specialty care PT referrals will be managed
IAW current AFMS referral management policies and guidance. (T-3)
16.2. Appointment Types Used in PT Templates and Schedules. Appointment types will be
used IAW chapter 3 of this AFI. (T-3)
   16.2.1. PT clinics are permitted to use five standard appointment types with or without $
   suffixes per this AFI when setting up their templates and schedules. They are:
       16.2.1.1. ACUT and ACUT$ slots will only be used to schedule direct access (i.e., no
       referral needed) neuromusculoskeletal evaluations and for acute musculoskeletal and
       neuromuscular conditions that should be seen within 24 hours. (T-3)
       16.2.1.2. SPEC and SPEC$ slots will be used to schedule/book any Routine priority
       referral/consult requests for initial physical therapy care evaluations by a physical
       therapist, (officer or civilian/contract equivalent) within the time frame requested by the
       referring provider or not to exceed 28 days. (T-3)
       16.2.1.3. EST and EST$ slots will be used to schedule/book appointments to the physical
       therapist for the purpose of reevaluation or treatment. These appointments will be booked
       within the time frame requested by the physical therapist. (T-3)
       16.2.1.4. PROC and PROC$ slots will be used to schedule PT care appointments to
       enlisted, civilian, or contract PT technicians or equivalent providers as approved/directed
       by the physical therapist. The majority of appointments scheduled for PT technicians will
       use the PROC/PROC$ appointment type. If multiple patients are to be seen at the same
       time by the PT Technician in a group setting for PT care/courses of therapy to be
       provided, the PROC/PROC$ appointment type with multiple appointment slots during
       the same time will be used. All PROC/PROC$ appointments will be booked within 28
       days to meet the Specialty Care ATC standard. (T-3)
       16.2.1.5. GRP and GRP$ slots will be used for patients who require group
       teaching/education classes/sessions by any physical therapist or PT technician. (T-3)
16.3. Guidance if Physical Therapist and PT Technician Treat Patient During Same
Visit. If both the physical therapist and the PT technician see a patient during a visit, the
appointment type used will default to the one that was originally chosen when booking the
appointment. For example, if a PROC appointment is booked for the PT tech, but during the
visit the physical therapist sees the patient, then the appointment type for the visit remains
PROC($).

           AFMS REFERRAL MANAGEMENT BUSINESS RULES (T-2)

                      Referral Management Center (RMC) Business Rules (BRs). The
     Step/            terms referrals and consults are used interchangeably in document.
No   Decision Point   Green Bold identifies an Efficiency Opportunity or Best Practice.
                      At minimum, the RMC staff will:
                           Read the AFMS RMC guidance AFI 44-176, and the Composite
                              Health Care System (CHCS) Referral Management and
                              Appointing System Instruction Manuals
                           Complete CarePoint Referral Management Suite (RMS) and
                              AHLTA training.
                      Other job aids: Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC) website/tools
                      training; TRICARE Operations Manual (TOM) chapters related to
     RMC Staff        referrals; TRICARE Policy Manual (TPM) on the TRICARE benefit;
1.   Training         other MTF training.
                      The RMC should be located within the MTF (exception: Multi-Service
                      Markets (MSM)) and in close proximity to the primary care clinics to
                      promote patient convenience and staff communication. The RMC
                      location will be configured to accommodate queues and patient privacy.
                      At a minimum, RMC equipment should include telephones, voice mail
                      capability, dual monitor computers with internet, high speed scanners, fax
                      machines with fax forward capability, and phone headsets. The RMC
     Locate RMC       staff will have access to CHCS, AHLTA, RMS, Healthcare Artifact and
     w/Patient In     Image Management Solution (HAIMS) and Secure Messaging (SM). The
2.   Mind             use of RMS is mandatory.
                      The MTF will train providers/clinical staff during orientation/in-
                      processing and on a recurring basis as needed on the following: roles and
                      responsibilities for ordering referrals/consults, correct order entry via
                      CHCS/AHLTA, specialty capability within the MTF/multi-service market
                      (MSM), non-covered benefits to avoid writing referrals that will be
                      denied, use of network specialists, and avoidance of directed referrals and
                      use of non-network specialists unless clinically justified. Per the
                      TRICARE Third Generation (T3) Contracts, “The contractor shall
                      provide customer service support equal to 40 person-hours per month
                      to be used at the discretion of and for the purpose specified by the
                      MTF Commander.” Therefore, MTFs can request from the MCSC
                      to train MTF providers on non-covered benefits, use of network and
                      non-network providers, and appropriate use of directed referrals.
                      Best Practice (Travis AFB): An RMC staff member regularly attends
                      clinic huddles, clinic staff meetings, medical management meetings, and
                      ProStaff in case providers and clinical staff have referral questions as well
     Educate MTF      as briefs them on referral processes, issues, and trends as needed. UM
     Providers &      should also train providers on medical necessity, providing copies of
3.   Clinical Staff   Milliman Care Guidelines (MCG) requirements as needed.

No    Decision Point   Green Bold identifies an Efficiency Opportunity or Best Practice.
                       Definition of a consult: a request for an opinion on the best course of
                       treatment for a patient; the referring provider continues care for patient
                       based on the advice of the consulted provider. Definition of a referral:
                       a request to evaluate and treat and assume care for the patient for the
      Consult and      condition. The terms referrals and consults are used interchangeably in
      Referral         this document. Referrals generated for tracking purposes (labs, radiology,
      Definitions      disease management, HEDIS, ancillary orders, etc.) do not meet the
      and Priority     definition of a specialty care referral/consult and will not be processed or
4.    Types            tracked by the RMC.
                       The DoD access to care (ATC) standard for routine referrals is 28 days
      Routine          from date the referral was written. See BR 11, “Appoint Referral to MTF
4.1   Referrals        Specialty Clinic”, for waiving ATC standards.
                       For referrals with a priority other than “Routine,” the provider/clinical
                       team will contact the specialist directly and arrange an appointment. The
      Emergent and     RMC/MCSC can assist the PCM/team with locating a network provider.
      Urgent           The accepting provider’s name, appointment date, phone number (if
4.2   Referrals        available) and location/facility will be annotated within the referral.
                       The MTF will manage and track consults for urgent primary care. Per the
                       TOM, Chapter 8, Section 5, the patient is required to contact the MTF
                       during duty hours and his/her PCM after duty hours prior to seeking
                       urgent primary care in the purchased care. Urgent primary care consults
                       requested during or after duty hours will be entered into CHCS/AHLTA
                       NLT the next duty day. With documented training and written
                       algorithms, other staff members (e.g., appointing agents, etc.) may enter
                       consults for urgent primary care into CHCS. The consult must be signed
                       by a credentialed provider. The RMC will transmit the consult to the
      Urgent Primary   MCSC and obtain the urgent primary care consult results. Best Practice:
4.3   Care Referrals   Travis AFB Fast Track Urgent Primary Care Referrals
                       Credentialed providers will order consults in CHCS/AHLTA before the
                       end of the patient encounter so the patient can go to the RMC for
                       guidance/counseling. At a minimum, providers should include on the
                       referral: a provisional diagnosis; reason for referral to include treatments
      Request          attempted and outcome(s); care or service requested; and whether the
      Referral/        specialist is to evaluate or evaluate and treat the patient. The RMC staff
5.    Consult          will not enter new or renewal referrals/consults.
                       All specialty care referrals will be routed through CHCS/AHLTA to the
                       RMC or MSM RMC for administrative review, appointing to the MTF,
                       and processing. Specialty care clinics that perform their own reviews will
                       be approved by the Executive Staff or designee in writing. MTF specialty
      Route            clinics exempted by the Executive Staff will be responsible for referral
      Referrals to     review, booking, and tracking of those referrals. See Kx for instructions

                        purchased care.
                        The MTF’s CHCS ancillary procedures will have the name of the

                        Referring provider/team should instruct patients with referrals to go to the
                        RMC prior to leaving the MTF. (Exception: MSM RMCs located at a
                        distance from the referring MTF). Patients who are unable to go to the
                        RMC should be given an RMC brochure by the provider/clinic staff
                        which explains the RM process, contact information of MCSC for
                        authorization questions, and RMC’s contact information for questions.
                        The RMC can save providers/clinical staff 5-10 minutes per patient
                        by educating and answering patient questions on the referral process.
                        Best Practice (Tinker): Providers/clinical staff use verbiage such as “stop
      Send Patients     by the RMC to activate your referral.” RMC brochures are available in all
7.    to the RMC        examination rooms and clinic areas.
                        RMC staff will confirm patient’s TRICARE eligibility and contact
                        information (ensure preferred phone number is entered in the CHCS
                        “home phone number” field); appoint the patient’s MTF specialty
                        appointment prior to leaving the MTF or explain how they will be notified
                        of their appointment and explain the purchased care referral process.
                        Refer the patient to the MCSC or Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance
                        Coordinator for TRICARE health plan coverage information as needed.
                        Best Practice: Encourage all patients to utilize SM for referral questions
                        and provide the RMC their purchased care referral results or appointment
8.    Assist Patients   information. SM minimizes phone tag with patients.
                        All specialty care referrals (except self-referrals and “referrals” for
                        administrative tracking) will be initially reviewed and booked (MTF
                        specialty clinics only) by the RMC staff based on the specialty care
                        clinics’ appointing guidelines. RMC staff should consult with MTF’s
                        subspecialty clinics or send the referral to the specialist for review as
                        needed. The review process ends when the referral is dispositioned with
                        an Appoint to MTF or Defer to Network status. Each referral reviewer
      Perform           (e.g., RMC, specialty clinic, SGH, UM nurse, MSM RMC, etc.) will have
      Referral          one business day from the date the referral was received to make a
9.    Review            determination on the referral to prevent delays in care.
                        The RMC will review referrals for administrative completeness to
                        minimize delays in referral processing and appointing. All RMC staff are
                        expected to be able to perform CHCS referral reviews and RMS
      Mandatory         processing/tracking. The RMC may complete missing information or
      Referral          over-ride incorrect fields if permitted; otherwise, the RMC will return the
9.1   Information       referral to the originating provider for completion. The MTF should

                     ensure that all referrals include sufficient clinical, administrative
                     information to allow the consulted provider to appropriately evaluate the
                     patient and contact the referring provider/MTF as needed. Referring
                     providers should have approved and standardized references (for example,
                     MCG, MCSC medical necessity guidelines, mental health, ASAM for
                     chemical dependency, etc.) to assist them in writing complete referral
                     requests which will mitigate rejection by the MCSC or specialty clinic for
                     “more information needed” reasons. Best Practice: The RMC and MM
                     staffs provide referring providers written examples/specific information
                     from approved references on what information would make the referral
                     complete. This can be done via AHLTA Tasking, email, or paper routing.
                     Patient requests for a referral or referral renewals will be directed to the
                     PCM/team. The RMC will not enter requests for referrals or referral
                     renewals (excludes ROFRs). For requests by network specialists for
                     additional visits, per TOM Chapter 8, Section 5, 6.1.7,”For services
       Requests for  beyond the initial authorization, the MCSC shall use its best practices in
       Referrals or  determining the extent of additional service to authorize. The MCSC
       Referral      shall not request a referral from the MTF…” This applies for non-ADSM
10.    Renewals      patients. ADSM patients require MTF approval/referral renewal.
                     The initial MTF specialty appointment will be booked in CHCS using the
                     Appointment Order Processing (AOP) function in order to link the
                     appointment with the referral and ensure correct tracking through
                     CHCS/RMS. The initial specialty appointment will be booked IAW DoD
                     ATC standards. If the MTF cannot meet the ATC standard, the
                     appointing staff should ask patients if they would waive their ATC
                     standard and opt for a later appointment. MTFs cannot mandate patients
                     to waive their ATC standard. If the patient does not waive their ATC
       Appoint       standard, then the patient will be deferred to the purchased care. Best
       Referral to   Practice: patient leaves the MTF with initial appointment with the MTF
       MTF Specialty specialty clinic (patient-focused service and prevents rework of phone-tag
11.    Clinic        with the patient by RMC/clinic staff).
       MTF Specialty Specialty clinics will provide the RMC and MSM RMC with current
       Clinic        appointing guidelines. The appointing guidelines should be as
       Appointing    unrestrictive as possible to retain/recapture the maximum number of
11.1   Guidelines    specialty care referrals within the MTF.

                     If the referring MTF (e.g., Bolling AFB) is on the same CHCS host as the
                     consulting MTF (e.g., Andrews AFB), the referring MTF (Bolling) will
                     select the consulting clinic (e.g., Andrews RMC) and enter a review status
                     of “Refer to Subspecialty” (code 14).
                     If the referring MTF (e.g., Laughlin AFB) is not on the same CHCS host
                     as the consulting MTF (e.g., SAMMC Consult & Appointing Office
                     (CAMO)), the referring MTF (Laughlin) will enter a review status of
                     “Defer to Network” (code #10) and in the first line of the “Review
                     Comment” field will type “To MTF/” plus the DMIS of the consulting
                     MTF, e.g. TO MTF/0066. Complete the Clinic specialty field, indicating
                     the specialty requested. Transmit the referral to the consulting MTF.
       Appoint or    The consulting MTF’s RMC (e.g., CAMO) will enter the referral in
       Forward       CHCS/AHLTA as a consult and in the first line of the Review Comment

                     A ROFR is a referral from a beneficiary enrolled to a network civilian
                     PCM sent to the MTF by the MCSC for appointing consideration.
                     Beneficiaries enrolled to a civilian PCM have the following CHCS DMIS
                     locations and numbers: USAFE (6913), PACAF (6914), Latin America
                     (6915), (No location assigned to 6916), North (6917), South (6918), and
       Perform Right West (6919). RMS recognizes a ROFR entered into CHCS if the clinic
       of First      from which you are entering the referral displays in its CHCS clinic
       Refusal       profile as “Hospital Location: Non-MTF”. MTFs should ensure the
12.    (ROFR)        fullest extent of ROFR acceptance to sustain clinical currency.
                     The MTF will accept/decline urgent priority ROFRs received within 30
                     minutes of receipt or as updated in TOM 8.5. The MTF will
                     accept/decline routine priority ROFRs received within one business day
                     of receipt or as updated in TOM 8.5. Failure to respond to ROFR requests
                     within the prescribed times is an implied MTF declination and the MCSC
                     will send the patient to the network.
                     If the ROFR is accepted, the RMC will enter the ROFR into
                     CHCS/AHLTA as a consult. If the ROFR is entered in Referral Booking,
                     convert the referral to a consult in CHCS in order to track results. In both
                     cases, use the CHCS downtown provider or generic downtown provider
                     as the referring provider. Include ROFR or Right of First Refusal on the
                     first line of the Reason for Referral or Review Comment fields. The
                     RMC or specialty clinic will notify the patient of their ROFR
       Timelines to  appointment. The RMC will forward the specialty care report via a
       Accept or     HIPAA/Privacy Act compliant method to the referring civilian PCM

                     Definition of recaptured referral: When a MTF enrolled patient receives a

                        referral becomes a recaptured referral. Documenting recaptured referrals
                        shows the value of the RMC and the purchased care cost avoidance
                        (savings) accomplished by the MTF. Examples: The purchased care
                        orthopedic specialist refers the patient to radiology to get an MRI and to
                        physical therapy. The MTF has a MRI and PT. The MCSC sends the
                        referrals to the MTF which accepts them. The MTF has recaptured two
                        referrals. Another example is when the RM staff redirects a referral for
                        the purchased care back into the MTF. This occurs when the referring
                        provider does not know that the specialty care requested is available
                        within the MTF. The difference between a ROFR and Recapture referral
                        is the patient’s place of enrollment (civilian vs. MTF PCM).
                        Measuring the number of referrals that the RMC/MTF recaptured or
       Measuring        redirected back to the MTF provides data on the MTFs efforts to
       Recaptured and   maximize MTF capabilities and decrease purchased care costs. Enter the

       [REDIRECT]       RMC
                        Although the Services define ROFRs and recapture as above, the MCSC
                        does not differentiate between the two. The MCSC sends recapture
                        opportunities as ROFRs. Therefore, the MCSC ROFR metrics will
       ROFR vs.         include recapture opportunities. Use of RMS deferred reason codes assist
13.2   Recapture        MTFs with identifying ROFR versus recapture referrals.
                        When there is no specialty care available in the MTF, the RMC or MSM
                        Referral Center will defer the referral to the network and transmit the
                        referral to the MCSC. The RMC will assist patients with specialty care
                        referrals not requiring MCSC authorization and advise them of their
                        options based on their TRICARE health plan and eligibility (e.g., give
                        provider options, book appointment). Best Practice: Book the
       Defer Referral   appointment for the Non-Prime patient (e.g., TFL, Medicare, T-Plus) with
       to Network       the specialist of their choice while at the RMC. Service is patient-focused
14.    Provider         and helps the RMC when chasing results.
                        The referring provider will provide the clinical justification for sending a
                        patient to a non-network provider in the referral. The RMC should
                        educate MTF providers to allow the MCSC to determine where to send
                        the patient versus requesting by-name non-network providers. Non-
                        network providers may not be TRICARE certified providers. Best
       Defer Referral   Practice: non-network and out of area specialty care referrals require
       to Non-          second level review/approval from the SGH to ensure all direct care and
       Network          local specialty care options have been exhausted. Patient requests for

                       therefore, the RMC will not process, manage, or track PCM
       Disease         orders/referrals for screening exams. The RMC will not enter cancer
       Management,     screenings (breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screenings), HgbA1c

                       The referring provider/team will obtain additional medical information
                       (e.g. lab reports, x-rays, previous encounter notes, etc.) to provide to the
                       purchased care specialist as requested/clinically required. The RMC can
                       assist the PCM/team by faxing the documents to the specialist’s office.
                       For STAT/ASAP referrals, the ordering provider/team is responsible for
                       obtaining and sending the requested information to the specialist. Best
                       Practice: Determine if purchased care providers are using the same SM
       Send Clinical   vendor as the AFMS and transmit information via colleague to colleague
       Information to communication. RMC brochures/education materials should specify how
       Purchased       patients can obtain clinical records for the specialist. The MTF’s Release

                        separation or retirement.
                        The requesting provider and the MTF SGH will initiate the waiver

                        Health Affairs policy requires MTFs to ensure specialty care services are
                        available for ADSMs on “medical hold” within two weeks of identifying
                        the need for an appointment. MTFs should collaborate with their MCSCs
                        to ensure that ADSMs receive their referral authorizations and
                        appointments expeditiously. Referring MTF providers will specify in the
                        body of the referral when the ADSM should be seen (e.g., 72 hours, 7
       ADSM on          days, 14 days, etc.) rather than using the default 28-day ATC standard for
21.    Medical Hold     “Routine” priority referrals.
                        The MTF should assist RegAF personnel on terminal leave to obtain a

                        of Veterans Affairs (DVA). If the RegAF member intends to reside
                        outside of the Prime Service Area (PSA) of the CONUS MTF while on
                        terminal leave, the RegAF member must coordinate with their
       ADSMs on         PCM/clinical team for the pre-authorization referral. This does not apply
       Terminal         to the OCONUS RegAF members on terminal leave that will take their
       Leave: Pre-      terminal leave in CONUS. (Note: There is no requirement for the MTF
       Authorization    to determine if the RegAF member on terminal leave is going to leave the
       of Care at       area. There is no requirement for the MTF to determine if a DVA

      OCONUS Pay eligible to be seen within the MTF for primary and specialty care if
24.   Patients       capacity exists.
                     If MTFs have specialty capability and capacity, MTFs are highly
                     encouraged to accept self-referral specialty care requests from
                     TFL/Medicare beneficiaries with or without a referral/request from their
                     civilian PCMs. Often these requests are written on a provider’s
                     prescription form, requesting specialty care for the patient. These
                     beneficiaries should be afforded the opportunity to be seen in the MTF
                     based on the MTF’s capability and capacity and currency case needs.
                     Depending on where the patient presents, the specialty clinic or the RMC
                     will enter a consult in CHCS. Be sure to obtain physician information
                     from patient and notate on the referral so MTF results can be sent to the
                     patient’s PCM/referring provider. The RMC will provide the referring
                     provider/PCM the results, and track the referral. Note: specialty access

                        urgent primary care results, and laboratory results and radiology reports
                        that require an authorization into HAIMs within three working days
                        from receipt of results. The RMC will notify the referring provider/PCM
                        of the results via T-Con. Note: Use of HAIMs for CLRs is mandatory
                        per DoDI. If the MTF does not have HAIMs, follow AHLTA Scanning
                        policy. If HAIMs is down, revert to AHLTA Scanning policy (see BR
                        40). Best Practice: SGH defines the priority of scanning results by
                        general category. All referrals will be entered into the EHR, but it would
                        help the RMC prioritize workload. The RMC contract staff will not
                        import results for hospital discharge summaries, emergency room visits,
       Import CLRs      labs/rads/exams for preventative health/HEDIS measures, and all loose
33.    into HAIMs       documents not directly related to a referral.
                        1. A T-Con and HAIMs entry will be created for each CLR/result.
                                    a. The T-Con will be associated with the HAIMs entry so that
                                        the reviewing provider clearly understands which T-Con is
                                        for which HAIMs entry.
                                    b. For both parts, the following mandatory standard naming
                                        convention will be used: Network Results – Specialty
                                        MM/DD/YY where the MM/DD/YY is the date the patient
                                        was seen. For example, Network Results – Cardiology
                                        2/10/14.
                        2. Any existing shared folders used for the purpose of storing temporary
                            results or other Protected Health Information may be maintained for
                            30 calendar days following the date of the original image upload.
                            Thereafter, the electronic folder and documents must be deleted.
                        3. Both the original foreign language and the English translated
                            result/report will be uploaded into HAIMs. The untranslated
                            result/report does not have to be signed by the referring provider if the
                            translated result/report was already signed.
                        4. Once loaded into HAIMs, the reviewing provider is not required to
                            handwrite or “wet” sign the hard copy result/report. The paper copy
       General              of the result/report is not required to be filed into the paper outpatient

                           be required for special programs (e.g. PRP) or payment issues. Before
                           destroying the original hard copy or electronic result/report, ensure
                           that the scanned document is legible by the provider. Ensure you have
                           a quality check process in place to ensure right patient, right CLR and
                           right record.
                        5. Correcting errors: The MTF will have a quality check process to
                           minimize PHI/PII errors.
                        6. Contingency plan: When HAIMs is down for several hours, results
                           may be entered into AHLTA Clinical Notes per the instructions in BR
                           40. If both AHLTA and HAIMs are down indefinitely, paper copy
                           result/reports may be reviewed and signed by the provider. The
                           signed reports will be sent back to the department scanning the
                           reports/results to enter into HAIMs per the above instructions. A T-
                           Con for the provider’s notification and review is not needed since
                           there is a wet signature on the result/report.

                                       HAIMs entry
                                   c. Click “OK” when done. Your T-Con will automatically
                                       display.
                                   d. If sending a courtesy copy notification of a result/report,
                                       use the following naming convention: “Network Results -
                                       Specialty MM/DD/YY—CC” (CC=courtesy copy).

33.4   T-CON              CLR.
                       The RMC will fill out the below mandatory HAIMs metadata fields:
                       1. Author Name: The author name is the purchased care provider or
                          group that provided the CLR.
                       2. Date Document Created: The date that the patient visit occurred or
                          the date of the CLR.
                       3. Document Type: Use the dropdown menu: for CLRs, select:

                    5. At a minimum, providers shall document their review of the HAIMs
                        CLR in the corresponding T-Con. Ensure T-Con is non-count
                        workload. Change T-Con medical coding as appropriate. Sign and
                        close.
                    6. Providers will review T-Cons notifying them of scanned
                        results/reports within three business days from the receipt of the T-
                        Con. Providers will have current surrogates in CHCS/AHLTA to
                        review T-Cons in their absence.
                    7. Completed T-Cons are assumed to mean that the provider has
                        reviewed the result/report in HAIMs/AHLTA.
                    Best practice: Quality Assurance/Data Quality Office monitors open
       Provider     provider encounters and/or pulls the ad hoc in BR 35 and provides to
34.    Review       MTF leadership/providers.
                    When the T-Con naming convention is used per policy instructions, MTFs
                    may use the CHCS Provider Review Ad Hoc that displays by provider by
                    patient which CLRs scanned into HAIMs have been reviewed or not
       CHCS Ad Hoc reviewed by noting if the T-Con associated with the scanned CLR has or
       to Monitor   has not been completed in AHLTA. On the printed ad hoc report, if the
       Provider     T-Con has been reviewed, a status of “Tel-Con status” will show next to
       Review of    the T-Con. If the T-Con has NOT been reviewed, a status of “Occ-Svc
35.    Scanned CLRs status” will show next to the T-Con.
                    The MTF will have processes in place to assist with Medical In- and Out-
                    processing:
                    1. The losing MTF will provide pending/incomplete/un-resulted referrals
                        to the patient.
       Patient      2. The gaining MTF will follow-up on pending/incomplete/un-resulted
36.    Hand-Off         referrals.
                    The MTF will report the below measures to MTF Executive leadership at
37.    Measures     least quarterly.
                    Items 1-5 can be obtained from RMPMT.
                    1. Number of specialty care referrals/consults
                    2. Number of urgent primary care referrals
                    3. Number of referrals seen in the MTF
                    4. Number of referrals deferred to other MTFs
                    5. Number of referrals deferred to the purchased care
                    6. Number and percentage of ROFRs accepted from the MCSC (Note: if
                        the MTF has no ROFR capability, then items 6 and 7 are N/A)
                    7. Percent ROFR referral results sent to requesting civilian PCM within
                        10 days of the kept appointment
                    8. Reasons why urgent primary and specialty care referrals were deferred
                        to network: Primary responsibility for this measure is with the GPM
       Mandatory        or UM nurse. Trends should be used to analyze access and recapture

                        1. Provider referral patterns (POC: UM): display by referring provider
                            the total number of specialty care referrals written; further display the
                            total number of specialty referrals by product line (aka clinic
                            specialty). Rationale: identifies outliers against peers.
                        2. Display by PCM the percentage of total PCM appointments to total
                            referrals written (POC: UM). For example, if the PCM had 100 kept
                            appointments in a month and wrote 80 referrals from those 100
                            appointments, the percentage would be 80 divided by 100. Rationale:
                            identifies outliers against peers who may need mentoring by the SGH.
                        3. Number of initial specialty care referrals reviewed by the MCSC that
                            were denied/declined for lack of clinical information, lack of
                            administrative information, not a covered benefit, or inappropriate
                            referral. Rationale: returned referrals result in REWORK.
                        4. Number of initial specialty care referrals deferred to network and non-
                            network for Prime dependents and non-Prime patients with OHI.
                        5. Number of specialty care referrals redirected or recaptured back into
                            the MTF. Further breakdown total by product line. Rationale: cost
                            avoidance efforts by the MTF; demonstrates value of RMC/UM
                            processes.
                        6. Number of patients served by the RMC and customer satisfaction with
                            service (survey). Rationale: provides RMC workload data and
                            customer value.
