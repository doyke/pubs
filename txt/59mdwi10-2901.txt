     control systems to ensure members meet all requirements before flight. The CCATT will
     receive a mission trip kit containing relevant AFIs, forms, and reference material from the
     CCATT Program Coordinator after being assigned a mission. The kit will also contain a
     binder with policy letters (local and AMC/SG), FCIF Part Bs and relevant SG NOTAMS.
     CCATT personnel will sign the front cover sheet inside the binder signifying that they have
     read all current information and materials.
