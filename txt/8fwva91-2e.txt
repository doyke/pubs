Mishaps may occur at any time. Usually a mishap will result in personnel injury or damage to
equipment/property or both. After a mishap, a thorough investigation is conducted to prevent similar
mishaps from recurring. Your responsibility is to help administer this program covered under AFI 91-204.

In the event of an accident or injury, seek medical attention immediately and/or notify your immediate
supervisor, or commander in absence of supervisor. The supervisor or commander then notifies the
Command Post/Maintenance Operations Center and the USR. Command post will then run applicable
notification checklist, which will in turn notify the applicable commanders and wing safety. Supervisor
generates PACAF Form 161 within 72 hrs, forwards to USR, and the USR will route the PACAF Form
161 through the unit commander and subsequently to wing safety.
