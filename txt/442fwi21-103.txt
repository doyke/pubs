Command Supplement, Aircraft Equipment Maintenance Management. This instruction applies
to all 442d Maintenance Personnel. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance with
this instruction. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-123 (will convert
to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision changes
series, number, title and updates language, format directives and establishes a Dropped Object
Prevention Program (DOP).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change modifies the procedures for the FOD/DOP program. A margin bar indicates
newly revised material.
 2                                                         442FWI21-103 14 NOVEMBER 2007


1. Responsibilities: 442d Fighter Wing (FW) Vice Commander is the overall Foreign Object
Damage (FOD) and Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Program Manager. 442d Maintenance
Group (MXG) commanders and supervisors will ensure personnel actively participate in the
(FOD/DOP) program and walks.
2. Weekly FOD walks will be performed by all maintenance group personnel.
3. Flight Line Procedures
     3.1. Vehicle tires will be inspected for FOD prior to driving on the flightline at specified
     points. Tires will also be inspected after driving on unpaved roads, before entering the
     flightline or taxiways.
     3.2. The flightline and maintenance hangars are designated as no hat/salute areas; however,
     hats are optional due to climate and safety. Hats will not be worn within 25 feet of an
     operating engine intake (danger area).
     3.3. At least one flightline vehicle will have a magnetic bar installed to help eliminate FOD.
     Magnetic bars require cleaning daily (AFI 21-101, para 14.19.4.). Magnetic bars may be
     removed during inclement weather and reinstalled when weather conditions improve. If a
     sweeper is required, call Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) to dispatch the sweeper to
     the location.
4. Covers (e. g. engine inlet/ exhaust, water intrusion plugs, and ECS cover) will not be
removed more than 4 hours prior to flight and can remain off for the day’s flying period to
include spares. Pitot cover will remain in-place until just prior to pilot show and reinstalled after
engine shut down. Engine compressor inlet covers will be installed for any maintenance
accomplished on the engine forward of the engine compressor inlet, to include bird cage panel
removal/ installation, a Red X symbol will be placed in the AFTO Form 781A for the
compressor inlet cover being installed. All covers will be inspected after any severe weather
condition to ensure serviceability and inventory.
     4.1. Cloth bag(s) with draw strings or suitable container that can be sealed, will be securely
     attached to the removed components. Annotate the cloth bag or container with the
     aircraft/equipment serial number, quantity and nomenclature of contents. The clean-as-you-
     go concept will be adhered to. Hangars and back shops will remain FOD free. Ensure all
     work areas are cleaned upon task completion and at the end of shift.
     4.2. Flight crews will make a final FOD check of the cockpit prior to exiting the aircraft.
     When practical, flight crews personal items should be marked with the individual’s name,
     thus ensuring accountability and expeditious return of equipment.
     4.3. Ensure dumpster lids are kept closed and area kept clean.
     4.4. All engine inlet maintenance, to include inlet/ exhaust inspections prior to/ after each
     engine operation and blade blending, will be annotated on a Red X symbol in the AFTO
     Form 781A. Fan Blade damage blendable or not will be reported in accordance with AFI 21-
     101. Inlet/ exhaust inspections before and after operation or maintenance will be conducted
     by a qualified 7-level or a Red X qualified 5-level as identified on the unit’s Special
     Certification Roster (SCR) for the task.
442FWI21-103 14 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                 3


   4.5. All personnel that are in the vicinity (if in doubt, stow it) of aircraft with running
   engines will stow their line badges. Do not hang pens, pencils, rings or other items from the
   line badge lanyard at any time.
5. FOD/DOP T raining
   5.1. All maintenance personnel will receive FOD & DOP training annually. This training
   will be tracked in Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS).
   5.2. Random spot checks for FOD of selected areas will be documented and routed using the
   Quality Assurance Tracking and Trending System (QANTTAS). All FOD containers are
   required to be stenciled with the word “FOD” in contrasting letters no smaller than two
   inches.
6. FOD Investigation and Reporting
   6.1. When FOD/Bird strike damage occurs, MOC will run Emergency Action Check sheet
   for FOD or Emergency Action Check sheet for bird strikes. The Unit FOD monitor will
   complete and forward the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Form 42, Foreign Object
   Damage (FOD) Mishap Investigation Check sheet, to 10th Air Force (10 AF), Maintenance
   (A4MZ), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Maintenance (A4MZ), and the base
   FOD/bird aircraft strike hazard (BASH) monitor.
   6.2. When FOD/lost item in the cockpit occurs, every effort to locate the FOD/lost item will
   be made and follow the established procedures in AFI 21-101.
   6.3. The unit FOD/DOP monitor or representative will attend the quarterly FOD meeting
   with the host base FOD Prevention Committee.
7. DOP Investigation and Reporting
   7.1. When a Dropped Object incident occurs, MOC will run Emergency Action Check sheet
   #3 for aircraft dropped object. Aircrew or maintenance personnel discovering a dropped
   object will make the appropriate entries on the next open block of the Air Force Technical
   Order (AFTO) IMT 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document in accordance
   with (IAW) Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
   Documentation, Policy and Procedures. Aircrews will debrief the loss to maintenance
   immediately after landing.
   7.2. The unit Dropped Object Monitor will report all initial dropped objects by telephone or
   email within 24 hours, and complete the worksheet attachment #2, then forward the
   completed form within three working days to AFRC/A4MZ and 10 AF/A4MZ, IAW AFI 21-
   101, unless the dropped object is reportable IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
   Reports.
   7.3. If material failure or design deficiency is the cause of a dropped object, a deficiency
   report will be submitted with information copies sent to AFRC/A4MZ and 10 AF/A4MZ.
   Dropped objects resulting from maintenance malpractice shall be referred to the appropriate
   squadron commander and the MXG commander.
   7.4. Dropped Object Prevention Inspection is performed during End of Runway (EOR)
   inspection IAW T.O. 1A-10A/C-6WC-6, End of Runway Inspection Work Cards, cards 1-
   003 thru 1-006

     7.5. Analysis and Quality Assurance (QA) will analyze dropped object incidents for unit
     trends and ensure corrective actions are valid and completed.
