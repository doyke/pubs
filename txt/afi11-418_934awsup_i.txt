1. General.
The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations Group Commander (OG/
CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e., Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup)
and Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The chain of supervision begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF,
down to the individual squadron supervisors. Specific duties and responsibilities of each are defined later
in this instruction. Paragraph 3. specifies the requirements for each position.
NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” (aircrew) is used in accordance with (IAW) the
definition specified in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2 MDS Volume 1. Aircrews are
also considered “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated
“experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS, are selected by the Squadron CC and
approved by the OG/CC. Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit
squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.

2. Operations Supervision Functions:
    2.1. Supervisor of Flying. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct represen-
    tative of the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight operations. Deci-
    sion authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.

NOTES:
     1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/RC-26 operations/
        special operations/deployed U-2 Ops.
       2. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
       3. DELETED.
    2.2. Operations Supervisor. The squadron Ops Sup must be filled by the squadron operations officer,
    assistant operations officer, flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified by the squadron
    commander and approved by the OG/CC.
    ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup and
    will determine the appropriate personnel to fill the Ops Sup position.
       2.2.1. Squadron commanders can always fill the Ops Sup position, if available.
       2.2.2. During local flying operations, an Ops Sup will always be immediately available to the
       OG/CC, the SOF, command and control (C2) personnel or other supporting agencies to respond to
       any current operations issues requiring time-sensitive answers, decisions and actions.
       2.2.3. For Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) tasked missions, AFRC units require an Ops Sup
       for home station departure and arrival.
    2.3. Stand-by Duty Officer (SDO). The SDO is an experienced squadron member, designated by the
    squadron operations officer, who has the authority to make operations-related decisions and recom-
    mendations. The SDO is necessary when the squadron has on-going off-station operations. These
    operations include sorties that do not otherwise qualify as deployed sorties. When on duty, the SDO
    will be available to the OG/CC, the SOF, C2 personnel and other supporting agencies to respond to
    squadron operations issues. For operations where the SOF is not qualified to provide technical assis-
AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007                                                                      5


   tance to the type of aircraft airborne and an Ops Sup is not readily available, the SDO will assist the
   SOF as required.

3. Supervision of Flying Operations. All levels of flight operations may not require each supervisory
position to be manned. With the exception of scramble (Active Duty), some type of squadron-level super-
visor is always required (Ops Sup/SDO), but other factors enter into the decision if the group-level SOF
position should be manned. Table 1. outlines the minimum supervision requirements.

NOTES:
1. Duty Location as directed by paragraph 18.1.2.2.1. (Added)
2. For deployed operations, the detachment commander (DETCO) will coordinate with host base OG
   for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the host base SOF and or SOF pro-
   gram.
3. Extended operations out of local area require the SOF to be at the duty location until 30 minutes
   after departure and 30 minutes prior to arrival.
4. As directed by OG/CC

    3.1. Types of Operations. Classifying types and levels of flight activity is the basis for designating
    minimum supervision requirements. The definitions for types of operations that are used in Table 1.
    are:
       3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station (this does
       not include other types of operations defined below).
       3.1.2. Reduced Flying Operations. Operations, scheduled or unscheduled, that occur when major-
       ity of the unit is not flying. Under these conditions, OG/CC may direct that the group-level SOF
       position is not required.
       3.1.3. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at home station.
       3.1.4. Out of Local Area Operations. Missions that take off and land at home base but operate out-
       side the local area for extended periods of time. These missions usually have primary emergency
       landing fields other than home base.
       3.1.5. Deployment/Re-deployment. The departure from home station to another location or return
       to home station from another location.
AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007                                                                         9


       3.1.6. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of a deploy-
       ment, exercise or contingency.
       3.1.7. Cross Country Departures/Returns. Aircraft departing from or returning to home station for
       other than a deployment, exercise or contingency.
       3.1.8. Functional Check Flight. Aircraft launched to ensure it is airworthy and capable of accom-
       plishing its mission.
       3.1.9. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
       3.1.10. TACC Missions. Missions flown with OPCON by the Tanker Airlift Control Center
       (TACC).
   3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1. for each type of operation.
   The OG/CC may impose additional requirements depending on local circumstances.

4. Responsibilities of Supervisors:
NOTE: For the purposes of this instruction, the term “operations group commander” also refers to the
designated representative.
   4.1. OG/CC (ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or AOO) will:
       4.1.1. Be responsible for the implementation, direction and execution of the Operations Supervi-
       sion program.
       4.1.2. Be immediately available to the SOF or Ops Sup for consultation during daily flying oper-
       ations.
       4.1.3. Ensure tenant flying units use host/tenant memorandum of agreement (MOA)/letter of
       agreement (LOA) to avoid duplication of effort, where appropriate.
       4.1.4. Be the final approval authority for unit supplement to this instruction.
   4.2. SOF will:
       4.2.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1. or when directed by the OG/CC.
       4.2.2. Be responsible to the OG/CC for monitoring and supervising all phases of unit flying oper-
       ations and will provide guidance, advice, assistance and recommendations to aircrews, supervi-
       sors, command and control personnel and support agencies regarding the safe and efficient
       conduct of flight operations.
          4.2.2.1. While aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for the safe operation of their
          aircraft, the SOF will ensure that in-flight emergency (IFE) recovery plans and weather related
          mission changes reflect sound airmanship, follow AFI and technical order guidance, and “pass
          the common sense check.”
       4.2.3. Remember that safety is the first priority. If safety is an issue, the SOF has the authority to
       direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC, to correct/prevent unsafe situations. This
       includes the use of any and all resources to include radios, FM nets, telephone hot lines and all
       wing-flying operations on the ground or in the air.
       4.2.4. Prior to the first launch, ensure the airfield status is suitable for safe operations IAW Air
       Force, major command (MAJCOM) and local directives.
10                                                             AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007


        4.2.5. During an emergency or an abnormal situation, provide aircrews with guidance, timely
        advice and assistance to determine a correct course of action to safely recover the aircraft.
        4.2.6. Be in a position to visually monitor the final approach and landing of IFE aircraft. If
        unable, the SOF will direct another highly qualified aircrew member to be in position to monitor
        the landing and provide needed assistance or guidance. (ANG/AFRC: Not required.)
        4.2.7. Closely monitor the status of primary and emergency airfields and inform aircrews of
        changes that may affect flight operations.
        4.2.8. When deteriorating weather conditions affect flying operations, coordinate with wing agen-
        cies and utilize all available resources (i.e., weather, radar, tower personnel, pilot reports, etc.) to
        determine the best course of action for wing aircraft. This course of action could extend to depar-
        tures and recoveries as well as diverts or SOF directed holding. The SOF will determine suitable
        weather alternates, assign them accordingly and monitor them. When necessary to ensure safe
        flight operations, the SOF will coordinate with the air traffic control (ATC) watch supervisor or
        senior controller for runway changes.
        4.2.9. Prepare a daily log tracking major events, with format and content as defined by unit sup-
        plement. The SOF will debrief the OG/CC and the applicable squadron commander of any aircraft
        involved in an unusual situation, IFE, weather divert or other mission change requiring SOF
        action or intervention.
     4.3. Ops Sup will:
        4.3.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1. and be present in the squadron when required in the
        performance of the duties listed below.
        4.3.2. Be immediately available to assist the SOF or aircrew (for units which do not require a
        SOF).
        4.3.3. When the SOF is not qualified in the distressed aircraft or the unit does not require a SOF,
        be the primary source of technical assistance.
        4.3.4. For situations where the SOF and Ops Sup are not qualified to provide technical assistance
        to the type of aircraft airborne, schedule an instructor or experienced crewmember to be immedi-
        ately available for aircraft technical assistance.
        4.3.5. Ensure the SOF is advised of any changes or deviations to the squadron's flying schedule.
        4.3.6. Be responsible for the execution of the daily flying schedule and coordinate any mission
        changes as required. Ensure that the actual mission flown is accurately annotated on the flying
        schedule.
            4.3.6.1. Be assisted by SARM personnel or a duty officer as required.
        4.3.7. Ensure crews are briefed on aircraft and airfield status, aircraft configuration, scheduled
        and available airspace and weather.
        4.3.8. Manage aircraft tail number changes, crew swaps, flight-plan and airspace changes.
        4.3.9. Ensure electronic scheduling and tracking systems are updated to include changes to and
        deviations from the daily flying schedule.
AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007                                                                       11


           4.3.9.1. Prepare, at squadron commander’s discretion, a daily operations log to aid in tracking
           daily operations. For missions where a SOF is not required, this log will be prepared by Ops
           Sup or SDO. Log format and content will be defined by unit supplement.
NOTE: Mission commanders/flight leads are required to coordinate with Operations Supervisor/Top 3
prior to the flight brief when intended sortie type, profile, airspace, and/or aircraft configuration do not
match the approved schedule.
   4.4. SDO will:
       4.4.1. Be on duty when required by Table 1.
       4.4.2. Be available by telephone, pager or radio to respond to any current operational issues
       requiring time-sensitive answers, decisions and actions.
       4.4.3. Ensure the SOF and Ops Sup are advised of any changes or deviations to the squadron's fly-
       ing schedule.

5. Responsibilities of Other Key Unit Personnel:
   5.1. Wing/unit commanders are responsible for an effective Operations Supervision program for all
   assigned and attached units and ensure other group commanders support the OG/CC when and where
   needed in order to execute an effective program.
   5.2. Mission Support group commanders are responsible for the maintenance, upgrade and repair of
   the applicable SOF facilities and equipment.
   5.3. Mission Support group/Logistic Readiness group commanders are responsible for maintenance,
   upgrade and repair of the SOF vehicle.
   5.4. Squadron commanders ensure a SOF/Ops Sup/SDO is on duty when required by Table 1.
   5.5. Command post is responsible for tracking all wing flying activities, both on and off station. It
   functions as the central source for information during an emergency. ANG/AFRC: Single squadron
   units and units with minimal command post full-time manning may establish procedures for unit SOF,
   Ops Sup, and duty desk personnel to track flying activities and be the central source for information
   during an emergency.

6. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
   6.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of the air-
   crew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
       6.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC and the
       emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach (SFA). The SOF
       will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor
       the recovery.
       6.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate agencies and
       key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates, allowing the SOF or Ops Sup to devote full
       attention to the emergency.
       6.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
12                                                          AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007


        6.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common frequency)
        from the Ops Sup/SDO to an IFE aircrew. Only ATC personnel may authorize direct communica-
        tion over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency. However, this does not preclude the SOF
        from using whatever communication necessary, to include GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe
        situation that could immediately jeopardize safe recovery.
        6.1.5. That only the on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate an emergency.
        6.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft com-
        mander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their knowledge of the air-
        craft and the flight and airfield environment.
        6.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
        6.1.8. Directing the Ops Sup or other highly qualified individual to report to the SOF's duty loca-
        tion during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.

7. CONFERENCE HOTEL Aircraft Specific Procedures:
NOTE: DELETED.
     7.1. These procedures make aircraft specialists accessible to the SOF or Ops Sup and aircrew when
     in-flight situations pose systems-related questions that cannot be answered at the local level. See
     Attachment 4 for specific MDS procedures.
     7.2. Table A4.1. shows the different MDSs and the MDS-specific reference paragraphs.

8. SOF/ATC Relationship:
     8.1. The relationship between supervisors and ATC must be based on professionalism, trust and team-
     work. SOFs represent the OG/CC for the conduct of safe flight operations and mission accomplish-
     ment.
     8.2. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of the watch supervisors and
     controllers. Unless safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch supervisor. To pro-
     mote effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based on knowledge of the flying
     schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions, actions that affect ATC concerns or
     desires.
     8.3. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without prior coordina-
     tion with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All radio transmissions to a dis-
     tressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be coordinated through the SOF.

9. Duty Hours:
     9.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as directed by
     AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented. For AFRC units, 12 hours of crew rest is
     required prior to starting duty but may be waived by the OG/CC to 8 hours on a case-by-case basis.
     9.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 12 hours. Waiver authority for SOF duty day is OG/CC. For
     AFRC units, the maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours and may not be waived.
AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007                                                                      13


   9.3. The SOF will be on duty in with sufficient time to complete required duties in paragraph 4.2. and
   will be in the primary or alternate duty location 30 minutes prior to first scheduled takeoff and remain
   on duty until the last aircraft is shut down.
   9.4. (AFRC/ANG) If Ops Sup and SOF duties are combined, SOF duty hour limitations apply.

10. SOF Duty Location:
   10.1. The OG/CC will designate primary and alternate SOF duty locations. As a minimum, the loca-
   tion must have adequate communication equipment and the capability to monitor weather conditions.
   It is desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground operations, takeoffs, landings and local
   traffic patterns can be observed. The designated locations must provide the SOF with timely access to
   a SOF vehicle and the airfield when required. AFRC units are not required to have a dedicated vehicle
   for the SOF, but must be provided access to a vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
   10.2. The primary SOF location for active duty bomber and fighter units will be in the control tower.
   The primary SOF location for all ACC flying units will be in the control tower (OG/CC may designate
   an alternate SOF duty location IAW this regulation). ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units
   will designate, in priority order, the SOF primary and alternate duty locations in their unit supplement
   to this instruction. Also see paragraph 16. for ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units. Unless
   contained in the following list, SOF duty locations need an OG/CC waiver:
      10.2.1. The control tower.
      10.2.2. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
      10.2.3. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
      10.2.4. The unit dispatch desk.
      10.2.5. The command post.

11. SOF Equipment:
   11.1. The communication equipment must be functional and immediately available to the SOF and
   include:
      11.1.1. A dedicated multi-frequency radio (UHF, VHF and/or HF, as appropriate) to contact air-
      borne aircraft.
      11.1.2. A telephone (land-line or cellular telephone) or FM radio to contact the OG/CC, command
      post, Ops Sups/SDOs, weather facility and ATC watch supervisors. Dedicated phone lines
      (hot-lines) are preferred.
      11.1.3. The minimum equipment for the SOF to communicate with airborne aircraft and the com-
      mand and control network and monitor ATC.
   11.2. An appropriate local weather dissemination system will be available.
   11.3. Units are required to have a dedicated SOF vehicle immediately available to the SOF and posi-
   tioned to respond to emergencies, perform airfield inspections and other official purposes. This vehi-
   cle must have a flight line clearance and be equipped with a multi-channel radio capable of contacting
   unit aircraft and local controllers. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement in their supplement to this
   instruction.
14                                                            AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007


     AFRC: Wing commander or equivalent may waive this requirement IAW paragraph 19..
     11.4. Locally developed checklists will be used to outline procedures for normal and emergency pro-
     cedures. The required SOF checklists are listed in Attachment 2.
     11.5. SOF dedicated binoculars will be immediately available to the SOF when in the control tower,
     RSU/RMU or SOF vehicle.
     11.6. The SOF will have access to such items as applicable directives and instructions, aircraft Tech-
     nical Orders, checklists, in-flight guides, SOF read/information file, etc. If the SOF repositions to an
     alternate location, minimum essential equipment will be available (pre-positioned or transported).

12. SOF Qualifications:
     12.1. All SOF nominees will be experienced, rated officers with proven maturity, judgment and
     supervisory ability. They must be mission qualified combat mission ready (CMR)/basic mission capa-
     ble (BMC) in a unit aircraft and medically qualified to fly.
     12.2. All SOFs will complete the SOF qualification or upgrade program.
     12.3. Duties not involving flying (DNIF) crewmembers may perform SOF duties when specifically
     cleared by a flight surgeon.
     12.4. Qualified SOFs may perform duties while N-CMR/N-BMC at the discretion of the OG/CC. The
     status must be temporary in nature (due to TDY, DNIF status, RAP sortie look back, ground training
     courses, etc.). All SOF related items will be current. Qualified SOFs will not perform SOF duties in
     unqualified (UQ) status. EXCEPTION: AFRC OG/CC may approve qualified SOFs to perform SOF
     duties in UQ status on a case by case basis.

13. SOF Currency/Recurrency. The currency for SOF duties is 90 days (ANG/AFRC: 180 days;
AETC ANG/Reserve Associate Instructor Pilots: 90 days). Individual squadrons will track SOF cur-
rencies (Aviation Resource Management System [ARMS] preferred). To regain currency, as a minimum,
accomplish a 1-hour supervised tour with a current and qualified SOF.

14. SOF Upgrade Program:
     14.1. Squadron commanders will screen and review qualifications of all SOF candidates before nom-
     inating them for entry into the upgrade program.
     14.2. All SOF candidates will receive an interview and briefing from the OG/CC on responsibilities,
     personal philosophy and expectations. OG/CCs will emphasize the SOFs position as a group level
     supervisor and that decision authority is delegated to the SOF position to ensure the safe accomplish-
     ment of the mission.
     14.3. All upgrading SOFs will become familiar with airfield procedures, primary and alternate duty
     locations, equipment and local support agencies. The upgrade program will emphasize operating pro-
     cedures and support provided, specifically capabilities and limitations. Upgrade programs will
     include:
        14.3.1. Weather (to include forecaster duties and priorities) information.
        14.3.2. Approach control information.
AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007                                                                  15

      14.3.4. Crash/fire/rescue operation.
      14.3.5. Explosive ordnance disposal operation.
      14.3.6. Base ops operation.
      14.3.7. Command post operation.
      14.3.8. Airfield Drivers License Qualification (N/A ANG/AFRC if alternate location is not IAW
      para 10.2.2.)
   14.4. For previously qualified SOFs, the OG/CC may waive applicable upgrade requirements.
   14.5. The upgrading SOF will accomplish two supervised upgrade tours of two hours each (minimum
   of 4 hours of training time) with a current and qualified SOF (IAW para 14.9.). Conduct SOF training
   on two different days in order for the upgradee to observe differing wind and weather conditions.
   Upgradees will act as primary SOF on their second upgrade tour (previously qualified SOFs require
   only this tour). These tours must include the following:
      14.5.1. Operation of all SOF equipment and radios.
      14.5.2. Contact procedures for aircraft and support agencies.
      14.5.3. A review of publications and directives available to the SOF.
      14.5.4. Operation of SOF vehicle (requires a flight line permit/license).
      14.5.5. A familiarity tour of the airfield and discussion of frequently used travel routes.
      14.5.6. When acting as primary SOF, the upgradee will successfully handle an IFE (actual or sim-
      ulated).
   14.6. All upgrading SOFs will become familiar with the performance aspects and characteristics of
   all base assigned aircraft.
   14.7. Upgrading SOFs will accomplish an initial written examination containing a minimum of 25
   questions on SOF duties, procedures and responsibilities. Minimum passing grade is 85 percent cor-
   rectable to 100 percent.
   14.8. The OG/CC will review upgrade training records and certify upgradees for SOF duties.
   14.9. (N/A AFRC/ANG) SQ/CCs will designate in writing and OG/CCs will certify (on the “letter of
   X” or equivalent documentation) and OG/CCs will certify on appropriate documentation SOFs who
   are qualified to upgrade a crewmember to SOF (i.e., perform the duties of an “Instructor SOF”).

15. SOF Continuation Training (CT):
   15.1. Semi-annual SOF meetings are the usual means to accomplish CT. Commanders will be
   involved in developing meeting agendas and all qualified SOFs are expected to attend. If unable to
   attend, SOFs will review meeting minutes.
   15.2. Annually, all SOFs are required to review applicable SOF guidance and directives and receive a
   briefing from the OG/CC on responsibilities, expectations and commander perspective. If unable to
   attend the OG/CC briefing, SOFs will review briefing minutes.
16                                                            AFI11-418_934AWSUP_I 19 APRIL 2007


16. Provisions for ANG/AFRC and Smaller Than Wing-Sized Units. The provisions of this para-
graph apply to ANG/AFRC units and to units not directly associated with a typical wing (i.e., geographi-
cally separated units/squadrons, detachments, etc.).
     16.1. If a unit operates from a location with another organization (i.e., tenant unit), integration into
     host unit supervisory program should be attempted if operations are compatible. These procedures
     will be implemented through LOAs/MOAs.
     16.2. In ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing size units, supervisory positions are limited based on unit
     authorizations. At the discretion of the OG/CC (or equivalent), more than one supervisory position
     may be covered by a single supervisor. The responsibilities of the SOF position take priority over all
     other duties and the single operations supervisor will be SOF qualified. Units will establish proce-
     dures in their unit supplement to this instruction for others to assist with SOF and Ops Sup duties and
     responsibilities if required during times when one supervisor is covering both SOF and Operations
     Supervisor positions.
     16.3. For AFRC units which do not require a SOF, the OG/CC will designate duty locations and pro-
     cedures for Ops Sup during IFEs in the unit supplement to AFI 11-418.

17. SOF Program Administration:
     17.1. The OG/CC will designate an Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the administration of
     the program.
     17.2. The OPR will:
