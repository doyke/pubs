responsible for meeting the reporting timelines. Reports will be submitted, updating the
GSORTS database within 24 hours, when the 3/6/12-month forecast changes, data expires, to
include GWD or upon direction from USAFE Readiness Measures. Reports will not be delayed
in order to submit within the monthly USAFE reporting window or until a scheduled brief to
wing/group commanders is conducted.
2.4.1.4. (Added) Measured units will submit monthly SORTS reports updating all required unit
data beginning on the 20th at 0001Z, with all reports updated in the GSORTS database not later
than 25th at 2359Z of each month. SRO must request a waiver from the USAFE Readiness
Measures Office prior to 2359Z if they cannot submit reports within the established timeline.
2.5.1.1. (Added) Unit commanders are not authorized to assess their overall C-level up. Only
downgrading is authorized. Commanders should exercise their judgment and only assess down
if factors and circumstances dictate.
2.5.1.2. (Added) When unit commanders are unable to obtain a Forecast Date of Change
(CADAT) or determine a GWD, they will ensure the responsible USAFE FAMs is contacted for
assistance. NOTE: To Be Determined (TBD) and Unknown (UNK) are not to be used as
substitutes for GWD.
2.5.2.3. (Added) Commander’s must use the 3, 6, and 12 month forecast to address and
LIMFACs affecting the unit ability to accomplish the mission.
2.5.2.4. (Added) Commander’s Assessments will not be used in the Forecast Change Rating
AFI10-201_USAFESUP                                                                             11


(CARAT) or in the CADAT Remark. The CARAT and the 3/6/12-month forecast levels need to
reflect what the unit’s actual overall C-Level will be, given the current measured area levels and
their corresponding GWDs. Forecasts must be based on concrete indications of an impending
change in the unit’s C-level such as actual arrival and departure dates of personnel, or actual
dates when equipment items are scheduled for maintenance. An explanation addressing
expected shortfalls must accompany the 3/6/12-month forecasts. See Table 2.4 for an example
of how to format the CADAT Remark.
2.5.2.5. (Added) When a unit is an overall C-1 and is forecasting less than a C-1 in any of the
3/6/12-month forecast, a corresponding remark is required to be submitted using the appropriate
Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level For Personnel Not C-1 (PRRES), Primary
Reason Equipment and Supplies On Hand Not C-1 (ESRES), Primary Reason Equipment
Condition Category Level Not C-1 (ERRES), or Primary Reason Training Resource Area Not C-
1 (TRRES) label.
2.7.2.3.6. (Added) If a unit is reporting Percentage Effectiveness (PCTEF) (1), see Table 2.4.
for an example of how to format the remark.
2.11.1.1. (Added) Remarks will be used to explain deficiencies and corrective actions. Generic
entries are not authorized. Remarks will be directly related to deficiencies in the UTCs and
mission narrative listed in the unit’s DOC Statement. The overall purpose of remarks is to
highlight DOC Statement capability deficiencies as well as explicit description of what portions
of the DOC Statement mission, which the unit can accomplish, to include a narrative and extent
of the missions able to be accomplished. Remarks considered by the SRO, Command Reporting
Organization (CRO), or FAM as inadequate, ambiguous, or not in compliance with AFI 10-201
and USAFE guidance will be corrected by the reporting unit and resubmitted into the GSORTS
database within 24 hours of notification.
2.11.1.2. (Added) Remarks may be used at any time to provide supplemental information. Do
not refer to previous messages or remarks under other labels. Each GWD must specifically state
what level that GWD is for (i.e. GWD to C-2 is 20 Jun 06, or GWD to P-3 is 01 Dec 06). GWDs
must also reflect the next change in C-level, whether up or down. All GWD must be in the
“DDMMMYY” format. All acronyms must be spelled out when they are first used within each
remark. Abbreviations may not be used at anytime throughout the SORTS reports. AFSC
listings must contain the job title of each AFSC. Remarks considered inadequate or ambiguous
will be corrected by the reporting unit and resubmitted into the database within 24 hours.
2.11.3.1. (Added) Remarks must be standard throughout the report. Each remark should begin
and end similarly (i.e. Unit is reporting C-3 due [explanation] and GWD to C-1 is 01 Jan 01).
The use of C-level ratings should pertain only to the overall REASN remark. Otherwise use the
corresponding P, S, R, T code. Individual labels (e.g. ESSA1, ERSA1) should never have an
overall measured resource area code assigned. Individual percentages will be used to reflect
each deficiency.
2.11.3.2. Each remark should be able to explain what the problem is, what’s being accomplished
to fix it, and when does it expect to be fixed. Ensure each remark clearly answers these
questions.
2.11.3.3. (Added) Use the Critical Personnel - Available (CPAVL) Remark to submit
information concerning AFSC substitutions. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format the
12                                                                      AFI10-201_USAFESUP


remark.
2.11.3.4. (Added) Use the Aircrews Formed (CREWF) Remark to submit information
concerning aircrew assigned but not formed. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format the
remark.
2.11.5.1. (Added) Remarks must be used to detail any GWD that change from the previous
month. Remarks will accompany the current remarks GWD and include rational as to why the
GWD changed. Examples of rational are “shipment delayed a month”, “forecasted inbound
cancelled, no new inbound scheduled until 2013”, or “small arms training cancelled this month,
awaiting rescheduling”.
2.11.6.1. (Added) Use Table 2.4. to format remarks. This table is not all-inclusive. Other
remarks may be required to clarify specific deficiencies (see AFI 10-201, local supplement to
AFI 10-201, and related guidance messages for further formatting instructions).
2.11.6.2. (Added) Before addressing an outside organization in remarks, be sure to coordinate
the specific remark with that organization to ensure accuracy and currency of the remark. For
example, before submitting a remark stating you are waiting for supplies on order or waiting for
delivery of a vehicle from transportation, check with the Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) for
current status.
2.11.7.4.1. (Added) When the Total Personnel Percentage (PERTP) label is used, do not
completely re-list the same information under the PRRES label. The purpose of the PERTP
Remark is to sufficiently characterize AFSC shortage numbers along with individual AFSC
GWD.
2.11.8.3.1. (Added) In the RICDA remark, report mobility A-Bags (general-use) and B-bags
(cold weather) according to Table 2.4. and indicate the status of shortages. If bags are centrally
stored in one location (i.e. LRS), then include remarks.
2.11.8.3.2. (Added) USAFE ground crew bags will contain the assets and quantities specified in
AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1., Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations.

 2.2.2, Contingency and Wartime Mobility Airfield Operations Management, unit assigned
 personnel with AFSC’s C021XX/B021XX are interchangeable with some 11XXX/12XXX
 duty positions in the 7E1XX UTCs. 2.) Per UTC manpower detail 21XX, 11XX, 12XX are
 interchangeable regardless of suffix; 2A5X3A and 2E1X1/3 are interchangeable; 2A6X2 and
 3E0X2 interchangeable. 3.) According to AFI 10-201 (Para 3.1.2.5.1. and 3.1.2.5.2.) all
 AFSC's are authorized an increase in skill level, not a decrease.

4.1.1.6. (Added) Aircraft Units (Generation and Mobility mission). Supplement reported UTCs
as required with critical in-place assets. Units will e-mail a consolidated listing of the equipment
used to measure each equipment subarea to Aircraft Airframe (HQ USAFE/A4MA), (AEF
Branch (HQ USAFE/A3JA) Readiness Measures), and the SRO upon receipt of a new/updated
DOC Statement and when changes occur. Count only “XF” “XD” “NF” or “ND” coded items to
avoid skewing results with large number of easily procured expendable items. Include
nomenclature, national stock number (NSN), total authorized, and quantity required to support
the DOC Statement. Submit listings within 30 days of receiving this supplement and when
changes are made to the listing.
4.1.1.7. (Added) Aircraft Units (Mobility mission only). Units will submit a consolidated listing
of the equipment used to measure each equipment subarea to HQ USAFE/A4MA, HQ USAFE
/A3JA Readiness Measures, and the SRO upon receipt of a new/updated DOC Statement and
when changes occur. Count only “XF” “XD” “NF” or “ND” coded items to avoid skewing
results with large number of easily procured expendable items. Include nomenclature, national
stock number (NSN), total authorized, and quantity required to support the DOC Statement.
Submit listings within 30 days of receiving this supplement and when changes are made to the
listing.
4.2.3.5. (Added) Use Major Equipment - Possessed (MEPSD) Remark to submit information
identifying aircraft assigned, but not possessed by the owning unit. Include the number of
backup aircraft inventory (BAI), number and location of aircraft in programmed depot
maintenance (PDM), aircraft on loan to or from another unit, and estimated return date. Use the
MEPSD example format in Table 2.4.
4.4.5. (Added) Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) will use Personal Computer - Aircraft
Sustainability Model (PC-ASM) assessments for In place Readiness Package (IRSP)/ Mobility
Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) assessment.
4.6.4.2.1. (Added) Use the Major Equipment - Assigned (MEASG) Remark to submit
information concerning the actual number of aircraft assigned. See Table 2.4. for an example of
how to format the remark.
4.6.4.3.1. (Added) Use the Major Equipment - Possessed (MEPOS) Remark to submit
information concerning the actual number of aircraft possessed. See Table 2.4. for an example
of how to format the remark.
4.6.4.5. (Added) Use the Major Equipment - Mission Ready and Available (MEMRA) Remark

to submit information concerning the status of major equipment possessed, but cannot be made
mission ready within the unit’s DOC Response Time.
4.6.5.1. (Added) For weather units with Army-provided vehicles and equipment, do not report
status of Army-provided vehicles and equipment if these items are reported through SORTS via
Army channels.       Instead, in the “Remarks Section”, identify Modification Table of
Organizational Equipment (MTOE) for each supported customer and provide percentage filled
per paragraph 4.6.2.
4.10.4. (Added) When making these assessments include all available resources, to include
deployed assets (Readiness Spares Package (RSP) and Minimum Spares Kit (MSK)) located
within the theater that could be redeployed within unit DOC response time. Ensure your
parameter input images for R26 processing are correctly formatted to select satellite and home
station data. Personal Computer - Aircraft Sustainability Model (PC-ASM) assessments are
accomplished by LRS. Material Management (HQ USAFE/A4RMW) offers training in
preparing PC-ASM assessments.
4.12.1. (Added) All Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) aircraft with engine holes will have
serviceable/projected serviceable engines allocated. All engines (including those installed in or
allocated to Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI), or, hangered, long-term-broke assigned aircraft
that will be available and ready for installation within DOC Response Time, will be counted as
serviceable spare engines for S-level computations. Use Table 4.8 of the basic publication to
determine appropriate percentage and S-level. War Reserve Material (WRM) and required
engines are synonymous.
4.13. (Added) Use the EQSEE Remark to submit information concerning resources (other than
aircraft) that are at depot for maintenance. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format this

5.4.4.3.1. (Added) When submitting major equipment location and crew information
(MEQLOCN) data, use a separate MEQLOCN set to report on aircraft and aircrews that are
deployed away from home station for longer than 72 hours in the temporary location code
(TEGEO) field. The MEQLOCN set containing the temporary location data must be updated or
deleted within 24 hours when crews and aircraft return to home station.
5.7.1.1.1. (Added) Ensure required systems or subsystems are operational using the basic
systems list (BSL) of the DOC's mission essential subsystems list (MESL). Those units whose
MESL is listed in the work unit code (WUC) format will use the BSLs to determine mission
capable status.
5.7.1.1.2. (Added) Units assigned a conventional DOC must use any one of the tasked BSLs (as
shown in the DOC). Units assigned a nuclear and conventional DOC must use any one of the
tasked conventional BSLs plus nuclear BSL.
5.9.1. (Added) Use the MEMRA remark to submit information concerning the number of
aircraft not mission ready available. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format the remark.

combat ,combat support, combat services support units apportioned to or deployed in support of
CJCS or CCDR directed OPLAN, CONPLAN, SIOP, OPLAN 8044 Revision 03, or Vol 3 of the
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in the “Forces For Unified Commands”, or
other tasking documents (i.e. NATO), and are required to have SORTS DOC Statements. Per
para. 3.1.1.1.1, the UMD will be used as the source document for personnel for generation/dual
mission. The UTA will be the source document for personnel for mobility missions. Units will
report all UTCs with AEF posturing codes (DW*, DP*).
A2.5.2.1.3. (Added) AF Form 723, SORTS DOC Statement, are developed, managed,
reviewed and revised by the responsible USAFE SORTS FAMs. The USAFE Readiness
Measures Office provides guidance and oversight of the SORTS DOC Statement process. DOC
Statement Creation and DOC Statement Coordination Checklists are provided by the USAFE
Readiness Measures office to assist FAMs in creating and publishing DOC Statements. DOC
Statements must be completed using DOC Statement Checklist’s within established timelines.
The goal for DOC Statement completion is 90 days from initial notification. The AEF Policy
and Joint Exercise Division (HQ USAFE/A3J) will send out annual DOC Statement review
notifications to all FAMs.
A2.5.2.3.1. (Added) SROs are notified by an official e-mail message when a new DOC
Statement or FMTL is available or when an annual review has been accomplished.

Statement, the FAM will accomplish a letter, signed by the DOC Statement Approval Authority,
indicating completion of the annual review for the DOC Statement (Figure A8.4. (Added)). If
changes are required and/or an FMTL is in place for the unit’s DOC Statement, the FAMs must
contact USAFE Readiness Measures to receive the DOC Statement Creation and DOC Statement
Coordination Checklists. At that time, USAFE Readiness Measures, along with the FAM will
establish a timeline for publishing the DOC Statement. The goal for DOC Statement completion
is 60 days from initial notification. FAMs must return the DOC Statement signed by the DOC
Statement Approval Authority for distribution.
A2.7.1.1. (Added) All correspondence affecting a unit’s DOC Statement must be kept with the

A2.8.2.3.1.1. (Added) For generation or dual mission DOCs, who report against their UMDs, not
their UTCs, FAMs will input “Refer to UTC Availability (UTA)” in Section IIC of the SORTS
DOC Statement versus listing each UTC separately. For DOCs supporting mobility only
missions, FAMs will input in parenthesis “(see section IV for a list of UTCs)” at the bottom of
Section IIC. Include UTCs with posturing codes of DW*, DP*. The “D” indicates the total
standard deployable (mobility) UTCs. DPS and DPX are also deployable, but normally within
theater.
A2.8.3.1.3.1. (Added) If critical personnel are to be measured, FAMs must include the rule
number in Section IIIA of the SORTS DOC Statement next to the Critical Box. SROs will mark

             USAFE SORTS STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV) PROGRAM

A8.1. SORTS SAVs
A8.1.1. The USAFE SORTS Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) is designed to assess SRO and unit
reporting compliance, with baseline standards, according to AFI 10-201, AFI 90-201 USAFE
Supplement 1, and this supplement. In addition, provide operational requirements, training, and
suggestions for improving wing SRO overall effectiveness.
A8.1.2. SAVs will be scheduled and conducted annually. The schedule will be transmitted to
each unit and published at (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCop.asp?Filter=OO-OP-
FE-01). A message will be sent to specific units, as applicable, if a date change is necessary.
NOTE: Every effort will be made to ensure that the SAV is conducted prior to a Unit
Compliance Inspection (UCI), Operational Readiness Inspection and/or Surety Inspection.
A8.1.3. The most current UCI report will be used as the basis of measurement for all SORTS
programs. The most current UCI SORTS checklists will be located on the USAFE Portal,
USAFE Publications page under the “Checklists” heading.
A8.1.4. The SAV will be conducted in conjunction with SRO training, as applicable. Training
will be conducted using the USAFE Command Post Master Training Plan (MTP), Phase 3. The
SRO (primary and alternate) appointed by the wing/group commander must be present for this
training. Training will be documented and maintained according to paragraph 1.11.10.2.1.5.
(Added)
A8.1.5. The SAV team will provide the Command Post (CP) with a message and/or e-mail
confirming arrival/departure dates, team composition, Entry Authorization List (EAL) and in-
brief/out-brief availability not later than 30 days before arrival. Team visits will normally be 3-5
days. The CP chief will verify if the wing commander/alternate desires a SAV team chief in/out-
brief and coordinate, appropriately. If an out-brief is desired, an appointment should be made for
the last duty day of the visit.
A8.1.6. (Added) Measured unit commanders must ensure their SORTS representatives
(measured unit monitors) are available to provide the SORTS program information to the SAV
team members for review. Also, the unit commander must inform the wing SORTS manager
during coordination of the SAV, if they would like a one-on-one in and or outbrief.
A8.2. Non-compliant SAV results.
A8.2.1. To ensure appropriate senior leadership involvement in non-compliant SORTS
programs, wing commanders will ensure the Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO)
prepares and submits a Get Well Plan to HQ USAFE/A3J no later than the date indicated in the
SAV report.
A8.2.2. The USAFE Readiness Measures office will conduct one-on-one training with the
primary/alternate SRO within 30 days of the SAV, if desired. Training is unit funded and
conducted at Ramstein Air Base, GE to allow the SRO uninterrupted personalized training.
A8.2.3. The wing may request USAFE Readiness Measures personnel return, no earlier than 90
days from the initial SAV date, to ensure the wing program is in compliance according to the
Unit Compliance Inspection Checklist and to provide one-on-one training to the SRO. The wing
AFI10-201_USAFESUP                                                                       29


will fund this secondary SAV.
A8.3. The respective HQ USAFE functional manager, and 2-letter directorate (SF, SC etc.) are
highly encouraged to develop SORTS reporting guides for their responsible area. An area
specific checklist/guide is desired to identify functionally unique SORTS requirements. If
developed, coordinate such guides through USAFE Readiness Measures and HQ USAFE/IG.

INTRODUCTION
1. BACKGROUND
1.1. The Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS) was designed to provide
an Automated Data Processing (ADP) and related general support tool to the National Military
Command System (NMCS). GSORTS functions as the central registry of all Operational Units
in the US Armed Forces. It is the single, automated reporting system within the Department of
Defense that provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Staff with accurate and
timely unit identification, location, assignment, personnel, and equipment data for the registered
units and organizations of the US Armed Forces, Defense Agencies, and certain foreign and
international organizations involved in operations with the US Armed Forces. GSORTS also
provides an assessment of how resources and training levels will affect a unit’s ability to
undertake its wartime mission(s).
2. REPORTING
2.1. One component of the SORTS system is the Readiness Assessment System (RAS) Input
Tool (RAS IT). It is the DoD resource-and unit-monitoring system designed to support unit
readiness reporting and assessment, crisis response, and deliberate planning information
requirements. The SORTS database reflects the current status of selected resources of a
reporting unit against that unit’s assigned wartime mission(s). The resource areas reported
through the RAS IT are personnel, training, equipment on-hand, and equipment condition.
Additionally, Overall and Chemical and Biological Data Resources and Training (CBDRT) are
measured areas and as such are an integral part of the Input Tool. However, the CBDRT does
not affect the READY level of a unit.
The RAS IT is a source and destination of information from the SORTS database. The system
uses an Internet web browser to display application Graphical User Interface (GUI) screens to
the user. By using a browser interface, the RAS IT will be available to any platform with a
SIPRNet connection. The RAS IT provides users with on-line, interactive access to enter or
update data in the SORTS database. There are two segments that make up the RAS IT: the RAS
Input Tool (RASINP) and the RAS Interactive Transaction Processor (RASITP). The RASINP
is the icon found on the client workstation Global Command and Control System (GCCS)
desktop; the user clicks on the icon to start the input tool. The RASITP is a software segment
that maintains an open “gateway” between the SORTS database and the client workstation.
3. Required Reading
3.1 It is important for the trainee to read and understand the usefulness of AFI 10-201 and AFI
10-201 USAFE Supplement 1.


      TASK RM: SORTS RESPONSIBILITIES AND MEASURED AREAS
INTRODUCTION: Within the Air Force, individual wings (and sometimes squadrons) prepare
38                                                                      AFI10-201_USAFESUP


and submit their GSORTS reports directly to the Joint SORTS processor. The use of
standardized labels, fields, sets and general text remarks allows for timely extraction of
information from the database by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), warfighting
combatant commanders, Air Staff, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The standard web-based
input tool uses RASIT.
CRITERION OBJECTIVE: Understand SORTS procedures as applicable to USAFE.
STANDARD: USAFE SORTS managers and monitors should be able to complete Task RM at
a minimum task performance level 3; minimum task knowledge level b; minimum subject
knowledge level B (ref: AFSC 1C3X1 CFETP).

TASK SR: SUBMISSION OF UNIT SORTS REPORT
INTRODUCTION: GSORTS was designed to provide an automated data processing (ADP)
and general support to the National Military Command System (NMCS). GSORTS functions as
the Central Registry of all Operational Units in the US Armed Forces. It is the single, automated
reporting system within the Department of Defense and the NMCC depends primarily on reports
from defense agencies and services in establishing the JCS SORTS database. Each USAF
MAJCOM is responsible for ensuring units in their area of responsibility (AOR) comply with the
JCS-directed frequency of reporting. To accomplish this, USAFE has established a SORTS
audit program, which ensures accurate and timely reporting. Corrective actions such as quality
control and training are applied to identify units and/or areas needing attention. Unit errors
found on the HHQ audit report will be corrected within 24 hours.
CRITERION OBJECTIVE: Submit accurate, timely SORTS reports; retrieve, interpret and
correct SORTS Error Messages.
STANDARD: SORTS managers and monitors should be able to complete Task SR at a
minimum task performance level 3, minimum task knowledge level b and a minimum subject
knowledge level B, with guidance from trainer (ref: AFSC 1C3X1 CFETP).
