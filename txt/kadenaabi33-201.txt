  original in the continuity binder (see Attachment 2).
     2.3.2. Upon appointment by unit commander, attend initial training. Attend refresher
     training annually. Obtain a copy of your AF Form 4168, COMSEC Responsible Officer
     and User Training Checklist, from the COMSEC office and maintain in your Continuity
     Binder. A new AF Form 4168 will be accomplished each year during refresher training.
     2.3.3. Notify the COMSEC office in writing, of any new requirements, changes (increase
     or decrease), or pending requirements to existing requirements.
     2.3.4. Review annually the requirement for COMSEC material according to AFI 33-201
     volume 2.
     2.3.5. Upon appointment of a new primary CRO/SVRO, request a COMSEC material
     report of the local elements COMSEC holdings from the COMSEC office, and perform a
     physical inventory, accounting for all holdings.        The incoming and outgoing
     CROs/SVROs must both participate in this inventory. After all holdings have been
     reconciled, request a consolidated inventory from the COMSEC office. Sign and file this
     document in your continuity binder and dispose of all previously held hand receipts.
     Additionally, upon appointment of a new Primary CRO/SVRO, a self-inspection will be
     performed, a new COMSEC requirement letter will be drafted with the new CRO/SVRO
     signature, and all COMSEC documents will be page checked. Both the outgoing and
     incoming CRO/SVROs participate in accomplishing these tasks.
     2.3.6. Devise and implement a unit COMSEC program that complies with this
     instruction, AFI 33-201, vol. 1, AFI 33-201, vol. 2, AFI 33-201, vol. 4, AFI 33-201, vol.
     5, AFI 33-201, vol. 7, AFI 33-201, vol. 9, AFSSI 4212, AFSSI 3014 (if applicable), and
     AFSSI 3035, Operational Systems Security Instruction for TACLANE (KG-175) - if
     applicable.
     2.3.7. Part of the COMSEC program implementation will consist of the development of
     an account operating instruction. Account operating instruction will establish local
     procedures on storing, handling, controlling, accessing, and inventorying of COMSEC
     material, protective technology inspection, keying and rekeying procedures for
     Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI), Two Person Integrity (TPI – if applicable),
     Cryptographic Access Program (CAP), destruction, Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
6                                               KADENAABI33-201 10 OCTOBER 2012


    implementation, incident reporting and a requirement for the CRO to obtain COMSEC
    manager clearance from responsibility prior to a permanent change of station (PCS),
    permanent change of assignment (PCA), or a deployment or TDY of over 90 days.
    Coordinate account operating instruction through the COMSEC office and maintain it
    and the coordination sheet in a continuity binder.
    2.3.8. Accomplish a COMSEC requirements letter (see Attachment 3). This letter
    justifies the need for requested COMSEC keys within a local element. Maintain this
    letter in your continuity binder and provide a copy to the wing COMSEC office along
    with proof of cryptographic equipment registration into the Standard Base Supply System
    (SBSS) via a CA/CRL (R-14). Re-accomplish the requirements letter annually, when
    requirements change, or when CRO/SVRO changeover occurs.
    2.3.9. Ensure only authorized and trained users have access to COMSEC material by
    accomplishing a COMSEC access list (see Attachment 4), ensuring individual
    clearances are verified in the process. Re-verify or re-accomplish this list monthly by
    listing each month at the bottom of the access list and initialing for each month after
    verification is complete. Do not retain old access lists to show documentation of monthly
    reviews. The access list must be re-accomplished annually or when an addition to the
    access list is required.
    2.3.10. Train all personnel on the COMSEC access list annually. Annotate this training
    on AF Form 4168 and maintain these forms in your continuity binder.
    2.3.11. Ensure all personnel on the COMSEC access list perform semi-annual required
    reading. This reading will consist of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) dry-runs (i.e. a walk
    through), reviewing AFI 33-201, vol. 1, and AFI 33-201 vol. 2, AFI 33-201 vol. 4, AFI
    33-201 vol. 5, and AFI 33-201 vol. 9 (volume 9 is only required for CROs performing
    SVRO functions). Have the individuals sign a document stating they have performed
    these actions (see Attachment 5) and maintain in the continuity binder.
    2.3.12. Limit COMSEC material access to those personnel listed on the COMSEC access
    list. The only individuals not on the COMSEC access list who can access your holdings
    are the COMSEC Manager, the Alternate COMSEC Manager, wing COMSEC
    accountants and IG inspectors who are trained and enrolled in CAP. Track access by
    these individuals via AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log. Maintain this log in your
    continuity binder from inspection to inspection.
    2.3.13. Develop EAPs to ensure the safeguarding of all COMSEC material and keyed
    CCI items during fire, bomb threat or emergency evacuation scenarios. Additionally,
    develop EAPs for priority and emergency destruction of COMSEC. Coordinate the
    EAPs through the COMSEC office and conduct dry runs at least semi-annually. Post the
    EAPs and coordination sheet in a conspicuous location where they can be easily located
    when needed.
    2.3.14. Pick-up COMSEC from the main-account at the designated time. Be advised that
    the main-account will not issue COMSEC material to any CRO overdue for training, not
    on an updated appointment letter and any local element that has not provided wing
    COMSEC with their SKL audit trails (see Attachment 20). CROs late for or missing
    their designated pick-up time will be rescheduled by the COMSEC office after all other
KADENAABI33-201 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 7


      accounts receiving issues have been processed. When picking-up COMSEC, always
      bring your continuity binder, Data Management Device (DMD) laptop and SKL audit
      trails with you. Maintain Standard Form (SF) 153, COMSEC Material Report; used for
      hand receipt issued during pick-up in your continuity binder until it becomes inactive (i.e.
      all items listed are destroyed).
      2.3.15. Maintain constant accountability for all COMSEC material and aides within your
      account. Document the inventory of COMSEC material on AFCOMSEC Form 16,
      COMSEC Account Daily Shift Inventory, once per shift when a safe is opened (see
      Attachment 6). Be advised that inventories must also be maintained for deployed
      COMSEC material. All AFCOMSEC Form 16s must be stamped for official use only
      (FOUO). Maintain the current AFCOMSEC Form 16 in your safe. Maintain inventories
      for the prior 6 months in your continuity binder.
      2.3.16. Ensure correct procedures are followed by personnel within your unit deploying
      with COMSEC as defined in Attachment 7.
      2.3.17. Ensure all opening and closing of safes is documented on SF 702, Security
      Container Checksheet.
      2.3.18. Change safe combinations at least annually. Document the changes on SF 700,
      Security Container Information, and post inside the locking drawer of the applicable safe.
      Conduct a visual inspection after the combo change and document the inspection on an
      AFTO Form 36, Maintenance Record for Security Type Equipment.
      2.3.19. Ensure a preventive maintenance inspection (PMI) is conducted by the Civil
      Engineering Squadron (CES) every five years for safe drawers and every two years for
      vault doors. Document the preventive maintenance on an AFTO Form 36.
      2.3.20. Be familiar with your short-title holdings and their effective and supersession
      dates.
      2.3.21. Maintain three years worth of Disposition Record Certificates (DRC). As of Apr
      2012 DRCs are no longer required due to the implementation of 100% audit trail reviews.
      However, three years worth of DRCs are still to be maintained and are inspectable.
      Example: If a DRC was accomplished in March 2012 that DRC must remain in your
      continuity binder until March of 2015, at which time the DRC may be destroyed.
      2.3.22. Store all pulled key tape segments in a sealed opaque envelope until the pulled
      segments are destroyed. These envelopes will be sealed and their outside labeled with
      the appropriate short title, edition and segment number. During COMSEC semi-annual
      inspections, all sealed opaque envelopes will be opened for inventory purposes.
      2.3.23. Destroy COMSEC within a 12-hour window after its supersession (see
      Attachment 10). Document this destruction, to include electronic key, on SF 153 as a
      destruction report. Provide the COMSEC Office a copy of the Destruction Report within
      48 hours. Be advised that late destruction will at minimum be considered a Practice
      Dangerous to Security (PDS).
NOTE: Offices using COMSEC material that do not normally operate during weekends (normal
or extended) must destroy superseded material on the first duty day after the weekend.

       2.4.7. Limit COMSEC material access to those personnel listed on the COMSEC access
       list. The only individuals not on the COMSEC access list who can access your holdings
       are the COMSEC manager, the alternate COMSEC manager, wing COMSEC
       accountants and Inspector General (IG) inspectors who are trained and enrolled in CAP.
       Track access by these individuals via AF Form 1109. Maintain the AF Form 1109 for
       one year.
       2.4.8. Develop EAPs to ensure the safeguarding of all COMSEC material and keyed CCI
       items during fire, bomb threat or emergency evacuation scenarios. Additionally, develop

     on STEs. Rekeys can be performed by anyone on the Secure Voice Device Access List
     and should be accomplished semi-annually on all STEs, Iridiums, OMNIs, SECTERAs
     and GSMs devices.
     2.4.20. Ensure that STEs are installed in locations that adhere to a common-sense
     approach to acoustic security concerns as well as ensuring Emission Security (EMSEC)
     requirements are met. All personnel assigned to the area where the STE is located should
     have the same security clearance as the STE key. Where this is not possible or practical,
     develop and implement local procedures to prevent unauthorized personnel from
     accessing the device or overhearing classified telephonic conversations.
     2.4.21. Maintain SF 701 in all areas where COMSEC is utilized or stored – to include
     areas with safes, STEs. Ensure there are appropriate entries (examples: Safe CS04 has
     been secured and checked; KSV-21 removed from phone and properly secured) and that
     this form is completed at the end of each work day, or for 24/7 operations, the beginning
     of each shift.

                                 INVENTORY PROCEDURES

A6.1. All Accounting Legend Code (ALC) 1 COMSEC material will be stored in a GSA
approved safe (separated by non-COMSEC items by at least a divider), listed on AFCOMSEC
Form 16 (inventory form) and inventoried when accessed. ALC 4 should be inventoried by
quantity, ALC 6 and 7 material does not have to be inventoried; however, it should be protected
commensurate with its classification level. Some non-ALC 1 Controlled Cryptographic Items
(CCI) will also be accounted for on inventory. The CCIs required on inventory are all KG-44s,
KG-144s, KGR-96s, MYK-7As, OMNI desktop secure phones, and secure cell sleeves. Fill
devices such as KYK-15s will also be accounted for on inventory if stored in a keyed condition.
ALC 1 COMSEC material will be identified on inventories by short title, edition, quantity and
register number. CCI items will be identified on inventories by short title and serial number.
A6.2. When a safe containing COMSEC is opened, it must be inventoried; however, only 1
inventory per shift is required to be documented. In 24/7 duty sections, an inventory will be
conducted at every shift change.
A6.3. When performing the inventory, look closely at each item to ensure the short title, edition,
and register number match the listing on the inventory. If segments from a key tape are not
present and have been destroyed, ensure you can account for these segments via entries on a
DRC. Do not mark the inventory until you have properly accounted for all segments of the key
tape. Additionally, inspect all protective technology (canisters, pink air-tight seals etc) for
defects and/or tampering. Use only blue or black ink for markings and never use correction fluid
or tape. If errors are made, explain with a Memorandum for Record (MFR). Failure to follow
these set inventory procedures constitutes an improper inventory and increases the possibility for
a COMSEC incident.
A6.4. Sealed containers containing COMSEC will be stored in a safe and annotated with an
identifying number. This number and a short description of container will be recorded on the
inventory. Generate an additional inventory, listing only the container’s contents and place it
inside the container before sealing. This inventory will be used to account for the container’s
contents if it is opened. A third inventory must be on the outside of this container, also listing its
contents. This inventory will not be marked on and serves the purpose of listing the container’s
contents while it is sealed.
A6.5. Standard Form 702 will be annotated to reflect all opening and closing of safes. The safe
will be locked by one individual, and checked by another, whenever possible. After a SF 702
has been completely filled out, it can be shredded and another SF 702 started.
A6.6. A Green pen or marker will be used to identify items added to the inventory, along with a
handwritten MFR stating information such as date added, where material was received from (i.e.
base COMSEC account, transferred from another local element, transferred from another safe
etc) and the initials of the individual adding the material. Preferably, the entire contents of this
MFR would be entered within the highlighted area, however, the details of the MFR can be
written on the back of the inventory form. When doing this, please remember to number the
MFR in the highlighted area and to then utilize the same number on the back of the inventory.
Ensure MFR entries are legible.

A6.8. A red pen or marker will be used to identify items that have been permanently removed
from the inventory (destroyed material) along with a handwritten MFR stating information such
as date removed, and reason for removal (e.g. transferred to another safe, destruction, etc…) and
the initials of the individual who removed the material. Preferably, the entire contents of this
MFR would be entered within the highlighted area, however, the details of the MFR can be
written on the back of the inventory form. The destruction official will be responsible for
annotating the AFCOMSEC Form 16, except in cases of TPI where both individuals are required
to annotate the form. The MFR will state information such as date destroyed/converted, reason
and the initials of the individual(s) destroying/converting the material. Please remember that all
items destroyed must also have a SF 153 completed and filed appropriately. Ensure MFR entries
are legible.
A6.9. Example of inventory with 1 item destroyed on the 15th, and another converted on the
same date. In this example, XXXX-XXX is entered in the Short Title block for three items – on
your inventory, the actual short title would be entered there:

                          DEPLOYED COMSEC PROCEDURES

A7.1. In accordance with reference, the following deployed COMSEC procedures are hereby
implemented for units deploying from Kadena Air Base. It should be noted that during
deployments of COMSEC, every attempt should be made to utilize US military or US
commercial air carriers for transportation. If non-US commercial air carriers are to be utilized,
contact the COMSEC Office well in advance of deployment date for coordination and approval
through AFNIC.
A7.2. Responsibilities
   A7.2.1. Commanders will appoint couriers from within their units to transport COMSEC
   during deployments. Only individuals with appropriate clearance and training will be
   appointed as couriers. Appropriately cleared means the individuals hold the proper security
   clearance and are listed on their unit’s COMSEC Access List. Appropriately trained means
   the individuals have the proper COMSEC training on file (AF Form 4168) within the unit.
   Appointment will consist of Commanders listing appointed personnel on a completed
   Authorization to Hand-Carry Classified Sealed Package letter (see Attachment 8).
   A7.2.2. CROs will ensure appointed couriers are aware of their responsibilities for
   safeguarding and protecting COMSEC material before they deploy. CROs will ensure only
   COMSEC material specifically required during the deployment is taken. CROs will provide
   couriers with a copy of the unit’s COMSEC Access List prior to their departure. If non-US
   commercial carriers are to be utilized for transportation of COMSEC, CROs will contact the
   COMSEC office well in advance of deployment date for coordination and approval through
   AFNIC.
   A7.2.3. Couriers will be personally responsible for the safeguarding and protection of the
   COMSEC during transit to and from the deployment location. Couriers will maintain in their
   possession a copy of the Authorization to Hand-Carry Classified Sealed Package letter at all

                           COMSEC DESTRUCTION NOTES

A10.1. Destruction must be completed within a 12-hour window after COMSEC is superseded
and must be documented (to include electronic key) on SF 153. In non 24/7 shops, if
supersession occurs on a weekend or holiday, destruction will be performed on the morning of
the first duty day that follows.
A10.2. If destruction is performed late, contact the COMSEC Office immediately. This will
result in no less than a Practice Dangerous to Security. All late destruction will have a
memorandum attached to the Destruction Report detailing the circumstances.
A10.3. Be keenly aware of supersession dates of electronic key.      A problem frequently
encountered at Kadena is late destruction of electronic key.
A10.4. Ensure the device you use to shred COMSEC documents and keying material is
approved by NSA for COMSEC destruction. Contact the Wing COMSEC office with any
questions or concerns involving destruction of COMSEC material. If you are not sure if your
device is approved for COMSEC destruction, DO NOT USE IT and immediately contact the
wing COMSEC office.

                    SAMPLE SECURE VOICE USER CERTICATIONS

A14.1. Secure Voice Responsible Officer (SVRO) Training. The SVRO must be trained on
their responsibilities pertaining to secure voice user training, semi-annual KSV-21 inventory, and
any other responsibilities prescribed by the COMSEC Manager, if any.
A14.2. User Training. The SVRO must train each user they support. This training must include
responsibilities pertaining to secure voice devices, protection of KSV-21 cards, physical security
requirements for the equipment and any other responsibilities prescribed by the COMSEC
manager.
A14.3. The following is a sample training list and can be tailored to meet local requirements.
   A14.3.1. Placing Unsecure Unclassified Calls.
       A14.3.1.1. When the STE is in the un-keyed mode, use it only for placing unsecure,
       unclassified calls. Removing the KSV-21 makes the terminal un-keyed.
       A14.3.1.2. The IRIDIUM and FNBDT are keyed and may be used for unsecure
       unclassified calls if the PIN code has not been entered to activate the key.
   A14.3.2. Placing Secure Calls.
       A14.3.2.1. When the STE is in the keyed mode (KSV-21 in the STE), afford protection
       commensurate with the level of the key it contains and ensure use only by authorized
       personnel (individuals on Secure Voice Device Access List). When unauthorized
       personnel are in the area, the keyed STE must be under the operational control and within
       view of at least one appropriately authorized user. Unauthorized personnel will not be
       allowed access to the STE and no secure calls will be placed by anyone in the area while
       these individuals are present.
       A14.3.2.2. When the IRIDIUM or FNBDT is in the keyed mode (PIN Code entered into
       the secure voice device), afford protection commensurate with the level of the key it
       contains and ensure use only by authorized personnel (individuals on Secure Voice
       Device Access List). When unauthorized personnel are in the area, keep keyed devices
       under the operational control and within the view of at least one appropriately authorized
       user. Unauthorized personnel will not be allowed access to the IRIDIUM or FNBDT and
       no secure calls will be placed by anyone in the area while these individuals are present.
       A14.3.2.3. Pay strict attention to the authentication display to ensure the classification
       level of the conversation does not exceed the highest clearance classification displayed.
       A14.3.2.4. Before discussing classified information, the person making/receiving the
       classified call must make sure all personnel in the area are cleared and have a need to
       know.
       A14.3.2.5. Each STE user must call the Electronic Key Management System Central
       Facility (EKMS CF – by dialing 118) twice each year to update the STE. Recommend
       you call at least once a quarter to receive an updated compromise information message
       and update the key.
KADENAABI33-201 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                31


       A14.3.2.6. Each SECTERA or OMNI user must call the Electronic Key Management
       System Central Facility (EKMS CF – by dialing 312-238-4470) twice each year to update
       the COMSEC key. Recommend you call at least once a quarter to receive an updated
       compromise information message and update the key.
   A14.3.3. A STE not operational 24 hours a day will have the KSV-21 removed at the close
   of business. Annotate that this has been accomplished on the SF 701, Activity Security
   Checklist. Store the KSV-21 in a GSA-approved security container, if kept in the same room
   as the STE. If the room in which the STE is used is authorized for open storage, the KSV-21
   may remain in the phone. Only individuals on the Secure Voice Device Access List will have
   access to the container. If you store the KSV-21 in another room, keep it in a GSA-approved
   security container. If a security container is not available, store the KSV-21 in a locked
   cabinet, desk, etc. You may place the KSV-21 on your person. The adequacy of storage
   alternatives for the CIK is determined on a case-by-case basis by the unit security manager
   within each using organization.
A14.3.4. For IRIDIUM and FNBDT devices, keep the PIN Code separate from the associated
devices. Do not write the PIN on the device or anywhere else accessible by an unauthorized
person. The PIN will not be written or otherwise affixed to the device.
   A14.3.5. If you lose your KSV-21, notify your SVRO immediately.
   A14.3.6. The following are reportable COMSEC incidents that you must report to your
   CRO/SVRO:
   A14.3.7. KSV-21 cards left in STE overnight (except 24-hour work center or area approved
   for open storage of classification of STE).
A14.4. Lost secure voice device.
   A14.4.1. Loss of KSV-21 fill cards.
   A14.4.2. Unauthorized personnel making a secure call on a secure voice device.              An
   unauthorized individual is anyone not listed on the Secure Voice Device Access List.
   A14.4.3. Secure call completed using expired key.
A14.4.4. Any instance where the authentication information displayed during a secure call is
does not represent the distant terminal
   A14.4.5. Failure to adequately protect or to erase a KSV-21 associated with a lost terminal.
   A14.4.6. Any instance where the display indicates the distant terminal contains
   compromised key.
   A14.4.7. STEs (KSV-21 inserted) left unattended (i.e., no authorized user present for more
   than five minutes). Exceptions to this are rooms with open storage authorization.
   A14.4.8. Any instance where the display is inoperative and a secure call is completed.
A14.5. Emergency Procedures. In the event of fire, natural disaster, or covert threat, remove the
KSV-21 from the STE and secure it or keep it in the personal possession of an authorized
individual. Disable PINs in all FNBDT devices and secure or take all secure cellular phone
devices. These procedures are listed in your unit’s Emergency Action Plans (EAPs). See your
CRO/SVRO for details. Example illustration provided below.

                         SECTERA AND OMNI PROCEDURES

A17.1. The following COMSEC procedures are implemented for the SECTERA and OMNI
devices.
A17.2. Handling and accountability of SECTERA Wire line Terminals and PIN:
   A17.2.1. Terminal:
      A17.2.1.1. Storage and Handling: SECTERA terminals must be located in areas where
      access to the device can be controlled, users can maintain continuous physical control of
      the terminal and the possibility of loss, theft, unauthorized use, or tampering is
      minimized. Any loss, theft, unauthorized use or tampering must be reported immediately
      to the COMSEC office. The selected location must also adhere to a common-sense
      approach in regards to acoustic security concerns. When the secure capability of the
      terminal has been activated by entering the User PIN code, the terminal must be protected
      to the classification level of the key it contains. All personnel assigned to the area where
      the SECTERA is located should have a security clearance at least equivalent to the key
      contained within the SECTERA. When the terminal is not being used, the PIN code
      must be disabled.
      A17.2.1.2. Accountability: Each SECTERA will be accounted for daily on a SF-701,
      Activity Security Checklist. Each terminal will be listed individually on the SF-701 by its
      serial number. Entries on the SF-701 will also include reminders to ensure SECTERA
      PIN codes have been disabled. Semi-annually, the COMSEC Manager will inventory all
      terminals at each local element and ensure daily accountability via SF701 has been
      conducted.
   A17.2.2. PIN:
      A17.2.2.1. Storage and Handling: Each terminal’s T1DSW PIN and all User PINs will
      be stored in a GSA approved safe when not being utilized. User PINs are generated by
      the SECTERA itself. Once a User PIN is generated, it may be recorded on a SF-700.
      T1DSW PINs will never be written down and User PINs will only be recorded on a SF-
      700.
      A17.2.2.2. Accountability: CROs/SVROs must devise a method to account for T1DWS
      and User PINs. The method used is left up to these individuals (AFCOMSEC Form 16
      listing COMSEC material, separate AFCOMSEC Form 16). Whichever method is used,
      each PIN will be listed by the serial number of the phone to which it is assigned.
A17.3. Handling and accountability of OMNI Terminals and PIN:
   A17.3.1. Terminal:
   A17.3.1.1. Storage and Handling: OMNI terminals must be located in areas where access to
   the device can be controlled, users can maintain continuous physical control of the terminal
   and the possibility of loss, theft, unauthorized use, or tampering is minimized. Any loss,
   theft, unauthorized use or tampering must be reported immediately to the COMSEC office.
   The selected location must also adhere to a common-sense approach in regards to acoustic

  security concerns. When the secure capability of the terminal has been activated by entering
  the User PIN code, the terminal must be protected to the classification level of the key it
  contains. All personnel assigned to the area where the OMNI is located should have a
  security clearance at least equivalent to the key contained within the OMNI. When the
  terminal is not being used, the PIN code must be disabled.
     A17.3.1.2. Accountability: Each OMI will be accounted for daily on a SF-701, Activity
     Security Checklist. Each terminal will be listed individually on the SF-701 by its serial
     number. Entries on the SF-701 will also include reminders to ensure OMNI PIN codes
     have been disabled. Semi-annually, the COMSEC Manager will inventory all terminals
     at each local element and ensure daily accountability via SF701 has been conducted.
  A17.3.2. PIN:
     A17.3.2.1. Storage and Handling: Each terminal’s TA PIN and all User PINs will be
     stored in a GSA approved safe when not being utilized. The TA and User PINs are
     generated by the OMNI itself. Once these PINs are generated, they may be recorded on a
     SF-700. The only place TA and User PINs may be recorded is on a SF-700.
     A17.3.2.2. Accountability: CROs/SVROs must devise a method to account for TA and
     User PINs. The method used is left up to these individuals (AFCOMSEC Form 16 listing
     COMSEC material, separate AFCOMSEC Form 16). Whichever method is used, each
     PIN will be listed by the serial number of the phone to which it is assigned.
