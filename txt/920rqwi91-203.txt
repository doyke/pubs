                            AMMUNITION IDENTIFICATION

A5.1. 5. 56 MM Blank ammunition physical characteristics: The blank 5.56 MM cartridge
is distinguished by the absence of a bullet and is used for simulated fire and maneuvers, salute,
and to operate weapons for instructional demonstrations. The blank cartridge contains a special
propellant powder. The cartridge is identified by a rose-petal (rosette crimp) closure of the
cartridge case mouth. In addition, an engraved knurl is located ½ in from head of cartridge case.
Figure A5.1. 5.56 MM Blank ammunition physical characteristics.




A5.2. 7. 62 MM Blank ammunition linked: Early 7.62MM blank M82 cartridges identified by
its double tapered neck with a wad seal will operate in the M240 machine gun. However, it
is recommended that the new M82 blank 7.62MM cartridge, manufactured after 1989 and
identified by a rosette crimp with a purple lacquer seal, be used.
