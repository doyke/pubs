This instruction aligns with Air Force Policy Directive 32-20, Fire Emergency Services and
implements Air Force Instruction 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention
Program. It establishes responsibilities, procedures, and practices for a comprehensive fire
protection program at Randolph Air Force Base (RAFB). It applies to all personnel assigned or
attached to units at Randolph AFB, to include all tenant organizations and off base sites that
come under Randolph jurisdiction. It assigns responsibilities for fire prevention and protection
and establishes a recognized standard practice for safeguarding life and property. Failure to
prevent fires could seriously hamper mission accomplishment here and at other bases worldwide.
Therefore, it is essential that all personnel, military and civilian, maintain constant vigilance to
prevent needless loss of life and property to fire. This regulation is based upon the standards of
the Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards; National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) standards; Unified Facilities Criteria 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering
for Facilities; Engineering Technical Letters; and the Uniform Building Code (UBC). A copy of
this instruction will be maintained in all functional areas. The importance of a sound fire
prevention program cannot be over emphasized. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123,
Management of Records, and are disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil/.

managers and supervisors on the effectiveness of their programs.

    21.1. Building managers or a designated representative will accompany the fire prevention
    inspector on each assessment and initiate immediate corrective action on all fire hazards
    noted at the time of the inspection. If a discrepancy is beyond the control of the building
    manager, submit an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, to have the hazard
    repaired or item replaced.
RANDOLPHAFBI32-2001             20 AUGUST 2007                                                 9

   21.2. If a hazard exists that presents an imminent-danger situation, it will be brought to the
   attention of the supervisor in charge who must take prompt action to eliminate/reduce the
   hazard or cease operations and withdraw exposed personnel. If such situations exist and
   corrective action is not taken, the Chief, FES, Fire Marshal, wing safety, and unit
   commanders will personally observe the operation. If discussions with these individuals fail
   to resolve the problem, the installation commander will be notified and will determine if the
   operation should be continued or terminated.

   21.3. After completion of each assessment, the fire prevention inspector will brief the
   individual accompanying them of the conditions in the area being inspected.

   21.4. AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, informs the building manager, supervisor
   and unit commanders of fire hazards and deficiencies noted during fire prevention
   assessments. Directions for disposition are preprinted on the form.

        commanders. It is imperative these requirements be met.

   25. Authority to Commandeer. The Chief, FES or Senior Fire Officer (SFO) in charge at the
   scene of an emergency may commandeer available military vehicles, equipment, materials, and
   personnel considered necessary for prompt control and extinguishing of fires or rescue of
   personnel. Civilian assistance may be solicited.

   26. Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants will only be used by FES personnel. It is the building
   manager’s responsibility to ensure fire hydrants in their area are free of obstructions. This also
