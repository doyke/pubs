        spectrum support throughout the entire program.
3. Spectrum Management Process.
     3.1. Overall Spectrum Management Process (Figure 1.). Every test plan that calls for
     spectrum use must obtain equipment certification and specify the frequency window required
     to accomplish test objectives. Since frequency use is tied to a window of time and space, the
     date and location of the test is just as important as the desired frequency needed. When
     requesting a frequency window, it is important to indicate to the AFRL SMO what flexibility
     is allowable while meeting test objectives (i.e., can this test be accomplished at Wright-
     Patterson Air Force Base or can it only be done at Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air
     Force Base). The approval process includes agencies that are not controlled by DoD;
     therefore, the AFRL SMO will assist the ISM in obtaining this approval for the S&E or
     program researchers. Activities above or below the solid black line are inputs/outputs to
     processes outside of the AFRL Enterprise.

Figure 1. Level 1 Spectrum Management Process




     3.2. Plan for Spectrum Needs (Figure 2.). The roles and responsibilities depicted in the level
     2 process breakout swim lanes show the work and decisions required for each office of
     responsibility. The process begins when the TD management approves a test that requires
     spectrum use. The S&E or program researcher will identify the spectrum requirements for
     the test. They will then contact the AFRL SMO and/or their SMIPT member who will assist
     them in determining available options and test location.           The AFRL SMO may also
     recommend approved equipment available from another TD and will assist the S&E or
     program researcher in checking the Equipment Location-Certification Identification (EL-
     CID) database for other equipment options. If the S&E or program researcher agrees with
     the equipment selection, skip to Step 3.0. If not, continue to the next step.
AFRLI33-118 15 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   5


Figure 2. Spectrum Management Level 2 - Plan for Spectrum Needs




   3.3. Obtain Equipment Certification (Figure 3.). If no certified equipment exists for the test
   location and/or objectives, the S&E or PM must fill out DD Form 1494, Application for
   Equipment Frequency Allocation, for equipment that will be created, purchased, or borrowed
   prior to use at a particular location. The AFRL SMO and SMIPT member will assist as
   required. The AFRL SMO files the document with the AF Spectrum Management Office
   (AFSMO), and start the tracking process to keep the S&E or program researcher informed of
   the certification process. The AFRL SMO will notify the S&E or program researcher of the
   decision and help to obtain clarification of any non-approved request. Once the equipment is
   certified for use, the frequency window must be applied.

Figure 3. Spectrum Management Level 2 Obtain Equipment Certification




     3.4. Assign Frequency Window (Figure 4.). Start the process for the request for the
     frequency window once the equipment certification is approved at the National level. The
     AFRL SMO is the focal point for the S&E or program researcher and will provide them with
     a worksheet to fill out the needed information. The S&E or program researcher will fill out
     the worksheet and send it to the ISM with a copy to the AFRL SMO to track its progress.
     When AFSMO returns the approved request, the AFRL SMO will prepare an approval
     document that allows the S&E or program researcher to proceed with the test.          (See
     Attachment 2 for the approval memo format.) No test shall proceed without having this
     signed (by the AFRL SMO) approval document in hand. This can be in paper or electronic
     format.
AFRLI33-118 15 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    7

4. Processing of Spectrum Products.
   4.1. General. AFI 33-118, Chapters 2 and 3 provide general guidance and procedures for
   spectrum certification and frequency assignment actions.
   4.2. Spectrum Planning. S&E or program researchers must identify spectrum-dependent
   equipment in order to obtain support.
      4.2.1. Identify spectrum requirements in planning documents. If there is a
      requirement to radiate electromagnetic energy between 9 kHz – 275 GHz, consult the
      AFRL SMO for further guidance.
      4.2.2. When selecting equipment, consider the electromagnetic environment for both the
      testing location and the final operating location. If a capability requires frequencies that
      do not fall within the proper spectrum allocations for the location, prepare and submit an
      out-of-band justification to the AFRL SMO.
          4.2.2.1. The justification must include the reason for using the out-of-band
          equipment, the actions taken to mitigate interference, and the operational impact
          if the equipment is not approved for use.
          4.2.2.2. The AFRL SMO will coordinate with higher-level spectrum management
          agencies to determine whether an electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) study is
          required. The Joint Spectrum Center requires funding to Conduct an EMC study;
          therefore, S&E or program researchers need to budget for studies in the initial cost of
          the program.
          4.2.2.3. Out-of-band justification decisions will not preclude the need for an EMC
          study if later required by DoD, another Federal agency, or a combatant command.
 8                                                         AFRLI33-118 15 NOVEMBER 2013


        4.2.3. When selecting equipment that is already certified, ensure the certification
        includes the type of use, technical characteristics, and location required for operation. If
        not met, the certification must either be amended or re-accomplished.
     4.3. Spectrum Certification. Complete DD Form 1494 for each emitter requiring
     certification. EL-CID software can also be used to complete and submit this certification
     document.       The program, support documentation, facts and questions, and support
     information are available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/elcid/index.html. (The
     AFRL SMO can supply risk assessment information for information assurance (IA) purposes
     upon request.)
     4.4. Frequency Assignments. Complete and submit a Frequency Action RequestWorksheet
     to the ISM with a copy to the AFRL SMO. See Attachment 3.
        4.4.1. Frequency proposals processed by other organizations must list Standard
        Frequency Action Format (SFAF) Item 205 (Subcommand) as “AFRL.”
     4.5. Electronic Attack (EA) Clearance. Complete and submit an EA Clearance Request
     Worksheet to the ISM with a copy to the AFRL SMO. See Attachment 4.
     4.6. Lead Times. Submit requests far enough in advance to allow time for coordination and
     subsequent actions. Short-notice and rapid product development projects must provide
     justification for the lack of lead time. Failure to provide sufficient lead time can result in
     disapproval at any level. Sufficient lead time does not guarantee an approval of a request.
        4.6.1. Spectrum Certification
            4.6.1.1. Submit new equipment certifications 6 to 12 months in advance of testing.
            4.6.1.2. Submit amendments to approved systems and host nation coordination
            requests 3 to 6 months in advance.
        4.6.2. Frequency Assignments
            4.6.2.1. Submit new permanent frequency assignments and long-term experimental
            assignments 90 days in advance of operating date. Submit reviews and renewals 30
            days in advance of end date.
            4.6.2.2. Short-term assignments (STAs) require 90 days advance notice. Renew
            STAs 30 days in advance of expiration date.
        4.6.3. EA Clearances. Submit 90 days in advance of operation. Renew clearances 60
        days in advance of expiration date.
        4.6.4. Spectrum Interference Resolution (SIR). Resolve interference at the lowest level
        possible. Refer to AFI 10-707 for instructions. Inform the AFRL SMO of all SIR
        incidents.
5. Systems/Service Guidance.
     5.1. General.    AFI 33-118, Chapter 4, provides guidance and procedures for specific
     spectrum-dependent systems and services. The following guidance is either in addition to, or
     not covered in, AF or other local guidance.
     5.2. Non-Licensed Systems.
AFRLI33-118 15 NOVEMBER 2013                                                           9


     5.2.1. Submit the FCC identifier on all requests for FCC-approved non-licensed
     devices. The identifier is permanently marked on the equipment. Manufacturers or
     vendors can also provide identifiers on request.
     5.2.2. Systems not approved by the FCC as non-licensed devices must include a
     certification package for consideration under Annex K of National Telecommunications
     and Information Administration (NTIA) Manual of Regulations and Procedures for
     Federal Radio Frequency Management (NTIA Manual).
     5.2.3. All frequency requests for non-licensed devices will contain a statement
     acknowledging the device will accept interference and not cause interference to
     authorized spectrum users.
  5.3. Systems purchased with a government purchase card (GPC). In accordance with DoDD
  4650.1, Policy for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, ensure spectrum
  supportability of equipment prior to purchase or procurement under the GPC program.
  5.4. Equipment Marked as Exempt from Certification in AFI 33-118. Contact the AFRL
  SMO prior to determination of exemption.
