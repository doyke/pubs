1. Qualification Status. Space operations training programs are designed to advance crew
members who have completed Space 100/UST through Basic System Qualification (BSQ) to
Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or Combat Mission Ready (CMR) qualification status. 1NXXX
 4                                                  AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


personnel will attend specific training as required to attain CMR status.        Mission Support
personnel will be certified IAW paragraph 1.4, as required.
     1.1. BSQ. Following Space 100 or foreign national equivalent and upon completion of
     Initial Qualification Training (IQT), if available, a crew member attains BSQ status. If a
     formal IQT course exists, BSQ is a prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
     and is not intended to be a long-term qualification status. MQT provides the training
     necessary to initially qualify a crew member in a specific position required to perform the
     unit mission. Upon completion of MQT, the crew member attains BMC or CMR status IAW
     paragraphs 5 and 6.
     1.2. BMC. Qualification status of individuals who have completed the minimum training
     required to be familiar with specified tasks associated with their unit’s mission or missions.
     BMC status is the minimum level of qualification that applies to Numbered Air Force (NAF)
     commanders (if they choose to be BMC although not required), wing commanders, vice
     commanders, operations group commanders, deputy ops group commanders squadron
     commanders and detachment commanders as applicable and requires completion of an
     AETC mission area orientation or familiarization course (when applicable) and appropriate
     unit familiarization training. NAF/Wing commanders can designate additional positions as
     BMC. NAF/Wing commanders can also designate their respective squadron commander as
     CMR if they so dictate.
     1.2. (14AF) Squadron commanders and detachment commanders will maintain CMR status
     (except 13th Space Warning Squadron).
        1.2.1. Units will determine familiarization requirements for BMC qualification and
        forward them through their group/wing through their NAFs for concurrence to HQ
        AFSPC/A3T for approval. Air Reserve Component (ARC) units (i.e., 6 SOPS, 119
        CACS) will staff their BMC familiarization requirements through their respective
        headquarters OPRs who will then forward to AFSPC/A3T for approval.
        1.2.2. NAF/Wing Commanders may require BMC certified individuals to upgrade to
        CMR. These individuals must comply with CMR qualification requirements IAW
        paragraph 6. Additional CMR task training requirements will be met through MQT-type
        training.
        1.2.3. BMC qualified personnel will always perform crew duty with an individual CMR
        certified in the same duty position of pride of ownership within base personnel.
        1.2.4. (20 AF) BMC qualification includes Emergency War Order (EWO) and Codes
        familiarization training. EWO and Codes certifications are not required.
     1.3. CMR. Qualification status of operations officers and below as well as Spacelift
     Commanders, Spacelift Operations Directors and, if designated by NAF commander, the
     chiefs of standardization/evaluation, who have completed the minimum training required to
     be qualified and proficient in all tasks associated with their unit’s mission. Operations
     officers (or squadron commanders if designated as CMR IAW para. 1.2) will be CMR in the
     most comprehensive/senior CMR position (exception: 20 AF OSS operations officers can be
     BMC per group commander’s discretion). Generally, this status applies to 13SX, 1C6XX
     and 1NXXX personnel who have completed Space 100, AETC IQT (if available) and MQT,
     have passed an evaluation and are certified by an appropriate certifying official. CMR
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                         5


  requirements may apply to additional career fields at selected units at the direction of HQ
  AFSPC/A3.
     1.3.1. CMR personnel are responsible for completing a unit’s real-time operational
     mission and should not be confused with individuals who provide mission critical support
     functions. Examples of CMR crew positions are those with individuals who command
     satellites, accept custody of missile sorties, control space launch countdown processing,
     conduct counterspace operations, and physically control warning and surveillance
     systems. Job performance requirements for CMR positions are documented in
     accordance with NAF-approved Training and Evaluation Performance Standards (TEPS).
     1.3.2. (20 AF) EWO and code handler certifications are prerequisites for CMR
     certification and performance of unsupervised duty.
     1.3.3. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the sole authority for revoking and establishing new CMR
     positions. Units and NAFs should submit recommendations with the appropriate
     justification through HQ AFSPC/A3T. Upon approval, HQ AFSPC/A3 division(s) will
     update applicable guidance.
  1.4. Mission Support Personnel. Personnel not designated CMR/BMC who require a
  structured training program, as directed by the unit commander, will be qualified in their
  unique duty positions. In these cases, the group commander will document qualification
  requirements through the development of a group level operating instruction, ensuring
  compliance with AFPD 36-22 Air Force Military Training, AFMAN 36-2234 Instructional
  System Development, AFH 36-2235V11 Information For Designers Of Instructional
  Systems Application To Unit Training, AFI 36-2201V3 Air Force Training Program On
  The Job Training Administration and applicable Career Field Education and Training Plans
  (CFETP). At a minimum, training program requirements must include a master training plan
  identifying applicable task knowledge and performance requirements. Based on mission
  needs, additional consideration for inclusion into training programs should be given to
  recurring training requirements, procedures for placement on/removal from restricted status,
  procedures for decertification/recertification, and procedures to identify any health or
  medical condition that could impair ability to perform mission duties. The unit commander
  or next senior commander or deputy in the operational chain of command qualifies the
  individual.
  1.4. (14AF) Coordinate Mission Support (MS) certification requirements with 14 AF/A3V.
     1.4.1. (Added-14AF) Restricted Status. Units will develop policies and procedures
     governing placement on/removal from restricted status for mission support personnel.
     Only certified personnel may be placed on, or removed from, restricted status.
     1.4.2. (Added-14AF) Certification, Decertification, and Recertification. Units will
     develop policies and procedures governing certification, decertification, and
     recertification criteria and procedures for mission support personnel.
     1.4.3. (Added-14AF) Health and Medical Considerations. Units will develop policies
     and procedures for identifying mission support personnel whose ability to perform may
     be impaired by health or medical considerations. For Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)
     personnel, medical requirements will be consistent with pertinent contracts.
 6                                                 AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


        1.4.4. (Added-14AF) Units will develop training and evaluation programs to ensure
        mission support personnel are fully trained and qualified in their unique duty positions.
        Units will document a master training plan, including recurring training requirements.
        1.4.5. (Added-14AF) Documentation. Units will document training and evaluations,
        qualifications, restricted status-related actions, certification-related actions, and other
        significant actions affecting the readiness of mission support personnel.
2. Operations Review Boards (ORB). NAFs will establish an ORB process to conduct an
investigation to determine the cause of any abnormal system response. Examples of
circumstances requiring an ORB include: major system degradation, indications of erroneous
system response/procedures with significant mission impact, and significant events where the
cause cannot be determined by initial assessment or when corrective action is beyond minimal
retraining/minor procedural changes.
     2.1. The ORB convening authority is the 14 AF/A3, 20 AF/A3 or the wing/group/squadron
     CC at their respective organizational levels. ORB composition is at the discretion of the
     convening authority. Inform the respective NAF, HQ AFSPC/A3T and the A3 division with
     system responsibility via message when an ORB is convened (electronic versions are
     acceptable).
     2.1. (14AF) The convening authority will: (a) determine what constitutes minimal retraining
     or minor procedural changes, (b) provide assistance to units when required, (c) request
     Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance for ORB items through their parent organization
     when necessary, (d) designate a different ORB chairperson as circumstances warrant (1.e.,
     leaves, TDYs, etc.), and (e) take additional actions on ORB issues as required by 14 AF.
     When issues span across more than one organization, the organization whose primary
     mission was impacted will conduct the ORB. If issues span across more than one wing, 14
     AF/A3 will identify the convening authority. Other organizations, including those with
     Mission Support roles, will support the ORB as required. Requirements of AFI 91-204,
     Safety Investigations and Reports, take precedence over this supplement and may require
     termination of an ORB.
     2.2. ORB minutes will be approved at the next organizational level above the convening
     authority. Send a copy of ORB minutes to the NAF, with information copies to HQ
     AFSPC/A3T and the AFSPC/A3 division responsible for the mission (electronic versions are
     acceptable). Forward a copy of ORB minutes documenting safety-related problems to HQ
     AFSPC/SE.
        2.2.1. (Added-14AF) ORB minutes will be forwarded to 14 AF/A3V.
        2.2.2. (Added-14AF) At the convening authority’s discretion, forward a copy of the
        ORB minutes to participating organizations and units (internal to the wing) with similar
        missions.
     2.3. (Added-14AF) ORB Guidance
        2.3.1. (Added-14AF) ORB Chairperson. The DO acts as the ORB chairperson at the
        squadron/detachment level. The group/wing Chief of Standardization and Evaluation
        acts as the ORB chairperson at the group/wing level. If the DO and Chief of Stan/Eval
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                           7


     are not available, then the respective commander designates a chairperson. The ORB
     chairperson will:
         2.3.1.1. (Added-14AF) Oversee the ORB process.
         2.3.1.2. (Added-14AF) Assist the CC in determining ORB participants and ensure
         participants are notified of the ORB date and time. A safety representative, as
         defined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and
         standardization/evaluation representative are mandatory participants for all ORBs.
         However, the safety representative will determine the appropriate level of
         involvement, provided they have the appropriate security clearance. If the incident
         did not result in loss, damage, injury, or pose a risk to property or personnel, the
         safety representative may deem participation unnecessary. For Geographically
         Separated Units (GSUs) who do not have a standardization/evaluation function, the
         parent group’s OGV will conduct a review of the ORB minutes to identify any
         potential changes to mission procedures and to ensure compliance with HHQ
         instructions/policies.
         2.3.1.3. (Added-14AF) Ensure ORBs do not recommend adverse administrative
         personnel action.
         2.3.1.4. (Added-14AF) Ensure distribution of ORB minutes as appropriate.
  2.4. (Added-14AF) ORB Report. The ORB report should be kept unclassified; however,
  when classified information must be discussed in the minutes, efforts should be made to keep
  classification at the lowest level possible. The report will contain the following information
  in official memorandum format and in the specified order. (See Attachment 3 (Added))
     2.4.1. (Added-14AF) Date the ORB convened and topic.
     2.4.2. (Added-14AF) Personnel participating in the ORB. Include rank, name, duty
     title, and telephone number. If the safety representative determines their involvement is
     unnecessary, document the name and other required information of the individual making
     the determination, and in parenthesis state ―determined safety involvement not
     necessary.‖
     2.4.3. (Added-14AF) Sequence of events (time, locations, etc.). Do not use the names

3. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for New or Upgraded Systems. Prior to IOC, the
wing/group ensures operations, training, standardization, evaluation and crew force management
programs are developed and managed to provide adequate support to the new or upgraded
system operations. The unit commander will report this status using Status of Resources and
Training System (SORTS) criteria (see AFI10-201, Status of Resources and Training System).
IOC declaration for AFSPC systems are managed IAW AFSPCI10-604, Space Operations
Weapon System Management.
3. (14AF)IOC Compliance. At the time AFSPC/CC or designated alternate declares IOC for a
weapon system, the unit operating the weapon system will be in compliance with AFSPCI 10-
1202, AFSPCI 36-2202, Mission Ready Training, Evaluation and Standardization Programs,
and their corresponding supplements.
     3.1. (Added-14AF) The wing/group will conduct an Initial Operations Assessment (IOA)
     not less than 30-calendar days prior to the projected IOC date to determine if a unit’s
     operations, training, standardization and evaluation, and crew operations programs are
     sufficient to adequately support new or upgraded system operations.
     3.2. (Added-14AF) IOA Conduct.
        3.2.1. (Added-14AF) Assess each area a rating of pass or fail. The wing/group
        determines and documents pass/fail criteria. As a minimum, units must be in compliance
        with all critical checklist items associated with AFSPCI 36-2202, AFSPCI 10-1202,
        associated supplements, and appropriate local guidance to receive a pass rating.
        However, compliance alone with all critical checklist items does not necessarily
        constitute a pass rating. Any unit not in compliance with all critical checklist items will
        be rated as failed in the specific area. The IOA team will prepare a report with results
        and recommendations on the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements.
        3.2.2. (Added-14AF) A copy of the report will be forwarded to the squadron CC,
        Operations Group CC, 14 AF/A3 and 14 AF/A3V. If the IOA is rated fail, the IOA
        report will be forwarded to the Wing CC for assessment and IOC recommendation.
        System upgrades not managed through the IOC process do not require an IOA, unless
        deemed necessary by the wing/group or directed by 14 AF (e.g., Ops Acceptance).
        3.2.3. (Added-14AF) Group Stan/Eval offices will provide 14 AF/A3V a schedule of
        projected IOA activities no later than six months prior to the scheduled IOA date.

          5.4.2.2. If the assignment is to a different system, decertify the individual and give
          the IQF to the departing individual.
      5.4.3. Permanent change of assignment (PCA) to a non-BMC position.
      5.4.4. (Added-14AF) At the discretion of the certifying official.
6. CMR Certification:
   6.1. Certification Requirements. CMR certification grants individuals the authority to
   perform unsupervised operations duty. Before individuals are CMR certified, they must meet
   the criteria in paragraphs 6.1.1. through 6.1.5.:
      6.1.1. Complete the appropriate IQT course (if available) and MQT for the crew duty
      position as required by AFSPCI36-2202. Do not enter individuals into MQT until
      completion of IQT, if IQT is available.
          6.1.1.1. Operations officers are not required to attend IQT (or appropriate mission
          ready training) prior to reporting to their unit. They may attend IQT as schedules
          permit but will not be assigned B prefix until CMR status is attained.
          6.1.1.2. If an individual has been CMR in the unit’s mission or like weapon system
          within the last 4 years and there has been no major system modification, local
          requalification training at the unit is appropriate with no waiver required. If the
16                                              AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


        individual has not been CMR in the unit’s mission or like weapon system within the
        last 4 years or a major system modification has occurred, IQT or waiver from HQ
        AFSPC/A3T is required. For AFRC units/personnel, submit waivers to AFRC/A3T.
        6.1.1.3. If an individual has previously been CMR in a satellite command and control
        mission, the satellite command and control fundamentals course is not required.
        Request an IQT waiver from HQ AFSPC/A3T.
     6.1.2. Complete an initial or upgrade qualification evaluation as required by AFSPCI36-
     2202.
     6.1.3. Meet medical qualifications for space and missile operations duty established in
     AFI48123V3 (includes foreign nationals, if required by international agreement or IAW
     position descriptions supplied to the foreign country pursuant to international agreement).
     6.1.3. (14AF) Prior to certification, verify that the individual is medically qualified IAW
     paragraph 7.7 and its subparagraphs.
     6.1.4. (20 AF) Meet qualifications for PRP duty established in DOD 5210.42-R
     AFMAN 10-3902.
     6.1.4. (14AF) 14 AF space operations units will not apply Personnel Reliability
     Program (PRP) standards to CMR/BMC, certification, restriction, decertification, or
     medical action.
     6.1.5. Complete a formal CMR certification briefing. Briefing content is at unit
     commander’s discretion. CMR certification briefings will be given to the unit
     commander. Unit commanders can delegate this requirement no lower than the
     operations officer. Unit commanders, if required to be CMR IAW para. 1.2., will present
     the certification briefing to the next senior commander. CMR certification must be
     documented IAW paragraph 6.3. (20 AF) The EWO certification briefing may fulfill this
     requirement (see AFSPCI10-902, ICBM EWO Training and Evaluation Procedures.)
     6.1.5. (14AF) The certification briefing is a venue for CCs/DOs to discuss unit mission,
     operational rules of engagement, and provide feedback and expectations to operators.
     Certification briefings will be conducted for initial, upgrade, and requalification
     evaluations.
     6.1.6. When significant hardware, software or procedural changes impact unit mission
     requirements, recertify affected CMR personnel to address the changes. AFSPC/A3 will
     determine the requirement for recertification based on recommendations from the NAF,
     HQ AFSPC/A3T and the appropriate division within HQ AFSPC/A3, which has
     MAJCOM oversight of the affected mission. (20 AF) Refer to AFSPCI10-902 for EWO
     recertification instructions.
 6.2. CMR Special Applications. When a new unit or duty position is established, new
 equipment or system modifications occur, or new or significantly changed operations
 procedures requiring training or evaluation occur, the most experienced or qualified
 personnel in the unit may be designated as the subject matter experts (SME) and CMR. This
 only applies to those individuals necessary to develop/conduct the appropriate CMR training
 and evaluation programs or individuals necessary to support the operations, test, and
 evaluation process. SMEs must accomplish the appropriate training for the duty position,
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                        17


  such as contractor-provided Type I training, and meet requirements in paragraphs 6.1.3. and
  6.1.4. as applicable.
     6.2.1. (Added-14AF) For new unit activations or equipment modifications requiring an
     IOC declaration, all designated Subject Matter Experts’ training and evaluations will be
     conducted in accordance with AFSPCI 36-2202 and 14AFSUP1.
  6.3. Certifying Official. The certifying official ensures the successful completion of
  required mission-oriented training, evaluation and ancillary training.
     6.3.1. The unit commander or operations officer documents, in writing (or electronic
     signature), CMR certification for crew members in their unit. For spacelift wings, the
     next senior commander in the chain of command is the CMR certification official.
     6.3.1. (14AF) Detachment CCs certify in writing all CMR crewmembers as CMR for
     their respective units. This certifying authority cannot be delegated to a lower level.
     When the Detachment CC is not available, the parent squadron CC can certify
     detachment crewmembers. Certification in writing is documented on the AFSPC Form
     91A in the form of the certifying official’s signature.
         6.3.1.1. (Added-14AF) For Air Reserve Component (ARC) squadrons supporting
         active duty squadrons, the ARC OG/CC or Deputy Operations Group Commander
         acts as the certifying official for the squadron CC.
         6.3.1.2. (Added-14AF) For personnel assigned to an ARC unit, the ARC squadron
         CC or Operations Officer is the certifying official. The ARC squadron CC may allow
         the CC or Operations Officer of an active duty squadron they support to act as a dual
         certification official.
         6.3.1.3. (Added-14AF) The 14 AF/CC or 14 AF/CV is the certifying official for
         Spacelift Wing CCs. Staff certification documentation through 14 AF/A3V.

         squadrons, the OSS squadron CC or Operations Officer will be the certifying official.
         For OSS staff instructors, the OSS CC or DO will be the certification official.
     6.3.2. Document CMR, EWO and additional duty position certification on the AFSPC
     Form 91.
     6.3.2. (14AF) The certifying official’s signature will be documented on the AFSPC
     Form 91A for CMR certifications.
     6.3.3. 21 SW GSU, 50 SW GSU and 148 SOPS Chiefs of Standardization/Evaluation (or
     senior evaluator CMR certified in the evaluated position) administer CMR evaluations
     (initial, recurring or special) to GSU commanders (if designated as CMR IAW para. 1.2.)
     and operations officers and provide results to the next senior commander (or deputy).
     The next senior commander (or deputy) makes a certification decision and determines
     additional training requirements.
     6.3.4. (Added-14AF) It is not necessary for individuals who PCS/PCA into the
     OGV/OSS to recertify when the assignment meets the requirements in AFSPCI 10-1202
18                                                AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


     and 14AFSUP1, paragraphs 6.1 to 6.1.5. If the new unit chooses to maintain the
     individuals’ certifications, it may do so. This includes CMR, MS, BMC, instructor or
     evaluator certification. Certification authority is simply transferred to the new unit
     commander. Re-accomplishment of a certification brief or documentation of certification
     is not necessary.
     6.3.5. (Added-14AF) IAW AFI 51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of
     Command, the term ―acting‖ commander is not authorized. The term ―acting‖ DO is also
     not authorized. At a minimum, when a unit DO is absent for extended periods (e.g.,

         last day of the member’s birth month.
         6.4.4.2. PHAs must be accomplished by the last day of the member’s birth month.
         6.4.4.3. Restricted status will begin the day after the last day of the member’s birth
         month if a PHA is not accomplished.
     6.4.5. Failure to perform one alert/one duty shift for 45 calendar days in the assigned
     CMR duty position (including ARC). Dual-position certified personnel are only required
     to perform one duty shift every 45 days. Multi-position certified personnel are required
     to perform one duty shift in each position every 45 days. (Not applicable to spacelift,
     mobile space control and mobile missile warning.)
         6.4.5.1. Restricted status will begin the 46th day following the last alert/duty shift.
     6.4.6. (20 AF) Failure to maintain EWO or code handler currency.
     6.4.7. (20 AF) Failure to accomplish annual nuclear surety or missile safety training.
     6.4.8. When the certifying official determines an individual no longer possesses the
     proficiency or professionalism required and decertification is inappropriate.
     6.4.9. (Added-14AF) (including ARC) Failure to perform two duty shifts every 45-
     calendar days in the assigned CMR duty position will result in restricted status. (310 SW
     Traditional Reserve Members) CMR certified personnel are required to perform one duty
     shift every 45-calendar days, with Group/CC approval. The 310 OG/CC will provide
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                         19


     prior approval in writing via memorandum, posted in Section 1 of the member’s
     Individual Qualification Folder (IQF). The effective date will be the 45th day following
     the last duty shift. (ANG Traditional Members) CMR certified personnel are required to
     perform one duty shift every 45-calendar days, with associated Wing/CC approval. The
     Wing/CC will provide prior approval in writing via memorandum, posted in Section 1 of
     the member’s IQF.
         6.4.9.1. (Added-14AF) Multi-position certified. Failure to perform two duty shifts
         in each position every 45-calendar days. (310 SW Traditional Reserve Members)
         Multi-position certified personnel are required to perform one duty shift in each
         position every 45-calendar days, with Group/CC approval. The 310 OG/CC will
         provide prior approval in writing via memorandum, posted in Section 1 of the

         6.4.9.2. (Added-14AF) Dual-position certified. Failure to perform two duty shifts
         every 45-calendar days. The desired method to achieve this requirement is to work
         only one shift in each position every 45-calendar days. However, shift requirements
         for both positions are met if an individual works two duty shifts in the most task-
         inclusive position within the 45-calendar day requirement. (310 SW Traditional
         Reserve Members) Dual-position certified personnel are required to perform one
         duty shift in the most task-inclusive position every 45-calendar days, with Group/CC
         approval. The 310 OG/CC will provide prior approval in writing via memorandum,
         posted in Section 1 of the member’s IQF. The effective date will be the 45th day

         member’s IQF.
     6.4.10. (Added-14AF) Restricted status only applies to certified individuals.       Non-
     certified personnel cannot be placed on, or removed from, restricted status.
  6.5. Removal from Restricted Status. The certifying official determines when to remove
  an individual from restricted status based on the circumstances of each case. Multi-position
  certified individuals must meet the requirements in each duty position for which they are in
  restricted status. Document removal from restricted status on the AFSPC Form 91. Before
  removing an individual from restricted status:
     6.5.1. Individuals who have failed an evaluation:
         6.5.1.1. Must complete the required corrective action.
         6.5.1.2. As a minimum must successfully complete a special evaluation IAW
         AFSPCI36-2202. The certifying official may direct a recurring evaluation.
     6.5.2. Individuals who have not received a recurring evaluation prior to their delinquency
     date must receive a recurring evaluation IAW AFSPCI36-2202.
20                                                 AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010

     6.6.5. Failure to maintain the appropriate security clearance.
     6.6.6. PCS.
        6.6.6.1. If the assignment is to a non-crew position, give the IQF and Career Field
        Education and Training Plan (enlisted only) to the departing individual. Enlisted
        personnel on assignment as AETC instructors must deliver a copy of their IQF
        documenting CMR certification to the gaining unit. This verifies their credentials as
        SMEs in the areas they will instruct. (20 AF) EWO certification documents may be
        destroyed or given to the individual.
        6.6.6.2. If the assignment is in the same system, decertification is not required.
        Retain only the individual's evaluation delinquency date and date of last alert/duty
        shift. The gaining unit commander or operations officer must ensure the remainder of
        CMR certification requirements is accomplished. Additionally, the losing unit gives
        the IQF (with annotation of individual's evaluation delinquency date and date of last
        alert/duty shift) to the departing individual. The gaining unit may decertify incoming
        individuals and provide additional training prior to recertification.
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                          21

      become multi-position or dual-position certified.
      6.6.9. Restricted status projected to exceed 90 days. (Note: once an individual exceeds
      90-calendar day’s restricted status, units must decertify the individual.)
      6.6.10. A disqualifying medical condition as determined by HQ AFSPC/SG.
   6.7. Recertification. Decertified crew members must complete the unit requalification
   training program and a CMR evaluation as required by AFSPCI36-2202. Additionally, these
   individuals must complete a formal CMR certification briefing IAW paragraph 6.1.5 of this
   instruction. Document recertification on the AFSPC Form 91. (20 AF units) Refer to
   AFSPCI10-902 for EWO recertification instructions. If no requalification program exists,
   then member must reaccomplish MQT to include evaluation and certification briefing as

7. Crew Force Management. The goal is to maximize crew force experience while sustaining
staff manning at an adequate level for unit programs.
   7.1. Crew Designators. (20 AF) For scheduling purposes, assign each crew a unique
   identifier. Designate individuals not assigned to a crew as CMR spare crew members.
   7.2. Crew Positions. CMR crew positions are normally filled with 13SX, 1C6XX and
   1NXXX personnel. Units with CMR crew positions filled by personnel with other AFSCs
   (foreign nationals excluded) must submit a waiver request to HQ AFSPC/A3 through HQ
   AFSPC/A3T IAW paragraph 10 of this instruction. Refer to Attachment 2 for a list of CMR
   crew positions.
   7.2. (14AF) Operations Flight Commanders, at units with CMR positions, will maintain
   CMR certification in any senior CMR crew position.
   7.3. Crew Scheduling. Adherence to safe operating procedures and WSSRs is mandatory
   and has prime consideration in the planning, scheduling, briefing, and conduct of all
   activities. NAFs/units will develop a comprehensive scheduling plan to effectively manage
   personnel resources. NAFs and subordinate units will develop and publish comprehensive
   policies governing specific alert and shift requirements in a supplement to this instruction.
      7.3.1. (Added-14AF) Spacelift and deployable space squadrons will develop a schedule
      consistent with paragraph 7.3. Units performing 24 hour operations or long-duration
      missions will develop a crew schedule consistent with this paragraph. The crew schedule
      will identify all crew operations requirements including, at a minimum, individual duty
22                                               AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


     shifts, restricted status, Duties Not Including Controlling (DNIC) status, leaves and
     Temporary Duty (TDYs). Squadrons may incorporate additional items into the schedule,
     such as training and evaluations, at their discretion. Clearly identify all symbols used for
     schedule items in a legend distributed with the schedule. Write-in changes are
     acceptable. Squadrons will publish a final schedule at the end of the month that
     incorporates all changes (1.e., leaves, TDYs, restricted status, etc.) made during the
     month. Maintain a minimum of one year (previous 12 months) of historical crew
     schedules.
     7.3.2. (Added-14AF) An operational duty shift is defined as receiving the changeover
     briefing, signing for the shift and being available for tasking by the Flight Commander
     (FCMDR)/CMDR/CCH, as applicable. Operational duty shifts will normally be 8 hours,
     but not exceed 12 hours. For extreme conditions where weather prevents crew rotation,
     operational duty shifts may exceed 12 hours. The squadron CC or Operations Officer
     will be waiver-granting authority for extended crew shift requirements.
     7.3.3. (Added-14AF) All operations personnel assigned, including those individuals
     performing crew duties, will adhere to requirements established in AFI 36-3003, Military
     Leave Program.
     7.3.4. (Added-14AF) Scheduling Limitations. The squadron CC or Operations Officer
     may waive the following limitations, for a period not to exceed 1 month, to meet mission
     requirements. Waivers to scheduling limitations exceeding 1 month will be approved by
     the OG/CC.
        7.3.4.1. (Added-14AF) There will be at least a 12-hour period prior to duty
        reporting time (between duty shifts), allowing for 8 hours of uninterrupted crew rest
        plus time for meals and transportation. This 8-hour period will exclude any
        operational or administrative duties.
        7.3.4.2. (Added-14AF) Crewmembers may be scheduled to report for duty prior to
        when their normal crew shift begins - as long as total duty hours performed does not
        exceed 12 hours and they have had the opportunity for 8 hours of uninterrupted rest
        prior to arriving for duty.
        7.3.4.3. (Added-14AF) Under unusual circumstances (e.g., sudden illness, increased
        operational activity, etc.), the squadron CC or Operations Officer may place a crew
        on operational duty at any time, provided they have had the opportunity for 8 hours of
        uninterrupted rest.
 7.4. Officer Crew Tour Commitment Dates. (Except ARC) Officer crew members in
 CMR positions (operations officers and above excluded, where applicable) at CONUS non-
 isolated bases are placed on an AAC 55. The AAC 55 is intended to provide a stabilized
 crew force, a Trained Personnel Requirements validation tool and to ensure payback for
 AETC training. The code is controlled by the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and may
 be terminated for a higher-level Air Force priority. Personnel with an AAC 55 must perform
 duty in a CMR position until an appropriate authority waives the AAC 55 or the AAC 55
 expires. Individuals whose primary duties do not require CMR certification (e.g., plans,
 executives, protocol) should not remain CMR certified. Ideally, officers selected for these
 positions should be near or at the end of their crew tours. An AAC 55 starts from the month
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                          23


  the member arrives at the organization or function in accordance with AFI36-2110,
  Assignments, paragraph 2.15 and the AFPC Stabilized Tour Guide. The individual becomes
  available for reassignment during the assignment cycle when the AAC expires. For example,
  an individual arrives at his organization on 15 Aug 08 and receives a 3-year AAC 55. The
  AAC 55 begins on 15 Aug 08 and expires 1 Aug 11. The individual is available for
  reassignment during the summer assignment cycle, Jun-Sep 11. The local Military Personnel
  Flight (MPF) administers the AAC 55.
     7.4.1. Unit inactivation. Follow-on assignments for officers at inactivating units will be
     determined through the AFPC assignment process.
     7.4.2. Officers applying for schools or special programs do not require an AAC 55
     waiver prior to the selection board. This includes boards for flying training, AF Institute
     of Technology (AFIT) programs, Top Hand and the AF Weapons Program. Officers
     should contact HQ AFSPC/A3T for boards not listed above. If the officer is selected, the
     unit must process a waiver to accurately account for AAC 55 commitments.
     7.4.3. A waiver is required prior to removal of officers from duty in a CMR position if
     the AAC 55 has not expired. HQ AFSPC/A3 is the AAC 55 waiver authority; however,
     this authority is delegated to 14 AF and 20 AF commanders for waivers of 7-12 months
     and wing commanders for waivers of 6 months or less. Documentation of NAF and unit
     waivers will be IAW local unit procedures and will include a roster of all crew members
     granted AAC 55 waivers, the purpose for the waiver and the original and new AAC 55
     expiration dates. Units will send quarterly copies of the roster to their NAFs, who will
     consolidate the inputs and forward to HQ AFSPC/A3TT via hardcopy or e-mail. Since
     Trained Personnel Requirements are based on AAC 55 expiration dates, units should not
     expect replacements for officers with AAC 55 waivers until the original AAC 55 expires.
     HQ AFSPC/A1FC will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A3TT on assignment actions of crew
     personnel with an AAC 55, as required. Waivers are not required when removal from
     CMR duty is the result of medical disqualification, permanent PRP decertification or if
     AFPC has broken the AAC 55 to meet an Air Force-level PCS requirement. Units will
     also reflect these instances in their quarterly rosters.
     7.4.3. (14AF) Submit waivers using an indorsement format from the unit CC, to the
     group/CC, to the wing/CC, to the NAF/CC, to AFSPC/A3TT. At the group/wing and
     NAF levels, staff all AAC 55 waivers through the Stan/Eval sections. See Attachment 4
     (Added) for a sample format.
     7.4.4. Unit Staff Manning. To ensure a strong crew force and appropriate wing staff
     manning, the following guidelines apply:
         7.4.4.1. (20 AF) Missile units will fill their company grade staff positions using
         internal resources to the maximum extent. When necessary, PCS manning will be
         provided based on priorities determined by HQ AFSPC/A1FC (in coordination with
         HQ AFSPC/A3TT), but careful planning and coordination should minimize these
         occurrences. Flexible application of AAC 55 and AAC 39 will support this process.
         Recognizing the time-sensitive nature of Code Controller manning, HQ AFSPC/A3
         will support AAC 55 waivers at 2.5 years served for this position. Other staff fills
         should not occur prior to 3 years of crew duty, based on approved AAC 55 waivers at
24                                                  AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


            the appropriate level. Under no circumstances will officers exceed 5.5 years Time on
            Station (TOS).
            7.4.4.2. (14 AF) Space unit manning is complicated by varied crew-to-staff ratios
            and large staff requirements. Positions for crew-experienced staff officers exceed
            crew positions in many squadrons, driving a higher rate of crew-to-staff rotations than
            missile units. Space unit commanders should minimize crew force turbulence to the
            maximum extent and seek AAC 55 waivers only as required to maintain staff
            capabilities. Crew members with the highest time on crew should be primary
            candidates for staff positions.
     7.5. Enlisted Crew Tour Commitment Dates. (Except ARC) Based on assignment policy,
     most first term airmen will complete 2 years of crew duty before PCS, all other enlisted crew
     members will complete 3 years without the need for an AAC. Selectively manned units will
     utilize procedures other than listed in this paragraph to maintain crew force stability. Other
     units will use the following guidance to assign AACs to enlisted crew members.
        7.5.1. Units with missions that require all enlisted crewmembers assigned to hold TS/SCI
        clearances and are not selectively manned will apply to be added to the AF Stabilized
        Tour Guide IAW AFI36-2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.15.6. This will provide crew
        force stability upon the individual’s arrival to the unit through assignment of AAC 44, 3-
        year Stabilized Tour.
        7.5.2. Units may request AAC 51, Operational Deferment, for enlisted crew members
        selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group and OSS Staff positions not to exceed 4 years, 3
        months’ time on station. For enlisted crew members selected to fill NAF/Wing/Group or
        OSS Staff positions that PCS to the duty assignment, no AAC is required. Only one
        AAC code will be assigned per manpower billet. If crew members are double-billeted in
        the same manpower position, only one AAC will be approved.
        7.5.3. Operational units performing weapon system upgrades or bringing new weapon
        systems online may request AAC 39, Operational Continuity, Airmen not to exceed 3
        years, for designated SMEs to support transition. Units will identify the minimum
        number of enlisted crew force personnel required to sustain support of upgrade/new
        weapons system transition. New AAC 39s will only be approved to replace SMEs that
        PCS, PCA, separate or retire.
        7.5.4. No more than one AAC per person will be approved for a given crew
        tour/assigned unit.
        7.5.5. HQ AFSPC/A1F is the approving authority for enlisted AAC requests. Submit
        requests through HQ AFSPC/A1FX, 150 Vandenberg St., Suite 1105, Peterson AFB CO
        80914-4020.
     7.6. Adjusting Crew Tour Commitment Dates. AAC 55 dates are established as outlined
     in para. 7.4 and will not be adjusted by local MPFs. For instances such as security clearance
     issues and extended DNIC/DNIA status, units are encouraged to request extensions for
     members via the AFPC reclama process as appropriate.
     7.7. DNIC/DNIA. This process ensures individuals with medical conditions that could
     affect mission accomplishment, cause mission degradation, or endanger personnel safety do
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                        25


  not perform operational duties. The terms DNIF, DNIA and DNIC are synonymous
  (reference AFI48-123 VOL 3). Each wing should use DNIC or DNIA exclusively.
  7.7. (14AF) 14 AF units will use the term DNIC exclusively.
     7.7.1. Personnel assigned to CMR/BMC positions (including foreign nationals, if
     required by international agreement or IAW position descriptions supplied to the foreign
     country pursuant to international agreement) who fail to meet the applicable medical
     standards established in AFI48-123 VOL 3 will be placed in DNIC/DNIA status and will
     not perform CMR/BMC duties on real-world systems.
     7.7.2. Personnel in DNIC/DNIA status who are not on convalescent leave, hospitalized,
     or assigned to quarters may perform additional duties as determined by the unit and
     competent medical authority to include receiving classroom/simulator instruction or
     instruction on real-world equipment that has been electrically isolated and performing in
     a simulator capacity.
     7.7.3. (Added-14AF) All personnel must comply with all medical requirements in
     AFI48-123 and must have an AF Form 1042 indicating medical qualification to perform
     SMOD (Space/Missile Operations Duties) on file at the operational unit (i.e., OG-level or
     below) that meets the following Minimum Acceptable Standards prior to interacting with
     online real-world systems:
         7.7.3.1. (Added-14AF) The date the individual was actually found certified. The
         date of the flight surgeon signature will serve as the date the action was
         accomplished.
         7.7.3.2. (Added-14AF) The operator’s full name, grade, and SSN must be properly
         filled in.
         7.7.3.3. (Added-14AF) The Special Operational Duty block must indicate SMOD
         (Space/Missile Operations Duties).
         7.7.3.4. (Added-14AF) Blocks indicating medical clearance following either
         ―Periodic Medical Examination‖ or ―Initial Clearance (This Base)‖ must be checked.
         ―Medically cleared for flying or special operational duty following an illness or
         injury‖ may be checked when the member is returning following a DNIC. (ANG
         Units) The ―Initial Medical Examination‖ block may be checked for personnel
         directly assessed into the unit.
         7.7.3.5. (Added-14AF) Remarks section.
            7.7.3.5.1. (Added-14AF) The Remarks section must not contain any comments
            or verbiage that calls into question the validity or qualification of personnel
            indicated medically cleared (e.g., it is unacceptable for the block indicating
            medically cleared following a periodic medical examination to be checked but
            have a remark indicating that the person has a SMOD-disqualifying medical
            condition).
            7.7.3.5.2. (Added-14AF) The Remarks section can be used for local special
            purpose determinations IAW AFI48-123.
            7.7.3.5.3. (Added-14AF) The Remarks section of any AF Form 1042 leaving the
26                                              AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


            Military Treatment Facility (MTF) will not have member’s diagnosis or other
            protected health care information written or otherwise affixed IAW HIPAA rules.
        7.7.3.6. (Added-14AF) If the expiration date is in the past, the individual is not
        considered to be medically qualified.
        7.7.3.7. (Added-14AF) A Flight Surgeon must sign and date the form.
        7.7.3.8. (Added-14AF) Any corrections made to the form, regardless of their
        significance, must be initialed by the Flight Surgeon who signed the form.
        7.7.3.9. (Added-14AF) Upon reporting to a new base for duty or training, a
        complete medical records review and informal examination (Initial Base Clearance)
        must be conducted by a flight surgeon to ensure the member is medically qualified to
        perform SMOD. Additionally, individuals arriving at their first permanent duty
        station must complete a PHA within three months (90 calendar days) of arrival IAW
        AFI48-123. A 1042 meeting the requirements of paragraphs 7.7.3 through 7.7.8 must
        be a matter of record before interacting with online real-world systems. The SMOD
        review is a different review from a PRP review.
        7.7.3.10. (Added-14AF) The requirements stated in paragraphs 7.7.3 through
        7.7.3.9 shall not be construed to modify any requirements for what must be
        maintained in individuals’ medical records as required by AFI48-123.
     7.7.4. (Added-14AF) Individuals in DNIC status will not perform CMR/BMC duties
     supervised or unsupervised. They may administer/receive evaluation and/or training
     scenarios in a simulator/emulator/communications-isolated system or attend classroom
     training, but at no time will they interact with real-world systems. DNIC personnel may
     also participate in testing activities provided the system being tested is communications-
     isolated and there is no interaction with real-world systems. The Flight Surgeon may
     specify individuals should not administer/receive evaluations/training if detrimental to
     their health.
     7.7.5. (Added-14AF) Medical Recommendation for SMOD Duties.
        7.7.5.1. (Added-14AF) Only a Flight Surgeon may make determinations or
        recommendations concerning a SMOD crewmember’s ability to perform or not
        perform CMR or BMC crew duties. When a crew member receives care by a non-
        flight surgeon provider, the member must be seen immediately by a flight surgeon for
        appropriate aeromedical disposition. If a flight surgeon is not immediately available,
        the member must be temporarily removed from space and missile duties until seen by
        a flight surgeon or the visit is reviewed by a flight surgeon.
        7.7.5.2. (Added-14AF) Non-flight surgeon medical providers may ground SMOD
        personnel; however, the Flight Surgeon must document review and disposition of all
        non-flight surgeon medical providers’ entries in the member’s medical record. A
        grounding AF Form 1042 initiated by a non-flight surgeon medical provider must be
        reviewed and countersigned and dated by the flight surgeon. Non-flight surgeon
        medical providers (e.g., nurses, clerks) are not authorized to remove an individual
        from DNIC status.
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                         27


        7.7.5.3. (Added-14AF) Electronic (e.g., E-mail, facsimile) transmission of AF
        Forms 1042 signed by the Flight Surgeon or AFSPC/SG are permissible providing
        they are clearly legible. Illegible forms will be considered invalid.
        7.7.5.4. (Added-14AF) AF Forms 1042 that have been transmitted electronically
        will be printed and filed in the same manner as hand-carried AF Forms 1042.
        7.7.5.5. (Added-14AF) Personnel other than Flight Surgeons or AFSPC/SGP will
        not alter the information contained on the AF Form 1042. This specifically includes
        pen/ink corrections to the information contained on the form (e.g., expiration dates,
        type of clearance).
     7.7.6. (Added-14AF) Units will ensure individuals receive an Initial Base Clearance no
     later than 30 calendar days from entering MQT. The goal is to have all trainees with an
     initial clearance on record at the start of MQT. An individual may enter MQT and
     receive      classroom    training     or     perform       training scenarios    in    a
     simulator/emulator/electrically-isolated/communications-isolated system before receiving
     a medical clearance. At no time will an individual who does not have a valid and current
     medical clearance, whether supervised or unsupervised, interact with real-world systems
     unless those systems (1) have been electrically-isolated and/or communications-isolated,
     (2) are performing in a simulator capacity, and (3) are under the direct supervision of a
     medically-cleared certified instructor or evaluator at all times.
     7.7.7. (Added-14AF) An individual who has met all medical, training, and evaluation
     requirements, but is otherwise in DNIC status, may be certified CMR/BMC. However,
     he/she will not perform CMR/BMC duty until removed from DNIC status.
     7.7.8. (Added-14AF) Expiration of AF Form 1042. On the date the AF Form 1042 for
     medical clearance expires, and anytime thereafter until a new AF Form 1042 is issued,
     the following are true: (a) The individual is considered DNIC by the flight surgeon, (b)
     the individual is considered to no longer possess a current physical by the flight surgeon
     and requires a new physical, (c) the individual is in ―Restricted Status‖ as defined by
     AFSPCI 10-1202, and (d) the individual will require a new AF Form 1042 from the flight
     surgeon to be removed from DNIC and restricted status before performing space/missile
     operations duties.
  7.8. (Added-14AF) Shift Requirements
     7.8.1. (Added-14AF) Prioritization. The Operational Risk Management (ORM) process
     will be applied to make calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental
     factors before, during, and after Air Force operations per AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
     Management and Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 90-902, Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) Guidelines and Tools. The specific situation dictates how the crew applies the
     ORM process, thus prioritizing actions when a risk based on human, material, or
     environmental factors must be weighed against mission accomplishment. Individuals
     should accept risks only to the point where the benefits outweigh the potential cost, but
     will not accept unnecessary risk. If a situation directly threatens mission accomplishment
     by placing resources at an unacceptable level of risk, the FCMDR/CMDR/CCH will
     direct actions to eliminate or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level, within their
     capabilities. To as much extent as possible, FCMDRs/CMDRs/CCHs will delegate tasks
28                                               AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


     appropriately to allow simultaneous processing of mission and hazard
     elimination/reduction. The crew accomplishes all activities using the following
     priorities:
        7.8.1.1. (Added-14AF) Priority 1: Real-time mission accomplishment. These are
        activities requiring immediate attention (e.g., satellite contacts, missile warning
        events, interference, real-time reporting requirements, etc.).
        7.8.1.2. (Added-14AF) Priority 2: Direct mission support. Preparation activities for
        accomplishing the real-time mission (e.g., status monitoring, equipment checkout,
        mission scheduling, etc.).
        7.8.1.3. (Added-14AF) Priority 3:         Indirect mission support (e.g., training,
        evaluations, additional duties, etc.).
     7.8.2. (Added-14AF) Shift Duty. The following are the minimum requirements for
     space operations shift duty.
        7.8.2.1. (Added-14AF) All crew positions designated as CMR will be manned by
        CMR certified personnel during real world mission operations.                     The
        FCMDR/CMDR/CCH, as applicable, is ultimately responsible for all activities,
        operations, security, and personnel in the operations area. The FCMDR/CMDR/CCH
        has authority over all personnel in the operations area, including those falling under
        other administrative chains of command. The FCMDR/CMDR/CCH is responsible
        for ensuring the proficiency of the crew and optimizing positional task exposure
        during a duty shift.
        7.8.2.2. (Added-14AF) A CMR crewmember may temporarily relinquish
        responsibility for their duty position to another individual CMR in the same crew
        position. A positional changeover briefing is required. Additionally, if the
        FCMDR/CMDR/CCH, as applicable, is relinquishing responsibility the on-coming
        FCMDR/CMDR/CCH must sign in the operations log prior to assumption of the shift.
     7.8.3. (Added-14AF) Actions for Assumption of Crew Duty.
        7.8.3.1. (Added-14AF) These actions may be accomplished via a changeover
        briefing from another crew or a pre-brief of the crew prior to beginning duties. (30
        SW/45 SW) A Launch Readiness Review meets the requirement of a pre-brief for
        those positions that don’t accomplish a changeover. At a minimum, the briefing will
        include the following:
           7.8.3.1.1. (Added-14AF) Ensure complete operational system status is provided
           to the on-coming crew. This should include any information regarding system
           capability for supporting the mission. Along with current Operations Capability
           (OPSCAP), provide specific information regarding planned or on-going
           corrective or preventive maintenance actions. Ensure crews are aware of any
           issues having the potential to affect mission accomplishment during the shift.
           Additionally, crews will be briefed on any planned operational events (e.g.
           satellite maneuvers, foreign launches, etc.).
           7.8.3.1.2. (Added-14AF) Provide a weather status. Crews must be aware of any
           local or space environmental conditions that may have an adverse effect on
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                             29


             system performance.
             7.8.3.1.3. (Added-14AF) Ensure crews are briefed on any relevant
             security/intelligence information. This includes any intelligence of value for
             reviewing potential threats to the operational system and mission. Security
             information should include primary and secondary real-world/exercise duress
             words, as applicable.
             7.8.3.1.4. (Added-14AF) Ensure crews are thoroughly briefed on all
             new/changed Crew Information File (CIF) item(s) and all new/changed
             emergency/urgent Temporary Procedure(s) (TPs). Crews must be fully aware of
             the content for all new CIFs and emergency/urgent TPs before assumption of the
             shift. It is the responsibility of both the off-going and on-coming CMDRs to
             ensure crewmembers thoroughly understand all new CIFs/TPs.
         7.8.3.2. (Added-14AF) Inventory Communications Security (COMSEC) materials
         IAW instructions provided by the local COMSEC custodian.
  7.9. (Added-14AF) Operations Log. Operations logs will document the names of all
  personnel performing duty, significant events, new CIFs/TPs posted, and any other
  information deemed necessary by the crew. The importance of the operations log is
  paramount and their integrity and accuracy is of foremost concern.                          The
  FCMDR/CMDR/CCH will sign upon assumption of the shift and assumes responsibility for
  the accuracy of log entries during their shift. See paragraph 7.12 for additional information.
  7.10. (Added-14AF) Crew Information File (CIF) Binder. The CIF provides new or
  updated information impacting operations to crewmembers. Review CIFs at least monthly to
  ensure currency of information, and remove items that are no longer current. Items of
  general nature, not specifically pertaining to crew duty, must be posted in a separate read file.
     7.10.1. (Added-14AF) Maintain any items requiring immediate crew attention of an
     informational basis. CIFs will not be used in lieu of TPs.
     7.10.2. (Added-14AF) Maintain an index/log identifying when a CIF is posted,
     reviewed, or removed. Crewmembers will sign-off the log (prior to the end of the shift)
     to signify they were briefed and that they thoroughly understand any new CIFs.
  7.11. (Added-14AF) Operations Standards. A person must not act as a crewmember of an
  operations crew while:
     7.11.1. (Added-14AF) Under the influence of alcohol or its after-effects. Operations
     crewmembers will not consume alcoholic beverages during the 12-hour period prior to
     assumption of crew duties.
     7.11.2. (Added-14AF) Under the influence of or using a drug that affects the ability to
     safely perform assigned duties. Operations crews may use over-the-counter (OTC)
     medications and supplements as outlined in AFI48-123, paragraphs 6.47.6.2 through
     6.47.6.2.2.3.
     7.11.3. (Added-14AF) Physical/mental condition is suspect or known to be detrimental
     to safety as determined by the Flight Surgeon.
 30                                                AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


   7.12. (Added-14AF) Logs/Binders/Databases/Coordination Sheets: The requirement for
   separate paper logs/binders/databases/coordination sheets is waived if the electronic
   documentation is maintained on a computer system meeting Air Force computer security
   requirements. Electronic logs/binders/databases/coordination sheets may be signed using any
   approved Air Force format (e.g., //SIGNED// jec 21 Nov 08, electronic certificates). All
   electronic logs/binders/databases/coordination sheets must maintain the capability to print
   out a hard copy. Units will maintain paper or electronic logs/binders/ databases/coordination
   sheets for a period of one calendar year, unless otherwise specified.
8. Technical Data And Procedures:
   8.1. Technical Data. Operational systems and weapon systems will not be operated without
   validated and verified technical data or operations procedures. Once technical data or
   operational checklists are in place, crews will use these technical data/checklists at all times
   (or as specified in the technical data) when operating the systems.
      8.1.1. (Added-14AF) Any changes to Technical Orders (T.O.s) must be made using the
      AFTO 22 system outlined in T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. Quick,
      expedient changes can be made using this system. Additionally, priorities for change
      requests via AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation and
      Reply, can be designated and change approval/disapproval response can be required
      within 48 hours.
      8.1.2. (Added-14AF) Ideally, checklists that address procedures not specific to the
      designed function of the defense/weapon system (non-T.O. checklists) may be
      maintained in a separate binder. However, to reduce costs and to maintain continuity of
      crew operations, units may combine non-T.O. checklists into one binder as long as there
      are clear demarcations between T.O. and non-T.O. checklists. Such procedures may
      include but are not limited to the following: safety (e.g., fires external to the operations
      center, severe weather/natural disaster, accident/injury/illness), security (e.g., physical
      security violations, Force Protection Conditions, bomb threats), and Alert Condition (e.g.,
      Emergency Action message (EAM) validation and processing). Units may maintain
      (non-T.O.) operational and contingency checklists, along with associated job aids, in a
      single binder.
          8.1.2.1. (Added-14AF) Format. Operational checklists that are not included in the
          T.O. will be formatted per MIL-PRF-38314, Performance Specification, Manuals,
          Technical: Operation and Associated Checklist (Space Systems), Preparation of.
          8.1.2.2. (Added-14AF) Units will comply with              the standardized checklist
          numbering scheme in Paragraph 8.3.2.6.1 (Added).
   8.2. Operations Manuals. The NAFs will specify procedures for proper marking and
   annotations on hardcopy technical data consistent with the provisions of T.O. 00-5-1, Air
   Force Technical Order System and all other applicable technical order directives.
   8.2. (14AF) Guidance for preparing USAF-approved T.O.s is addressed in MIL-PRF-
   38314, Manuals, Technical: Operation and Associated Checklist (Space Systems). Units
   with existing operations manuals that fall outside the USAF-approved T.O. system, will
   convert to the format specified in MIL-PRF-38314 when major changes/revisions are
   required to keep data current. Wings/groups may convert to the MIL-PRF-38314 format
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                          31


  independent of major changes/revisions if personnel and material resources permit such
  development. (30 SW/45 SW) Units are exempt from the format specified in MIL-PRF-
  38314. Additional guidance for developing and publishing both Electronic and non-
  electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs/TMs) is contained in MIL-STD-38784, Standard
  Practice For Manuals, Technical: General Style and Format Requirements.
     8.2.1. (Added-14AF) Units that are migrating their current TMs or T.O.s to an
     electronic format should use established Department of Defense guidance. Units will not
     migrate to a non-interactive ETM. Units are required to maintain the ability to print
     extremely critical mission and emergency procedures or maintain enough paper copies to
     be used in the event of Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) /ETM failure.
     14 AF does not require any specific on-screen (or printed) format for IETMs/ETMs.
     8.2.2. (Added-14AF) The current standard guidance available for units who use an
     ETM with no (or extremely limited) interactive ability is provided in MIL-STD-38784.
     Units that currently use ETMs will migrate to IETMs when either a significant change
     requires a new/updated TM/T.O. be built and delivered by the contractor or when it is
     financially feasible, whichever is sooner.
     8.2.3. (Added-14AF) Units will coordinate through their Program Manager (PM) and
     HQ AFSPC/LGM for issues on conversion/acquisition. Units will identify functionality
     requirements and forward them to the PM. PMs should work through HQ AFSPC/LGM
     to ensure standards are being met while providing the unit with the required functionality.
     8.2.4. (Added-14AF) IAW MIL-PRF-38314 Demand-Response procedures will be
     limited to critical and/or lengthy procedures. These are procedures that require
     accountability for all steps being completed and/or require steps to be completed in a
     specific order.
     8.2.5. (Added-14AF) For units with USAF-approved T.O.s (non-electronic), issue one
     copy per duty position. The Wing CC is delegated the authority to have units within their
     wing issue one T.O. per person. If the unit issues only one T.O. per position, Stan/Eval
     and Training shops will maintain additional copies of the T.O. (may be used during
     training/evaluation scenarios, checked out for individual study, etc.).
     8.2.6. (Added-14AF) Annotations on both T.O. operations manual pages must be in soft
     erasable black or red pencil only. Annotations on acetate may be made in grease pencil
     or any color vis-à-vis. Authorized annotations are:
        8.2.6.1. (Added-14AF) Any annotation that does not obscure printed material, is
        non-directive in nature, and does not change the context or classification of the
        material being annotated.
        8.2.6.2. (Added-14AF) Underlining which does not obscure or line out printed
        material whether inadvertent or intentional.
        8.2.6.3. (Added-14AF) Color highlighting on acetate that does not obscure the
        printed material.
     8.2.7. (Added-14AF) Job Aids: Job aids are intended to facilitate difficult, repetitious
     or long tasks. Job aids will not supersede technical guidance, T.O.s, or checklists.
32                                              AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


         8.2.7.1. (Added-14AF) Job aids will not be formatted like demand-response or non-
         T.O. checklists. Job aids must be clearly marked as such and not be confused with
         checklists.
         8.2.7.2. (Added-14AF) Job aids may be kept in the same binder as the applicable
         non-T.O. checklist. It is preferable to maintain a job aid with the related checklist.
         8.2.7.3. (Added-14AF) Wings/groups may dictate the specific format or level of
         detail a job aid contains.
  8.3. (14 AF applicable units) Space Operations Procedures. This section outlines the
  basic process for development, validation, and approval of procedures based on new or
  changed operations requirements for units without formally published technical data. These
  procedures can be permanent or temporary. Contractor-developed procedures are produced
  and delivered according to the specifications in the governing contract. The implementing
  unit must review these contractor documents for impact to unit procedures.
  8.3. (14AF) Track new supplemental, temporary and permanent procedures, and changes to
  existing permanent procedures, through closure using the ORP process. The procedures
  outlined in the following paragraphs apply to any unit that uses TPs to effect temporary
  changes to operations manual procedures while awaiting formal changes.
     8.3.1. Procedures Development and Validation:
         8.3.1.1. The individual has completed the crew tour, unless appropriate waiver
         authority has approved an AAC waiver. The waiver must be approved prior to PCA
         and decertification. (See paragraphs 7.4. and 7.5.)
         8.3.1.2. Validation. The organization(s) required to implement the procedure first
         validates it through trial use. Run the procedures, noting the expected outcome for
         each step or task. If the outcome is not as expected, then an analysis must be
         accomplished to determine any required modifications to the procedures or expected
         results. Provide recommendations to the developer for consideration or approval. If
         the trial run of a new procedure may impact operations or operational equipment, it
         must be conducted on an off-line simulator/system (if available) with sufficient
         fidelity to ensure no mission impact/equipment damage to the operational system.
     8.3.2. Permanent Procedures. These are necessary to ensure successful mission
     accomplishment. Although they are usually required for an indefinite period of time,
     they may be periodically modified to keep pace with changes to system or mission
     requirements. Permanent procedures are documented in positional checklists or
     operations manuals. Locally prepared checklists are formatted IAW T.O. 00-5-1, MIL-
     PRF-38314, Manuals, Technical:        Operation and Associated Checklist (Space
     Systems), Preparation of, and MIL-STD-38784, Standard Practice for Manuals,
     Technical, General Style and Format Requirements.
         8.3.2.1. Changes. Changes to permanent procedures are categorized according to the
         urgency for their implementation. Modifications usually are affected through the
         replacement of whole pages. The three categories of changes are emergency, urgent,
         and routine.
            8.3.2.1.1. Emergency. These require immediate action on a deficiency that, if not
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                          33


           corrected, would result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive
           damage or destruction of equipment or property, or inability to achieve or
           maintain the mission.
           8.3.2.1.2. Urgent. These require action on a deficiency which, if not corrected,
           could cause one or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment
           or property; reduce operational efficiency; or could jeopardize the safety or
           success of mission accomplishment.
           8.3.2.1.3. Routine. These require action on deficiencies that do not fall into the
           emergency or urgent categories. These are modifications to existing procedures
           that do not affect the overall process for completion, such as administrative
           changes.
        8.3.2.2. 14 AF develops procedures regarding the coordination and approval process
        for permanent procedures contained in positional checklists and operations manuals
        as well as checklist numbering schemes.
        8.3.2.2. (14AF) Format. Operational checklists that are not included in the T.O. will
        be formatted per MIL-PRF-38314. (30 SW/45 SW) Units are exempt from the
        format specified in MIL-PRF-38314. Additional guidance for developing and
        publishing both Electronic and non-electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs/TMs) is
        contained in MIL-STD-38784, Standard Practice For Manuals, Technical: General
        Style and Format Requirements.
           8.3.2.2.1. The coordination process must address procedure technical accuracy
           assurance, standardization of procedures, and training requirements.
           8.3.2.2.2. The approval process must identify the final approval authority for new
           or changed procedures. The final approval authority ensures the procedure
           satisfies the operational requirement, is technically accurate, is in compliance with
           DoD and Air Force directives or instructions, and is formatted appropriately.
        8.3.2.3. All permanent procedures are maintained in the appropriate work center or
        issued to all personnel performing duties in the work center. No new or changed
        procedures will be used for operations until properly coordinated, approved and
        trained to crew members. A unit may recommend to the approving authority that the
        procedure be categorized as a Temporary Procedure (TP) pending final approval. In
        this case, the procedure must meet all TP requirements before implementation.
        8.3.2.4. Individuals have the responsibility to take actions necessary to ensure the
        procedure in use is accurate. Work centers will review procedures at least annually to
        ensure accuracy, currency, and mission applicability.
        8.3.2.5. Forward a copy of all approved permanent procedures and related training
        material to the unit providing system initial qualification training, as applicable.
        8.3.2.5. (14AF) OSOT must ensure that the applicable 381 TRG squadron receives
        copies of all related training material for permanent and long-term (6+ months)
        interim procedures within 30 days of receipt from the unit, as applicable. GSUs
        should forward all materials to their OSOT for forwarding to the applicable 381 TRG
        squadron.

         8.3.2.6. (Added-14AF) Numbering. Units will comply with the standardized
         checklist numbering scheme below. Start checklists in a series with the same series
         number. If there are two or more checklists in a series, identify them by placing a
         dash after the series number and sequentially numbering them (e.g., 3-1, 3-2). If a
         unit does not require a specific checklist series, do not use that series.

      8.3.3. Temporary Procedures. TPs are used to temporarily alter existing permanent
      procedures. Posted directly opposite the affected procedure, they are usually required to
      be implemented because of a unique mission requirement (e.g., to support system testing
      or to support a system engineering analysis requirement). They are seldom modified;
      instead, they are regenerated as a new TP and the previous version rescinded. TPs may
      be used to affect partial changes to permanent procedures until the procedure or page may
      be replaced in its entirety IAW paragraph 8.3.2.1.
         8.3.3.1. A Temporary Procedure Request (TPR) is the document used to implement a
         TP. Initially attached to the TP during the coordination process and prior to TP
         posting, the TPR includes the following information (at a minimum): posting and
         removal instructions, effective dates, issuing agency, and coordinating/approval
         agencies and signatures.
         8.3.3.1. (14AF) Temporary Procedure Request (TPR).           TPRs will address the
         following items as a minimum:
             8.3.3.1.1. (Added-14AF) Identify the procedure requiring change, to include
             proposed changes.
             8.3.3.1.2. (Added-14AF) Identify positions affected.
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                        35


           8.3.3.1.3. (Added-14AF) Identify any special training/evaluation required to
           implement the TP.
           8.3.3.1.4. (Added-14AF) Include an ORP tracking number.
           8.3.3.1.5. (Added-14AF) Identify affected checklists.
           8.3.3.1.6. (Added-14AF) TPRs will be maintained in a binder. TPRs may be
           kept in a combined CIF/TP binder.
           8.3.3.1.7. (Added-14AF) To reduce duplication of effort, an AFTO 22 request
           form may be used in lieu of the TPRs in the TP binder, provided that all
           information listed in paragraphs 8.3.3.1 through 8.3.3.1.6 is maintained along
           with it. Additional information may be in a separate document, such as an MFR,
           but must be readily accessible when reviewing the AFTO 22.
        8.3.3.2. There are three categories of TPs: emergency, urgent, and routine.
           8.3.3.2.1. Emergency. These require immediate action that, if not implemented,
           would result in a fatality or serious injury to personnel, extensive damage or
           destruction of equipment or property, or inability to achieve or maintain the
           mission.
           8.3.3.2.2. Urgent. These require action which, if not corrected, could cause one
           or more of the following: personnel injury; damage to equipment or property;
           reduce operational efficiency; or could jeopardize the safety or success of mission
           accomplishment.
           8.3.3.2.3. Routine. These require action that does not fall into the emergency or
           urgent categories. These are modifications to existing procedures that do not
           affect the overall process for completion, such as administrative changes.
        8.3.3.3. 14 AF develops requirements regarding the approval, coordination, and
        control of TPs.
        8.3.3.3. (14AF) The TP binder may include TPRs, TPs, and CIFs. Maintain an
        index identifying when the TP was posted, subsequent reviews, and when the TP was
        removed. Crewmembers will read all new or changed TPs prior to the end of the
        shift.
           8.3.3.3.1. At a minimum, the coordination process must ensure technical
           accuracy and training requirements, as required.
           8.3.3.3.2. All affected duty positions must be knowledgeable of and have access
           to a copy of the TPR and associated TP prior to performing duty in the weapon
           system or receipt of weapon system training.
        8.3.3.4. Units review open TPs for possible integration into permanent procedures.
        14 AF develops requirements for reviewing TPs, to include schedule, responsible
        agency and revocation and extension authorities. 14 AF may delegate this
        responsibility to the wings.
        8.3.3.4. (14AF) At a minimum, review TPs every 30 days for currency. Prior to the
        90th day, units will extend, rescind, or incorporate the TP actions into a permanent
36                                              AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010


         procedure. TPs may be extended beyond 90 days when special circumstances are
         warranted. Extensions must be approved in writing by the initial approval authority.
         The next higher approval authority approves TPs extended beyond 180 days. Rescind
         TPs after they are incorporated into permanent procedures.
     8.3.4. Supplemental Procedures. Supplemental procedures are used to amplify/augment
     existing permanent procedures without altering them. 14 AF develops procedures
     regarding the coordination and approval process for supplemental procedures.
     8.3.5. (Added-14AF) Approval Authority. The approval authority for temporary and
     permanent procedures is as follows:
         8.3.5.1. (Added-14AF) Squadron CCs determine the approval authority for
         procedures affecting only their unit.
         8.3.5.2. (Added-14AF) OG/CCs determine the approval authority for procedures
         affecting multiple units within the same group.
         8.3.5.3. (Added-14AF) Wing CCs determine the approval authority for procedures
         affecting multiple groups within the same wing.
         8.3.5.4. (Added-14AF) The 14 AF/A3 is the approval authority for procedures that
         affect more than one wing. The originating wing will coordinate the recommended
         procedure through other applicable wings and forward the coordinated package to 14
         AF/A3.
     8.3.6. (Added-14AF) Technical Orders shall only be updated and improved using
     revisions, changes and supplements to basics T.O.s IAW AFI 21-303, the 00-5 series
     T.O.s, and AFI 11-215. Units shall not make changes or corrections to T.O.s unless
     directed by official T.O. updates (either interim or formal).
  8.4. (Added-14AF) Operations Review Panel (ORP). The ORP proactively considers
  current and long-term factors affecting the organization’s ability to accomplish the mission,
  resulting in maximized mission effectiveness. The ORP ensures operations documentation is
  in place and tracks completion of applicable training and evaluation prior to implementing
  new or changed procedures.
     8.4.1. (Added-14AF) ORP Process. The ORP process is a means to formally
     coordinate items ensuring technical and operational accuracy, standardization of
     products, and consideration of applicable safety measures. Wings/groups and all
     subordinate units will establish ORP processes to review items appropriate to their level.
     Wings/groups may standardize these processes as necessary.
         8.4.1.1. (Added-14AF) Only personnel necessary to ensure technical and
         operational accuracy, standardization, and safety measures need review a specific
         item.
         8.4.1.2. (Added-14AF) The wing/group/squadron, as applicable, will identify and
         document the personnel necessary to coordinate on each ORP item.
         8.4.1.3. (Added-14AF) Coordinate the following items using the ORP process:
             8.4.1.3.1. (Added-14AF) New or changed mission requirements.
AFSPCI10-1202_14AFSUP_I 1 JUNE 2010                                                         37


            8.4.1.3.2. (Added-14AF) Operations procedures (e.g., TPs (added and
            rescinded), CIFs, checklists, pass-plan templates, etc.), if no other formal
            coordination process exists.
            8.4.1.3.3. (Added-14AF) Evaluation and training requirements/products, if no
            other formal coordination process exists.
        8.4.1.4. (Added-14AF) Other items may be included at the discretion of the ORP

                  14 AF/A3V ARC PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

A5.1. (14AF) In order to remain in good standing with 14 AF/A3V, 14 AF/A3V ARC
evaluators (Individual Mobilization Augmentee/Traditional Reserve/National Guard personnel)
assigned to 14 AF/A3V must perform a minimum of two inspections or conferences per calendar
year. Ideally, evaluators are expected to participate in visits that fall under their area(s) of
mission expertise.
   A5.1.1. (14AF) 14 AF/A3V will determine the specific visits evaluators are
   required/requested to attend based on current needs. These may include, but are not limited
   to, standardization and evaluation conferences, SETs, SAVs, IOAs, and Guardian Challenge.
   A5.1.2. (14AF) Failure to conform to minimum participation standards (which should not
   exceed minimum participation requirements for a ―good‖ year of service) may be cause for
   dismissal.
       A5.1.2.1. (14AF) Exceptions to Policy. Individual ARC personnel may request an
       exception to policy based on extenuating circumstances.
           A5.1.2.1.1. (14AF) Requests for exceptions to policy will be routed to 14 AF/A3V.
           Exceptions to policy will be considered on an individual basis and will be weighed
           against 14 AF/A3V’s mission requirements.
           A5.1.2.1.2. (14AF) An exception to policy will cover a maximum of one calendar
           year.
           A5.1.2.1.3. (14AF) Individuals seeking an exception to policy must be proactive.
           Requests must be made sufficiently early so that if 14 AF/A3V disapproves the
           request, the affected ARC member has sufficient time to meet annual participation
           requirements.
A5.2. (14AF) 14 AF/A3V ANG evaluators will report to, and be rated by, their ANG squadron
leadership.
