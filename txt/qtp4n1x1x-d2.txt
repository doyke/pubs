                                             INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assist
Otolaryngology Surgical Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the task. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each
subject area. Direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each
module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn
each step; some objectives may take more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to
ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is
ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as
you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately
in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas
needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module.
After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a certifier
should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will
meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them. The subject-matter-expert for writing and developing this QTP was:

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent
risk factors, and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
immediately and correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the
trainee dons all personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation
should be documented using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using
an approved substitute record.

                      APPLICATION OF METAL NASAL SPLINT                                            SAT    UNSAT
PREPARATORY PHASE
1. Review orders to determine splint requirements.
2. Gather needed supplies.
3. If in a clinical setting, greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient
    to relax as much as possible.
PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient as directed by physician.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury.
3. Cleanse and dry skin of nose thoroughly.
4. Apply alcohol prep pad to skin of nose and wait until completely dry. Prior to
applying the alcohol, ensure pt is not allergic to alcohol.
5. The physician will then manually express the edema from the skin. While this is
occurring, the technician will open the skin-prep package and pass it to the physician for
application to the nasal skin. The skin-prep will then be allowed to dry. While the
physician is applying the skin prep, the steri-strip material should be prepared. The first
strip should be approximately 1 ½ inches long. The strips should increase in size by
approximately ¼ of an inch each time. You will need approximately 6 strips.
6. The physician will then need the steri-strips. They should be passed to him starting
with the smallest strip first. Have the scissors ready in case the strips need trimming.
The strips will be applied in an overlapping pattern.
7. Pass the center pad to the physician. The pad will be placed directly over the dorsum
of the nose, on top of the paper tape strips. The pad should not touch the skin at any
point.
8. The adhesive loop section will be needed next. The technician will have this ready
and pass it to the physician. At this point the physician will remove the paper backing
from the adhesive side and apply this side to the paper tape on the nose. The adhesive
should not touch the skin.
9. The technician will now pass the metal hook segment of the cast to the physician who
will apply it hook side down. The splint will be molded to fit by the physician and
should not touch the skin.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around splint.
2. If in a clinical setting, ensure the patient is aware of splint care: The patient should be
    informed not to trim, wiggle, take off, or try to re-apply the splint if it falls off on its
    own. The patient should avoid contact with direct water flow, steam and sweat
    around/on the splinted area.
3. If in a clinical setting, ensure documentation of visit.
4. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.

2. Gather needed supplies.
3. If in a clinical setting, greet and explain the procedure to the patient. Help the patient

PERFORMANCE PHASE
1. Position patient as directed by physician.
2. Inspect skin for integrity/injury.
3. Cleanse and dry skin of nose thoroughly.
4. Apply alcohol prep pad to skin of nose and wait until completely dry. Prior to
applying the alcohol prep, ensure that the patient is not allergic to alcohol.
5. The physician will then manually express the edema from the skin. The technician
will have Mastisol open and ready for the physician when needed. The Mastisol will be
applied to the nasal skin by the physician and allowed to dry.
6. The physician will again express the edema from the nasal skin. At this point the
technician should have the ½ inch steri strip/paper tape material cut and ready for the
physician. The strips should start out at approximately 1 ½ inches long and should
increase in length each time about ¼ of an inch. You will need approximately 6 strips.
7. Pass the strips to the physician as needed. Have scissors ready in case trimming of
the strips is required. The physician will apply the strips in an overlapping pattern. This
is to ensure no skin comes in contact with the splint.
8. The technician will ready the foam tape for the physician. The tape should be cut in a
4-inch square. The tape and scissors (1 pt sharp or bandage scissors) will be passed to
the physician who will then cut the strip to the size/shape needed. At this point the
surgeon will apply the foam tape to the nasal skin. The technician should at this point
have the plaster cast strip cut to a 4 inch square. It is then immersed in the water. The
cast material will be passed to the physician after it becomes malleable.
9. The physician will trim the plaster splint material to correspond with the area to be
covered. The plaster should not contact the skin at any time. The splint should
harden/set in about 30-45 seconds.
FOLLOW-UP PHASE
1. Clean patient’s exposed skin around cast.
2. If in a clinical setting, ensure the patient is aware of splint care: The patient should
be informed not to trim, wiggle, take off, or try to re-apply the splint if it falls off. The
patient should avoid contact with direct water flow, steam and sweat in/on the splinted
area.
3. If in a clinical setting, ensure documentation of visit on an SF Form 600.
4. Discard used items and return unused items to storage.
