                                            Chapter 1
              INTRODUCTION TO THE MISSION TRAINING PROGRAM
1.1. General. The Mission Training Program (MTP) is an integral part of the overall command
and control (C2) training effort. The simulation program is designed to provide a spectrum of
training events to exercise individuals, single units, and multi-unit configurations in a high-
fidelity virtual battlespace. This realistic training program utilizes a combination of mission
training materials and a full scope of mission training events (MTEs).
1.2. Mission Materials. The training materials provide the weapons system and crews
information necessary for the unit personnel to perform their mission essential tasks. These
materials include contractor-generated, Department of Defense (DoD) generated, and unit-
generated products. Guidelines for the integration of mission materials into the execution of the
CRC functions are set forward in AFI 13-1CRC, Volume 3, Operating Procedures-Control and
Reporting Center and the applicable AF Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
1.3. Mission Training Requirements. The requirement for units to conduct an MTE is
specified in AFI 13-1MCS, Volume 1.
1.4. Simulation. The CRC simulation program is a means to provide effective training on the
mastery of key skill sets without the requirement of multiple live combat assets in the scenario.
The simulation events are broken into these basis areas:
    1.4.1. Individual Training. Training designed for individuals to achieve a proficiency level
to fulfill initial qualification training (IQT) and mission qualification training (MQT)
requirements standards set forth in AFI13-1MCSV1. Continuation training (CT) will enhance
and hone initial skills to achieve a maximum level of proficiency in preparedness for combat
    1.4.2. Single Internal Unit Training. Personnel or crews are trained in a simulated
operational environment to enhance cohesion and to refine coordination between the internal
crew members and the CRC supporting functions. The supporting communication system
architecture resides within the unit’s assigned assets for the distribution of radar communications
and simulation data.
    1.4.3. Multi-Unit External Training. The participating TACS elements and CAF aircraft
units train to perform as integrated force. The two major network backbones used to support
these complex simulation events are the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Network
(DMON) or the Joint Training Exercise Network (JTEN). MTEs should be conducted using the
Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) to the maximum extent possible.
    1.4.4. Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) is a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF)
directed readiness initiative to train warfighters. The DMO vision is to provide warfighters
routine in-garrison access to multiple, simultaneous, and large/small training or mission rehearsal
events within a true joint force environment while avoiding the traditional expense and
disruption of having to assemble assigned units and opposing forces for training at a common
and observable physical location. The primary objective underpinning DMO is enabling
warfighters to train as they would expect to fight, maximizing the combat realism available in
modern visually immersive simulators that cannot be replicated in expensive traditional live
training. DMO capability within the CRC will enable a mission crew, small teams, or
individuals to train in a stand-alone or networked mode with other DMO participants through a
full range of composite force employment options.
ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                           5

    1.4.5. Simulation events consist of virtual and constructive entities. Virtual entities use
actual weapons system operators in their MDS simulators. Constructive entities are simulated
entities that may or may not be actual operators using simulation models and communications to
replicate a participating platform or agency. Computer generated forces (CGF) are simulated
entities built within the constructive simulator that act as a self-adjusting force against the
trainer’s virtual entity.
1.5. Principles of Mission Training Events. MTEs are based on five well established
principles of learning.
    1.5.1. Function. Train as a functional section, complete operational crew or as an integrated
CRC. MTEs are sufficiently complex to allow realistic training regardless of the level of
participation. Each element can receive, process, and take action on all essential information
generally available within the platform.
    1.5.2. Realism. Simulate the real environment. In order to get maximum training, the
inputs, interactions, and outputs from the CRC must strive for realism. Realistic actions are
essential in order to maximize the transfer of training to actual operations. During MTEs,
personnel perform their functions just as they would in combat. The exercise “White Cell” team
will carefully observe and record crew performance.
    1.5.3. Stressors. Train the mission crew to operate under stress. The mission crew must be
trained to effectively handle a variety of stressful situations as well as to develop and keep a high
level of proficiency in operations execution and platform interface. Simulation of the battlespace
permits control of the Large Force Exercise (LFE) or contingency theater operations training
situations introduced to operations not normally met in day-to-day training.
    1.5.4. Feedback. Provide the participants with immediate knowledge of mission crew
performance in order to improve overall performance. Crew members being trained are
furnished feedback from the mission execution results. Detailed performance records are kept by
the exercise “White Cell” team to allow the exercise “White Cell” team to systematically assess
participation, identify specific problems, capture lessons learned, debrief the mission crew, and
provide positional trend analysis.
   1.5.5. Frequency. Exercise mission crews regularly and frequently. An effective MTP
requires that training events are held regularly and frequently. Operational personnel must have
continued practice in handling a variety of battle management situations if they are to develop
and maintain a high level of proficiency and flexibility in the use of operational skills and
procedures.
1.6. Categories of MTEs. These events are categorized by the number of participating units
and the level of effort within each unit. There are three categories of MTEs.
    1.6.1. Category I (CAT I). Training which exercises crew positions of a single unit (no
external participants/agencies). The scope may vary from positional training for a single section
to involvement of an entire operations crew.
    1.6.2. Category II (CAT II). Small scale DMO events interfacing the CRC with a DMO
capable weapons system to execute TTPs and focused mission type training. The MTE should
include operational data link with at least two data link capable units participating. CAT II could
be with some external agencies and doesn’t necessarily have to be in DMO.
6                                           ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008

        1.6.2.1. CRC’s distributed interface with a single weapons system (F-15, F-16, A-10,
etc).
        1.6.2.2. CRC to CRC/AWACS distributed interface for lateral unit TTP training.
       1.6.2.3. An example of specific type mission event would be reflected in CAS, CSAR,
TIC, Interdiction, and TST scenarios with the associated virtual weapons systems participating.
    1.6.3. Category III (CAT III). (Multiple external agencies usually on DMON or JTEN).
Large scale training exercises interfacing crews into a multi-unit distributed scenario. Every
DMO event using a distributed network will require a review and compliance with security
interface standards for the distributed network and interfacing weapons system. The MTE
should include an operational data link with at least two data link capable units participating.
The training emphasis is centered on accomplishing the interactions which are essential to CRC
operations, and must include interfacing with another element of the TACS. This should include
a higher headquarters element and at least one other Air Force or joint/combined service element
such as the U.S. Army’s Phased Array Tracking Intercept on Target (PATRIOT) Air Defense
Artillery (ADA) system. Units are required to participate in large scale joint exercises i.e.,
Virtual Flags (VFs), Fleet Synthetic Training-Joint (FST-J) events, Joint Kill Chain Events
(JKCEs), Warfighter Focused Events (WFEs), etc.

    2.4.3. Plan and develop simulation to maximize realistic training for operations participants.
    2.4.4. Coordinate with simulation operators and develop/execute the Master Scenario Events
List (MSEL). The MSEL is a collection of pre-scripted events intended to guide an exercise
toward specific outcomes. Joint exercises may require inputs entered with the Joint MSEL
(JMSEL). Joint Master Scenario Event List (JMSEL) is an automated system specifically
designed to assist in MSEL management. The JMSEL tool facilitates the work of Exercise
Planners and supports execution of exercises with simple, easy to use functions. JMSEL
provides a Web-based, Graphical User Interface (GUI) for developing and viewing the JMSEL
product data. An example of a unit based MTE MSEL is located at Attachment 6.

ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                         9

2.5. Exercise Director. The Exercise Director will:
   2.5.1. Supervise the overall conduct of all major scenario training events involving a full
mission crew.
   2.5.2. Lead the exercise team “White Cell” which includes simulation supervisor, simulation
operators and other personnel on the team providing notional entities or agencies to support the
exercise scenario.
   2.5.3. Plan and develop simulation scenarios to maximize realistic training for the mission
crew.
   2.5.4. Coordinate with exercise team personnel (White Cell) and develop/review MSEL.
   2.5.5. Provide dynamic inputs, as necessary, to enhance training objectives.
    2.5.6. Coordinate with Current Operations and/or the Maintenance Operation Center has
released equipment and the equipment is ready for use at STARTEX.
   2.5.7. Follow guidance stipulated in unit Operating Instructions (OIs) for Distributed
Mission Operations (if available).
    2.5.8. Coordinate with all units to ensure unit training objectives are implemented in the
simulation scenario and all internal/external units training objectives are understood to maximize
training for all exercise participants (CAT II & CAT III).
   2.5.9. Ensure MTE objectives are met prior to ENDEX.
   2.5.10. Ensure an After Action Report is produced in accordance with Attachment 4 and
submitted through channels to HQ ACC/A3YG NLT ten working days following the end of an
exercise.
2.6. Exercise Development. MTEs are based on a library of exercise materials that provide
realistic training documentation and scenarios. As training requirements are identified, exercises
may be developed and added to the ACC MTE library.
    2.6.1. After the successful evaluation of a scenario, newly created scenario builds, with
“Smart Pack” materials, should be submitted to the ACC/A3YG via SIPRnet
(acc.doyg@langley.af.smil.mil) for posting to ACC/A3TO website for all CSP equipped units to
access and use.
       2.6.1.1. Existing MTE scenarios from the ACC/A3TO website library will not be
changed. If an existing scenario is changed, it must be renamed and saved with appropriate
support information (i.e., smart packs and briefing materials) and submitted to ACC/A3YG to be
loaded on the SIPRnet website for CAF-wide use.
        2.6.1.2. AF Doctrine Document 1-1, Leadership and Force Development, discusses the
development of Mission Essential Tasks (METs) and Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs)
using the AF Task List (AFTL). The AFTL defines tasks and illustrates the relationship between
the AFTL, METLs, Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMETL), and the Universal Joint Task
List (UJTL). The JMETLs are defined in the initial planning phase of each joint exercise. ACC
has a corresponding Task List supporting the AFTLs. It is important to understand the CRC
METLs (along with the associated ACC task list number) when participating in joint exercises to
express the activities needed to support CRC training. Joint exercise planners understand that
10                                           ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008

METLs are not a wish list but a service requirement to support within the joint exercise warfare.
The other services will express their METLs as a documented warfighting requirement. Joint
units will not participate if too few METLs are not supported since it is not an effective
environment in which to train.
   2.6.2. Squadron developed scenarios can also be loaded onto SIPRnet server (mentioned
above) for all units to use. A README file should accompany the scenario which lists the
AOR, TACS structure, a brief description of the scenario, track load, red/blue force breakout and
applicable “smart pack” information.
    2.6.3. The simulation supervisor will ensure the MTE scenario file selected is adapted by the
CRC simulation system administrator to build/configure appropriate sub-systems files and ensure
a corresponding operations module database is configured and saved for the mission.
   2.6.4. DOW will load or have on file applicable MTE “Smart Pack” mission materials for
crew use.
2.7. Exercise Conduct. There are three phases in the conduct of an exercise: planning,
execution, and assessment.
    2.7.1. Exercise Planning. A large part of the planning process is to determine the CRC
mission essential competencies (MEC) to be demonstrated within the MTE prior to the start of
the simulation exercise. MECs are the DMO higher-order individual, team, and inter-team
competencies that fully prepare the crew for successful mission completion under adverse
conditions and in a non-permissive environment. They are demonstrated in the context of a
high-fidelity simulated mission, under wartime conditions. During the exercise, training
emphasis may be placed on either the functional interaction of the participating elements or the
reactions to changing situations within the individual units. Also, commanders may emphasize
specific parts of an exercise to determine strengths and/or weaknesses, and to identify areas
requiring additional training. The planning phase of exercise implementation requires that
exercise personnel at all echelons check MTE ATO, ACO, TACOPDAT, OPTASKLINK, EOB,
OPLANs/OPORDs, Air Tasking Orders (ATOs), and/or the exercise description in detail to
make sure they understand the exercise content, objectives, and requirements. Thorough pre-
exercise briefings are an integral part of the planning phase. Prior to the exercise, simulation
personnel will be briefed on the training objectives and MSEL for the dynamically generated or
scripted stress situations to be injected into the exercise. Refer to Attachment 6 for an example
stress input sheet.
    2.7.2. Exercise Execution. All essential elements of the exercising platforms will either
actively participate (virtual element) or be simulated (computer generated force). For effective
training, unit personnel must execute the exercise in the same manner in which they would
operate in combat. The training benefits derived from high-fidelity simulations are directly
related to the willingness and ability of simulation personnel to inject realism into MTE play.
For unit personnel to receive top benefit from an MTE, it is necessary for the White Cell to be
familiar with the agencies/positions they are simulating and to be as realistic as possible when
employing simulation techniques. Sim drivers must be encouraged to respond and react as if
under real combat operations. The simulated environment must draw responses, reactions, and
activities from the participants that are identical to an actual combat environment and requires
strong command level support.
ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                        11

    2.7.3. Exercise Assessment. Exercise assessment is a program for measuring operational
effectiveness in each functional area and the crew as a whole in mission execution. Data will be
collected by each element that takes part in an exercise. The exercise debriefing log or any
automated tracking program will be used to record data. Proper assessment of the data collected
during exercises will serve as a basis for identifying execution trends, deficiencies, operational
weaknesses, and other areas that need more training. Post-exercise debriefings, attended by key
simulation team personnel, are used during the exercise assessment phase as a means for
identifying those areas that need more training.
   2.7.4. Exercise Conduct. The briefing, conduct, and debriefing are the three required
functions to support the training requirements for an MTE to advance MEC skills and
knowledge.

                  MTE AT THE CONTROL AND REPORTING CENTER
3.1. General. The MTE provides a way to train unit personnel, and may be conducted either
independently or in conjunction with other elements of the TACS and Combat Air Forces (CAF).
Through the repetitive use of MTEs, simulated scenarios are set up in a realistic interactive
environment that develops the skills of airmen to execute flawlessly without hesitation in
situations likely to be encountered in real tactical operations. Personnel taking part in these
MTEs must have a clear understanding of their duties.
3.2. Training Objectives. The training objectives for the CRC MTEs are to:
     3.2.1. Execute MECs effectively in a Joint Tactical Air Operations (JTAO) battlespace.
   3.2.2. Provide training in the collection, transmission, receipt and processing of operational
and intelligence reports.
    3.2.3. Direct the decentralized execution of air operations, to include both defensive and
offensive mission activities.
     3.2.4. Perform weapons and control functions, as directed by the AOC/CRC.
    3.2.5. Conduct the collection, display, evaluation, and reporting/telling of air surveillance
information.
    3.2.6. Coordinate and interface the identification function with other operations elements in
the accomplishment of the classification function.
   3.2.7. Coordinate defensive actions through the Army Air Defense Artillery Fire Control
Officer (ADAFCO) to the associated ADA Fire Direction Center (FDC).
  3.2.8. Interpret and publish supplemental prearranged Operational Data (OPDAT) in US
Message Text Format (USMTF).
    3.2.9. Provide link interface training of both internal and external circuits in the execution of
the OPTASKLINK).
     3.2.10. Exercise the processing and exchange of the simulated link data.
    3.2.11. Provide training in the establishment and maintenance of an effective digital data air
picture and emphasizing airspace control in an automated environment.
3.3. MTE Scheduling. The ACS Director of Operations (DO) is ultimately responsible for the
scheduling of all MTEs. The DO may delegate MTE scheduling duties to the Operation Plans
and Exercises (DOX) branch. Units will use the Integrated Training Initiative (ITI) Virtual
Events Scheduling Tool (VEST) to schedule participation in DMO events. The intermediate
headquarters when necessary will assist in the coordination and support for the units during
larger virtual exercises if needed.
3.4. Mission Crew Leader Responsibilities. The mission crew leader (usually MCC, SD or
ASO) is responsible for preparing their crew to complete the MTEs using the briefing and
debriefing guides.
ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                          13

3.5. Simulation Team (White Cell) Responsibilities. The team is to portray the various
external agencies and information sources that, for reason of practicality or economy, do not
actively take part in the MTE.
   3.5.1. The team coordinates requirements and actions among the exercise participants.
Members are selected for their knowledge and experience in the areas and functions to be
simulated.
   3.5.2. The team, under the guidance of the Simulation Supervisor (for smaller training
events) or the Exercise Director (for larger or full crew training events), should plan and execute
a MSEL in order to facilitate the flow of events while ensuring all training objectives are being
accomplished in an efficient manner.
   3.5.3. Prior to beginning a MTE, the team members assume their positions and check their
equipment and communications for proper operation. Following the exercise, the simulation
team collects and passes all pertinent information obtained in the event to the Simulation
Supervisor or the Exercise Director.
    3.5.4. All simulation team members will familiarize themselves with unit OIs for DMO prior
to the event (if available).
3.6. Exercise Simulation. External agency simulation consists of those inputs that would
normally be received from non-participating agencies. The following list describes the functions
of some of the external agencies that may be simulated. (Not all inclusive)
    3.6.1. ADA weapons simulation provides for the input of Army air defense weapons status
information. (ADA units normally participate during joint exercises.)
   3.6.2. Pilot simulation is performed on the Instructor Operator Stations (IOSs) with the
simulation drivers realistically responding to Weapons Director (WD) instructions.
    3.6.3. Wing Operations Center (WOC) simulation personnel will perform those functions
normally done by the operations staff at various air base WOCs. The simulation team will
normally perform all WOC functions during MTEs. During WFEs and VFs, a White Force cell
at 705 CTS, Distributive Mission Operations Center (DMOC) or other distributed locations can
provide WOC simulation for the exercise.
    3.6.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation involves interaction between non-TACS ATC
agencies such as control towers, Federal Aviation Administration/International Civil Aviation
Organization (FAA/ICAO) centers, radar approach control (RAPCON), and other facilities
which process flight data. In some instances, multi-user Internet Chat Relay (i.e., mIRC, IWS,
etc) or any instant messaging system may be used.
3.7. Briefings and Debriefings. MTE briefings and debriefings will be conducted IAW the
procedures described in this instruction and AFI 13-1MCS Volume 3, Attachments 3 and 4. The
MTE crew briefing format (Attachment 2) and debriefing leader techniques (Attachment 3) are
found in this instruction.

                                            Chapter 4
                              BRIEFINGS AND DEBRIEFINGS
4.1. Introduction. The importance of MTE briefings and debriefings cannot be
overemphasized. They are an excellent means of disseminating information to MTE participants
and of providing post-exercise analysis and results. Briefings are conducted to review training
requirements and objectives. The briefing provides the staff and participants with essential
exercise data, establishes the environment, and outlines the procedures used to conduct the
events. Debriefings are used to assist the participants in improving mission execution
performance. The debriefing enables individuals to better understand and more effectively
perform their own tasks.
4.2. Briefing Objectives. Briefings should provide personnel with:
      --A summary of the political and military developments surrounding the event scenario.
(can be conducted by assigned intelligence personnel if available)
     --An opportunity to review operational problem areas and new procedures recommended
during previous debriefings.
     --Necessary information concerning the status of both friendly and enemy forces.
     --Equipment status which would affect conduct of the event.
4.3. Briefing Types. Prior to an MTE, the following briefings will normally be conducted. The
complexity of the training event will influence the degree of detail introduced into each briefing.
   4.3.1. MTE Planning Briefing. The planning briefing is normally the initial briefing and is
conducted to determine the scope of the MTE and simulation team requirements. It is usually
conducted by the Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director with the support of the Squadron’s
DOX (Plans/Exercise) Branch.
    4.3.2. MTE Briefing. The briefing is conducted by designated personnel and includes
pertinent information required for the conduct of the event. Information contained in the
OPLAN/OPORD, ATO, and status messages are a few sources used by personnel to prepare
these briefings. Formats for briefings vary and will generally be arranged to suit the briefer and
audience as well as to satisfy the briefing objectives. The contents for each of the briefings can
be found in Attachment 2 of this instruction.
    4.3.3. CAF or Joint Pre-Exercise Briefing. A conference call connecting key personnel of
the participating CAF elements/joint service units will normally be scheduled prior to the
exercise in order to obtain pre-exercise status information and resolve conflicts regarding
exercise preparation. Some joint exercises (those exercises inherently large in scope) may hold
an Initial Planning Conference (IPC), Mid Planning Conference (MPC) and conclude with a
Final Planning Conference (FPC) to ensure requirements are properly articulated and understood
before exercise execution.
4.4. Debriefing Objectives. Debriefings should provide an environment in which MTE
participants can:
   4.4.1. Obtain and provide accurate and complete information. The individual participant
may only focus on part of the overall mission execution, and frequently does not know how
ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                          15

individual actions affect the overall mission crew performance. Thus, the individual participant
may not accurately judge the cause of mission execution failures.
       4.4.1.1. Simulation Team Presentation. The simulation team presentation (conducted by
the Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director) provides simulation “truth data” to accurately
provide information about the performance of the entire mission crew. The team will provide
supporting information about situations and actions observed by the simulation team during
mission execution.
        4.4.1.2. Informal Discussion. Informal discussion by participants allows all pertinent
facts about the mission to be made available.
    4.4.2. Identify Problems. Conduct a careful investigation and review of the facts pertaining
to mission execution to identify the actual operator difficulties that may have caused the
problems during execution.
    4.4.3. Examine Operational Procedures. Ensure that participants understand their
responsibilities and how their actions, in coordination with others, can best contribute to the
desired results.
   4.4.4. Solve Problems. If the problem is the result of inadequate MTE procedures, new
procedures can be developed. All participants will be aware of the proposed solutions.
4.5. Debriefing. Debriefings are conducted in mass. All event participants will take part in the
single mass debriefing. At the conclusion of the mass debrief, sections (i.e. Weapons,
Surveillance, or Technicians) may depart to a smaller setting to debrief section specific items if
needed. In addition, during joint exercises or other large scale distributed events, a mass post-
exercise conference call or Video Teleconference (VTC) debriefing will normally be scheduled.
4.6. Debriefing Procedures. The following procedures will apply to debriefing.
    4.6.1. Scheduling. The debriefing will be held as soon as possible after the exercise
terminates. The debriefing maybe delayed to support data collection requirements. Debriefings
should not be delayed longer than 24 hours.
      4.6.1.1. The debriefing leader (usually the MCC, SD or ASO) is responsible for the
conduct of the debriefing.
    4.6.2. Participants. The debriefing participants should include all personnel actively
engaged in the exercise, including the Simulation Supervisor, Exercise Director and Simulation
Team. As a minimum, the Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director must take part. The
Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director may excuse certain simulation team members from
the debriefing however the Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director is responsible for
obtaining debriefing comments from the excused personnel to share with.
   4.6.3. Key personnel from participating units should take part in debriefings for DMO
exercises.
   4.6.4. Presentations.
       4.6.4.1. Presentation by Debriefing Leader. The debriefing leader begins with a general
review of the mission objectives and the overall performance, including any special or unique
elements of the exercise which will be discussed later in the debriefing.
16                                            ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008

        4.6.4.2. Presentation by Simulation Supervisor or Exercise Director. The Simulation
Supervisor or Exercise Director presents the mission reports and other information. The report
describes what occurred, but avoids evaluation and speculation. Simulation team personnel
should avoid further participation unless called upon. Detailed discussion by participants usually
is not encouraged at this time, although questions and requests for clarification are allowed.
        4.6.4.3. Presentations by Other Leaders. Leaders or supervisors of the various sections
or elements report on the performance of their operations, including problems that occurred
within the sections/elements as well as difficulties in coordination with other sections/elements.
As problems are brought up, the debriefing leader decides whether a general discussion should
take place or be postponed until reports from all sections/elements have been completed.
    4.6.5. Discussion. Under the guidance of the debriefing leader, the information provided by
the simulation team and the section/element reports provides the basis for discussion by
participants. The discussion centers on isolating problems, identifying actual causes, and
suggesting solutions. The debriefing leader makes sure that all participants understand the
factual information and recommended solutions that are discussed. The leader guides the
discussion, maintaining the informal problem-solving atmosphere necessary to useful debriefing.
    4.6.6. Conclusion. In concluding the debriefing, the leader summarizes the problems
identified and the proposed solutions. The debriefing leader ensures that this information is
documented IAW Attachment 4. If any of the problems or proposed solutions requires further
investigation before implementation, the leader will ensure an MTE debriefing log (Attachment
5) is completed or the information is entered in approved computer program data bases and
assign an appropriate individual the responsibility for follow-up activity.

                          DEBRIEFING LEADER TECHNIQUES
A3.1. This attachment provides the debriefing leader with a list of recommended techniques that
may be used to facilitate group discussion. By following this guide, the result should be a more
effective MTE debriefing.
A3.1.1. Control the debriefing, but do not dominate the discussion in such a way as to prevent
other people from contributing their ideas.
A3.1.2. Encourage a problem solving atmosphere in which all participants objectively discuss
the exercise events instead of defending their own actions or casting blame on others.
A3.1.3. Focus the discussion on the identification and solution of significant problems.
A3.1.4. Discourage repetitious discussion of minor difficulties or problems beyond the control
of the participants.
A3.1.5. Encourage all participants, especially the hesitant or less experienced members, to speak
when they have pertinent facts, questions, or ideas to offer.
A3.1.6. Do not allow the more experienced members to dominate the discussion.
A3.1.7. Review identified problem areas and proposed solutions at the conclusion of the
debriefing.
A3.1.8. Assign responsibility for any required follow-up action.

MEMORANDUM FOR ACC A3YG
ATTN: XXXX XXXXXXX
FROM: XXX ACS/DOE
SUBJECT: After Action Report, CAT III MTE 11 June 07, 1-07 Segments 1A & 3, Participants
XXXrd ACS & XXXrd ACS.
A4.1. Training Objectives.
A4.1.1. Effective Initial Qualification Training for Surveillance Technicians and Weapons
Directors and Air Weapons Officers.
A4.1.2. Accomplish all scheduled positional evaluations.
A4.1.3. Effective Simulation Team through providing accurate information about system and
crew performance in presentations.
A4.1.4. Effectively set up under field conditions at deployed location.
A4.1.5. Pre Briefing, Execution Briefing and Debriefing accomplished IAW ACCI 13-1MTP
A4.1.7. Effective Simulation cells, including AOC, and pilots.
A4.2. Training Goals Obtained. Overall the XXX met our training goals. There was effective
flow of information throughout each unit and into the Command Post. Communications were a
problem initially, but were operational for 75% of the exercise and data links were operational
for 75% of the exercise. 100% of Operations personnel present were on position for at least one
MTE. The Simulation cell and maintenance branch did an outstanding job.
A4.3. Standards and Evaluations Goals Obtained: XXXrd ACS: 4 IQE, 0 RQE, 0 Spot
Evaluations, 0 SEE
A4.4. Exercise Observations.
A4.4.1. Subject: MTE fidelity circuit testing
A4.4.1.1. Discussion: On Friday 10 June, the fidelity check for the MTE was never and
specified this in the tasking message.
A4.4.1.2. Lesson Learned: Allow more time for testing when deploying in the field. The
tasking message did not specify on-site testing times for the units. This needs to be specified in
the tasking message and clearly communicated to all sections during the pre-MTE conference
calls.
A4.4.1.3. Recommendation: Allow more time for testing when deploying in the field. Ensure
the exercise tasking letter specifies the onsite and offsite testing times, and ensure everyone
agrees to it, during the pre-MTE conference calls.
A4.4.1.4. Follow Up POC: Capt. XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX
A4.4.2. Subject:
ACCI13-1MTPVOLUME 1 19 NOVEMBER 2008                                                          27

A4.4.2.1. Discussion: The ATO did not correlate with segment 3 on our HD.
A4.4.2.2. Lesson Learned: We pre-tested segment 1 and the ATO correlated. However we
never pre-tested Segment 3. We need to pre-test the segment we intend to use prior to the MTE.
A4.4.2.3. Recommendation: Pre-test all segments prior to the MTE. Follow up with other units
and ACC to determine if there is an accurate ATO for this segment.
A4.4.2.4. Follow Up POC: Capt. XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX
A4.4.3. Subject: Crew Briefing.
A4.4.3.1. Discussion: There was no briefing prior to the second MTE event for Segment 3
(post hostilities). This cause confusion within the crew, especially with the ID of hostile aircraft.
A4. 4.3.2. Lesson Learned: Either brief both segments before we go on position, or preferably
allow more time between scenario runs to allow for separate crew briefs.
A4.4.3.3. Recommendation: Allow more time between MTE segments runs for a separate
briefing.
A4.4.3.4. Follow Up POC: MCC, ASO, SD, Capt. XXXXX, MTPO DSN XXX-XXX
A4.5. Training impact: The overall training value for this exercise was excellent. Mission
planning was effective and units were in constant contact throughout the months leading up to
this MTE. Required information was effectively passed between the OM’s and the Command
Post and the participating units. This allowed all units to effectively train at all positions.
A4.6. CRC Simulation Critique: Review all aspects of the exercise areas and critique each
area IAW Attachment 7. Through good feedback the exercise, exercise materials and
performance can be improved to meet the operational requirement.
