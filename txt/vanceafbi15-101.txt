1.1. General. The 71st Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (71 OSS/OSW) and the
26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) at Barksdale AFB LA, per separate Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA 15-01) between the 26 OWS and the 71 OSS, are responsible for providing
all weather support to the 71st Flying Training Wing (71 FTW) at Vance AFB OK. Weather
support includes, but is not limited to, 24-hour meteorological watch with regular dissemination
of weather observations and forecasts, aircrew briefings, exercise/contingency support, and staff
briefings. Weather support is customer tailored to meet the criteria important to flying
operations, base support, and resource protection.

1.3. Station Duty hours. Staff services are generally available from 0630L to 1530L, Monday
through Friday (except federal holidays). Weather forecasters are on duty from 0300L until
airfield closure, Monday through Friday, and augmented observations (when necessary) are
generally transmitted from 0500L until airfield closure. On Sunday, the weather station will open
two hours prior to airfield opening, unless inclement weather justifies opening earlier. Sunday’s
augmented observations are taken two hours prior to airfield opening through airfield closure.
When necessary, the WF hours will be adjusted to coincide with airfield operating hours. The 26
OWS provides METWATCH for Vance AFB during non-duty hours and initiates a recall,
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                          7

through the 71 FTW Command Post (CP), of the Severe Weather Action Team forecaster in the
event of severe weather.

1.4. Supported Mission Overview. The mission of the 71 FTW is to conduct Joint Specialized
Undergraduate Pilot Training for Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and International NATO
students. The 71 FTW operates approximately 200 T-1, T-6 and T-38 aircraft. 71 FTW flying
operations cover the entire CONUS, but the majority of flying training is centered in the south
central US.

1.5. Concept of Operations.

1.5.1. The 71 OSS Weather Flight (WF) is the single point of contact for weather information at
Vance AFB and will provide and/or arrange for weather information to all supported agencies for
the purpose of operational and planning decisions and for the protection of base resources. The
71 FTW/CP serves as a 24-hour point of contact during weather station closure. The WF
leverages the support of the 26 OWS for forecasting services, meteorological watch, resource
protection, and transient aircrew flight weather briefings. The WF tailors this information, when
possible, to the specific needs of supported agencies. Mission forecasting, airfield observing, and
staff weather services are provided on a limited basis, based on airfield hours. Weather services
are normally provided for military or military-related operational use only. Release of weather
information to non-military or government sources must be coordinated through 71 FTW Public
Affairs Office.

1.5.2. Weather flight duty priorities. These duty priorities will be followed by personnel on duty
at the 71 OSS Weather Flight, now referred to as the Weather Flight (WF). Weather personnel
will use judgment in complying with these priorities, especially when there is imminent danger
to life and/or property.

1.5.3. Local dissemination refers to weather observations, forecasts, watches, advisories, and
warnings that are sent to base agencies via the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) and/or the New
Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS). Due to station manning, the volume of telephone traffic into
the WF, and the time-critical nature of weather information, agencies which have the JET/N-TFS
software on their computers, are expected to use them to their fullest potential prior to contacting
the WF for weather data.
(Note: JET is scheduled to become the primary system for automated dissemination of
weather information, but N-TFS will continue to operate in conjunction with JET until
JET becomes the single source for dissemination. Therefore, any further references to JET
in this document should also account for the use of N-TFS until such period.)

1.6. Terms Explained

1.6.1. Basic Weather Watch (BWW) – During normal airfield operating hours, a BWW is
normally conducted from the weather unit by weather personnel who, because of other weather
operations duties, cannot monitor the weather continuously. Due to these other weather duties,
weather personnel on duty may not detect and report all weather changes as they occur. The
BWW observing program has been implemented to establish the minimum requirements needed
to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained.

1.6.1.1. During BWW, weather personnel will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to
exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI
observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to
occur within 1 hour.


Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet
Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet
Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters)
Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters)
Precipitation (any form)
Fog or mist


In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert for any
other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation. Weather personnel
will also monitor local area observational and forecast products as often as necessary to keep
abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.

1.6.2. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) – CWW is a program where qualified non-weather
personnel assist the weather forecaster in monitoring weather conditions for the occurrence of
previously unreported weather conditions which could affect flight safety or be critical to the
safety or efficiency of local operations/resources. At Vance AFB, a CWW is in effect between
the WF and Control Tower. The RAPCON, all Flying/Fighter Training Squadrons, and Security
Forces should also report significant weather information to the WF. Upon reception of the data,
the WF will re-evaluate for possible inclusion into observations or watches/warnings/advisories.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                          9
1.6.3. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) – METWATCH is a deliberate process for
monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a
METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from
forecast conditions and determining courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or
group of products and designated agencies notified. Strategic and Operational level weather units
typically conduct METWATCH activities.

1.6.4. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) – METAR is a routine scheduled
observation as well as the primary observation code used by the United States to satisfy
requirements for reporting surface meteorological data. METAR contains a complete report of
wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather and obscurations, sky condition,
temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting collectively referred to as “the body of the report.”
In addition, encoded and/or plain language information that elaborates on data in the body of the
report may be appended to the METAR. The contents of the remarks will vary according to the
mode of operation (i.e. manual, automated, or augmented.) Scheduled METAR observations
taken hourly are called record observations.

1.6.5. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) – SPECI is an unscheduled
observation completed and transmitted when special weather criteria are observed at manual
observing stations, or determined by sensor equipment at automated stations. SPECI
observations contain all data elements found in a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates
on data in the body of the report. SPECI observations are prepared and transmitted as soon as
possible after the relevant criteria are observed or sensed.

1.6.6. Prevailing Visibility – The greatest visibility equaled or exceeded throughout at least one-
half the horizon circle. The visibility does not have to be continuous throughout 180 consecutive
degrees; i.e., it may be composed of sectors distributed anywhere around the horizon circle.

1.6.7. Sector Visibility – The visibility in a specified direction representing a 45-degree arc of
the horizon circle.

1.6.8. Surface Visibility – The prevailing visibility determined from the official point of
observation. It normally represents a value observed at a height of six feet above ground level.

1.6.9. Tower Visibility – The visibility determined from the control tower when the surface
visibility is determined from another location, such as the weather station.

1.6.10. Ceiling – The height above the earth’s surface of the lowest cloud layer reported as
broken or overcast; or the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling.

1.6.11. Indefinite Ceiling – The vertical visibility, measured in feet, into a surface based total
obscuration which hides the entire celestial dome.

1.6.12. MISSIONWATCH (Mission Meteorological Watch) – MISSIONWATCH is a deliberate
process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment for specific mission-limiting
environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH process identifies and alerts decision-makers to
changes affecting mission success.
10                                        VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010
1.6.13. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) – Mission tailored environmental information
describing a specific impact to an operational mission. WFs conduct deliberate forecast
processes to develop, deliver, monitor and amend mission execution forecasts by fusing
perishable data with operational and strategic level weather forecast products into decision
quality information for an operational end user. See A2 for an example of the Vance MEF.

1.6.14. TAF Code – Used by weather forecasters to encode expected forecast conditions in a
standardized format. The Operational Weather Squadrons (OWSs) and other applicable AFW
units issue TAFs based on the USAF coding found in AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes,
and practices of the WMO Aerodrome Forecast Code, FM 51, which is based on the METAR
code in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. See A3 for examples of encoded
TAFs.

1.6.15. UTC – Coordinated Universal Time. Worldwide standard time reference, also known as
Z (ZULU) time. At Vance AFB, UTC time is Local Standard Time plus 6 hours (during Daylight
Savings Time, plus 5 hours).

1.6.16. Weather Advisory (WA) – A special product notifying an end user when an established
environmental condition effecting operations is occurring or is expected to occur.

1.6.17. Observed Weather Advisory (OWA) – A weather advisory issued when a particular
weather event first occurs and the customer does not require advanced notification of the
observed weather phenomenon.

1.6.18. Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA) – A weather advisory issued when the customer
requires advance notification of an impending weather condition with sufficient time to allow for
protective actions.

1.6.19. Weather Watch (WATCH) – A special notice to notify operational commanders of a
potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property.
Weather Watches indicate a potential for environmental threats and are used by operational
commanders to make force protection and risk management decisions.

1.6.20. Weather Warning (WW) – A special notice to notify operational commanders when an
established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is occurring
or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining environmental
threats and are used by operational commanders to make force protection decisions.

1.6.21. Desired Lead-Time (DLT) – The amount of advance notice a supported agency desires
before the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.

1.6.22. Issue Time – The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory.
When more than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified.
Follow-up notifications are not considered when determining issue time.

1.6.23. Valid Time (VT) – The time in which a weather watch, warning, or advisory is in effect.
The start time of the VT is when the phenomenon is expected to first occur. The end time of the
VT is when the phenomenon is expected to cease and no longer occur.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                          11
1.6.24. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) – Actions taken by a weather unit to
enhance the unit’s response capability during a severe weather event. Actions include, but are not
limited to, recalling personnel or reallocating resources from other tasks to provide focused
support during a severe weather event.

1.6.25. Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) – One or more weather personnel on duty during
severe weather. The 26 OWS is inherently part of the Severe Weather Action Team and interacts
with the Vance CP and the WF to facilitate timely notification to supported units and to assist
with management of severe weather.

1.6.26. Longline Communications – Communication circuits that deliver weather products for
distribution to worldwide users. Weather products (TAFs, observations, PIREPs, etc.) are
typically encoded differently for longline and local transmissions.

1.6.27. Local Communications – Communication circuits that deliver weather products to users
on Vance AFB only. Weather products (TAFs, observations, PIREPs, etc.) are typically encoded
differently for longline and local transmissions.

1.6.28. Pilot Report (PIREP) – A report of in-flight weather by an aircrew member. See A3 for
an example of a PIREP.

1.6.29. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) – The computer system and associated interfaces that
provide an automated weather support and communications capability to the WF.

1.6.30. Actual Lead-time – The elapsed time between issue time of an advisory or warning and
the first occurrence of the event.

1.6.31. Climatology – The historical records of weather conditions measured or observed at a
specific location is known as climatology. Some data goes back over 100 years, but generally a
10- to 25-year history is more common. Climatology is useful in planning operations beyond 5 to
7 days. It usually describes the average (or mean) conditions such as high and low temperatures
and extremes.

1.6.32. Cloud Cover – The amount of clouds over, or at, a given location. Cloud conditions are
expressed as cloud bases or ceiling, the amount of cover stated in eighths--1/8 to 2/8 is few, 3/8
to 4/8 described as scattered; 5/8 to 7/8, broken; and 8/8, overcast, and cloud tops. Several layers
of scattered clouds added together may result in a broken or overcast condition.

1.6.33. Weather Flight (WF) – An umbrella term covering any military weather organization
tailoring operational and strategic level weather products and providing decision-quality
environmental information for an operational user’s military decision-making processes. In
addition to designated weather units, (OSS weather flights, Weather Detachments and
Squadrons, Air National Guard Weather Flights), specialized sections in an OWS (flight weather
briefing or contingency cell), Air Operations Center of AFWA also operate as WFs.

1.6.34. Eyes Forward – WF forecasters are the eyes forward for the forecasters in the OWS and
integrate weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection readouts, and
non-standard weather data systems (vertical profilers, mesonet data, etc.) to create an integrated

weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the OWS. Eyes forward yields meaningful
meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the servicing OWS and is an
integral part of the meteorological watch for an installation or contingency operating location.

1.6.35. Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) – A notice containing information concerning the
establishment, condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard,
the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.

1.6.36. Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) – An organization comprised of management,
technician, and training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their
mission is to produce fine-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to customers
within their area of responsibility (AOR).

1.6.37. Wind Shear – The rate of change of wind velocity (speed or direction) with distance.
Eddies and gusts form in areas of wind shear, thus producing turbulent flying conditions. Wind
shear may occur in either the vertical or horizontal plane.

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Weather forecasters take weather observations from the official point of
observation hourly and when specific regulatory and locally established thresholds are met (see
paragraph 2.4). The official point of observation is located approximately 50 feet from the west
side of Building 155, at the end of the sidewalk near the flight line. There are no longer
dedicated weather observers in the WF. Therefore, forecasters perform observing duties and
may simultaneously also carry out forecasting and/or briefing duties.

2.1.1. The WF will back-up an observation if a particular element is missing that the FMQ-19
normally reports (i.e. wind data, visibility, present weather elements, sky cover up to 24,999 feet
AGL, temperature, dew point, altimeter setting, remarks (e.g. WSHFT), and additive data).
Although some of the following phenomena are within the capabilities of the FMQ-19 to report,
due to sound Operational Risk Management practices, back-up is considered mandatory at Vance
AFB during airfield open hours: when a warning/advisory is valid for Vance AFB (except
crosswinds and turbulence) or any weather element deemed operationally significant is
present, but reported inaccurately by the FMQ-19 (i.e. sky condition reported as “CLR”
when a deck at 010 is approaching).

2.1.2. If a weather phenomenon is occurring that the FMQ-19 does not have the capability to
report, then supplementing is required. It is mandatory for observers to supplement the following
weather phenomena and take a SPECI (if occurring outside of METAR ob window): (IAW
AFMAN 15-111, Table 3.1) Funnel Cloud (Tornadic Activity), Hail ≥ ½” (begins or ends),
Volcanic Ash, and Snow Depth

2.2. SPECI Observation Criteria. Single element (versus full element) SPECI observations
will only be taken when a delay in reporting all elements of the SPECI observation would cause
an immediate threat to life or property (e.g., tornadic and volcanic activity). The AOS (FMQ-19)
or during augmentation, the forecaster, will take and disseminate the following special weather
observations:

2.3. Observing Limitations.

2.3.1. Vance AFB weather forecasters function under the Basic Weather Watch (BWW) and
Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) concept. Due to other essential duties, the forecaster cannot
monitor the weather on a continuous basis.

2.3.2. The following physical limitations may impact the representation of Vance AFB weather
observations:

2.3.2.1. Buildings, hangars, aircraft shelters, and aircraft block portions of the sky as well as
ground visibility reference markers, especially clockwise from north to south (360-180 degrees).

2.3.2.1.1. Aircraft shelters interfere but don’t totally block visibility/sky condition readings to
the northwest.

2.3.2.2. Lack of adequate ground visibility reference beyond the ½ mile point to the south. This
especially degrades determination of nighttime visibility.

2.3.2.3. Nearby lighting contaminates and complicates observing of nighttime sky conditions.

2.3.2.4. The ends of the runways are not visible from the observation point. When fog and/or
low clouds are present over the approach end of runways, conditions reported from the
observation point may not be representative.

2.4. Meteorological Equipment Locations, Descriptions and/or Limitations. Readouts for
all meteorological sensors are located in the WF in Building 155. For meteorological equipment
locations, see Attachment 8.

2.4.1. WSR-88D, Doppler Weather Radar and Open Principal User Processor (OPUP) are
located in the WF in Building 155. The antenna, receiver and Radar Product Generator are
located at Kegelman Auxiliary Field, 26 NM north-northwest of Vance AFB. A narrow band to
the west-southwest of the radar’s 0.5 elevation scans is blocked trees.

2.4.2. FMQ-19 is the primary meteorological equipment. It is the combined meteorological
equipment that measures cloud bases; records wind speed/direction, air temperature/dew-point,
lightning strikes, visibility and surface weather phenomena. Its sensors are located intermittently
between all three active runways.

2.4.3. Manual weather observations are limited in all quadrants due to buildings, hangars,
shelters, and aircraft obstructing view. All ends of the runways are not visible from the
observation point. When fog and/or low clouds are present over the approach end of runways
17/35, conditions reported from the observation point may not be fully representative.

                    MISSION WEATHER FORECASTING SERVICES

3.1. General. Vance WF forecasters, in conjunction with the 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB LA,
provide forecasting services for Vance AFB and the 71 FTW. Forecast products include, but are
not limited to, 24-hour aerodrome forecasts, weather watches, warnings, advisories, and mission
execution forecasts.

3.2. Forecasting Limitations. Lack of observation sites to the east, west, and northwest limit
low-level wind forecast accuracy for Military Operations Areas (MOAs) and low level routes.

3.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). The 26th OWS issues TAFs for Vance AFB a
minimum of 3 hours prior to field opening and within 15 minutes after the published forecast
service opening time listed in the DOD FLIP, unless the airfield is closed. TAFs are normally
issued Sunday through Friday. The 0100Z TAF will be issued only as needed to support the
local flying schedule. The Vance forecaster will coordinate any temporary changes or Saturday
TAFs with the 26 OWS as needed to support local mission needs. Issue times are in the table
below. Each TAF will be a 24-hour forecast. Unless otherwise specified, forecast elements in
the main body of the forecast text apply to the area within a 5 statute mile radius of the Vance
AFB airfield complex. Forecast elements represent the most probable conditions expected
during the forecast period and in the forecast area. Times of occurrence or changes represent the
times conditions are expected to occur. The 26 OWS issued TAF is one of a suite of tools used
by the Vance duty forecaster to develop the MEF for Vance AFB and the regional flying training
areas operated by Vance. The Vance AFB MEF is the official forecast for Vance AFB and the
flying training areas.

*as needed

3.3.1. TAF Specification and Amendment.

3.3.1.1. Individual elements in the TAF will be forecast as accurately as possible. As a
minimum, TAFs (scheduled or amended) will specify time of occurrence to the nearest hour (and
minute as appropriate), the duration, and intensity of the standard criteria listed below.

3.3.1.2. TAF-coded forecast products will be amended for the standard criteria and conditions
listed below:
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                      17
Vance AFB Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Amendment Criteria
Forecast Element/Occurrence         Standard TAF Amendment Criteria
Ceiling or Visibility observed or Category D > 3,000 feet / 3 statute miles
later expected to decreases to less Category C < 3,000 feet / 2 miles
than, or if below, increases to Category B < 1,000 feet / > ½ mile
equal or exceed:                    Category A < 200 feet / < ½ mile

                                    Categories are determined by the lower of the values.
                                    Notes:
                                        1. Forecast category is determined by the lower ceiling
                                             or visibility value.
                                        2. Use surface visibility to determine forecast category.
                                        3. Substitute the lowest published airfield minimum for
                                             Ceiling/Visibility category A. (may require deletion
                                             of the B category at some airfields)
Surface Winds:                      Wind Speed: The difference between the predominant wind
                                    speed and the forecast wind speed is > 10 knots and/or the
                                    difference between the observed gusts is > 10 knots from
                                    the forecast gust. For example, amend a forecast specifying
                                    surface winds of 23018G25KT if observed predominant
                                    wind speed is 28 knots or more, or if the observed gusts are
                                    35 knots or higher. Similarly, amend the TAF if
                                    predominate winds are 8 knots or less, or gusts are 15 knots
                                    or less.

                                    Wind Direction: A change > 30 degrees when the
                                    predominant wind speed or gusts are expected to be over 15

                               assistance to in-flight aircraft.

3.4. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). The Vance AFB MEF is the official forecast for
Vance AFB and the flying training areas. The MEF will always be in categorical agreement with
the TAF, local weather watches, warnings, advisories, and the 26 OWS aviation hazard charts.
The Vance MEF is designed to meet the needs of our assigned airframes and mission profiles as
well as our non-flying customers. The Vance MEF will be available during regularly scheduled
flying hours. During non-flying hours, a MEF will not be produced for airfield, meteorological,
or navigation equipment maintenance (e.g., instrument landing system check). Given
operational and resource constraints, WF leadership will coordinate and determine MEF
necessity for non-regularly scheduled flying (e.g., a full Vance MEF will not be created just to
launch or recover one or two aircraft). The first MEF of the day is published based on the local
flying schedule. During “Day Weeks” where airfield is open from 0700-2000L, the initial MEF
will be published at 1200Z (0500L DST, 0600L CST). During “Night weeks” where the airfield
is open from 0900-2359L, the initial MEF will be published at 1400Z (0700 DST, 0800 CST). A
17Z (1200L DST, 1300L CST) update will always be done, and on designated Night Weeks, a
01Z (2000L DST, 2100L CST) update will be published.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                              19
3.4.1. 8 and 33 FTS. Unless otherwise instructed, T-6 aircrews normally fly local missions
directly off the Vance weather homepage MEF and do not come into the WF for a formal
briefing. For cross country or out and back flights, face-to-face in person briefings are provided
at the WF.

3.4.2. 3, 32 and 25 FTS. Some T-1 and T-38 aircrews come to the WF for a verbal or written
brief. Many of these aircrews, however, fly local missions directly off the Vance weather
homepage MEF unless otherwise instructed.

3.4.3. Aircrews desiring to fly directly from the MEF without a WF brief should review flight
hazard charts and coordinate with their squadron supervisor (SUP) to ensure they have the latest
weather information and thorough weather situational awareness. Aircrews should contact the
duty briefer or forecaster if they require clarification, desire a verbal brief, or to request a written
brief. Returning aircrews who encountered unforecasted or unrepresentative conditions should
immediately relay the information to the WF forecaster directly or through their SUP, who will,
in turn, pass the information to the WF.

3.4.4. The WF produces the MEF Monday through Friday. Weekend MEFs will be prepared as
necessary.      The primary means of delivery will be the Vance weather homepage,
\\vncfs01002\NetShare\Public\Vance Web\Weather\webpage\wxindex.htm, and the secondary
means will be by fax. The MEF is valid from the first scheduled takeoff until the last land.
Times are adjusted as necessary for night or weekend flying. The MEF will be posted to the
weather homepage 2 hours prior to the first scheduled takeoff time or 0500L, whichever is first.
If a weekend MEF is requested, coordinate with the WF leadership no later than close of
business on Friday. The MEF consist of the data listed in the table below and will be amended
for the criteria listed in following table.

 Amendment Criteria for Vance AFB MEF*
 To align with Vance TAF categories
 To align with watch, warning, or advisory criteria (e.g. crosswinds)
 Temperature errors greater than 3 degrees Celsius
 Pressure altitude errors greater than 50ft (ALSTG >.05 in Hg)
 Wind direction errors 30 degrees or more with winds greater than or
 equal to 10kts
 Wind speed errors greater than or equal to 15kts
 Errors in moderate or greater turbulence forecast
 Any deviation from the icing forecast
 Any atmospheric change that would affect the mission (e.g. LLWS)
 Representativeness as determined by the forecaster
 Ceiling changes above/below the following levels (in feet):
 3000, 1500, 1000, 500, 300, 200
 Visibility changes above/below following levels (in statute miles):
 3, 1 ½, 1, ½

*Forecasters will also attempt to make amendments ahead of time based on aircraft weather
sensitivities. For example, if conditions that cause crosswinds greater than or equal to 25kts are
expected, but not originally forecast, they will attempt to be amended because the T-6 and T-1
aircraft cannot take off or land.

3.5. First Look. The First Look is a planning tool for aircrews to plan their next day missions.
The WF produces the First Look Sunday through Thursday (for the following day). The primary
means of delivery will be the Vance weather homepage and the secondary means will be by fax.
The First Look is valid from the first scheduled takeoff until the last scheduled land for the next
day and will be posted to the Vance weather homepage by 1300L the previous day. The First
Look is amendable and consists of the data listed in the table below:

 Data Provided in Vance First Look*
 Regional flight level winds, temps, and climb data
 Local sky conditions, flying hazards, visibility, surface
 winds, weather type, altimeter, pressure altitude, lunar and
 solar data, and temperatures
 A 48-hour outlook for the local area
*Forecast elements in the First Look may change as mission needs evolve.

3.6. Mission Weather Briefings. One of the primary functions of the WF is to provide flying
mission weather briefs in support of daily operations at Vance and, as manning and duty
priorities allow transient aircrew briefing support.

3.6.1. Written aircrew weather briefings will be prepared using DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather
Briefing. In the event of a telephone update request, the duty forecaster will annotate briefed
changes to the original DD Form 175-1 along with the requester’s name. The WF requests 1
hour notification before brief time on DD Form 175-1 briefings. Briefs can be faxed or emailed
if necessary.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                       21
3.6.2. Aircrews may receive verbal weather briefings upon request via telephone or at the
weather station. Verbal weather briefings will be recorded on a local Vance AFB weather form.

3.7. Transient Aircrew Briefing Support. Vance aircrews should use the following sources to
obtain mission weather briefings while off station, in order of precedence: (1) the Vance WF, (2)
the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) responsible for the area from which they are
departing, (Vance aircrews are provided an OWS AOR map on the back of the DD Form 175-1),
(3) any military base weather station, (4) a qualified FAA forecaster or flight weather service
briefer, or (5) the nearest flight service station.

3.7.1. Transient (non Vance) aircrews requiring mission weather briefings for departure from
Vance AFB will be briefed as local mission and duty priorities allow. In the rare event the WF
briefing workload is too high to provide expedient briefings; transient aircrews may be referred
to the 26 OWS for briefing support. A telephone, contact information, and computers are
provided in the flight planning room for aircrews to obtain any weather information they might
need.

3.8. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is performed from departure to recovery of off
station missions and METWATCH is performed while the weather station is open and/or during
SWAP. Since the majority of Vance training missions are conducted in the Vance local area, the
WF performs MISSIONWATCH for these missions on a continual basis as the mission is
essentially constant during the flying window. MISSIONWATCH is performed for non-local
missions by using verbal forms and 175-1s to gain insight on the scheduled flight plan for each
aircraft. Impacting weather which will affect a mission will be passed to the appropriate SUP
and/or SOF ASAP. The WF focuses on mission-limiting weather thresholds for specific mission
as defined by supported units. The WF will coordinate with OWS, if required.

3.9. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The WF operates a PMSV on Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) 342.55 MHz for dissemination of weather information to airborne aircraft. The PMSV is
limited only by range. Maximum effective range will vary with atmospheric conditions and the
aircraft’s altitude. The WF has no phone patch initiation capability. Other nearby bases PMSV
frequencies are:

McConnell AFB (KIAB) 375.2
Tinker AFB (KTIK) 261.025
Altus AFB (KLTS) 239.8

4.16. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Forecasts. Tropical Cyclone (TC) forecasts produced by the
NWS Tropical Cyclone forecast centers must be included in the DAM briefings if the TC is
forecasted to impact TX, LA, or MS coasts. We have letters of agreement with Columbus AFB,
MS, and Randolph AFB, TX, to park/position aircraft. We will use the tropical cyclone forecasts
issued by the designated tropical cyclone centers (i.e., National Hurricane Center or Joint
Typhoon Warning Center). No deviation from the official forecast for position, track,
movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity trend is authorized. We will tailor the official
tropical cyclone forecasts into a specific mission forecast product for our supported customers.
Tailoring may include factors such as specific local effects such as terrain.

Additional Note: Ensure all supported customers are notified of all updates to tropical cyclone
forecasts and understand the limitations of extended tropical cyclone forecasts (48hr-72hr
outlooks contain a high degree of uncertainty, are for planning purposes only and subject to
change. Brief the forecast error probability statements included in discussion bulletins or on the
forecast products.

                WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS, AND ADVISORIES

5.1. General. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard, or
adversely affect operations on Vance AFB or aircraft operations in our flying training areas. The
Vance WF and the 26 OWS conduct a two-tiered meteorological watch by monitoring weather
observations and forecasts in the vicinity of Vance AFB for the development of weather
conditions that may adversely impact military operations. When forecasters detect threatening
weather conditions, they advise concerned units so they can take protective measures. Weather
watches, warnings, and advisories are the vehicles through which supported agencies are notified
of these critical weather conditions.

5.1.1. Each Vance AFB unit has the responsibility to coordinate with the WF for weather
conditions that impact their operation and define the amount of forewarning (desired lead-time)
they require before the onset of the weather condition to take protective actions. Additionally,
each unit must provide the WF with checklists of protective actions taken upon notification from
weather personnel to validate their requirement. If the request falls within the operational
capabilities of the WF or the 26 OWS, weather personnel will monitor, advise, watch, and warn
of operationally significant weather as requested.

5.2. Resource Protection Concept of Operations. Resource protection is a three-tiered
structure with Air Force Weather Agency, Operational Weather Squadrons, and Weather Flights
all playing significant and interactive roles. The table below illustrates products provided by
each tier in the resource protection process for Vance and our flying training areas.

Three-Tiered Resource Protection Process
Air Force Weather Agency Provides:
CONUS Military Weather Advisories
Severe Weather Analysis Package/Teleconference
Strategic Level Threat Assessments
Back-Up to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center & Aviation Weather Center
26 Operational Weather Squadron (Barksdale Hub) Provides for Vance:
Regional Severe Weather Products
Regional Discussions Detailing Severe Weather
Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
Vance WF Provides:
Mission Tailored Support for Customers
Observed Weather Warnings, and Advisories
Backup Watch, Warning, and Advisory Support For Immediate Resource Protection
"Eyes Forward" Support for OWS/Severe Weather Reports to OWS

5.3. Watch, Warning, and Advisory Dissemination. The 26 OWS issues all watches,
warnings, and applicable advisories during WF closure. When the WF is open, the 26 OWS will
continue to issue all watches, forecasted warnings, and forecasted advisories. All observed
warnings and observed advisories will be issued by the WF.

5.4. Vance AFB Weather Watches/Warning. Weather Watch/warning criteria for Vance AFB
with applicable Desired Lead Times (DLTs) are found below and cover an area within a 5 NM

Note: The 26 OWS uses radar and lightning display systems to issue and cancel observed
lightning warnings. This technology may not be as timely or as accurate as local technician
weather observations or local lightning detection systems.

The Vance WF does not watch or warn for Sandstorm criteria or heavy rain. During airfield
closure, the SWAT forecaster is not required to report to the weather station upon receipt of the
lightning within 5 NM watch or warning or Wind > 35 knots but < 50 knots warning. When
winds are forecasted to be > 40 knots the standby forecaster will report to, and open the weather
station two hours prior to the occurrence.

                   DISSEMINATION OF WEATHER INFORMATION

6.1. General. The Vance WF and the 26 OWS share responsibilities in dissemination of
weather information to supported agencies. The WF will assist units in maintaining an efficient
and effective means of disseminating weather information. Procedures must ensure information
is received by those who need it and that weather personnel do not spend too much time
communicating information, to allow more time to monitor and forecast weather conditions. All
units receiving weather support must be involved in a continuous program of evaluation and
improvement of the weather dissemination system, including inter-unit dissemination. Due to
limited manning and the time-critical nature of this information, the WF expects agencies with
JET terminals to use them to their fullest potential prior to contacting the WF.

6.2. JET.

6.2.1. The primary means of disseminating weather information on Vance AFB is via JET and
the 26 OWS and Vance WF use this system. JET is used to disseminate the information listed in
the table below. See A7 for a detailed matrix of Vance AFB
watch, warning, and advisory recipients. Those units that do not have JET software installed on
a LAN PC but have a documented requirement for weather information (i.e.
warnings/watches/advisories) should contact the closest JET user in their organization for
inclusion in their notification chain.


 JET Disseminated Data
 Vance AFB observations
 Vance AFB TAFs and amendments
 Vance AFB weather warnings and watches
 Vance AFB forecast and observed weather advisories
 Observations and forecasts for five selected bases
 Vance AFB PIREPs

6.3. JET Local Dissemination Backup Procedures. When JET is inoperative, the WF will
locally disseminate weather observations, forecasts, amendments, watches, warnings, and
advisories via the Vance weather homepage. When JET goes down, the WF will immediately
notify Tower and RAPCON that JET is inoperable and provide an estimated downtime. They
will also call the FTS’s, Vance CP & 26th OWS and direct them to the Vance Weather
Homepage “Vance Wx Data” link for weather observation, advisories, watches, and warnings.
The WF will then call the JET Help Desk at DSN 272-2785 and ensure the outage is logged on
the WF Equipment Outage Log. The WF will advise the above agencies to check the homepage
each time a weather product is updated. Manpower and workload, especially during rapidly
changing weather, does not allow time for the WF to read updated weather products to users
except during communications outages, see para. 6.4. If necessary, weather observations will be
uploaded via alternate means IAW the WF Outage SOP, section 2. Additionally (if requested),
the 26 OWS will e-mail or fax selected weather products and information to the WF.

6.4. Communications Outage. When the WF experiences a communication outage (i.e. JET
and LAN/web page), the WF will locally disseminate weather observations, forecasts, watches,
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                         37
warnings, and advisories via fax to the agencies listed in A7, Diagram G. Observations will be
called out to the 26 OWS to upload to the JAAWIN webpage. Additionally, the 26 OWS will
verbally pass the weather products and information to the WF and 71 FTW/CP.

6.5. Total Communications Outage. When the WF experiences a total communications outage
(i.e. JET, LAN/web page, and telephone) the WF will assume complete responsibility from the
26 OWS (per MOA 15-01) for production and dissemination of all Vance weather products to
include observations, TAF and MEF production, watches, warnings, and advisories. A runner
from the WF will be employed to pass critical weather information to the CP, SOF, squadron
supervisors, tower, and RAPCON for safety of flight. As manpower and duties allow, runners
will also attempt to pass weather data to other primary agencies shown in A7, Diagram G.
Supported agencies may have to provide a runner in order to get weather information from the
WF.

6.6. Non-Hub Operations. When an interruption in weather operations at the 26 OWS is
expected to be 72 hours or less, the WF will assume complete responsibility from the 26 OWS
(per MOA 15-01) for production and dissemination of all Vance weather products to include
observations, TAF and MEF production, watches, warnings, and advisories. The WF will stand
up 24 hour operations until the 26 OWS can resume weather operations. When the interruption
in weather operations at the 26 OWS is expected to exceed 72 hours, weather responsibility for
Vance AFB will transfer IAW AFMAN 15-129, paragraph 1.6.

6.7. Base Siren Activation/Testing. During tornadic events, the base siren system serves as the
primary notification system for the Vance populace. Immediately, upon receipt of a tornado
warning from the 26 OWS, the Vance CP will activate the base siren. The WF will activate the
base siren in the event of a CP equipment malfunction/failure or if rapidly changing severe
weather conditions do not allow sufficient time to issue a tornado warning and necessitate
prudent base populace notification. The WF, when open, will notify the CP immediately after a
tornado warning is issued. The CP will notify the Wing Commander and appropriate wing
leadership.

6.7.1. The CP will ensure the automated base siren test occurs every Wednesday at 1200 Local.
During the months of March-October, the WF will test their ability to activate the base siren on
the third Wednesday of each month.

6.7.2. The WF will ensure their equipment is operational with periodic tests. Normally, this will
occur during the summer months on the last Wednesday of the month. The CP will coordinate
this test with the WF.

6.7.3. During periods of potential severe weather, the CP will coordinate with the WF prior to
making a decision to cancel the scheduled siren test. If the CP and WF agree that the weather is
potentially severe enough to cancel the scheduled test, the CP will disable the auto activation and
then notify the 71 FTW/CC that the test was not performed due to the potential of severe
weather.

6.8. Alternate Operations Location (AOL) for Weather Personnel.

6.8.1. In the event evacuation of the WF (Building 155) becomes necessary, an alternate
operating location will be established in Building 179 at the 8 FTS main duty section, located in
38                                       VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010
the western portion of the building. Setup location will be in the safety office, across from the
duty desk. The WF can be reached by calling the 8th safety office at DSN 448-6097 / 6121 /
7107 or COMM: 580-213-6097 / 6121 / 7107. Connectivity to the local area network and local
printer access will be made available by 8 FTS personnel. Normal weather data dissemination
through JET still applies. The following limitations to weather services can be expected in the
event of evacuation.

6.8.1.1. The first priority is for the weather technician to take and disseminate augmented
weather observations, if required by supplementing/backup procedures (VAFBI 15-101, paras
2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Briefing and/or forecasting services may be curtailed or even temporarily
suspended until additional manning can be recalled and work priorities allow. Aircrews can
expect some briefing delays due to limited workspace, telephones, and computers. They may be
referred to the 26 OWS for briefing and planning support.

6.8.1.2. Use of tactical meteorological equipment and limited access to satellite, lightning
detection, and NEXRAD radar equipment will likely degrade the accuracy and timeliness of
some forecasts and observations.

6.8.1.3. There will be no PMSV capability for WF personnel. Prior to evacuating the weather
station or immediately upon relocating to the AOL, the weather technician will contact the
Vance Tower and request they monitor the PMSV frequency until the WF can monitor the
frequency themselves.

6.8.2. In the event the main duty section of Building 179 is unusable, an AOL may be
established at any other suitable location. Minimum desired requirements for an AOL are
availability of power, a Class A telephone, easy access to the outside, and a view of the flight
line area.

6.9. Public Release of Weather Information. The WF will forward all requests for weather
information from non-DOD/public agencies to the 71 FTW/PA. The WF will not routinely
provide Vance AFB historical or real-time weather data to non-governmental agencies unless
coordinated by a MOA.

6.9.1. Public Affairs representatives disseminate general weather watch, warning, and advisory
information on the commander’s base cable access channel (channel 43) during duty hours. In
the event a tornado warning has been cancelled, the “all-clear” message will be posted on the
commander’s base cable access channel during duty hours.

6.10. Obtaining Weather Information When the WF is Unavailable. When the WF is closed
weather personnel will be recalled through the CP in the event of severe weather or significant
emergency. For routine support, consult the WF website. In the event of a WF evacuation, WF
personnel will relocate to the primary Alternate Operating Location (consult para 6.8 for details).
If unable to contact WF at the primary AOL, call Vance CP. They will have firsthand
knowledge of the WF’s new location. Call them for a telephone number. Off-station aircrews
will attempt to contact the WF for updates. If unavailable, aircrews will call the 26 OWS for
briefing support.

                           SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS

7.1. General. Support information to the primary flying training units is outlined in this
chapter. Aircraft weather sensitivities and mission weather impacts are included. Any special
support requirements not covered should be coordinated with the WF at least five working days
prior to the start of the support.

7.1.1. Vance has four active duty Flying Training Squadrons (FTS), the 8 FTS, 25 FTS, 32 FTS,
33 FTS, one Fighter Training Squadron, the 3 FTS, and one Reserve squadron, the 5 FTS. The 8
FTS and the 33 FTS fly the T-6 Texan and conduct Phase II Joint Specialized Undergraduate
Pilot Training (JSUPT). The 25 FTS flies the T-38 Talon and the 32 FTS flies the T-1 Jayhawk.
Both the 25 FTS and 32 FTS conduct Phase III JSUPT for their designated aircraft. The 3 FTS
flies the AT-38 and conducts Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF).

7.1.2. The 5 FTS is an associate squadron and provides instructor pilots (IPs) for all four of the
active duty flying training squadrons. The 5 FTS does not own any aircraft and their IPs operate
under the direction of the individual squadrons for which they fly. The 5 FTS IPs flying for the 8
FTS and the 33 FTS fly the T-6 Texan and conduct Phase II JSUPT. The 5 FTS IPs flying for
the 25 FTS and 3 FTS fly the T-38 Talon and conduct Phase III JSUPT as well as IFF. The 5
FTS IPs flying for the 32 FTS fly the T-1 Jayhawk and also conduct Phase III JSUPT.

7.2. Weather Impacts on Mission Operations. Current and forecast weather conditions will
normally be the basis for determining flying status; however, other factors may dictate a more
conservative status in the interest of flying safety. The SOF comes from one of the five flying
training squadrons. The SOF may coordinate with the squadron supervisor (SUP) to designate a
weather ship to accurately depict flying conditions in the local area. From these flying
conditions, the SOF determines the flying status for each aircraft. The flying status can and
sometimes will be determined from information received from the weather ship regardless of
what the local observation dictates. Flying hazards, ceilings, and visibility criteria determine the
flying status for each aircraft, and although the forecast may not need to be amended, the status
criteria should be kept in mind during daily operations. Weather information is extremely
critical for students and timely notification of non-forecasted conditions is crucial to flying
safety.

7.3. T-6 Phase II JSUPT. The 8 FTS and 33 FTS normal flying days are Monday-Friday. Cross
country departures are normally on Friday and returns are on Sunday. Times of first takeoff/last
landing are published weekly and updated daily. The various types of training require different
minimum ceiling and visibility criteria based, in part, on individual student's qualifications.

7.3.1. T-6 Flying Training Areas. These are the smaller MOAs located northwest, north, east
and south of Vance AFB. The low altitude block in each MOA runs from 7,000-12,000 feet
MSL. The high altitude block in each MOA runs from 14,000-22,000 feet MSL. The T-6 uses
the local SR low-level routes located to the west and to the east of Vance AFB. The T-6 also
uses Kegelman Auxiliary Field which is located 26NM NNW of Vance near the Great Salt
Plains Lake.

7.3.2. T-6 Satellite Operations. Satellite bases are those bases used for navigation and flight
checks. Minimum weather requirements vary for each base and each instructor pilot. IP’s have
different categories that determine the weather minimums in which they are allowed to land.
The SOF can impose stricter landing minimums. T-6s use the following bases or airports listed
below:

T-6 Satellite Operations
Base or Airport                  Minimum Weather (Ft AGL and SM)
McConnell AFB                    1000/3

Tulsa IAP                         300/1

7.3.3. T-6 Alternates. An alternate is required when the ceiling and/or visibility at Vance AFB
is less than 1500/3. Minimum alternate weather requirements vary from one airport to another
due to the instrumentation of the aircraft, and radar approaches at the airport itself. Alternates are
listed below in order of preference with the minimum weather conditions required for each
alternate. The SOF can impose stricter landing minimums if deemed necessary.

T-6 Alternate Operations
Base or Airport                  Minimum Weather (Ft AGL and SM)
Tinker AFB                       1000/2

7.4. T-38 Phase III JSUPT. The 25 FTS normal flying days are Monday-Friday. Cross country
departures are normally on Friday and returns are on Sunday. Times of first takeoff/last landing
are published weekly and updated daily. The various types of training require different
minimum ceiling and visibility criteria based, in part, on individual student's qualifications.

7.4.1. T-38 Flying Training Areas. The T-38 MOAs are located to the west of Vance AFB from
18nm to 90nm and extending almost to the Texas border. The low altitude block in each MOA
runs from 10,000-23,000 feet MSL. The high altitude blocks are confined to Areas 2,3, and 6
and run from 26,000-43,000 feet MSL. The T-38 also uses the local IR low-level routes located
to the west of Vance AFB in Figure 7.2.

7.4.2. T-38 Satellite Operations. Minimum weather requirements vary for each base and for
each instructor pilot. IP’s have different categories that determine the weather minimums in
which they are allowed to land. T-38’s use the following satellite bases or airports listed below
for navigation and flight checks.

7.5. T-1 Phase III JSUPT. Normal flying days for the 32 FTS are Monday-Friday. Cross
country departures are normally on Friday and returns are on Sunday, however, many weekday
cross countries will also launch. Times of first takeoff/last landing are published weekly and
updated daily. The various types of training require different minimum ceiling and visibility
criteria based, in part, on individual student's qualifications.

7.5.1. The 32 FTS Training Areas. The T-1 MOAs are located to the west of Vance AFB from
18NM to 90NM and extending almost to the Texas border. The low altitude block in each MOA
runs from 10,000-14,000 feet MSL. The high altitude block in each MOA runs from 16,000-
20,000 feet MSL. The T-1 uses all local low-level routes, as well as several other low-level
routes located throughout the region shown in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. The T-1 also uses several Air
Refueling (AR) routes. AR-669 runs from 25,000-27,000 feet MSL, AR-70 and AR-60 run
between 17,000-23,000 feet MSL, and AR-653/DOBIE which runs between 11,000-22,000 feet
MSL are shown in Figure 7.3.

7.5.2. Satellite Operations. Minimum weather requirements vary for each base and for each
instructor pilot. IP’s have different categories that determine the weather minimums in which
they are allowed to land. T-1’s use the following bases or airports below for navigation, flight

7.6. AT-38 IFF. Normal flying days for the 3 FTS are Monday-Friday. Times of first
takeoff/last landing are published weekly and updated daily. The various types of training
require different minimum ceiling and visibility criteria based, in part, on individual student's
qualifications and mission type.

7.6.1. The 3 FTS Training Areas. The AT-38 uses combined local T-38 airspace blocks de-
conflicted from UPT T-38 flying periods. These blocks are located to the west of Vance AFB
from 18NM to 90NM and extending almost to the Texas border in the northwest corner of the
state, and uses altitudes 11,000-23,000 feet MSL. The AT-38 also uses the Smoky Hill Aerial
Gunnery Range, just south of Salina, KS, primarily in altitudes below 18,000 feet MSL.

7.6.2. AT-38 Satellite Operations and Alternates. Minimum weather requirements vary for each
base and for each instructor pilot. IP’s have different categories that determine the weather
minimums in which they are allowed to land. AT-38’s use the same satellite and alternate bases
or airports as the T-38 for navigation and flight checks.

7.7. Mission Limiting Weather Parameters. Flying Status and Weather Minimums are listed
below for the T-6 T-38, AT-38 and T-1. Flying status is determined from observations, weather
ships, radar, and limitations imposed by the facilities. Weather ships report conditions that
would prohibit or limit students from flying. Restrictions may be placed on aircraft if clouds
hinder work in the traffic pattern or flying areas.

         7.8.1. Temperature. See table below for aircrew temperature sensitivities:

          Temperature Sensitivities for 71 FTW Aircrews
          Cold Weather – Equivalent Chill Temperature (ECT)
          ECT Caution Range      ECT 32F to –19F
          NO FLY Zone            ECT –20F and below
          Hot Weather – Index of Thermal Stress (ITS)
          ITS Caution            ITS 90F – 99F
          ITS Danger             ITS 100F and above

         7.8.1.1. T-38/AT-38s are particularly sensitive to flight-level temperature forecasts from 35,000-
         45,000 feet during Functional Check Flights (FCFs). The temperature forecast helps determine
         the minimum allowable mach (speed) for these flights, and technical orders require engine
         performance evaluations while flying at the minimum mach. Temperatures just 1-2 degrees
         colder than forecasted may raise the minimum allowable mach above the planned mach, and
         make the pilot unknowingly susceptible to a compressor stall and/or flameout. Flight-level
         temperatures are also used help determine the minimum mach for supersonic training flights.

         7.8.1.2. T-38/AT-38s are also sensitive to high surface temperatures during take off. The
         airframe doesn’t have much lift therefore; high surface temperatures at short and high elevation
         runways pose problems, especially during the summer.

         7.8.1.3. T-6 Ground operations are limited to +43C per TO 1T-6A-1.

                                            Chapter 8

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

8.1. General. Many of our communications and navigations systems use radio waves (High
Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), which can be
rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from the sun. This chapter contains some brief
information regarding space weather limitations, alerts, warnings, and products available to
Vance personnel.

8.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, the ability to provide lead-
times for significant space events is extremely limited. Lead times typically range from minutes
to days and the duration of space weather events is typically minutes to days.

8.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. The WF receives specific space weather alerts or
event warnings from HQ AFWA. Bulletins are available through the Joint Air Force and Army
Weather Information Network (JAAWIN) at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/conus_space.html. A
sample of the Daily Discussion and a Daily Space Weather Events and Impacts stoplight chart is
provided in A4. See the link above for current Space Environment Discussions, including
potential impacts to AF Operations. Minimum aircraft criteria are listed in AFI 11-2(acft type)
Vol 3, and associated AETC supplements.

8.3.1. Each Vance AFB unit has the responsibility to coordinate space weather product
requirements with the WF for space weather conditions that may impact their operations. The
WF will assist units in determining potential impacts of space weather. Additionally, units must
provide the WF with checklists of protective actions taken upon notification of space weather
alerts and warnings to validate their requirement. If the request falls within the operational
capabilities of the WF, the 26 OWS, or the Air Force Weather Agency, then weather personnel
will monitor, alert, and warn of operationally significant space weather impacts as requested.

8.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN. For additional
information concerning these products please contact the WF or the 26 OWS.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                          55
                                            Chapter 9

                                   RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

9.1. All Supported Agencies. Supported agencies will establish and coordinate all weather
support requirements and procedures with the WF and notify WF of any changes in weather
support requirements. This should be done with sufficient notice (normally 5 working days) to
preclude impact on the WF. Agencies will use assigned JET software on LAN PCs to the
greatest extent possible as a source of weather data. Data provided for Vance AFB includes
current observations, 24-hour forecasts, weather watches, warnings, advisories, PIREPs, and, for
RAPCON, tower, and SUP computers, observations/forecasts for up to 20 alternate bases.

9.2. 71 OG. The 71 OG will:

9.2.1. Inform the WF of any changes in the operational needs of the 71 FTW, including changes
in circling or landing minima.

9.2.2. Provide the WF with all plans, messages, or communications that may affect weather
support to the 71 FTW.

9.2.3. Through the SOF: Notify the duty forecaster of the primary alternate airfield and any
changes in alternates, as required; notify the 71 OG/CC and SUPs when alerted by the weather
flight of a change in radar operational status; notify the duty forecaster when a weather recall is
initiated; pass PIREPs containing weather information to the duty forecaster.

9.2.4. Through OG/OGV, provide the WF with the date, time, and location of the quarterly SOF
meeting, at least 5 working days prior to the event.

9.3. 3 FTS, 8 FTS, 25 FTS, 32 FTS, and 33 FTS. The commander, ops officer, and/or ops
supervisor of each FTS will:

9.3.1. Ensure Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs), amendments, and other pertinent weather
data such as flight level hazard charts are received, readable, and posted in the Training
Operations Centers and other desired locations.

9.3.2. Participate in the Cooperative Weather Watch by ensuring aircrews pass weather related
PIREPs to the WF either directly via the PMSV (frequency 342.55 MHz) or through the SOF.

9.3.3. Ensure flight crews make every effort to provide at least 1 hour advance notification to the
pick up/briefing time for DD form 175-1 requests. Ensure a reasonable and timely effort is made
to notify the weather flight of flight cancellations and/or mission changes that affect a previously
requested 175-1 briefing or a cross-country briefing.

9.3.3.1. Ensure flight crews request 175-1s only for actual planned missions, not for
practice/planning. WF manning and workload does not allow for practice/planning 175-1s and
such requests significantly reduce resources available to complete actual 175-1 requests on time.
Other avenues, such as the Vance First Look, obtaining weather information off the internet, or
talking to the forecaster or briefer, are available to assist aircrews with flight planning.
56                                        VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010
9.3.4. Ensure IPs and students make a reasonable effort to have a general idea of the weather
before they contact the WF for planning or a briefing request. Aircrews can use internet sources,
and posted weather data such as the MEF or First Look to increase their weather awareness.
Aircrews with even a minimal amount of weather situational awareness greatly facilitate their
interaction with the forecaster or briefer resulting in more efficient mission planning.

9.3.5. Coordinate with WF leadership to establish and maintain a process to provide timely
mission weather debrief information to the WF. This data is required for WF and AETC weather
metrics and is a valuable part of the MEF process ensuring the WF is providing accurate and
appropriate weather support services for the flying mission.

9.3.6. Ensure the WF is notified whenever meteorological wind sensing equipment in the RSUs
is suspect or inoperative.

9.3.7. In the event Building 155 has to be evacuated, the 8 FTS will provide an area in the
Operations section to serve as the alternate weather operations and observing site. Connectivity
to the local area network and local printer access will also be provided. See section 6.8.2 for
specific information.

9.3.8. Ensure each SUP accomplishes the following:

9.3.8.1. Notify the WF of significant increases or changes in the aircrew briefing workload.

9.3.8.2. Notify the WF when a mass briefing of not less than five aircrews is desired for weekend
cross-country, out-and-back flights, or other mass aircrew briefings. Notification will include
the briefing location, desired briefing time, and the following elements if known: takeoff and
arrival times, flight levels, destinations, alternates, and times to alternates. Notification must be
made before close of business the duty day prior to the briefing. Units with facilities and digital
projectors are expected to utilize their equipment to facilitate PowerPoint presentations;
otherwise, the requesting squadron will provide an overhead projector for the briefing. If more
than one squadron requests briefings for the same time, the first squadron to request the briefing
will have priority.

9.3.8.3. Ensure Mission Execution Forecasts (MEFs), amendments, and other pertinent weather
data such as flight level hazard charts are received, readable, and posted in the Training
Operations Centers and other desired locations for planning and are available to aircrews as they
leave to fly local sorties. Note: Weather warnings, watches, and advisories are considered
amendments to the MEF.

9.3.8.4. Upon request, provide indoctrination training to newly assigned forecasters. The
indoctrination training should include the flying mission overview, weather sensitivities of
assigned aircraft, SUP and forecaster relationship, a tour with the SUP, and a simulator ride
showing various weather effects on flying.

9.3.9. Ensure SOFs, SUPs, IPs, and students are informed of and understand weather services
and policies. Questions or concerns should be directed to the WF leadership for clarification.

9.3.10. Notify the WF of any degradation in weather service or if changes to this instruction are
required.

9.4. 71 OSS/OSA. Airfield Operations personnel will provide the WF with the date, time, and
location of the quarterly Airfield Operations Board meeting, at least 5 working days prior to the
event.

9.5. 71 OSS/OSAT. The Control Tower will:

9.5.1. Participate in the Cooperative Weather Watch Program. This requires notification of the
WF duty forecaster when any of the following weather conditions occur and are not in the latest
available observation: Precipitation starts or stops; thunderstorms and/or lightning is observed;
tower prevailing and/or sector visibility is less than 4 SM and is different from the surface
prevailing and/or sector visibility (this is no longer reported in observations, but is still
emphasized to give the WF a heads up that conditions may be changing); any weather
phenomenon that might be considered significant. The weather technician will reevaluate the
weather conditions whenever a reliable source (i.e. ATC, pilots) reports weather conditions
different from the last disseminated observation (i.e. different ceiling height, visibility, present
weather). Based on reevaluation of different weather conditions reported and local policy,
weather personnel will log-out & backup the FMQ-19 sensors if they are incorrect and meet
backup criteria (VAFBI 15-101, para 2.1.1.).

9.5.2. Relay all PIREPs containing weather information to the WF duty forecaster.

9.5.3. Notify the WF of a change in the active runway.

9.5.4. In conjunction with daily radio checks, perform a PMSV radio check.

9.5.5. Notify the WF when wind equipment is inoperative or readings differ from visual
references.

9.5.6. Ensure all personnel assigned to the tower receive local weather phenomena training and
certification to take limited weather observations and to participate in the Cooperative Weather
Watch as described in Chapter 1.

9.5.7. Ensure weather personnel receive ATC indoctrination, in accordance with AFI 13-203.
Tower will be the focal point.

9.6. 71 OSS/OSAR. RAPCON will:

9.6.1. Relay all PIREPs containing weather information to the WF duty forecaster. RAPCON
will also participate in CWW Chapter 1 (1.6.2).

9.6.2. In conjunction with normal daily phone checks, obtain a voice clarity check on the
RAPCON-to-Weather hotline.

9.6.3. Ensure all RAPCON personnel receive weather code familiarization training.

9.7. 71 OSS/OSOS. Wing Scheduling will:
58                                        VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010
9.7.1. Ensure the WF leadership is notified of scheduled Saturday flying and changes to the
scheduled Sunday cross country return flying window to include addition or deletion of local
flying or out-and-back missions. This facilitates WF manpower scheduling and the lead time
required to prepare the appropriate mission forecast products for the scheduled flying.

9.7.2. Ensure the WF leadership is sent a copy of the monthly weather cancellations. This data
is required for WF and AETC weather metrics and is a valuable part of the MEF process
ensuring the WF is providing accurate and appropriate weather support services for the flying
mission.

9.8. Aircraft Maintenance. Prior to 1600L each Friday, from 1 March through 31 October, the
Contractor, Aircraft Maintenance supervisor on duty will contact the duty forecaster (Ext 7530)
for the weekend forecast. If thunderstorms are forecast, aircraft will be tied down and hail
covers installed on T-38 aircraft and a decision will be made whether to shelter aircraft.

9.9. Airfield Management. Airfield Management Operations will:

9.9.1. Notify weather personnel of all aircraft emergencies, aircraft mishaps, and ground
emergencies.

9.9.2. Relay Runway Conditions Reports (RCR) and Runway Surface Conditions (RSC) to
weather personnel for situational awareness purposes. RCR/RSC will not be reported in an
observation.

9.9.3. Relay pertinent information on Vance AFB-diverted aircraft to weather personnel.

9.9.4. Contact designated aircrews, when requested by weather personnel, and advise them to
contact the forecaster prior to departure.

9.9.5. Provide the WF with requested DOD FLIPs. Upon receipt of weather data changes for
the DOD FLIPs, coordinate and submit all revisions for publication.

9.9.6. Provide a copy of the airfield hours to the WF by the Friday prior to the week of
scheduled flying. This facilitates WF manpower scheduling and the lead time required to
prepare the appropriate mission forecast products for the scheduled flying.

9.9.7. Notify the duty forecaster of the airfield closing time or any changes to that time.

9.9.8. Include a note for extended PMSV outages (over 24 hours) in a local NOTAM.

9.10. Civil Engineering. Contractor, Civil Engineering will ensure all weather observing
equipment has an automatic-starting back-up power supply and will ensure the WF is notified
prior to scheduled power outages, to include the monthly tests of back-up power.

9.11. 71 FTW/PA. Public Affairs will disseminate weather warnings and watches on the
Commander’s Access Channel (CAC) - channel 43. In the event of a situation that precludes
71 FTW/PA from accessing the CAC, 71 FTW/CP will post weather warnings and watches on
the CAC.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                        59
9.12. 71 FTW/CP. The Vance CP will:

9.12.1. Disseminate, upon receipt, all weather watches, weather warnings, and weather
advisories issued by the WF or the 26 OWS, as required in A7.

9.12.2. Ensure base siren activation/testing IAW paragraph 6.7.

9.12.3. Upon receipt of severe weather reports from on or off-base sources, immediately relay
the information to the WF forecaster.

9.12.4. Inform Contractor, Aircraft Maintenance and Contractor, Civil Engineering Operations -
CEOW upon notification from the WF or 26 OWS that surface winds greater than or equal to 50
knots have been observed at Vance AFB.

9.12.5. Notify wing leadership of pertinent weather watches, warnings, and advisories as
established in VAFBI 10-201, Commander Notifications.

9.12.6. Notify the WF of all local events/incidents affected by weather or weather services.

9.12.7. Contact the standby forecaster (pager 213-3719) whenever any watch, warning, or
advisory is issued by the 26 OWS and the weather station is closed. If the standby forecaster
can’t be reached, the CP will use the 71 OSS/OSW recall roster to notify the flight commander,
NCOIC, or any other forecaster.

9.12.8. The CP will address the WF and the 26 OWS on all OPREP-3s submitted for weather
related incidents or phenomena such as aircraft weather diversions, aircraft damages, injuries,
flight control problems, or significant impacts to student training IAW AFI 10-206, Operational
Reporting, and AETC Sup.

9.13. 71 FTW/XPE. The 71 FTW/XPE will coordinate and execute semiannual severe weather
exercises, tailored to seasonal weather concerns. During these exercises, the timeliness of
personnel notification and the response capability to severe weather events by base agencies will
be evaluated. Actual severe weather events meet this requirement.

9.14. 71 FTW/SE. The Chief of Wing Safety will provide aircraft mishap board training for
selected weather personnel. Notify the WF when it is suspected that weather may have caused or
contributed to aircraft damage, either in-flight or on the ground.

9.15. 71 CS. The 71 CS will:

9.15.1. Through the 71 CS and Contractor maintenance sections accomplish all repair and
preventative maintenance in accordance with appropriate technical orders on WF equipment
located on Vance AFB and Kegelman Auxiliary Field as listed by priority in the table below:

9.15.2. During duty hours, response time for maintenance personnel is 30 minutes to Vance
AFB and 1 hour to Kegelman. During non-duty hours, response time is 1 hour to Vance AFB
and 2 hours to Kegelman.

9.15.3. In the event of two or more simultaneous outages, the above list will serve as a general
priority order of repair; however, the situation may warrant a different order of repair.
Maintenance personnel will contact the WF to see which equipment has the highest priority for
the situation. Additionally, Air Traffic Control and landing systems will normally have priority
over meteorological equipment. An exception to this policy is the WSR-88D, NEXRAD
Weather Radar, which is operationally controlled by the National Weather Service in Norman,
Oklahoma. Weather equipment will not be taken out of commission for maintenance without the
consent of the duty forecaster.

9.15.4. Receive and disseminate outage reports in accordance with existing directives and
regulations.

                        MISSION EXECUTION FORECAST (MEF)




A2.1. Airfield portion of MEF. The first portion of the MEF is for the airfield. Information of
this portion of the MEF includes date, valid period, MEF # and amendment, time of last update,
amendment reason (if any), forecaster, body of MEF, anticipated watches, warnings, and
advisories, temperatures, freezing level, solar/lunar data, space weather impacts, and an hour by
hour listing of temperatures and pressure during the valid period.

A2.2. Body of MEF. Formatted similar to a TAF, the MEF will be written in “TAF-like” code
to include wind direction in three-digit degrees, speed and gust (if any) in knots, weather
phenomena (if any), visibility in SM, sky condition reportable per AFMAN 15-111, table 9.7,
and any significant aviation hazards or relevant mission-limiting parameter.

A2.2.1. Significant aviation hazards and/or mission limiting parameters will be highlighted in
red text. These conditions include max expected cross winds 10kts or above, wind shear, any
icing, and any turbulence.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                     63

A2.2.2. If significant aviation hazard or relevant mission-limiting parameters are expected to
occur throughout the entire MEF period, they will be written below the MEF and highlighted in
red.

A2.2.3. Significant aviation hazards and/or mission limiting parameters will be written in
abbreviated English, rather than TAF-code. This is to alleviate confusion between 5 and 6
groups in the METAR and the TAF format. For example, moderate turbulence from the surface
to 6,000 feet will be written as MDT TURB SFC-060. Light rime icing between 3,000 and 7,000
feet will be written as LGT RIME ICG 030-060. Max expected cross winds of 24 knots will be
written as MAX X-WND 24KT. Wind shear conditions from the surface to 3,000 feet will be
written as WIND SHEAR SFC-030. These significant aviation hazards are not required when
TSRA is mentioned in the same BECMG/TEMPO group, as they are all implied within
thunderstorm activity.

A2.2.4. Ceilings will be written with base and tops. For example, broken at 18,000 feet through
22,000 feet will be written as BKN180-220.

A2.3. Anticipated Watches, Warnings, Advisories. Up to six watches, warnings, and
advisories can be selected that are expected to occur during the valid time of the MEF.

A2.4. SFC Temperatures. Max and minimum temperatures during the valid time of the MEF
in both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius. Temperatures 100F (38C) and above are
highlighted in red and 32F (0C) and below in blue.

A2.5. VAFB Freezing Level. Freezing level above KEND prior to 1200L and after 1200L in
thousands of feet above ground level.

A2.6. Solar/Lunar Data.

A2.6.1. SS. Sunset in 24-hour time

A2.6.2. SR. Sunrise in 24-hour time

A2.6.3. MS. Moonset in 24-hour time

A2.6.4. MR. Moonrise in 24-hour time. In the event that the moonset is the following day, the
time will be formatted as XX/YYYY where XX is the date and YYYY is the time in 24-hour
format. In the event that moonrise occurred on the previous day, and will not occur again until
the following day, ** will be used.

A2.6.5. Illum. Max illumination of the sky caused by the moon after sunset.

A2.7. Space Weather Impacts. HF, UHF, and GPS are color coded green, yellow, and red
based on AFWA’s Space Weather bulletins and guidance. Green indicates no degradation,
yellow indicates temporary degradation, and red indicates severe or total loss of
communications.

A2.8. Flight Level Data. Direction (three digit code), speed (in knots in two- or three-digit
code), temperatures (in Celsius) are given for the surface and 9 significant flight levels. There is
a combined data given for quick reading, and a Delta-T for the flight levels. Climb winds are
given from 6,000 feet and up. When wind speeds are between 75 and 99 knots, they are coded
yellow. Wind speeds of 100 knots and above are coded red. Contrails are written in thousands
of feet in three-digit flight level code and highlighted red.

A2.9. Hour by hour data. Time (in Zulu), altimeter (ALSTG in inches of mercury), PA (in
thousands of feet), and temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit) are given for every hour the MEF
is valid.
VANCEAFBINSTRUCTION15-101 15 APRIL 2010                                                      65




A2.10. Mission portion of MEF. The second half of the MEF is for the low level routes, air
refueling routes, and MOAs. These forecasts are broken down by area and flight level, and
include wind direction and speed (in knots), temperature (in Celsius), visibility (in SM), cloud
conditions (if none, then “NO CLDS AT FL” is written), significant weather (if any), turbulence,
icing, and thunderstorms.

A2.10.1. A remarks section is available for each time frame as well for any significant weather
phenomena and is written in abbreviated English. For example, thunderstorms with 5 miles of
visibility temporarily affecting the eastern half of SR241 between 12 and 14 Zulu would be
written as: TEMPO 1214 5 -TSRA SCT070CB BKN100-140 EAST 1/2 of SR241.

A2.10.2. Turbulence, icing, and thunderstorms will be highlighted yellow if expected to occur.
Otherwise “NEG” will be coded for “no” or “negative” impact. Each category will be written in
abbreviated English, not TAF-code. For example, turbulence will be written as MDT-SVR SFC-

060. Icing will be written as, LGT RIME 060-090. Thunderstorms will be written as ISOLD
MT400 for isolated storms with max expected tops in hundreds of feet. If any of these
conditions are expected to be temporary, a time-frame will be given as well. For example
thunderstorms only expected to be temporary between 21 and 23 Zulu will be written as 21-23Z.

A2.10.3. This format will continue for the rest of the Mission portion of the MEF as shown
below.

Station Identifier. KEND

Type and Time of Observation. METAR 1055Z. METAR observations are regularly scheduled
“hourly” between 55 and 59 minutes after every hour. The time of a METAR is the time the last
element was observed. SPECI observations are “special” observations taken when any of the
criteria listed in Table 2.2 is observed to occur. The time of the SPECI is the time the criteria is
first observed.

Wind. 19012G25KT. Direction (magnetic) from which the wind is blowing. Reported in tens
of degrees using three digits. In the example above, the wind is blowing from 190 degrees.
Speed is encoded in two digits (or three for winds of 100 knots or more). In the example above,
the wind speed is 12 knots. Gusts are encoded in two digits (three for gusts of 100 knots or
more). In the example above, the wind has gusted to 25 knots during the period of observation
(10 minutes).

Visibility. 1 ½. Visibility is reported in statute miles and fractions.

Present Weather. -TSRA. Weather or obscuring phenomena occurring at the station is encoded
in the body of the observation (light thunderstorms and rain as indicated in the example above).
Weather observed at a distance but not occurring at the station is encoded in the remark (RMK)
section of the observation.

Sky Condition. SCT015 OVC030. Layer amounts are reported in octas; SKC=Clear, FEW=1 to
2/8ths, SCT=3 to 4/8ths, BKN=5 to 7/8ths, OVC=8/8ths. Encoded in ascending order up to the
lowest overcast layer. “VV” indicates vertical visibility when a surface-based obscuring
phenomenon (e.g., dense fog) obscures the entire sky. Heights are given in hundreds of feet
using three digits. A ceiling is considered as the height of the lowest BKN or OVC layer aloft,
or the vertical visibility (VV) into a surface-based obscuration. A cloud layer followed by “CB”
indicates cumulonimbus.

Temperature and Dewpoint. 31/22 Reported in degrees Celsius. Temperature and dew point is
separated by a solidus.

Altimeter Setting. ALSTG 29.80. Altimeter is in inches of mercury (Hg).

Remarks. RMK PK WND 18031/33 TS ALQDS MOV E. Remarks are included to expand
upon elements in the body of the observation and follow the remark (RMK) indicator.
Movement of significant features will be indicated by the contraction “MOV,” followed by the
direction towards which the feature is moving. Distances (from the station) of significant
features are in statute miles. In the example above, the peak wind (PK WND) during the
preceding hour was from 180 degrees, 31 knots, and occurred at 33 minutes past the hour. A
thunderstorm (TS) is observed in all quadrants (ALQDS every direction in relation to the station)
and is moving (MOV) towards the east (E).

Additive local remarks. 87F/71F ITS 97F PA +1262 DA +3717. Whenever a warning, watch, or
advisory is valid, the current temperature, dew point, and ITS or ECT temperature will be
provided in local remarks in Fahrenheit. These local remarks are not transmitted long-line, but
are accessible to those on base. Pressure altitude and density altitude are always transmitted
locally, regardless of if a watch, warning, or advisory is valid or not.

Forecast Valid Time Period. FCST 12-12. Time is in reference to Zulu. Forecast period is 24
hours, except for amendments. Amendments are valid from the whole hour during which the
amendment is issued, until the end of the regular forecast period. In the example above, if an
amendment was issued at 1512Z, the valid time of the amended forecast would read ‘15-12.’

Wind. 15012G25KT. Direction (magnetic) from which the wind is expected to blow. Reported
in tens of degrees using three digits. In the example above, the wind is forecast to blow from
150 degrees. Speed is encoded in two digits (or three for winds of 100 knots or more). In the
example above, the forecast wind speed is 12 knots. Gusts are encoded in two digits (three for
gusts of 100 knots or more). In the example above, wind gusts of 25 knots are forecast.

Visibility. 5. Visibility is reported in statute miles and fractions.

Forecast Weather. -RA. Weather or obscuring phenomena expected to occur at the station is
encoded immediately after the visibility. ‘NSW’ (no significant weather) will be used to specify
the termination of all obstructions and/or weather. In this example, light rain is expected.

Sky Condition. SCT090 BKN140 OVC250. Layer amounts are reported in oktas; SKC=Clear,
FEW=1 to 2/8ths, SCT=3 to 4/8ths, BKN=5 to 7/8ths, OVC=8/8ths. Encoded in ascending order
to report all forecast cloud (or obscuring phenomena aloft layers). “VV” indicates vertical

visibility when a surface-based obscuring phenomenon (e.g., dense fog) is expected to obscure
the entire sky. Heights are given in hundreds of feet using three digits. A ceiling is considered
as the height of the lowest BKN or OVC layer aloft, or the vertical visibility (VV) into a surface-
based obscuration.

Minimum Altimeter Setting. ALSTG29.97INS. Altimeter is in inches of mercury (Hg).
Forecasted value is the minimum altimeter expected for the time covered in the applicable
forecast group.

Remarks. LGT TURBC SFC-050. Remarks (if any) are always the last entries for each forecast
group. This remark shows light turbulence surface to 5,000 feet occurring between 12Z and 03Z.
TEMP 30C 2100Z TEMP 22C AT 1100Z. Forecast maximum and minimum temperatures, and
projected hour of occurrence are included on the last line of the forecast. This remark shows the
forecast hi temperature as 30 Celsius at 21Z and the forecast low temperature as 22 Celsius at
11Z.

Temporary (TEMPO) Condition Groups. TEMPO 16-02 1 +SHRA BKN025 OVC050. Used to
indicate a temporary fluctuation to forecast conditions (e.g., intermittent rain). May contain all,
some, or just one of the elements (excluding altimeter setting) listed in the above paragraphs.
When used, the valid time for the forecasted intermittent conditions is from whole hour to whole
hour as listed immediately after the TEMPO identifier. Conditions in a TEMPO group will
occur for less than 1 consecutive hour at a time and will cover less than half of the period
indicated by the time. In the example above, the heavy showers and rain, and the broken and
overcast cloud groups are expected to occur intermittently from 16Z until 02Z.

Change (BECMG) Groups. BECMG 02-03 18012G22KT 7 SKC NSW ALSTG 30.05INS.
Used to indicate a change in forecast conditions expected to occur within a specified time period.
The specified time periods will normally be 1 hour and will never exceed 2 hours. BECMG
groups will contain all elements. The valid time of this group will be from the end time of the
change, to the ending time of either forecast period or until the ending time of a subsequent
BECMG group. In the example above, the change is forecast to begin after 02Z and end at 03Z.
Therefore, the valid time for the conditions within the BECMG group would be from 03Z until
the end of the forecast (12Z) since there are no subsequent BECMG groups. NSW (no
significant weather) is used to specify the termination of all obstructions and/or weather.

Change (FM) Groups. Civilian produced TAFs often utilize the FM change group. FM groups
will contain all elements and are used when all forecast conditions preceding this group are
superseded by the conditions in the FM group (i.e., a relatively fast change in forecast
conditions). Four digit (to the nearest minute) resolution will be used in the FM group. In the
following example the Dallas/Ft Worth forecast was issued on the 8th at 1125Z and is valid from
12Z on the 8th to 12Z on the 9th. At 1600Z the conditions in the first line of the TAF will be
superseded by the conditions listed on the FM line.

Statement Type and Number. VANCE AFB WEATHER WATCH (warning or advisory)
07\002. Numbered sequentially in five digits. The first two digits represent the current month,
while the last three digits represent the sequential number for the watch. In the example above,
the watch is the second (002) weather watch to be issued during the month of July (07).
Watches, warnings, and advisories are all numbered independently of one another (e.g., the first
watch in July will be numbered 07-001, as will the first warning and first advisory).

Valid period. 03/2200Z (03/1700L) TO 04/0600Z (04/0100L). The valid time is in reference to
Zulu and local times. The valid period, not the issue time, is the time that weather criteria
specified in a watch, warning, or advisory is expected to occur.

Message Text. THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR LIGHTNING TO OCCUR WITHIN 5NM OF
VANCE AFB DURING THE VALID TIME. A WARNING WILL BE ISSUED LATER IF
REQUIRED. The text is self-explanatory and will describe the potential conditions expected. In
warnings, the text will identify the effect (if any) that the warning has upon other watches and/or
warnings which may have been in effect at the time of issuance. For example, if a warning for
large hail is issued while a previously issued watch is in effect, the warning would include the
following statement and the watch would be cancelled and replaced by the warning: “THIS
WARNING UPGRADES WEATHER WATCH XX-XXX.”

Transmission Time/Forecaster’s Initials. 13/AJW. Indicates 13 minutes past the issue hour.
