SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The
primary change made to this supplement is that it has been greatly reduced due to the fact that
many of the previously noted items are now covered in AFKAG- 1N Air Force Communications
Security (COMSEC) Operations and AFI 33-201V2. Updates paragraphs 3.3.23. and 16.7.1.
Updates Attachments 1 and 9.
3.3.23. Follow the COMSEC Training and Assessment Schedule (Attachment 9). This plan
provides a month-by-month outline of everything the COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) is
required to accomplish.
4.2.1. (Added) The unit CRO must maintain a copy of the waiver in his/her COMSEC book.
6.4. (Added) Operating Instructions (OIs) will be updated every 3 years or when changes are
required, whichever comes first.
10.3.1. (Added) All COMSEC material and aids received from CA626001 will be inventoried,
regardless of their accounting legend code.
16.7. (Added) Monthly routine COMSEC issue will be held on the last Wednesday of every
month from 0800 to 1200, unless a change in the issue schedule is required by the Main
Account.
16.7.1. (Added) If an issue schedule change is required, affected COMSEC units will be
notified as soon as practical.
16.7.2. (Added) If a unit cannot pickup COMSEC material on the scheduled issue day, prior
approval must be obtained through the COMSEC manager.
16.7.2.1. (Added) If prior approval is not obtained, a memorandum signed by the violating
unit’s commander will be required explaining why the COMSEC material could not be picked up
on the date and time appointed.
18.4.1. (Added) Clearance verification must be accomplished during the first week of the
month. Update the access list whenever changes are required or at least annually (February).
19.4.4.5. (Added) List CROs on the SF 700, Security Container Information, when a
combination change is accomplished. Attach a copy of the most current access list to the SF 700
to act as a continuation sheet for the SF 700. Completely fill out the SF 700 each time the
combination is changed, to include name and signature of the individual making the combination
change.
19.4.4.6. (Added) The "checked by" column on the SF 702, Security Container Checksheet,
can be completed by the same individual locking the container, if no one else is available.
21.3.1. (Added) AFCOMSEC Forms 16, COMSEC Account Daily Shift Inventory, should be
printed on the first duty day of each month by the CRO whether manually or utilizing DMD
Power Station software. If you manually manage your monthly COMSEC accounting forms,
double check for accuracy and ensure there are no clerical errors from month to month. If you
do not receive COMSEC material monthly, you are still required to print a new monthly
AFCOMSEC Form 16.

21.4.4. (Added) If the inventory becomes messy or unreadable, coordinate any corrections or
replacements with the Wing COMSEC Manager. Do not reaccomplish inventories!
44.3.3.1. (Added) All personnel on the COMSEC access list (except your commander) will
review the written portion of the EAP and "dry run" task cards during May and November. This
can be documented on the semi-annual self-assessment report.
