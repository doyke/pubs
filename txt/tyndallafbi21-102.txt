SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Responsibilities and evaluation requirements to reflect the use of the Mode 4 Systems Reliability
Program Checklist.
1. GENERAL.
   1.1. These programs are intended to increase systems reliability and ensure survivability in a
   hostile electronic threat environment. It is imperative aircrews have the latest operational
   IFF Mode 4 codes available. These systems must be maintained at the highest level of
   reliability possible. This program is effective immediately and applies to all equipped with
   IFF Mode 4. Commanders/supervisors are responsible for enforcing the procedures and
   policies contained herein.
   1.2. Guidance herein applies to the F-22 MDS.
2. 325th OPERATIONS SUPPORT SQUADRON (325 OSS) RESPONSIBILITIES.

    2.1. The wing Electronic Combat Pilot (ECP) will:
       2.1.1. Ensure all aircraft pilots are briefed on the requirements of this OI.
    2.2. Prior to evaluation by ground crew personnel, pilots will:
       2.2.1. Ensure compliance with the current 325th Fighter Wing Raptor Admin Standards.
       2.2.2. Perform the systems built-in checks as required.
3. AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE UNITS (AMU) RESPONSIBILITIES.
    3.1. The AMU IFF Mode 4 monitor will:
       3.1.1. Forward an appointment letter for a primary and alternate Mode 4 monitor to the
       325 MXG Avionics Manager (325 MXG/MXQ). Appointment letters will be updated
       annually during the month of January and upon change of assigned personnel.
       3.1.2. Maintain an IFF Mode 4 program book. The program book will contain a copy of
       this instruction, the program monitor appointment letter, the last 12 months of weekly
       Mode 4 ground test results, recorded on the TAFB Form 16. Forms are available digitally
       on the internet at https://e-publishing.tyndall.af.mil/IMTs.htm.
       3.1.3. Document weekly IFF Mode 4 reports using Form 16 format.
           3.1.3.1. Ensure all discrepancies found during weekly IFF Mode 4 evaluations are
           documented in the Integrated Maintenance information System (IMIS). Discrepancies
           will be troubleshot and corrected as required. The results and job control number will
           be included on the Form 16.
           3.1.3.2. Forward completed copies of Form 16 to the 325 MXG Avionics Manager

    4.1. LCL 325FW-106, Mode 4 Systems Reliability Program Checklist, will be used as a
    procedural checklist for Mode 4 ground evaluations.
    4.2. During weekly checks, IFF Mode 4 will be evaluated by the owning AMU prior to an
    aircraft leaving the parking area. This will allow for maintenance “red-ball” repair actions as
    necessary. The 100 percent in 60 days requirement, for all assigned aircraft, will be
    accomplished by performing ground checks at least 1-day a week, on the first goes of the
    day.
5. DEPLOYMENTS REQUIREMENTS.
