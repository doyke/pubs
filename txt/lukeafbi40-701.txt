     who travel overseas without command sponsorship are at risk of reduced or non-available
     medical care, loss of benefits such as base privileges or housing, and may incur significant
     personal expense when further relocation is needed. Sponsors who intentionally bypass the
     clearance process risk disciplinary action. Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRC)
     are both administrative and clinical in nature. Family Member Relocation Clearance
     Coordinators (FMRCC) carry out the administrative functions of EFMP-M processes.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Installation Commander.
        2.1.1. Ensures that all active duty sponsors comply with requirements to report to EFMP-

        members to activities, buildings, housing, parking, transportation, and programs IAW

        are notified of a PCS to a location overseas or anytime a family member with special
        needs is preparing to PCS. An FMRC review must be completed within 6 months of
        family member travel. All outbound sponsors complete the outbound EFMP-M

        available but are with an off-base provider, the FMRCC will request a copy of the
        record for the SGH to review. Records not in English are required to be translated to
        English at the member’s expense.
            3.2.1.2.1. A DD Form 2792, Exceptional Family Member Medical Summary,

            medical providers providing or overseeing mental health treatment of a family
            member must complete Addendum A-2 of the DD Form 2792. For medical
            documentation, the DD Form 2792 should be completed by the provider with the

            3.2.1.2.2. Medical records will be requested.
                3.2.1.2.2.1. The FMRCC will order medical records from local MDG clinic.
                3.2.1.2.2.2. If records are not available in the local area, the FMRCC will
                request that the adult family member provide copies of their medical records.
            3.2.1.2.3. All dependents age 2 and over must have AF Form 1466D completed.
            This form can be completed by taking it to the treating civilian dentist. The dental
            clinic may request a dental examination prior to completing the form. For short-
            notice situations, the family member may request a courtesy examination by the
            56th Dental Squadron. Such exams will be provided on a space-available basis
            and cannot be guaranteed.

              resides. Private off-base schools may complete the DD Form 2792-1 if the child
              attends a private school. If the child receives special education services, the
              Individualized Education Plan (IEP) must accompany the DD Form 2792-1. The
              Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) must be included for any child
              receiving Early Intervention Services.
       3.2.2. Once all documents necessary for the FMRCC have been received, an
       appointment will be scheduled with the SNC and SGH. All dependents accompanying
       the sponsor must be present during the appointment.
          3.2.2.1. If during the appointment, a medical condition is identified that meets
          criteria for enrollment in EFMP-M, an adult family member will be notified of
          mandated enrollment.
          3.2.2.2. The SNC and SGH will complete page 3 of the AF Form 1466. If special
          needs are identified and the sponsor is already enrolled in EFMP-M, the SGH will
          complete the bottom page of the AF Form 1466. The sponsor’s paperwork will be
          scanned into Q-base and sent via Q-base to the gaining base’s area of responsibility.
          Once a travel recommendation has been received, the sponsor will be contacted to
          pick up the AF Form 1466 packet.
          3.2.2.3. If special needs are not identified and the sponsor is not enrolled in EFMP-
          M, the AF Form 1466 is given to an adult family member with the recommendation
          for travel at government expense.
          3.2.2.4. A copy of all paperwork provided by the family will be made and filed in
          “Outgoing” file by sponsor’s last name.

          and 2. A spouse’s signature can only be accepted on pages 1 and 2 if a power of

          out processing.
          3.3.1.2. All adult family members must sign page 1 giving permission for their
          paperwork to be released.

        SNC to verify completeness.

     sponsor’s name until documentation is received by the EFMP-M office that warrants
     disenrollment.
        3.5.1.1. For dependents enrolled due to medical conditions, the sponsor will provide
        a new DD Form 2792 completed by the specialty care provider indicating specialty
        care is no longer required for the enrolled dependent.
        3.5.1.2. Dependents enrolled due to special education services will have a new DD
        Form 2792-1 completed by school officials stating the child no longer has an IEP. If
        the child has graduated from high school, the sponsor or parent will provide a copy of
        the high school diploma.

        dependent.
     3.5.2. Children enrolled in EFMP-M but who are not living with the sponsor due to
     custody is not a reason for disenrollment. The sponsor will remain Q-coded for the
     dependents as long as they remain military dependents with identified needs.
     3.5.3. The SNC will review the paperwork provided to ensure no additional
     medical/educational needs exist that meet DoD criteria for enrollment. The SGH may be
     consulted for input. If a sponsor has more than one dependent with identified needs, only
     the dependent that does not meet criteria will be disenrolled. However, the Q-code will
     remain with the sponsor’s name as long as the sponsor has an identified special needs
     family member.
     3.5.4. If criteria are not met for ongoing enrollment, the SNC will dis-enroll the family
     member.
     3.5.5. In Q-base, the family member’s information will be edited by stating the family
     member does not have any special needs. If there are not any additional family members
     identified, the sponsor’s case will be archived. A new family member sheet will be
     printed and placed in the SNAC record.

     shredded 2 years after closure.

4. Enrollment in EFMP-Medical.
   4.1. When a family member is identified for enrollment in EFMP-M, the provider will
   submit paperwork to the SNC. The sponsor and identified adult family member are to be
   notified of the required reporting and the referral. The referral source will complete a DD
   Form 2792 (medical) and/or DD Form 2792-1 (educational) on the referred family member.
   The FMRCC will contact the sponsor and adult family member for an enrollment
   appointment.
   4.2. A SNAC chart will be created for each Q-coded family member. The chart will be
   labeled with sponsor’s first name, last name, and the last four numbers of their SSN.
   4.3. The SNAC hard copy chart is created with sponsor and/or adult family member
   completing the Special Needs Identification and Assignment process form (AF Form 2523,
   Exceptional Family Member Program-Medical (EFMP-M) Information Form) and Privacy
   Act Statement (DD Form 2005, Privacy Act Statement – Health Care Records). Also

   ALC be placed with the sponsor’s name.

   be documented in Q-base.
   4.6. Copies of DD Forms 2792 pertaining to minor dependents are provided to the sponsor,
   parent or legal guardian for use as needed. If mental health or substance abuse treatment is
   documented for a minor dependent aged 13 or older, written consent of the minor must be
   obtained prior to release of the DD Form 2792 to the sponsor, parent or legal guardian.
   4.7. Copies of DD Forms 2792 pertaining to adult dependents are only provided to the
   patient described on the DD Form 2792, unless the identified patient provides express written
   permission to release it to others outside the DoD healthcare network, including the sponsor.
