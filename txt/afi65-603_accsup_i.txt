1. Official Representation Funds (ORF).
    1.1. The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to approve the use of appropriated funds for uphold-
    ing the standing and prestige of the United States by extending official courtesies to certain officials
    and dignitaries of the United States and foreign countries. The Secretary of the Air Force may autho-
    rize the limited use of representation funds to commanders in the field for any purpose considered
    appropriate according to established Air Force and DoD policies.
       1.1.1. Only the SECAF or the CSAF may extend invitations to foreign dignitaries to visit the
       United States at the expense (cost of travel, lodging, and all others involved in getting them to a
       location) of the Department of the Air Force. MAJCOMs and below are not authorized to use ORF
       for foreign dignitary travel and lodging expenses for visits to US installations.
    1.2. Unless specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Air Force or designee, commanders may
    spend ORFs only for official courtesies and purposes expressly authorized in this instruction.
       1.2.1. SAF/AA is responsible for reviewing requests for exceptions to this instruction. All such
       requests must be submitted through HAF/RM prior to expenditures of ORF.
    1.3. Commanders authorized ORF are referred to as designated authorities.

2. Designated Authority Responsibilities.
    2.1. Ensure courtesies are modest, not wasteful or extravagant from the perspective of the general
    public, and comply with the socially acceptable mores of American society while jointly serving the
    policy objectives of the United States and the interests of the taxpayer.
       2.1.1. Invite the minimum number of guests necessary to extend proper courtesy to the guest(s) of
       honor. When honoring guests from outside the DoD, observe the ratios in paragraph 3 of DoD to
       non-DoD attendees.
    2.2. Ensure all ORF managers and individuals involved in the planning, execution and processing of
    ORF understand and comply with this instruction; are properly trained in inventory management;
    complete government purchase card (GPC) training; and adhere to AFI 64-117 concerning GPC use
    and requirements.
    2.3. Review all events for propriety and provide written approval prior to use of ORF. Approval let-
    ters must be kept as part of the official record of the event.
    2.4. Keep records for each event documenting the following using the format prescribed in Attach-
    ment 2:
       2.4.1. Purpose of and prior-approval for the event.
       2.4.2. All DoD and non-DoD invitees with duty titles.
       2.4.3. Individual(s) being hosted.
       2.4.4. Total cost.
       2.4.5. Any personnel invited but not paid for with ORF.
       2.4.6. Location and date of the event.
    2.5. Designated authorities with joint or unified command responsibility may not use funds provided
    by the Secretary of the Air Force to host events in their joint or unified capacity. Reference CJCSI
AFI65-603_ACC_I 5 AUGUST 2006                                                                               5


   7201.01A, Combatant Commanders’ Official Representation Funds, for guidance regarding events of
   this type.
   2.6. Designated authorities may delegate hosting responsibilities in instances when they, as autho-
   rized hosts, are unavailable. The delegated authority must be in writing, result from extenuating cir-
   cumstances, and should normally be made to the next highest ranking individual in the organizational
   chain of command.

3. ORF Ratios.
   3.1. When providing modest courtesies using ORF, ensure attendance follows these ratios:
       3.1.1. Parties of less than 30 persons--not more than 80 percent will be DoD personnel.
       3.1.2. Parties of 30 or more persons--not more than 50 percent will be DoD personnel.
   3.2. Foreign military personnel assigned to the host activity or who are assigned to an organization
   which operates as a subordinate part of a United States Command are counted as DoD personnel for
   ratio-computing purposes.
NOTE: DoD personnel are active duty military and civilian employees of DoD and the Coast Guard; stu-
dents of the military academies; reservists on active duty; members of the National Guard; former military
and civilian employees of DoD not holding a position of prominence in the non-DoD community; and
spouses of those in the preceeding categories. Former DoD military and civilian personnel who held the
rank of 4-star general, or equivalent, are considered prominent U.S. citizens and should be counted as
non-DoD, as well as their spouse.
   3.3. The practice of inviting unnecessary personnel to meet an exact ratio is specifically prohibited.
   3.4. DoD personnel in excess of the ratios may attend functions by paying the pro rata share of the
   total expense.
       3.4.1. Pro rata expenses are determined by dividing the entire cost of the event by the number of
       attendees. All attendees, above the authorized ratios or who do not meet the intent for using ORF,
       must pay the pro rata costs when attending events.
       Example 1) An official guest list contains 50 personnel requiring a 50% ratio. 10 personnel are
       authorized guests. Applying the 1 to 1 ratio only 10 DoD personnel may be properly funded with
       ORF. These 20 people (10 authorized and 10 DoD) comprise 40% of the total guest list and, there-
       fore, ORF may cover 40% of the total cost of the function. The remaining 60% of the cost must be
       paid either on a pro rata basis by the additional 30 DoD persons or divided among all DoD attend-
       ees.
       Example 2) An official guest list contains 25 people requiring a 20% ratio. 3 personnel on the list
       are authorized guests. Applying the 1 to 4 ratio only 12 DoD personnel may also be properly
       funded with ORF. These 15 people (3 authorized and 12 DoD) comprise 60% of the total guest list
       and, therefore, ORF may cover 60% of the total cost of the function. The remaining 40% must be
       paid either on a pro rata basis by the additional 10 DoD personnel or divided among all DoD
       attendees.
   3.5. Deviations from the maximum number of DoD participants paid from ORF is not authorized
   without the advance approval of SAF/AA.
6                                                                   AFI65-603_ACC_I 5 AUGUST 2006


NOTE: When an event’s actual attendee deviation is more than 5%, all documentation concerning the
event and an explanation of the deviation must be forwarded through the MAJCOM to SAF/AA for
review.
