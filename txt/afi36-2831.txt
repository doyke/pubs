1. Award Description and Eligibility:
     1.1. Award Description. In 1984 the President of the United States established the CINC’s
     Annual Award for Installation Excellence to recognize the outstanding efforts of the people
     who operate and maintain Department of Defense installations and who have done the best
     with their resources to support the mission. The award encourages commanders to create
     an environment that promotes innovative and creative ways of enhancing base-level services,
     facilities, and quality-of-life.
     1.2. Award Eligibility. The previous year’s Installation Excellence and Special Recognition
     Award winners cannot compete for the current award year. The award is given for
     achievements made during the previous 12-month period, from 1 October and ending 30
     September, commonly referred to as the fiscal year. The Air Force presents the award in two
     categories:
        1.2.1. Installation Excellence Award. All major and minor installations are eligible. All
        units, including tenants attached to the installation compete together as part of the host
        installation.
        1.2.2. Special Recognition Award. All squadrons, flights, sections, teams, individuals,
        programs, and projects assigned to the winning installation may submit nomination
        packages.
2. Criteria:
     2.1. Installation Excellence Award. Each Major Command (MAJCOM) may nominate one
     installation within its organizational structure to compete for the Installation Excellence
     Award. Using the functional areas listed in paragraph 3.1.5. as headings, packages must show
     how the nominee introduced innovative programs that helped create and sustain excellent
     base operations during the nomination period. For those areas not functional specific, an
     additional heading titled “other activities” may be used and will be part of the overall score.
     Specific achievements during this period should explain how the installation:
        2.1.1. Improved the work environment or physical plant.
        2.1.2. Improved the quality of life.
        2.1.3. Enhanced productivity of the work force.
        2.1.4. Increased customer satisfaction or improved customer service.
        2.1.5. Encouraged bottom-to-top communication and team problem solving.
        2.1.6. Promoted unit cohesiveness and recognized outstanding individual efforts.
        2.1.7. Initiated sustainable practices according to Executive Order 13423; Strengthening
        Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management”.
            2.1.7.1. Energy efficiency and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
            2.1.7.2. Use of renewable energy.
AFI36-2831 12 APRIL 2006                                                                     3


          2.1.7.3. Reduction in water consumption intensity.

          2.1.7.5. Pollution prevention, including reduction or elimination of the use of toxic
          and hazardous chemicals and materials.
          2.1.7.6. Compliant and cost-effective waste prevention and recycling programs to
          meet regulatory, DoD policy and EO requirements.
          2.1.7.7. Increased diversion of solid waste.

          alternative fuels and the further reduction of petroleum consumption.
          2.1.7.10. Electronics stewardship.
   2.2. Special Recognition Award. Once the installation finalists are announced, both bases
   may nominate an unlimited number of squadrons, flights, sections, teams, individuals,
   programs and projects for the Special Recognition Award. Packages may include tenant units
   who made significant contributions to the winning base. MAJCOMs must review all
   submissions to ensure only those deserving consideration are submitted to AF/A7CR. Using
   the following criteria as headings, specific achievements during this period should explain
   how the nominee(s):
       2.2.1. Significantly enhanced the installation’s working conditions, quality of life, or
       customer service.
       2.2.2. Achieved improvement, greater efficiency, or higher standards through focusing

4. Nomination Procedures:
     4.1. Suspense. Nominate projects and programs implemented during the previous 12-month
     period beginning 1 October and ending 30 September, commonly referred to as the fiscal
     year. Make sure that entries for both the Installation Excellence and Special Recognition
     competitions arrive at HQ USAF/A7C, 1260 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-
     1260 by the first Friday in November. All nomination packages must be submitted on the
     current version of AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award. Submit all nomination packages
     electronically.
     4.2. Installation Excellence Competition. MAJCOMs and DRUs must submit a nomination
     package with a cover letter under the heading, “Nomination for The Commander-in-Chiefs
     Annual Award for Installation Excellence.” This four-page nomination must address the
     criteria described in paragraph 2.1 If the installation becomes one of two finalists, then it
     must submit the additional documents listed in Attachment 2.
     4.3. Special Recognition Competition. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must submit a package
     with a cover letter under the heading, “Nominations for (Fiscal Year) Commander-in-Chief’s
     Special Recognition for Installation Excellence Award.” The nomination must clearly show
     how the nominee’s innovative and imaginative thinking led to noteworthy achievements.
     Limit the nomination narrative to one page, bullet format. Ensure each nominee meets the
     criteria in paragraph 2.2
5. Selection Process:
     5.1. Phase I. The FEWG reviews the Installation Excellence nomination packages from a
     functional perspective and develops recommendations for the IERC.
        5.1.1. The FEWG members score each nomination package from a functional
        perspective as described in paragraph 3.1.5. There may be cases where an installation
        won’t have every functional area; therefore the rater will ensure a competitive score is
        awarded based on a total average for that function. After, the FEWG members have
        scored their functional areas, the FEWG will meet as a working group under the direction
        of the FEWG Chair to consolidate evaluations and build a decision brief recommending
        the two finalists to the IERC.
        5.1.2. HQ USAF/A7CR Program Manager serves as the facilitator during the scoring
        process and acts as the liaison between the FEWG and the IERC.
        5.1.3. The IERC will receive the FEWG’s decision brief, consider the FEWG functional
        evaluations and overall recommendations and select the two finalists.
        5.1.4. Once the installation finalists have been announced, the parent MAJCOM will
        collect and screen special recognition packages. Nominations meeting the criteria outline
        in paragraph 2 and determined worthy of SECDEF recognition will be forwarded to
        AF/A7CR.
     5.2. Phase II. The IESB conducts a two day visit with each installation finalist to determine
     the Installation Excellence and Special Recognition Award winner(s). During the visit, the
     IESB will validate and approve a maximum of 100 special recognition nominations from
     each base. After the Installation Excellence Award winner is chosen, only the IESB
AFI36-2831 12 APRIL 2006                                                                       7


   approved Special Recognition nominations from the winning installation will be forwarded
   for final SECDEF approval and signature.
       5.2.1. The IESB conducts first-hand observations of the programs that create and sustain
       installation excellence. The IESB team members visit the designated areas listed in Table
       1.

       Excellence and Special Recognition award winners to the Chief of Staff (CSAF) and the
       Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) for approval.
       5.2.3. After SECAF approves the recommendations, HQ USAF/A7CA sends the
       package to DUSD (I&E).
       5.2.4. Once authority is granted to release the names of Service winners, HQ USAF
       A4/7 will contact the MAJCOM/CC of both finalists and provide results.
