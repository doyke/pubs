                                    GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the T-38.
With the complementary references cited, this instruction prescribes standard operational
procedures to be used by all pilots operating T-38 aircraft.
1.1. (AETC)Scope. Within AETC, certain procedures may be identified as only applicable to
or not applicable (NA) to specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT), Euro-North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) joint jet pilot training (ENJJPT), undergraduate flying training
(UFT) (both SUPT and ENJJPT), pilot instructor training (PIT) for UFT instructor duty, or
introduction to fighter fundamentals (IFF). Procedures may also be identified as applicable to
aircraft modified under the propulsion modernization program (PMP) or by aircraft model.
1.2. Pilot's Responsibility. This instruction, in conjunction with other governing directives,
prescribes T-38 procedures under most circumstances, but is not to be used as a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the
safe and effective operation of the aircraft.
1.3. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval of the MAJCOM
Director of Operations (A3) unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates
otherwise, in which case the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft.
1.4. References:
   1.4.1. The primary references for T-38 operations are Technical Order (TO) 1T-38A-1,
   Flight Manual, USAF Series T-38A and AT-38B Aircraft; TO 1T-38C-1, Flight Manual,
   USAF Series T-38C Aircraft; AFMAN 11-250, Volume 1, (A)T-38 Flying Fundamentals;
   MCMAN 11-238, Volume 2, T-38 Mission Employment Fundamentals; and this instruction.
   1.4.2. Training units may develop phase manuals from the procedures contained in these
   documents. Phase manuals may be used to augment initial and mission qualification training.
   Phase manuals may expand these basic procedures, but in no case will they be less
   restrictive.
1.5. Recommended Changes and Waivers:
   1.5.1. According to AFPD 11-2, HQ USAF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or
   revisions to this instruction. Submit suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form
   847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the parent MAJCOM through
   standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels. (AF Form 847 is prescribed in AFI 11-215,
   USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out
   the form.)
   1.5.2. The MAJCOM A3 is waiver authority for this instruction. Waiver requests may be
   submitted in message or memo format.
1.6. Distribution. Each pilot is authorized a copy of this instruction.

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by the individual
pilots and the operations functions of organizations.
2.2. General Procedures:
   2.2.1. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment. AFI 11-
   202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, specifies minimum requirements.
   2.2.2. Pilots will compute takeoff and landing data for all flights. MAJCOM-approved tab
   data may be used when available.
   2.2.2. (AETC) T-38 aircrews will use the following procedures for computing takeoff and
   landing data (TOLD): (Note: The numbered Air Force [NAF]/A3 may approve TOLD
   software which complies with this paragraph and will notify HQ AETC/A3FV of all
   approved TOLD software.)
       2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Pilots may use flight manual tabulated data to determine
       TOLD and the following aircraft takeoff gross weights:
           2.2.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) For T-38C (after PMP): 12,800/12,600 pounds dual/solo
           respectively or the actual aircraft gross weight.
           2.2.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) For T-38A/B and T-38C (prior to PMP): 12,700/12,500
           pounds dual/solo respectively or the actual aircraft gross weight.
       2.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) Pilots may use the appropriate flight manual performance
       charts to determine TOLD based on actual aircraft gross weight prior to takeoff as
       follows:
           2.2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Add the aircraft gross weight obtained from the aircraft
           weight and balance (Form F), plus the weight of fuel (4,006 pounds for JP-8), plus the
           weight of liquid oxygen (LOX) (approximately 26 pounds), plus actual aircrew
           equipment and aircrew weight (243 pounds per person maximum), plus external
           stores (according to the flight manual), minus start/taxi fuel (approximately 200
           pounds).
           2.2.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) With squadron supervisor approval, pilots may reduce
           gross weight by burning down fuel to a predetermined useable fuel weight. Reduction
           of gross weight by burning fuel must be completed before taking the runway for
           takeoff and will not include a reduction for fuel used after afterburner light during
           takeoff roll.
   2.2.3. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on use of flight planning software.
   2.2.3. (AETC) Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules. Student pilots will
   only use flight planning software according to current training syllabus guidance.
   2.2.4. The T-38C navigation system with Block 5 software (and later) is certified for
   instrument flight rules (IFR) en route navigation according to FAA’s TSO-C129A, Airborne
   Supplemental Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS); Class

   Minimum Operational Performance Standards for Airborne Supplemental Navigation
   Equipment Using Global Positioning System (GPS), Change 1, located at
   http://www.rtca.org/. The navigation system has been installed according to FAA Advisory
   Circular (AC) 20-130A, Airworthiness Approval of Navigation or Flight Management
   Systems Integrating Multiple Navigation Sensors, and meets the associated requirements of
   AC 20-138A, Airworthiness Approval of Global Navigation Satellite System (BNSS)
   Equipment, and AC 90-45A, Approval of Area Navigation Systems for use in the U.S.
   National               Airspace               System.                 Go               to

   me?OpenFrameSet and click ―by number‖ to find these ACs.
2.3. Map and Chart Preparation:
   2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas.
   2.3.2. Charts. Flight information publication (FLIP) en route charts may be used instead of
   maps on navigational flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Maps:
      2.3.3.1. On low-altitude flights, each pilot in the flight will carry a current map of the
      low altitude route or operating area. The map will be of such scale and quality that terrain
      features, hazards, and chart annotations are of sufficient detail to allow individual
      navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
      2.3.3.2. Prepare maps for low-level according MAJCOM guidance and as directed
      locally. Pilots will highlight all manmade obstacles at or above the planned flight altitude
      and annotate, time and distance tick-marks on low-level maps to ensure positive
      positional awareness of obstacles along the planned route of flight plus or minus 5
      nautical miles (NM).
      2.3.3.2. (AETC) Prepare low-level charts according to the AETC Handout, Navigation
      for Pilot Training, which is available from the HQ AETC/A3F bookstore Web site at
      https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AE-ED-00-55. T-
      38C aircrew will annotate time and distance tick-marks on low-level maps.
      2.3.3.3. Annotate all maps with a route abort altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA for the
      entire route or area at a minimum of 1,000 feet separation from the highest
      obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within the lateral limits of
      the route or training area, but in no case less than 5 NM either side of planned route.
2.4. Briefing and Debriefing:
   2.4.1. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing that will promote safe,
   effective mission accomplishment. In addition, the following guidance applies:
      2.4.1.1. All pilots, crewmembers, and passengers will attend the briefing and debriefing
      unless previously coordinated with unit supervisors.
      2.4.1.2. Briefings will begin at least 1 hour before scheduled takeoff.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          13


     2.4.1.3. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the
     flight.
     2.4.1.4. Use briefing guides to provide the flight lead or briefer with a reference list of
     items which may apply to particular missions. Items listed may be briefed in any
     sequence. Those items understood by all participants may be briefed as ―standard.‖
     Specific items not pertinent to the mission need not be covered.
     2.4.1.5. During the briefing for all low-level missions, emphasize the following items:
     obstacle awareness, ground avoidance, pilot determination of low-altitude comfort level,
     and the avoidance of complacency.
     2.4.1.6. The squadron operations officer will approve dissimilar formations. When
     dissimilar aircraft are flown in formation, proper position (to ensure adequate wingtip
     clearance), responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements will be briefed for each
     phase of flight.
     2.4.1.7. When appropriate, brief an alternate mission for each flight. The alternate
     mission will be less complex than the primary and should parallel the primary mission.
     2.4.1.8. Mission elements and events may be modified and coordinated airborne as long
     as flight safety is not compromised. Unbriefed missions or events will not be flown.
     Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members.
     2.4.1.9. All missions will be debriefed.
  2.4.2. During deployed operations, exercises, and quick-turns, if all flight members attend an
  initial or mass flight briefing, the flight lead on subsequent flights during the same flight duty
  period must brief only those items that have changed from the previous flights.
  2.4.3. Required topics for flight briefing guides are contained in Attachments 3 through 13.
  Units may augment these guides as necessary. The following is a listing of the briefing
  guides in this instruction:
     2.4.3.1. Ground Ops/Takeoff/Departure Briefing Guide (Attachment 3).

2.5. Unit-Developed Checklists and Local Pilot Aids:
   2.5.1. Unit-developed checklists may be used in lieu of flight manual checklists (according
   to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program), if unit-developed checklists contain, as a
   minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable flight manual checklist.
   Crewmembers will still carry a current flight manual checklist and have it immediately
   available on all flights.
   2.5.2. Unit-developed pilot aids will include, as a minimum, the following items:
      2.5.2.1. Briefing guides.

                                           Chapter 3

                         NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Ground Visual Signals. The pilot will ensure that no system that could pose any danger to
the ground crew is activated prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from ground personnel.
When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-218,
Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. The crew chief will repeat
the given signal when it is safe to operate the system.
3.2. Preflight:
   3.2.1. Baggage or equipment will not be carried in an unoccupied T-38 rear cockpit, except
   in approved cargo carriers. Exception: Aircrew flight equipment may be secured in the rear
   cockpit.
   3.2.2. Objects will not be placed on top of the glare shield during start with the canopies
   open.
   3.2.3. Publications, maps, and personal items placed in the cockpit will be secured to avoid
   flight control or throttle interference.
   3.2.4. Place only soft-sided, pliable items under ejection seats. (EXCEPTION: Martin-
   Baker ejection seat-equipped aircraft)
   3.2.5. Cans of oil or hydraulic fluid will not be carried in the aircraft, except in the weapon
   system support pod (WSSP).
   3.2.6. (Added-AETC) Aircrews should use extreme caution when stowing items in the rear
   cockpit. If it is necessary to place items on or near the rear cockpit breaker panels, they
   should not exceed 8 inches in height to prevent interference with the balance weight arm.
   After closing the canopy with items stored near the rear cockpit circuit breaker panels,
   aircrew should visually confirm clearance exists between the balance weight arm and the
   stowed object. When the balance weight arm is fully closed, the bottom of the arm is 10
   inches above the rear cockpit breaker panels.
   3.2.7. (Added-AETC) The aircraft commander will ensure at least one operative flashlight
   is available in each occupied cockpit for night sorties.
   3.2.8. (Added-AETC) G-suits are required for all sorties except instrument or navigation.
3.3. Ground and Taxi Operations. Ground and taxi operations will be conducted in
accordance with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval. The minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Use caution to avoid
   jet blast when canopies are open.
   3.3.2. Ice or Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice or snow conditions until all portions
   of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. When ice or snow are
   present on the taxiway, taxi on the center line with a minimum of 300 feet of spacing.
   3.3.3. Quick Check and Arming. Place hands in view of ground personnel while the quick
   check inspection (or arming/dearming) is in progress. If the intercom system is not used
 16             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   during end of runway (EOR) checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
   the maintenance team chief or weapons load chief to facilitate the use of visual signals. Do
   not taxi in front of aircraft being armed or de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
3.4. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up as appropriate based on weather conditions, runway
conditions, and runway width. If formation takeoffs are planned, wingmen must maintain
wingtip clearance with their element leader. If runway width permits, line up with wingtip
clearance between all aircraft in the flight. Trailing elements will delay engine run up if pilots
cannot ensure wingtip clearance. Place the wingman on the upwind side if the crosswind exceeds
5 knots.
3.5. Before-Takeoff Checks. After the before-takeoff checks have been completed and prior to
takeoff, flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any abnormalities.
   3.5.1. Pilots will remove and properly stow ejection seat and canopy jettison safety pins once
   clear of the aircraft parking area, but not later than completion of the before takeoff checklist
   according to the appropriate flight crew checklist.
   3.5.1. (AETC) Solo student pilots will stop the aircraft at the end of the runway, or an
   approved area, prior to removing or reinstalling their ejection seat and canopy safety pins.
   When not in formation, solo student pilots will make a radio call to the controlling agency
   stating the ejection seat and canopy jettison safety pins are removed and stowed prior to
   being cleared for takeoff.
   3.5.2. Pilots will use the videotape recorder to the maximum extent practical.
   3.5.2. (AETC) As a minimum, use the videotape recorder (VTR) to record mission tasks
   (for example, air-to-air and air-to-surface training; low-level flight; formation and contact
   military operations area [MOA] work; advanced handling characteristics [AHC]); and
   landings.
3.6. Takeoff:
3.6. (AETC)Takeoff. During engine run up, the crewmember not in control of the aircraft will
guard and be ready to assume control of the brakes in case of rudder pedal rod end failure.
   3.6.1. Do not take off when the runway condition reading (RCR) is less than 10.
   3.6.2. Takeoff data will be reviewed and understood by every member of the flight.
   Particular emphasis should be placed on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal situations
   such as short or wet runway, heavy gross weights, nonstandard barrier configurations, and
   abort sequence in formation flights.
   3.6.2. (AETC) AETC pilots will use takeoff performance data for go/no-go decisionmaking
   as follows: (Note: The pilot in command makes the decision to continue or abort a takeoff
   (go/no-go decision) based on available information; for example, the speeds and distances
   determined in preflight planning, environmental factors; runway length and condition; barrier
   capability; required climb gradient; the actual speed when the event occurs; and the severity
   of event. A go/no-go speed is a reference to aid the pilot in decisionmaking.)
       3.6.2.1. (Added-AETC) Operations With a Remotely Controlled BAK-15:
           3.6.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) When decision speed (DS) is less than or equal to refusal
           speed with engine failure (RS-EF), use RS-EF as go/no-go speed. Aborts for other
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                           17


        than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire lights, etc.) initiated between refusal
        speed with both engines operating (RS-BEO) and RS-EF may result in overrunning
        the runway surface or barrier engagement.
        3.6.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) When DS is greater than RS-EF:
            3.6.2.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) If DS is less than or equal to takeoff speed (TOS),
            approval of the OG/CC is required. After receiving approval, takeoffs are allowed
            as long as the performance data results in a valid DS and SETOS. Use TOS as the
            go/no-go speed. The squadron supervisor will brief the aircrew and the supervisor
            of flying (SOF) on the situation and ensure the crew has the most current data.
            Only a rated pilot or a student pilot under the supervision of an instructor pilot
            (IP) in the aircraft may perform the takeoff. Note: For some extreme
            combinations of temperature and pressure altitude, the performance charts will
            not yield a valid DS or SETOS. This occurs on the DS chart where the curves on
            the gross weight plot do not extend far enough upwards and on the SETOS chart
            where the gross weight plot is labeled ―SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFFS NOT
            POSSIBLE.‖ Takeoffs in this situation are prohibited.
            3.6.2.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) If DS is greater than TOS, takeoffs are not
            authorized.
     3.6.2.2. (Added-AETC) Operations Without a BAK-15: (Note: This includes
     operations when the remote control equipment is not operating and the BAK-15 is
     lowered, and operations with the MA-1A.)
        3.6.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) When DS is less than or equal to RS-BEO, use RS-BEO
        as go/no-go speed. Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire
        lights, etc.) initiated above RS-BEO may result in overrunning the runway surface.
        3.6.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) When DS is greater than RS-BEO and less than or equal
        to RS-EF, OG/CC approval is required. Use RS-EF as the go/no-go speed. Only a
        rated pilot or a student pilot under the supervision of an IP in the aircraft may perform
        the takeoff. Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire lights, etc.)
        may result in overrunning the runway surface if initiated above RS-BEO.
        3.6.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) When DS is greater than RS-EF, takeoffs are not
        authorized.
     3.6.2.3. (Added-AETC) Operations With a Raised, Nonremotely Controlled BAK-
     15: (Note: Manually raising the BAK-15 when the remote control equipment is not
     operating may allow operations to continue in some circumstances.)
        3.6.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) When DS is less than or equal to RS-EF, use RS-EF as
        go/no-go speed.
        3.6.2.3.2. (Added-AETC) When DS is greater than RS-EF and less than TOS,
        takeoffs are allowed with the Operations Group commander (OG/CC) approval as
        long as the performance data results in a valid DS and SETOS. Use SETOS as the
        go/no-go speed. The squadron supervisor will brief the crew and the SOF on the
        situation and ensure the crew has the most current data. Pilots will delay rotation until
        155 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) (T-38C) or 150 knots indicated airspeed
 18            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


          (KIAS) (T-38A), and ensure the nose tire is off the runway no later than 174
          KGS/KIAS respectively. Only a rated pilot or a student pilot under the supervision of
          an IP in the aircraft may perform the takeoff.
          3.6.2.3.3. (Added-AETC) When DS is greater than or equal to TOS, takeoffs are
          not authorized.
   3.6.3. Do not take off if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent (single ship or interval
   takeoff) or 70 percent of the available runway (element takeoff).
   3.6.4. The wing commander or operations group commander may approve intersection
   takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   3.6.5. Use afterburner (AB) on all takeoffs.
   3.6.6. Rolling takeoffs are authorized when approved by the MAJCOM.
   3.6.6. (AETC) Single-ship rolling takeoffs are authorized during daylight hours only. Prior
   to performing a rolling takeoff, the pilot must consider TOLD with a runway length 300 feet
   less than the available runway.
   3.6.7. If installed, the instrument hood must be in the retracted position for all takeoffs and
   landings.
   3.6.8. (Added-AETC) When aircraft operate on runways with a remotely controlled
   arresting system, pilots will remain on the frequency of the agency, either tower or runway
   supervisory unit (RSU) that controls the runway and the arresting system until safely
   airborne. The barrier will be in the lowered position and will be raised only when the pilot
   calls for it. Note: The BAK-15 is the only arresting system suitable for stopping an aircraft
   with a travel pod. The MA-1A is suitable only for a clean aircraft.
   3.6.9. (Added-AETC) The minimum runway required for operations is 8,000 feet. The
   OG/CC may waive the minimum runway required to 7,000 feet. The 19 AF/A3 must approve
   all operations on runways less than 7,000 feet.
   3.6.10. (Added-AETC) Aircraft must have a full fuel load for each mission.
   (EXCEPTION: See paragraph 2.2.2.2.2 (Added) of this publication.) This requirement may
   be waived by the OG/CC.
3.7. Formation Takeoff:
3.7. (AETC)Formation Takeoff. Use at least 50 feet of wingtip clearance for engine runup
with a solo in any position.
   3.7.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.7.1. (AETC) Single-ship TOLD will be used when calculating formation takeoff data.
   3.7.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an instructor pilot (IP) or flight
   lead qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
   3.7.3. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
      3.7.3.1. Runway width is less than 150 feet.
      3.7.3.2. Standing water, ice, slush, or snow is on the runway.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                           19


      3.7.3.3. Crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
      3.7.3.4. Aircraft is being ferried from contractor or Air Force depot-level maintenance
      facilities.
   3.7.4. Takeoff interval between aircraft or elements will be a minimum of 10 seconds. When
   join-up is to be accomplished on top, takeoff interval will be increased to a minimum of 20
   seconds.
      3.7.4.1. After releasing brakes, single ship aircraft will steer toward the center of the
      runway.
3.8. Join-up and Rejoin:
   3.8.1. Day weather criteria for a visual flight rules (VFR) join-up underneath a ceiling is
   1,500 feet and 3 miles visibility.
   3.8.2. Flight leads will maintain 300 KTS airspeed until join-up is accomplished unless
   mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed. Pilots may delay coming out of AB to
   help establish a rate of closure on the leader or lead element.
   3.8.3. Flight leads will not normally exceed 30 degrees of bank during a turning join-up.
   3.8.4. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight-ahead rejoin, the number 2
   aircraft will join on the left wing and the element will join on the right wing unless otherwise
   briefed. For a turning rejoin, the number 2 aircraft will rejoin on the inside of the turn and the
   element to the outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the flight lead will
   specifically direct the desired formation positions.
   3.8.5. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle damage or bomb check
   after each mission prior to or during return to base. This check is mandatory following the
   expenditure of bomb dummy unit (BDU)-33s. Established deconfliction responsibilities and
   position change procedures will be observed. Fly no closer than normal fingertip spacing.
3.9. Formations (General):
   3.9.1. Flight or element leads will always consider wingman or element position and ability
   to safely perform a maneuver before directing it.
   3.9.2. In instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the maximum flight size is four
   aircraft.
   3.9.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet above ground level (AGL) or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.9.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals. A radio call is mandatory when directing position changes at night
   or under instrument conditions.
   3.9.5. Flight leads will not break up formations until each pilot has a positive fix from which
   to navigate; for example, visual, tactical air navigation (TACAN), or very high frequency
   omnidirectional range (VOR).
   3.9.6. When changing leads:
 20           AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


      3.9.6.1. During flight in limited visibility conditions (for example haze, night, or IMC),
      initiate lead changes from a stabilized, wings-level attitude.
      3.9.6.2. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
      over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water. In IMC, formation flights will not change lead
      or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. (For night position
      changes, see paragraph 3.21.4 of this instruction.)
      3.9.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft than a normal fingertip
      or route position, or greater than 30 degrees aft from line abreast.
      3.9.6.4. Flight or element leads will not initiate a lead change unless the aircraft
      assuming the lead is in a position from which the lead change can be safely initiated and
      visual contact maintained.
      3.9.6.5. The lead change will be initiated by either visual signal or radio call (required at
      night or in IMC).
      3.9.6.6. Acknowledge receipt of the lead by a head nod or radio call, as appropriate.
      3.9.6.7. The lead change is effective on acknowledgment.
      3.9.6.8. The former lead then moves to the briefed wing position.
   3.9.7. (Added-AETC) Maximum flight size is four aircraft unless waived by 19 AF/A3.
   3.9.8. (Added-AETC) Over-the-top maneuvers will not be flown in close trail formation.
3.10. Tactical Formations:
   3.10.1. General. The following rules apply for flightpath deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering:
   3.10.1. (AETC) Refer to Attachment 14 (Added) for UFT and PIT training rules. Note:
   Refer to AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, for IFF training rules.
      3.10.1.1. Wingmen must maneuver relative to the flight lead and maintain sight. Trailing
      aircraft or elements are responsible for deconflicting with lead aircraft or elements.
      3.10.1.2. At low altitude, wingman or elements will deconflict by going high relative to
      the flight lead's or element's plane of motion.
   3.10.2. Loss of Visual Contact. Use the following procedures when one or more flight
   members or elements lose visual contact within the formation:
      3.10.2.1. If any flight member or element calls ―blind,‖ the other flight member or
      element will immediately make an informative position call.
      3.10.2.2. If the other flight member or element is also ―blind,‖ the ―blind‖ call will
      include altitude. The flight lead will take action to ensure altitude separation between
      flight members or elements. The flight lead will specify either AGL or mean sea level
      (MSL) when directing the formation to deconflict. When directed to deconflict, a
      minimum of 500 feet of altitude separation will be used. Climbs and descents through the
      deconfliction altitude should be avoided if possible.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                            21


      3.10.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original ―blind‖ call, the flight
      member or element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known position of
      the other flight member or element and alter his or her altitude. Repeat the blind call.
      3.10.2.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive
      action to ensure flightpath deconfliction within the flight to include a terminate or knock
      it off (KIO) if necessary. Scenario restrictions, such as sanctuary altitudes and (or)
      adversary blocks must be considered.
      3.10.2.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude separation until a visual is regained and, if
      necessary, will navigate with altitude separation until mutual support is regained.
   3.10.3. Two-Ship Formations. The following rules apply for flightpath deconfliction
   during tactical maneuvering of two-ship formations:
      3.10.3.1. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flightpath deconfliction.
      3.10.3.2. The flight lead becomes primarily responsible for deconfliction when:
          3.10.3.2.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader in the wingman's ―blind cone‖ or
          forces the wingman's primary attention away from the lead (for example, the
          wingman becomes the engaged fighter).
          3.10.3.2.2. The wingman calls ―blind‖ and receives an acknowledgment from the
          flight lead.
      3.10.3.3. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the
      wingman acknowledges a visual on his or her lead.
   3.10.4. Three- and Four-Ship Formations. When flights of more than two aircraft are in
   tactical formation:
      3.10.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight or element lead pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified briefed otherwise by the flight lead.
      3.10.4.2. Trailing aircraft or elements will maintain sufficient spacing so primary
      emphasis during formation maneuvering or turns is on altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.11. Chase Formation:
   3.11.1. Any qualified pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or impending
   emergency conditions. Qualified stan/eval flight examiners (SEFE) may fly chase during
   flight evaluations.
   3.11.2. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In flight,
   the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but is primarily responsible for aircraft
   separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In the
   traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
   (EXCEPTION: Not applicable for 49 FW T-38/F-117 chase aircraft.)
   3.11.3. A safety observer in a chase aircraft will maneuver in a 30- to 60-degree cone out to
   1,000 feet from which the pilot can effectively clear and (or) provide assistance.
 22            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   3.11.3. (AETC) Unless safety or circumstances dictate otherwise, a chase aircraft will low-
   approach no lower than 300 feet above ground level (AGL).
3.12. Show Formation. These formations will be specifically briefed and flown according to
applicable directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and applicable
MAJCOM directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static
displays and aerial events.
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters:
   3.13.1. Except as specified for range procedures in AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
   Procedures, the minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL for low altitude maneuvering.
   3.13.2. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during any portion of aerobatic
   maneuvering. Aerobatic flight must be performed in special use airspace.
   3.13.3. Flight through wingtip vortices or jetwash should be avoided. If this is unavoidable,
   the aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G. Use asymmetric G limits
   if evaluating a jetwash-induced over-G. T-38C pilots will use the warning, caution, and
   advisory system or observed aircraft G to evaluate over-G conditions, including asymmetric
   over-Gs.
   3.13.4. Do not extend the flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft performance.
   3.13.4. (AETC) Unless specifically stated in the exercise or maneuver description, perform
   all maneuvers with gear and flaps in the retracted position.
   3.13.5. Do not attempt to shift the center of gravity by crossfeeding or using differential
   throttles to improve performance.
   3.13.6. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is 150 KTS unless conducting training
   under a formal syllabus that specifies or allows a slower airspeed for the training being
   conducted.
   3.13.7. (Added-AETC) The following additional maneuver parameters apply (paragraphs
   3.13.7.1 (Added) through 3.13.7.5.7 (Added)):
       3.13.7.1. (Added-AETC) Supersonic flight will be performed in accordance with AFI
       13-201, Airspace Management, and local supplements thereto.
       3.13.7.2. (Added-AETC) Minimum altitudes are as follows:
          3.13.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) For stalls or slow flight, 8,000 feet AGL. Maximum
          altitude is flight level (FL) 200; power setting 80 percent minimum.
          3.13.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) For unlimited air combat maneuvering (ACBT), 5,000
          feet AGL. For all other aerobatic maneuvers, 8,000 feet AGL.
       3.13.7.3. (Added-AETC) Accomplish practice nose high recoveries or instrument
       unusual attitudes below FL 240 and in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
       3.13.7.4. (Added-AETC) Do not plan a mission above FL 390 other than FCF or OCF.
       3.13.7.5. (Added-AETC) Prohibited maneuvers are as follows:
          3.13.7.5.1. (Added-AETC) Practice no-flap patterns and landings with more than
          2,500 pounds of fuel.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                        23


          3.13.7.5.2. (Added-AETC) Practice single-engine circling approaches or overhead
          patterns. Note: For overhead patterns to set up a practice single-engine go around, use
          both throttles until rolling out on final.
          3.13.7.5.3. (Added-AETC) Practice no-flap full-stop landings.
          3.13.7.5.4. (Added-AETC) Practice minimum roll landings.
          3.13.7.5.5. (Added-AETC) Practice inflight engine shutdowns other than FCF
          flown by qualified FCF pilots or during FCF upgrade sorties.
          3.13.7.5.6. (Added-AETC) Formation touch-and-go landings.
          3.13.7.5.7. (Added-AETC) Closed and low-closed traffic patterns immediately after
          initial takeoff.
3.14. Ops Checks:
   3.14.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
   Additionally, each pilot will monitor the fuel system carefully throughout the flight to
   identify low fuel, trapped fuel, or an out-of-balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency
   should be increased during tactical maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are
   required during climb or at level-off after takeoff, before each engagement or intercept,
   before entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if multiple passes are made,
   and after departing the range.
   3.14.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, fuel quantities, fuel balance, G-suit
   connection, oxygen system, and cabin altitude.
   3.14.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or visual
   signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal. The query and response for ops
   checks will be based on the amount of fuel and Gs. Normally, pilots will reset the G meter
   between ops checks.
3.15. G-awareness Exercise. Refer to AFI 11-214 (if applicable).
   3.15.1. Aircrew will conduct a G-awareness exercise anytime aircrews plan or are likely to
   maneuver above five Gs during the mission. MAJCOMs may establish additional G-
   awareness exercise requirements.
   3.15.1. (AETC) At a minimum, accomplish a 90-degree turn at 4 Gs and a 180-degree turn
   at 5 Gs. UFT and PIT pilots will accomplish a G-awareness exercise when maneuvers in
   excess of 4 Gs are anticipated. The G-awareness exercise requires a discernible horizon with
   sufficient visual cues to perform the exercise. In the event a G-awareness exercise cannot be
   accomplished, flight leads will modify the flight profile as appropriate.
   3.15.2. Maintain a minimum of 4,000 feet between aircraft. Establish separation prior to
   maneuver execution. During maneuver execution use visual lookout and briefed formation
   contracts as primary means of ensuring aircraft deconfliction. Use other systems only to
   enhance situation awareness; for example, air-to-air TACAN, traffic collision avoidance
   system (TCAS), etc.
 24             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   3.15.2. (AETC) All pilots have responsibility for deconfliction during a G-awareness
   exercise. Flight leads will brief the potential conflicts and the transition of the ―visual‖ during
   line abreast 180-degree G-awareness turns.
   3.15.3. Flight leads and pilots will ensure the airspace intended for the G-awareness exercise
   is free from potential conflict. Use air traffic control (ATC) services to the maximum extent
   practicable to make sure the airspace is clear. Conduct the G-awareness exercise in the
   following airspace preference to the order listed in paragraphs 3.15.3.1 through 3.15.3.4:
       3.15.3.1. Special use airspace (for example, restricted or warning areas, ATC assigned
       airspace (ATCAA), military operating areas (MOA), or MAJCOM-approved large scale
       exercise or special missions areas);
       3.15.3.2. Above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace;
       3.15.3.3. Inside the confines of military training routes/low-level training zones; or
       3.15.3.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
3.16. Radio Procedures:
   3.16.1. Preface all communications (except for wingman acknowledgment) with the
   complete flight call sign. Transmit only information essential for mission accomplishment or
   safety of flight. Do not use the radio as a flight ―intercom." Use visual signals whenever
   practical.
   3.16.2. Use a KIO radio call to cease tactical maneuvering when safety of flight is a factor,
   especially for an inflight emergency. Any flight member may make this call. When a
   dangerous situation is developing, be directive first. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and
   all types of missions. All participants will acknowledge a KIO by repeating the call.
   3.16.2. (AETC) Refer to Attachment 14 (Added) for UFT and PIT.
   3.16.3. All radio checks and channel changes will be initiated by the flight lead and will be
   acknowledged in turn by individual flight members prior to any flight member switching
   channels. EXCEPTION: During radio silent or limited communications operations, channel
   changes will be as briefed.
   3.16.4. Acknowledge radio checks that do not require the transmission of specific data by
   individual flight members in turn (for example, ―2, 3, 4‖). Acknowledgment indicates the
   appropriate action is complete, in the process of being completed, or understood by the flight
   member.
   3.16.5. In addition to the standard radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3;
   specific mission guides; and FLIP publications, all flight members will acknowledge
   understanding the initial ATC clearance. They will acknowledge subsequent ATC
   instructions when directed by the flight lead or anytime during trail departures.
   3.16.6. Brevity code and other terminology will be according to AFTTP 3-2.5, Multi-Service
   Brevity Codes (FOUO).
3.17. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of the T-38 must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement ―You have the
aircraft.‖ The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge ―I have the aircraft.‖ Once
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          25


assuming control of the aircraft, the pilot will maintain control until relinquishing it as stated
above. See paragraph 7.13 for procedures after a birdstrike or canopy loss.
3.18. Low-Altitude Procedures (General):
   3.18.1. Low-level formation positions and tactics will be flown using MAJCOM guidance or
   AFMAN 11-250, Volume 1; the T-38C Procedures Manual (interim); and MCMAN 11-238,
   Volume 2, (A)T-38 Mission Employment Fundamentals, as guides.
   3.18.2. During briefings, emphasis will be placed on low altitude flight maneuvering and
   observation of terrain feature or obstacles along the route of flight. For low altitude training
   over water or featureless terrain, include specific emphasis on minimum altitudes and spatial
   disorientation.
   3.18.3. If flight leads are unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known
   vertical obstructions that are a factor to the route of flight, they will direct a climb no later
   than 3 NM prior to the obstacle to ensure vertical separation by 2 NM from the obstacle.
   3.18.4. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead.
   3.18.5. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain a positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed approximately 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to
   upright bunting maneuvers.
   3.18.6. The minimum airspeed for low-level navigation is 300 KTS.
   3.18.7. During low-altitude training, maintain a minimum of 500 feet above the highest
   terrain or obstacle within 1/2 NM of the aircraft. Set the altitude warning function to alert the
   pilot at 90 percent of planned altitude during low-level operations.
   3.18.8. During all low-altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted
   attention, KIO, or emergencies (including any perceived loss of thrust) is to climb to RAA or
   a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL). If a birdstrike enters the cockpit and
   the aircraft loses a canopy, the pilot flying will immediately select MIL or MAX power on
   both engines and establish a climb away from the ground. The pilot not flying will be
   prepared to assume control if the pilot flying does not initiate a climb away from the ground.
   In this case, the pilot will change control of the aircraft according to paragraph 3.17 of this
   instruction.
   3.18.8. (AETC) The following additional low-altitude procedures apply (paragraphs
   3.18.8.1 (Added) through 3.18.8.3 (Added)):
       3.18.8.1. (Added-AETC) Conduct low altitude training no earlier than 30 minutes after
       sunrise (1 hour mountainous terrain), and exit the low altitude structure no later than 30
       minutes prior to sunset (1 hour mountainous terrain).
       3.18.8.2. (Added-AETC) Single-ship low-altitude training will be dual.
       3.18.8.3. (Added-AETC) The maximum airspeed for UFT and PIT low-level operations
       is 420 knots. The maximum airspeed for IFF low-level operations is 450 knots.
3.19. Minimum Altitudes. A pilot’s minimum altitude will be determined and certified by the
unit commander according to AFI 11-2T-AT-38, Volume 1, T-38 and AT-38 Aircrew Training.
 26            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


Pilots participating in approved stepdown training programs will comply with the requirements
and restrictions of that program. The following minimum altitudes apply to low-level training
unless higher altitudes are specified by route restrictions or a training syllabus:
   3.19.1. For pilots who have not completed stepdown training and who are not designated for
   flights at lower altitudes, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL.
   3.19.1. (AETC) Completion of an IP course clears SUPT, ENJJPT, and IFF IPs to fly or
   instruct low-level navigation or formation missions (without offensive air-to-air employment
   or threat reaction) down to 500 feet AGL. See AFI 11-2T-AT-38, Vol 1/AETC Sup 1, T-38
   and AT-38 Aircrew Training, Attachment 4 (Added), for additional IFF training.
   3.19.2. For night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet above the highest
   obstacle within 5 NM of the course.
   3.19.3. Weather minimums for visual low-level training will be 1,500 feet and 3 miles for
   any route or area, as specified in FLIP (for military training routes), or as specified in unit
   publications, whichever is higher.
   3.19.4. (Added-AETC) The minimum altitude for flying visual flight rules (VFR) point-to-
   point navigation missions dictated by operational or training requirements is 3,000 feet AGL.
3.20. Low-Level Route and Area Abort Procedures:
   3.20.1. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) route and area abort procedures are as
   follows:
       3.20.1.1. Maintain safe separation from the terrain.
       3.20.1.2. Comply with VFR altitude restrictions and squawk applicable identification
       friend or foe (IFF) modes and codes.
       3.20.1.3. Maintain VMC at all times.
       3.20.1.4. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
   3.20.2. IMC route and area abort procedures are as follows:
       3.20.2.1. Immediately climb to or above the computed RAA. (Reference paragraph
       2.3.3.3 of this instruction for computing RAA.)
       3.20.2.2. Maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
       procedures if necessary.
       3.20.2.3. If deviations from normal route or area procedures are required or if the RAA
       or minimum safe altitude (MSA) is higher than the vertical limits of the route or area,
       squawk emergency.
       3.20.2.4. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an instrument flight rules
       (IFR) clearance. If required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance, cruise at appropriate
       VFR altitudes until IFR clearance is received.
3.21. Night Operational Procedures:
   3.21.1. Night Ground Operations. The anticollision (beacon) light may be turned to OFF
   and the position lights turned to DIM if they prove to be a distraction or create a hazard. Taxi
   spacing will be a minimum of 300 feet and on the taxiway center line. The taxi light will
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                         27


  normally be used during all night taxiing. (EXCEPTION: When the light might interfere
  with the vision of the pilot of an aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come
  to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the taxi light.) For formation takeoffs,
  flight or element lead will turn the anticollision light to OFF and position lights to DIM when
  reaching the run up position on the runway. Wingmen will maintain the anticollision light to
  ON and position lights to BRIGHT for takeoffs, unless IMC will be encountered shortly after
  takeoff.
  3.21.2. Night Takeoff. During a night formation takeoff, brake release and gear retraction
  will be called on the radio. Following takeoff, each aircraft or element will climb on runway
  heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure instructions
  specifically prohibit compliance or executing a night overhead traffic pattern.
  3.21.3. Night Join-ups. Night join-ups are not authorized.
  3.21.4. Night Formation Procedures:
     3.21.4.1. When in positions other than fingertip or route, aircraft spacing will be
     maintained primarily by instruments, and (or) timing, with visual reference secondary. If
     aircraft spacing cannot be ensured, an altitude separation (minimum of 1,000 feet) will be
     established. At all times, aircrews will cross-check instruments to ensure ground
     clearance.
     3.21.4.2. Do not change lead or wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on RADAR
     downwind. Lead changes and position changes will be called over the radio, and they
     should be initiated from a stabilized, wings-level attitude.
  3.21.5. Night Fingertip Position. Night fingertip formation is flown in approximately the
  same position as during the day. If illumination is insufficient to use day references, exterior
  lighting relationships may be used.
  3.21.6. Night Breakup. Prior to a night formation breakup, the flight lead will transmit
  attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting, which will be acknowledged by wingmen.
  Wingmen will also confirm good navigational aids. This procedure is not required for a
  formation breakup that occurs in the overhead traffic pattern.
  3.21.7. (Added-AETC) The following additional night operations procedures apply
  (paragraphs 3.21.7.1 (Added) through 3.21.7.4 (Added)):
     3.21.7.1. (Added-AETC) Fly night overhead patterns only at the home base. (Lackland
     AFB is included for the 12th Flying Training Wing.)
     3.21.7.2. (Added-AETC) All night landings require operational glidepath guidance
     (precision approach or visual glidepath guidance) as follows:
         3.21.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) Unless required by a formal course syllabus or training
         associated with instructing that syllabus, the preferred night approach procedures (in
         descending order) are as follows:
             3.21.7.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) Precision approach.
             3.21.7.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Nonprecision approach with an associated visual
             descent path indicator.
 28             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


               3.21.7.2.1.3. (Added-AETC) VFR straight-in.
               3.21.7.2.1.4. (Added-AETC) VFR rectangular pattern.
           3.21.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) When available, use a visual descent path indicator to
           monitor glide slope position during visual approaches. Also use the instrument
           landing system (ILS) glide slope if available.
       3.21.7.3. (Added-AETC) All descents below a minimum descent altitude on a
       nonprecision approach require an operational visual approach system.
       3.21.7.4. (Added-AETC) The instrument straight-in portion of a circling approach is
       allowed. However, the straight-in approach must terminate in either a missed approach or
       a transition to visual approach guidance for landing; for example, visual approach slope
       indicator (VASI) or precision approach path indicator (PAPI).
3.22. Fuel Requirements:
   3.22.1. Joker Fuel. A prebriefed fuel needed to terminate an event and transition to the next
   phase of flight.
   3.22.2. Bingo Fuel. A prebriefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel (see paragraph 3.22.3).
   3.22.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the final approach fix (FAF) at the
   base of intended landing or alternate, if required. Fuel quantity will be as established locally
   or 800 pounds, whichever is higher.
   3.22.4. Minimum and Emergency Fuel. When it becomes apparent an aircraft will enter
   initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing or alternate (if
   required), declare the following (as applicable):
       3.22.4.1. Minimum fuel--600 pounds or less.
       3.22.4.2. Emergency fuel--400 pounds or less.
3.23. Approaches and Landings:
3.23. (AETC)Approaches and Landings. (For UFT only) When airborne and before moving
the gear handle, the pilot flying the aircraft will make an intercockpit ―gear clear‖ call and pause
momentarily before moving the gear handle. Prior to a student’s initial solo, the IP will
acknowledge ―clear‖ before the student moves the gear handle. On all other sorties, ―gear clear‖
is an advisory call only.
   3.23.1. The desired touchdown point is 150 – 1,000 feet from the threshold for a VFR
   approach. When landing from a precision approach, touchdown may be beyond the VFR
   touchdown zone. When local procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing
   beyond a given point on the runway, the desired touchdown point will be adjusted
   accordingly.
   3.23.2. When landing on alternate sides of the runway or when the preceding aircraft has
   cleared to the cold side of the runway, minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between
   landing aircraft is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (for example, T-38 versus T-38), 6,000 feet
   for dissimilar aircraft (for example, T-38 versus F-15), or as directed by MAJCOM or the
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                         29


   landing base, whichever is higher. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or
   when landing with a light tail wind, spacing should be increased.
   3.23.3. If the altitude warning function is used for decision height awareness on instrument
   approaches, aircrews will set the data source for activation of the altitude warning function to
   ―BARO‖ (or ―MSL‖ for Block 6 software).
3.24. Landing Restrictions:
   3.24.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway, land at
   an alternate runway, if possible.
   3.24.2. When the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 10, land at an alternate
   runway, if possible.
   3.24.3. Do not land over any raised web barrier (for example, MA-1A, BAK-15).
   3.24.4. If the crosswind component, including gusts:
       3.24.4.1. Exceeds 15 knots (dry runway) or 10 knots (wet runway), solo undergraduate
       flying training (UFT) students will land at an alternate runway, if possible.
       3.24.4.2. Exceeds 15 knots, the minimum runway length for 60- and 100-percent flap
       touch-and-go’s on runways without a suitable barrier is 10,000 feet. Do not perform no-
       flap touch-and-go landings on runways without a suitable barrier when the crosswind
       component exceeds 15 knots.
3.25. Overhead Traffic Patterns:
3.25. (AETC)DELETED.
   3.25.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unexpended practice ordnance.
   3.25.2. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.25.3. The break will be executed individually in a level 180-degree turn to the downwind
   leg at minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP or SEFE chase or when in tactical
   formation).
3.26. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted, using the following parameters:
   3.26.1. A maximum of four aircraft authorized in the formation.
   3.26.2. Lateral spacing of 4,000 to 6,000 feet.
   3.26.3. No more than 6,000 feet of element spacing.
   3.26.4. If using an offset box formation, offset away from the direction of the break.
   3.26.5. The lead element will break to downwind abeam or over the touchdown point.
   3.26.6. The second element (or aircraft if three-ship formation) will delay a break to
   downwind until number 2 is clear of the intended flightpath.
   3.26.7. Use normal overhead altitude and airspeed.
   3.26.8. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing will be flown.
 30             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   3.26.9. The ATC agency must be familiar with the procedure to be flown.
3.27. Touch-and-Go Landings. A touch-and-go landing will not be flown with hung ordnance.
3.27. (AETC)Touch-and-Go Landings. The maximum crosswind for single-ship touch-and-
go landings is 25 knots for a dry runway.
3.28. Low Approaches:
   3.28.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
       3.28.1.1. For IPs or SEFEs flying chase position, 50 feet AGL.
       3.28.1.2. For formation low approaches, 100 feet AGL.
       3.28.1.3. For chase aircraft during an emergency, 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.28.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below a VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude
   until crossing the departure end of the runway (unless local procedures, missed approach,
   climbout procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise).
3.29. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed or cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. When in formation, a
sequential closed may be flown with ATC concurrence at an interval to ensure proper spacing.
Plan to arrive on downwind between 200 to 240 KTS.
3.30. Rear Cockpit Approaches and Landings:
   3.30.1. Only qualified IPs or those enrolled in a course of qualification leading to instructor
   certification, with an IP in the front cockpit, may perform rear cockpit landings.
   3.30.2. During rear cockpit approaches and landings, the front cockpit pilot will visually
   clear the area, monitor aircraft parameters and configurations, and be prepared to direct a go-
   around or take control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary.
3.31. Formation Approaches:
   3.31.1. Pilots will normally accomplish formation approaches from an instrument approach
   or a VFR straight-in approach, using precision approach path indicator (PAPI) or visual
   approach slope indicator (VASI) lights, if available. In all cases, use a rate of descent similar
   to that of a normal precision approach.
   3.31.2. The weather must be at least a 500-foot ceiling and 1 1/2 miles visibility, or the
   highest of any flight member’s weather category, whichever is higher.
   3.31.3. The maximum number of aircraft is two. Both aircraft must be similarly configured.
   (EXCEPTION: Do not consider the WSSP configurations.) Non-PMP modified aircraft may
   fly formation approaches with PMP-modified aircraft.
3.32. Formation Landings. In addition to the procedures in paragraph 3.31:
   3.32.1. A qualified flight lead must lead formation landings unless an IP or flight lead
   qualified squadron supervisor is in the element.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                            31


   3.32.2. The flight lead will position the wingman on the upwind side if the crosswind
   exceeds 5 knots. Do not land as a formation if the crosswind component, including gusts,
   exceeds 15 knots.
   3.32.3. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.
   3.32.4. If the wingman overruns the lead after landing, both pilots will accept the overrun,
   maintain the appropriate side of the runway, and maintain aircraft control. The wingman will
   not attempt to reposition behind the lead. The most important considerations are wingtip
   clearance and aircraft control.
   3.32.5. Formation landings are prohibited when the runway is reported wet or when ice,
   slush, or snow is on the runway.
   3.32.6. The minimum runway width for formation landings is 150 feet.
   3.32.7. Pilots will not land in formation:
       3.32.7.1. With hung ordnance.
       3.32.7.2. If arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the
       approach end of 150-foot wide runways.
       3.32.7.3. With a PMP aircraft on the wing of a non-PMP aircraft.
3.33. (Added-AETC) Extended Daylight:
   3.33.1. (Added-AETC) Extended daylight is defined as the period 15 minutes prior to
   official sunrise to 15 minutes past official sunset. For local training only, daylight traffic
   pattern and MOA operations are in effect during the extended daylight period.
   3.33.2. (Added-AETC) All maneuvers normally accomplished during normal daylight
   hours may be performed within the extended daylight window, including solo syllabus
   sorties. Under certain weather conditions, such as low ceiling and visibility, the SOF will
   decide if maneuvers are appropriate or safe during the times defined in paragraph 3.33.1
   (Added).
3.34. (Added-AETC) Bat Procedures at Randolph AFB. Approval from the home OG/CC is
required to arrive or depart during periods of increased bat activity as defined in Area Planning
1.
3.35. (Added-AETC) Operating in High Wind or Sea States. Units will restrict their flying
operations when high winds or sea states would be hazardous to aircrew members in ejection
situations. Local training flights are not permitted over land when steady state surface winds
(forecast or actual) in training or operating areas exceed 35 knots. In training or operating areas,
overwater training flights will not be permitted when forecast or actual wave heights exceed 10
feet or surface winds exceed 25 knots. This is not intended to restrict operations when only a
small portion of the route or area is affected. If possible, alter mission plan to avoid the area. The
OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
3.36. (Added-AETC) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Restrictions:
   3.36.1. (Added-AETC) Pilots will not conduct FCFs in conjunction with other type
   missions except FCF continuation training, FCF upgrade training, or FCF standardization
32           AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


  check flights. Only an FCF pilot or a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board will
  accomplish FCFs.
  3.36.2. (Added-AETC) FCFs may recover at home station when originating from AETC
  auxiliary fields or from bases within the local flying area.
  3.36.3. (Added-AETC) FCF pilots will not practice instrument approaches or other AETC
  syllabus maneuvers not in compliance with the acceptance and functional check flight
  technical order (TO) on FCF missions unless required to check the aircraft. FCF pilots will
  ensure instrument hoods or vision-restricting devices are not installed in FCF aircraft.
  3.36.4. (Added-AETC) FCF pilots will ensure rear seat publications and seat packs are
  removed before solo FCFs.
  3.36.5. (Added-AETC) FCF pilots will not accomplish touch-and-go landings on an FCF
  sortie unless required to complete the FCF according to the acceptance and functional check
  flight TO.
  3.36.6. (Added-AETC) The commander who owns the aircraft may approve AETC FCF
  pilots to perform required FCFs on transient AETC aircraft. All FCFs on AETC aircraft will
  be flown by AETC FCF pilots or crews. AETC FCF pilots or crews will not normally
  perform FCFs on transient aircraft from other services or commands without specific
  approval from the commander having operational control over the aircraft.

                                              Chapter 4

                                 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category:
   4.1.1. The T-38 is approach category E. A missed approach will be accomplished in
   accordance with flight manual procedures.
   4.1.2. Approach category D minimums may be used where no category E minimums are
   published if:
       4.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
       4.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at a final approach airspeed of 165 KTS or less.
       4.1.2.3. The aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed (KTAS) or less for the missed
       approach segment of the approach. (Note: At high pressure altitudes and temperatures,
       260 KTAS may not be compatible with published missed approach airspeeds and
       category D approaches should not be flown.)
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up:
   4.2.1. The flight lead must notify the appropriate ATC agency when a VMC join-up is not
   possible because of weather conditions or operational requirements. Coordinate for an
   appropriate altitude block or trail formation. Formation in-trail departures will comply with
   instructions for a nonstandard formation flight as defined in DoD FLIP. The flight lead
   should request IFF squawks for wingmen in trail.
   4.2.2. If weather is below 1,500 feet and 3 miles, each aircraft or element will climb on
   takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when departure
   instructions specifically prohibit compliance.
4.3. Trail Procedures. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and
will not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
attempts to maintain contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and
notify the flight lead. The flight lead will then notify ATC.
4.4. Trail Departures:
   4.4.1. Use a minimum of 20-second takeoff spacing.
   4.4.2. Each aircraft or element will accelerate in AB power until reaching 250 KTS.
   Accelerate to 300 KTS in mil. Climb at 300 KTS using 600 degrees exhaust gas temperature
   (EGT) until reaching cruise Mach or cruise true airspeed (TAS), unless otherwise briefed. All
   turns will be made using 30 degrees of bank.
   4.4.3. The flight lead will call initiating all turns.
   4.4.4. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000 foot
   altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up or level-off or
   until the following aircraft or element calls "visual." In addition, each aircraft or element will
   call initiating any altitude or heading change. Acknowledgments are not required, but it is
 34             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   imperative that preceding aircraft or elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress
   of the succeeding aircraft or elements and immediately correct deviations from the departure
   route or planned course.
   4.4.5. Each aircraft or element will use all available aircraft systems and navigational aids to
   monitor position.
   4.4.6. Each aircraft or element will maintain at least 1,000 feet of vertical separation from
   the preceding aircraft or element during the climb or descent and at level-off until visual
   contact is established, except instances where departure instructions specifically prohibit
   compliance.
   4.4.7. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the flight
   lead will request 1,000 feet of altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element if all
   aircraft can comply with MSA restrictions. If the MSA cannot be complied with, the 1,000-
   foot vertical separation may be reduced to 500 feet.
4.5. Formation Breakup. Formation breakup should not be accomplished in IMC. However, if
it is unavoidable, breakup will be accomplished in straight-and-level flight. Prior to a weather
breakup, the flight lead will transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude, and altimeter setting, which will
be acknowledged by wingmen. Wingmen will also confirm good navigational aids according to
paragraph 3.9.5 of this instruction.
4.6. Formation Penetration:
   4.6.1. Formation penetrations are restricted to two aircraft when the weather at the base of
   intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.6.2. If a formation landing is intended, the wingman should be positioned on the
   appropriate wing prior to weather penetration.
4.7. Formation VMC Drag Procedures:
   4.7.1. A formation VMC drag maneuver may be used to establish spacing for single-ship
   landings when conditions do not permit a formation landing and the following conditions are
   met:
       4.7.1.1. Weather is at least a 1,500 foot-ceiling and 3 miles visibility. All aircraft will
       maintain VMC from the drag point to landing.
       4.7.1.2. Prior to directing the formation VMC drag under IFR, the flight lead will
       coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for nonstandard formation during the
       remainder of the approach.
       4.7.1.3. The wingmen may use briefed power settings and configurations (speedbrake,
       gear and flaps) to establish and maintain spacing. Wingmen will not fly below final
       approach speed and s-turns will not be used to gain or maintain separation while on final.
       4.7.1.4. Minimum spacing is 3000 feet, or greater if briefed.
       4.7.1.5. The latest drag point must allow adequate time for the wingmen to establish the
       required separation and then for the flight lead to slow to final approach speed not later
       than 3 nm from the runway. On instrument final approaches, the drag is normally
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                           35


       accomplished so as to establish separation prior to the final approach fix or glideslope
       intercept.
   4.7.2. Any time the spacing is in question, the wingman will go-around or execute the
   missed approach, notify air traffic control, and comply with local procedures. Note: Before
   using these procedures in flight, the briefing must include the information in paragraph
   4.7.1.3 through 4.7.1.5, and reference the specific traffic pattern or instrument approach
   procedure to be flown.
   4.7.3. Before using these procedures in flight, the briefing must include the information in
   paragraphs 4.7.1.3 through 4.7.1.5 above, and reference the specific traffic pattern or
   instrument approach procedure to be flown.
4.8. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight must be conducted according to
AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and requires a qualified safety observer in the aircraft or in a chase
aircraft as follows:
   4.8.1. Safety observers may occupy either the front or rear cockpit of the T-38 during
   simulated instrument flight. Under these conditions, an operable intercom is required.
   4.8.2. Flying multiple approaches in VMC without a chase is authorized. However, in this
   case, the primary emphasis will be on the ―see and avoid‖ concept. Chase aircraft may move
   into close formation on final if a formation landing is intended and the simulated instrument
   flight is terminated.
4.9. Icing Restrictions. Climbs or descents through forecast icing conditions more severe than
light rime are prohibited.
4.9. (AETC)Icing Restrictions. Do not fly in known or reported icing conditions. Do not
cruise in forecast icing conditions. T-38 aircrews will request complete icing condition forecasts,
to include trace icing for the entire route of flight when receiving a preflight weather briefing via
any source. Operations group commanders will ensure local weather procedures provide T-38
supervisors and crews with adequate trace icing forecasts.
4.10. (Added-AETC) Pilot Weather Categories (PWC). PWCs are designed to reduce the
exposure of pilots with limited experience to the risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and
visibility. Table 4.1 (Added) specifies the PWC minimums.
   4.10.1. (Added-AETC) When calculating total time for the purpose of PWC, do not include
   student, UFT, or ―other‖ flight time. Hours in an assigned aircraft may include all series or
   mission types of that aircraft.
   4.10.2. (Added-AETC) Assignment of PWC 1 status is dependent on the pilot’s
   demonstrated knowledge and performance in flight under PWC 2 operations and in aircrew
   training devices with low-visibility capability. Before assigning PWC 1, a PWC 1 pilot must
   evaluate the pilot’s instrument proficiency in the simulator or aircraft.
   4.10.3. (Added-AETC) Document certification of PWC 1 on the Letter of Xs signed by the
   commander of the flying squadron to which the pilot is assigned or attached.
   4.10.4. (Added-AETC) PWC 1 minimums apply to all PWC 2 pilots for approaches at the
   home field. If an IP is on board, aircrews may use the IP’s PWC.
 36               AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


    4.10.5. (Added-AETC) T-38A/B and AT-38 pilots converting to the T-38C will be
    assigned PWC 2 until achieving a minimum of 25 hours in the T-38C and meeting the
    criteria listed above for PWC 1.

4.11. (Added-AETC) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In AETC, the following requirements
apply to IFRs (paragraphs 4.11.1 (Added) through 4.11.7 (Added)):
    4.11.1. (Added-AETC) For local flying operations, aircrews do not have to designate an
    alternate airfield if all of the following conditions exist (per Federal Aviation Administration
    Exemption No. 7389 and Air Force Flight Standards Agency AETC Waiver Vol 3/20002):
          4.11.1.1. (Added-AETC) Departure and destination airfields are the same.
          4.11.1.2. (Added-AETC) An IP or examiner pilot is a crewmember.
          4.11.1.3. (Added-AETC) Ceiling and visibility are reported and forecasted to remain
          above 1,500 feet and 3 miles, respectively, for estimated time en route plus 2 hours.
    4.11.2. (Added-AETC) Takeoff minimums are specified in Table 4.1 (Added). Base the
    decision to launch a local sortie on the existing weather and forecast for planned landing plus
    1 hour. Base the decision to launch nonlocal sorties on the existing weather at takeoff time.
    4.11.3. (Added-AETC) Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for the
    estimated time of arrival, plus or minus 1 hour, is at or above the appropriate PWC or
    suitable published minimums, whichever is greater. See Table 4.1 (Added).
    4.11.4. (Added-AETC) Weather requirements for an alternate airport requiring radar or a
    global positioning system on the only suitable approach are the same as for an alternate
    without a published approach procedure.
    4.11.5. (Added-AETC) Do not commence a penetration, en route descent, or approach
    unless existing ceiling and visibility meet the requirements of Table 4.1 (Added).
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                    37


  4.11.6. (Added-AETC) After commencing a penetration or approach and if weather is
  reported below the required PWC or published minimums (ceiling or visibility), the pilot
  may continue the approach to the PWC or published minimums, whichever is higher. The
  PWC decision height or minimum descent altitude will be determined by reference to the
  touch-down-zone elevation (TDZE) for straight-in approaches and field elevation for circling
  approaches. Use field elevation if TDZE is unavailable. The pilot may descend below the
  decision height or minimum descent altitude if (1) the aircraft is in a position to make a
  normal approach to the runway of intended landing, and (2) the pilot can clearly see the
  approach threshold of the runway, approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the
  approach end of the runway. In all cases, the pilot will comply with the last clearance
  received until obtaining a revised clearance. CAUTION: The use of PWC minimums on a
  precision approach may require a pilot to execute a missed approach prior to the published
  decision height. In these instances, upon reaching PWC minimums and making the decision
  not to continue the approach, the pilot should start a climb immediately while proceeding to
  the nonprecision missed approach point (MAP). On reaching the nonprecision MAP, the pilot
  should continue with the published missed approach procedure.
  4.11.7. (Added-AETC) When flying instrument approaches in VMC conditions, pilots may
  fly down to approach minimums if the runway environment is in sight when reaching
  applicable PWC minimums. Pilots must acknowledge reaching PWC minimums and state
  their intentions to their crewmembers if continuing to published approach minimums.

                                            Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual.
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction addressed in the emergency or
   abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective actions have
   been accomplished.
   7.1.1. (AETC) No aircraft will be accepted for flight with the low oxygen quantity light
   illuminated. (The OG/CC may authorize a one-time flight below 10,000 feet MSL.) If
   oxygen quantity decreases to 1 liter or less when airborne, descend to at or below 10,000 feet
   MSL and land as soon as practical.
   7.1.2. Do not taxi an aircraft with nosewheel steering, brake system, canopy, or generator
   malfunctions or failures.
   7.1.3. Once a malfunctioning system is isolated and (or) the fault corrected, the system will
   not be used again unless it is used in a degraded mode and is essential for recovery. Do not
   conduct ground or inflight troubleshooting after flight manual emergency procedures are
   completed.
   7.1.4. Pilots will record all inadvertent supersonic events according to AFI 13-201, Airspace
   Management. Units will use AF Form 4290, Unplanned Supersonic Flight Activity Log, to
   record inadvertent supersonic events.
7.2. Ground Aborts:
   7.2.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, and the flight lead renumbers the flight to
   maintain a numerical call sign sequence, flight lead will advise the appropriate agencies of
   such changes.
   7.2.1. (AETC) Flight leads will notify ATC and the operations supervisor as a minimum.
   7.2.2. If the flight lead aborts, a flight of two or more aircraft with no designated flight lead
   in the formation must either sympathetically abort or proceed on a prebriefed single-ship
   missions.
   7.2.3. Pilots who do not take off with the flight may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous
   point prior to a tactical event or may fly a briefed alternate single-ship mission. If a join-up is
   to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range, all events will be terminated until the joining
   aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
   7.2.4. The PIC is primarily responsible for handling inflight emergencies. The additional
   pilot (if applicable) will confirm all critical action procedures have been accomplished and
   provide checklist assistance at the request of the PIC.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts:
   7.3.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, give the call sign and state intentions when
   practical. Following aircraft will alter their takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort the
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          41


   takeoff if adequate clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase ―barrier, barrier, barrier‖ will
   be used to direct the tower to raise the departure end barrier.
   7.3.2. When aborting, if hot brakes are suspected, declare a ground emergency. Taxi the
   aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake procedures.
7.4. Air Aborts:
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.4.2. Aborting aircraft with an emergency condition will be escorted to the field of intended
   landing. When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an
   escort for the aborting aircraft is required.
   7.4.3. Regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, the mission will be
   aborted for any of the following:
      7.4.3.1. Birdstrike or foreign object damage.
      7.4.3.2. Over-G. The aircraft will land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach.
      7.4.3.3. Flight control system anomalies.
      7.4.3.4. Engine flameout, stagnation, or shutdown.
   7.4.4. Report all engine anomalies during maintenance debriefing.
7.5. Radio Failure:
   7.5.1. Formation:
      7.5.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
      maneuver within close or route parameters to attract the attention of another flight
      member and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as
      soon as practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert
      base. A formation approach to a dropoff on final should be performed unless safety
      considerations dictate otherwise.
      7.5.1.2. If flying other than close or route formation when radio failure occurs, the
      NORDO aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on
      another flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances
      from other flight members until its presence is acknowledged by a wing rock, signifying
      clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
      signals. If prebriefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
      If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
      the base of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty or
      emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
   7.5.2. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures:
      7.5.2.1. For class A and manned class B ranges:
          7.5.2.1.1. Attempt contact with the range control officer (RCO) on the appropriate
          backup frequency.
 42            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


          7.5.2.1.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower
          on the attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The
          flight lead will either rejoin the flight and return to base or direct another flight
          member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base.
          7.5.2.1.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
          tower (if practical) on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the
          direction of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight
          member to join up and escort the emergency aircraft.
       7.5.2.2. For unmanned class B and class C ranges, make a pass on the target, if possible,
       while rocking wings. The leader will either rejoin the flight in sequence and recover or
       direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base. If the
       NORDO has an emergency, it will (if practical) make a pass on the target, rock its wings,
       turn the opposite direction of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will
       direct a flight member to join up and escort the emergency aircraft.
       7.5.2.3. If radio failure occurs and circumstances prevent landing with unexpended
       ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished if the following conditions are
       met:
          7.5.2.3.1. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact
          with the RCO.
          7.5.2.3.2. Jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
          aircraft to initiate jettison.
   7.5.3. NORDO Recovery. For a NORDO recovery, the procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP
   apply. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary, the
   chase will go around, pass the NORDO aircraft, and rock its wings. The NORDO aircraft
   will go around if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a wingman,
   the lead will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
7.6. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not attempt to fly through severe weather. However, if
severe weather is unavoidable, prior to severe weather penetration, flights should split up and
obtain separate clearances.
7.7. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. On losing sight of the lead, the wingman will simultaneously execute
applicable lost wingman procedures while transitioning to instruments. Smooth application of
control inputs is imperative to minimize spatial disorientation effects. Once lost wingman
procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin the flight must be obtained from the flight
lead.
   7.7.1. For two- or three-ship flights, in wings-level flight (climb, descent, or straight and
   level) simultaneously inform the lead and turn away, using 15 degrees of bank for 15
   seconds. Then resume the heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.7.1.1. When outside the turn, reverse the direction of turn, using 15 degrees of bank for
       15 seconds and inform the lead. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
       resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          43


       7.7.1.2. When inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
       and inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
       separation and obtain separate clearance. The lead may resume the turn only when
       separation is ensured. Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost wingman
       procedures (paragraph 7.7.2).
       7.7.1.3. For a precision or nonprecision final, the wingman will momentarily turn away
       to ensure separation, commence a climb, inform lead, proceed to the missed approach
       point, and carry out the published missed approach procedure while obtaining a separate
       clearance from approach control.
       7.7.1.4. For a missed approach, the wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
       separation, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
       procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. He or she will
       obtain a separate clearance from approach control.
   7.7.2. For four-ship flights, if only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures will provide safe separation. However, because it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the lead, it is imperative that
   number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 7.7.1. Number 4
   will follow the appropriate procedure as follows:
       7.7.2.1. For wings-level flight, simultaneously inform the lead and turn away, using 30
       degrees of bank for 30 seconds. Then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.7.2.2. When outside the turn, reverse direction of the turn, using 30 degrees of bank for
       30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3. Then obtain a separate
       clearance.
       7.7.2.3. When inside the turn, momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
       and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the lead to roll out. Obtain a separate
       clearance. The lead will resume the turn only when separation is ensured.
   7.7.3. The flight lead should acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and transmit
   attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters as appropriate. Care must be taken
   to observe published terrain clearance limits.
   7.7.4. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure, the aircraft
   with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. The NORDO aircraft will turn the
   IFF to normal code 7600 while proceeding with the previous clearance. If an emergency
   situation arises along with radio failure, turn the IFF to Emergency for the remainder of the
   flight.
   7.7.5. Practice lost wingman procedures only in VMC.
   7.7.6. With the flight lead's permission, wingmen may rejoin if weather conditions permit
   and a visual join-up can be accomplished.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). Conditions that prevent a clear visual horizon or increase
pilot tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot will make a conscious attempt to
increase his or her instrument cross-check rate. When SD symptoms are detected, the following
steps will be taken until symptoms abate:
 44            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   7.8.1. Single-Ship:
      7.8.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the attitude
      indicator. Use heads-down instruments. Defer nonessential cockpit tasks. If flying dual,
      transfer control to the other pilot.
      7.8.1.2. If symptoms persist, bring the aircraft to straight-and-level flight with reference
      to the attitude indicator conditions permitting. If the terrain permits, maintain a straight-
      and-level flight until symptoms abate, usually in 30 to 60 seconds.
      7.8.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC. Note: It is possible for SD
      to proceed to the point where the pilot is unable to see, interpret, or process information
      from the flight instruments. Aircraft control in such a situation is impossible. A pilot must
      recognize when physiological or psychological limits have been exceeded and be
      prepared to abandon the aircraft.
   7.8.2. Formation Lead:
      7.8.2.1. A flight lead experiencing SD will notify the wingmen. The flight lead will then
      comply with procedures in paragraph 7.8.1.
      7.8.2.2. If possible, wingmen should confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback to
      lead.
      7.8.2.3. If symptoms persist, the lead should terminate the mission and recover the flight
      by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.8.3. Formation Wingman:
      7.8.3.1. The wingman will advise the lead when disorientation makes it difficult for the
      wingman to maintain his or her position.
      7.8.3.2. The lead will advise the wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and
      airspeed.
      7.8.3.3. If symptoms persist, the lead will establish a straight-and-level flight for 30 to 60
      seconds, conditions permitting.
      7.8.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, the lead should consider passing the
      lead to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situational awareness
      from a chase position. Transfer lead while in straight-and-level flight. Once assuming the
      lead, the wingman will maintain straight-and-level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary,
      terminate the tactical mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.8.4. Three- or Four-Ship Formation. The lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight-and-
   level flight according to paragraph 4.5 of this instruction. The element with the SD pilot will
   remain straight and level while the other element separates from the flight.
7.9. Armament System Malfunctions:
   7.9.1. Inadvertent Release Procedures. If an inadvertent release occurs, pilots will:
      7.9.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                        45


      7.9.1.2. Check armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode.
      Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and obtain a chase aircraft during return to base,
      if practical.
      7.9.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
      7.9.1.4. Impound the aircraft upon landing.
   7.9.2. Failure to Release (or Hung Ordnance) Procedures. If ordnance fails to release
   when all appropriate switches are set, proceed as follows:
      7.9.2.1. Verify the proper switch position.
      7.9.2.2. Recheck switch positions and make an additional attempt to expend.
      7.9.2.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison them in a suitable area on
      a single pass, if practical.
      7.9.2.4. If ordnance remains on the aircraft, follow the hung ordnance recovery
      procedures.
7.10. Inflight Practice of Emergency Procedures:
7.10. (AETC)Inflight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Simulated emergency practice
requires daylight, a ceiling at least 1,500 feet AGL, visibility at least 3 miles, and VMC
according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   7.10.1. A simulated emergency procedure is a procedure that produces an effect that would
   closely parallel the actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to a degree that produces
   a drag equivalent to a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.10.1. (AETC) Pilots current or upgrading in the aircraft may practice simulated
   emergency procedures. Pilots will not practice simulated emergency takeoff, approach, or
   landing procedures unless an IP or flight examiner has immediate access to aircraft controls
   except as follows:
      7.10.1.1. (Added-AETC) Staff proficiency pilots flying dual may practice simulated
      emergency takeoff, approach, and landing procedures without an IP or flight examiner in
      the aircraft.
      7.10.1.2. (Added-AETC) Students in ENJJPT PIT are authorized to practice simulated
      single-engine and no-flap approaches and landings on syllabus-directed team sorties.
   7.10.2. All training related to aborted takeoffs will be accomplished in the flight simulator,
   cockpit familiarization trainer (CFT), or static aircraft.
   7.10.2. (AETC) Pilots will not practice takeoff emergency procedures below 500 feet AGL.
   7.10.3. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited except for functional check flight
   (FCF) training requirements.
   7.10.4. Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and applicable MAJCOM supplements for
   emergency landing patterns.
   7.10.5. (Added-AETC) Initiate a simulated single-engine go-around by 100 feet AGL (300
   feet AGL if full flaps are used).
 46             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


7.11. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. If an aircraft is lost in flight, actions must
immediately begin to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. All flight members
must aggressively pursue location and rescue of downed personnel even if they seem uninjured.
Many downed aircrews initially suffer from shock or have delayed reactions to ejection injuries.
The following procedures are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet each unique
SAR situation: (Note: Specific procedures will be detailed in the unit local supplement.)
   7.11.1. Squawk. Immediately terminate maneuvering, using appropriate KIO procedures.
   Establish a SAR commander. Place the IFF to Emergency to alert ATC or ground control
   intercept (GCI) of the emergency situation.
   7.11.2. Talk. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft or flight intentions
   immediately to applicable control agencies. Use Guard frequency if necessary. Do not use
   aircrew names on the radio; individual crew positions may be referenced by using the call
   sign and the suffix ―ALPHA‖ to refer to the front cockpit occupant and ―BRAVO‖ to refer to
   the rear cockpit occupant (for example, ―Randy 04-ALPHA‖ or ―Randy 04-BRAVO‖).
   7.11.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors or crash site, using any means
   available. Use the VOR, TACAN, or inertial navigation system (INS) position; ATC or GCI
   positioning; or ground references to identify the immediate area for subsequent rescue
   efforts.
   7.11.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of
   all possible survivors is determined. As a guide, allow 1 minute per 1,000 feet for a deployed
   parachute to descend. Deconflict other aircraft assisting in the SAR by altitude to prevent a
   midair collision. Establish high or low combat air patrol (CAP) as necessary to facilitate
   communications with other agencies.
   7.11.5. Bingo. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum SAR
   coverage over survivors or crash site. Do not overfly bingo fuel. Relinquish SAR operation to
   designated rescue forces on their arrival.
7.12. Solo Student Restrictions (UFT only):
   7.12.1. Do not perform the following:
       7.12.1.1. Traffic pattern stalls, approach to stalls, and slow flight.
       7.12.1.2. Advanced handling characteristics maneuvers.
       7.12.1.3. Practice nose high and low recoveries.
       7.12.1.4. Practice lost wingman as wing.
       7.12.1.5. Rolling takeoffs.
       7.12.1.6. Practice emergency patterns and landings.
       7.12.1.7. Low closed or circling approaches.
       7.12.1.8. Formation landings.
       7.12.1.9. DELETED
       7.12.1.10. Takeoffs with crosswinds (including gusts) greater than 15 knots, or landings
       with crosswinds (including gusts) greater than 15 knots (dry) or 10 knots (wet).
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                             47


      7.12.1.11. Patterns and landings with more than 2,500 pounds of fuel.
      7.12.1.12. Flight in an aircraft with any known malfunction or requiring an operational
      check (EXCEPTION: Inoperative instrumentation in the rear cockpit).
      7.12.1.13. Any unbriefed maneuver.
      7.12.1.14. On the wing of another solo student.
      7.12.1.15. Formation low approaches below 300 feet AGL.
      7.12.1.16. (Added-AETC) Split S or sliceback aerobatic maneuver entries, or
      continuing over-the-top maneuvers when the apex is below 18,000 feet AGL.
      7.12.1.17. (Added-AETC) Lead or number three position in a four-ship formation
      (except the 80th Flying Training Wing).
   7.12.2. Solo student minimum fuel is 800 pounds.
   7.12.3. Post-contact checkride solo students may climb and descend through IMC if the
   ceiling is at or above 5,000 feet AGL and not more than 2,000 feet thick. Minimum in-flight
   visibility above and below the ceiling is 5 miles. Solo students will not level off or cruise in
   any IMC.
7.13. Birdstrike and Loss of Canopy Procedures:
   7.13.1. Following any birdstrike that enters the cockpit, or loss of canopy, the potential for
   extreme confusion and disorientation is great. Pilots must use extreme care to avoid
   situations resulting in both crewmembers attempting to fly the aircraft at the same time.
   7.13.2. The crewmember with the intact canopy must be prepared to assume or maintain
   control of the aircraft. The pilot flying prior to the birdstrike or loss of canopy will maintain
   aircraft control (if able) until a positive transfer of aircraft control has occurred. The pilot not
   flying will monitor flight parameters and be ready to immediately assume control if the pilot
   flying is not responding appropriately (by initiating a climb if in the low-altitude
   environment).
   7.13.3. If the aircraft is at low altitude when the birdstrike or canopy loss occurs, the pilot
   flying will (if able) immediately select MIL or MAX power on both engines and establish a
   climb away from the ground. The pilot not flying will be prepared to assume control of the
   aircraft if the pilot flying does not initiate a climb away from the ground.
   7.13.4. If the intercom fails, following a birdstrike that enters the cockpit, or canopy loss.
   The pilots will transfer aircraft control by shaking the stick, unless prebriefed otherwise. (See
   paragraph 3.17.)
7.14. Nonpilot Aircrew Flying. MAJCOMs may establish procedures and restrictions for
nonpilot aircrew member control of the aircraft.
7.14. (AETC)Nonpilot Aircrew Flying. IFF weapon system officers may control the aircraft
but will not have physical control of the aircraft during:
   7.14.1. (Added-AETC) Student pilot sorties (in the same aircraft with the student pilot),
   unless safety of flight dictates.
   7.14.2. (Added-AETC) Takeoffs or landings.

                   CAFB T-38C LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Introduction. This supplement contains procedures for all
14 OG assigned T-38C pilots and defines 14 OG flight operations for the T-38C aircraft. This
supplement contains information specific to T-38Cs operating at Columbus Air Force Base and
the surrounding operational areas. Columbus T-38C pilots will fly only maneuvers described in
the applicable regulations and instructions. Deviations from this instruction are only authorized
when approved by 14 OG/CC, higher authority, or in the interest of safety. Differences between
SUPT and IFF T-38C operations are annotated.
8.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) General.
   8.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Dual/Solo Definitions. For this supplement, Dual is an
   Instructor Pilot (IP) and a student pilot/upgrade pilot. Solo refers to an SUPT solo student.
8.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Call Signs. 14 OG/CC through 14 OSS/OSOP publishes a
master call sign roster. Ground Facility Call Signs are:


                CALL SIGN
                SUNFISH                  RWY 13R/31L RSU

                COLUMBUS SOF             SOF
8.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Cross Country / Out and Back Procedures. Reference
squadron guidance.
8.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) BAK-15 Barrier Configurations/Inspections.
   8.5.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Prior to the first Class A RSU operation, Live Oak
   controllers will ensure operation of the BAK-15 by raising and lowering the barrier. If
   aircraft are airborne during this test, takeoffs will be discontinued and aircraft in the traffic
   pattern will be restricted to a low approach no lower than 500’ AGL.
   8.5.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The 14 OG/OGV T-38C Branch Chief is the OPR for
   monthly barrier inspections. Barrier inspections will be coordinated by the T-38C Branch
   Chief and may consist of no-notice checks or testing the barriers from the Tower or RSU.
   Other aircrew may be designated to conduct the no-notice tests, but the crew will contain at
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          51


   least one experienced IP. No-notice checks will usually take place from a full stop on the
   outside runway and after the aircraft is safely on landing roll. The call for the barrier to be
   raised will be made on the controlling radio frequency.
   8.5.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If there was a problem identified during testing, OGV
   and parties involved will determine the proper course of action to correct the problem.
8.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Runway Surface Condition (RSC). The SOF may direct
Tower and/or the RSUs to broadcast a change in RSC before Airfield Management confirms it,
when safety dictates. In this case, ATC will preface the advisory with ―SOF advises.‖
8.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Flightline Visitor Escort Procedures. Visitors to the local
ramp must check in with the Squadron SUP/Duty Officer for a briefing, aircraft assignment, and
clearance onto the ramp. During weekend hours of operation, when there is a Squadron
SUP/Duty Officer available for cross country returns, visitors shall be permitted to access the
ramp with SUP/Duty Officer coordination with Security Forces and Maintenance. SUP/Duty
Officer will designate escorts for all visitors to and from the ramp. With no Squadron SUP/Duty
Officer available, visitors are NOT permitted to access the ramp. Visitors are NOT permitted to
sit in ejection seat aircraft.
8.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Static Display Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial
Event Policy and Procedures, and the AETC Supplement for additional guidance.
8.9. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Ground Operations.
   8.9.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots will step to aircraft to make their scheduled
   takeoff time with adequate time for ground operations. A helmet bag is required to carry a
   helmet to and from the aircraft.
   8.9.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) All aircraft will monitor Ground (CH 1) during engine
   start. Advise Ground of the current ATIS code when calling for taxi.
   8.9.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When Sunfish controls the inside runway, Ground
   Control advises aircraft taxiing out to runway 13C/13L, ―SUNFISH PROCEDURES.‖
   Aircrew will monitor Sunfish RSU frequency approaching Taxiway L until across runway
   13R. Use the traffic light located on the opposite side of the runway for minimum
   communication. After receiving a green light, aircrew will visually clear final before
   crossing the active. Aircraft normally will not check-in on Sunfish frequency.
   8.9.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) For aircraft exiting/crossing the departure end of
   runway 31C after landing, and Sunfish controls runway 31L, Ground Control informs
   aircraft, ―SUNFISH PROCEDURES.‖ Aircraft will switch to Sunfish RSU frequency, hold
   at the VFR hold short line on Taxiway Alpha, and await clearance from Sunfish RSU to
   cross 31L. Aircraft normally will not check-in on Sunfish frequency. After an appropriate
   time with a break in the action and aircraft have not been cleared to cross by the controller,
   the lead aircraft will query the controller with number and type of aircraft holding short (i.e.:
   ―Two T-38s holding short‖). Aircrew will refrain from using the term ―to cross‖ in their
   transmission. When appropriate, the controller will clear the aircraft to cross with number of
   aircraft cleared to cross (i.e.: ―Two T-38s cleared to cross runway 31L or Two T-38s cleared
   to cross north inside‖). Aircraft will switch to Ground when clear of runway 31L.
8.10. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Preflight/Post-flight.
52            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


  8.10.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Do not apply power (battery or APU) or start engines
  if the adjacent aircraft is being serviced with fuel or oxygen. The grounding wire must
  remain connected until servicing is complete on the adjacent aircraft. Aircraft commanders
  will ensure the grounding wire is removed before starting engines.
  8.10.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Tires will be changed when any tire limit is reached.
  The aircraft commander may request a tire change before reaching the criteria when
  anticipating exceptionally heavy tire usage (i.e. cross-country, pattern only sorties, etc.).
  8.10.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots will inform Squadron Ops of tail number
  changes that occur after aircraft sign out.
  8.10.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Following any aircraft servicing or maintenance,
  accomplish another aircraft preflight of all affected areas.
8.11. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Taxi.
  8.11.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Taxiing past vehicles parked within white lines on the
  aircraft’s respective parking ramps does not require a marshaller.
  8.11.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Use two-way taxi procedures on taxiways C and along
  the T-6 parking ramp north of ―Foxtrot Row‖. Use one-way taxi procedures along the T-38
  parking ramp. When taxiing south on the T-6 parking ramp, make an ―S‖ turn at Foxtrot
  Row to provide added wingtip spacing. When taxiing in these areas, use caution for
  maintenance vehicles, fuel trucks, etc. In two-way taxi areas, aircraft will use the right-hand
  taxi-line.
  8.11.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) All aircraft will taxi on the yellow lines on Taxiways
  C, G, and on all parking ramps. Aircraft may stagger on all other taxiways as necessary.
  When holding to cross the runway, T-38s and T-6s may closely stagger on Taxiways A and F
  to reduce congestion.
  8.11.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Taxi lines located in the north and south hammerheads
  provide at least 10’ wingtip clearance for T-38, T-6, and T-1 aircraft in any combination. All
  aircraft should pull up in the hammerhead to allow a safe distance for aircraft to taxi behind
  them.
  8.11.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) For the Center Runway, hold in the arming area using
  the yellow taxi line closest to the runway. Contact Tower on Ch 3 when ready for departure.
  8.11.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When landing on RWY 31C, do not clear via Taxiway
  H unless cleared a 180º turn by Tower.
  8.11.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When landing on RWY 13C, pilots may request to exit
  at Taxiway H.
  8.11.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If exiting RWY 13C at Taxiway H, taxi back via
  Taxiways E, F, and D.
  8.11.9. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Do not taxi into a spot unless a marshaller is present.
  At night, the marshaller must have two working lighted wands. Do not taxi into a spot
  adjacent to an aircraft being serviced with fuel or oxygen.
8.12. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Flying Operations.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                    53


  8.12.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Transponder Procedures. Aircraft without an
  operable transponder are restricted to VFR pattern operations, unless in formation with an
  aircraft with an operating transponder.
  8.12.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Local Flying Status Common to All Airframes.
     8.12.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) OPS/Weather               Recall. Conditions       require
     recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all launches with the SOF.
     8.12.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Area Hold. Conditions prohibit normal aircraft
     recovery to CAFB. Coordinate all launches with the SOF.
     8.12.2.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Standby. All local flying is suspended for an
     indefinite period of time until conditions improve to support a better status.
     8.12.2.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Terminate. Local flying terminated for the
     remainder of the day.
     8.12.2.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Slots. Weather at least 300/1. Slots provide the
     capability to continue local flying operations when weather precludes simultaneous T-
     38C and T-6 recoveries because an IFR approach to Runway 13C/31C is required by all
     aircraft. Plan all approaches to a full stop. Aircrew requiring a radar delay or multiple
     approaches must coordinate with the SOF. The squadron SUP/Top3s will inform the
     SOF of coordinated slot times. Slot times are a landing window. For planning purposes,
     SUP/Top3s will plan for no more than 1 aircraft to land every 3 minutes. All squadron
     aircraft must land within the agreed upon window. If actual or forecast weather
     precludes a wing landing, extra time must be added for single ship landings.
  8.12.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) T-38C Flying Status.
     8.12.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Unrestricted. Weather and facilities permit full
     use of all training areas for dual and solo missions.
     8.12.3.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Weather Solo. Weather 5,000/5. Solo students
     will remain clear of clouds or maintain weather solo criteria. SUPT single-ship solos can
     be flown if the student is post transition check using weather solo criteria.
     8.12.3.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pattern Solo. Weather 3,300/5. SUPT solo
     students are not permitted outside of the VFR pattern. Weather permits VMC pattern
     operations including breakout and re-entry.
     8.12.3.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Dual. Weather at least 2,800/3. No SUPT solo
     sorties permitted. Weather permits VMC pattern operations including breakout and re-
     entry.
     8.12.3.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Restricted Overhead. Weather at least 2,000/3.
     If Tower controls the outside pattern, entry from vectors to initial, gate and Runway
     13C/31C side-step may be approved, traffic permitting. Under Live Oak Procedures,
     aircraft will enter the pattern from initial takeoff or crosswind entry from Runway
     13C/31C. Maximum number of aircraft in the RSU controlled pattern is eight. No
     breakouts. Aircrew will carry straight through initial with straight-ins between 9 and 4
     NM.
54           AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


     8.12.3.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VFR Straight-in. Weather at least 1,500/3. In-
     flight visibility 5 miles or greater. If Tower controls the outside pattern, entry from radar
     initial, gate and Runway 13C/31C side-step may be approved, traffic permitting. Aircraft
     can enter the pattern from initial takeoff or crosswind entry from Runway 13C/31C.
     Pattern altitude is 1,200’ MSL, straight-ins or Low Closed only. No normal overheads or
     breakouts. Maximum aircraft in the RSU pattern is five. T-38Cs fly the pattern at 300
     KCAS until 9 miles.
     8.12.3.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) IFR Recovery. Weather requirements will be
     either the T-6 circling approach minimums or 300/1 if T-6s are not flying. T-38Cs
     recover to Runway 13C/31C.
     8.12.3.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Weather Solo Criteria. Post Transition
     checkride SUPT solo students may climb and descend through IMC if the ceiling is at or
     above 5,000 feet AGL and not more than 2,000 feet thick with a minimum in-flight
     visibility above and below the ceiling of 5 miles. SUPT solo students will not level off or
     cruise in any IMC. IFF Top 3 will determine IFF student training restrictions and inform
     the SOF.
  8.12.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Outside Runway Recovery Status. This status
  informs pilots whether Live Oak or Tower is controlling the outside runway. ―Tower
  controls RWY 31C only‖ or ―Live Oak Recoveries‖ on ATIS indicates the primary T-38
  runway is the outside runway and Live Oak is controlling it. T-1s will not operate on the
  outside runway when Live Oak is in control except in an emergency.
  8.12.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Instrument Procedures.
     8.12.5.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VOR/DME or TACAN approaches may be
     conducted to 13L and 31R when tower controls both 13C/13L or 31C/31R.
     8.12.5.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilot may request sidestep to land on the outside
     runway when Tower controls the outside.
     8.12.5.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Chase/Low Approach Procedures, Center
     Runway. If directed by Tower to ―OFFSET‖, clear the runway between the center and
     outside runways.
     8.12.5.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Notify Tower or Arrival of frequency changes to
     Live Oak, Departure, or Arrival.
     8.12.5.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) During IFR Recovery Status, 14 FTW aircraft on
     circling approaches to RWYs 31L/13R and 31R/13L are MARSA with 14 FTW aircraft
     arriving and departing RWY 31C/13C.
  8.12.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VMC Drag. Formation VMC Drag will be
  accomplished IAW AFI 11-251. The VMC Drag allows a formation to achieve nonstandard
  formation spacing on final. The trailing aircraft gains separation by reducing airspeed and
  shall squawk 0400 at CBM. At locations other than CBM, the flight lead should coordinate
  for non-standard formation and squawk as required. Aircraft are still treated as a single
  formation by ATC, and communications are directed to the lead aircraft. However, each
  aircraft in the formation shall call gear down.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                          55


      8.12.6.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The lead aircraft will request VMC Drag upon
      initial call to ATC. Aircraft shall accomplish the drag and approach in daytime, during
      VMC conditions.
      8.12.6.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If landing clearance is canceled, both aircraft
      shall fly runway heading until turning crosswind or, if IMC, lead shall climb to 4,000'
      MSL and the wingman shall climb to 3,000' MSL following standard climb out
      instructions until separate clearances are obtained.
8.13. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pattern Procedures.
   8.13.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) UHF shall be the primary frequency used in the traffic
   pattern. Aircraft shall squawk 0000 TA Silent while in the VFR pattern. When Tower
   controls the pattern, standard FAA communications shall be used by aircrew and controllers.
   8.13.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) T-38 ground tracks and reporting points are depicted in
   the IFG.
      OVERHEAD: 1,700' MSL
      OVERHEAD BREAKOUT: 2,500' MSL
      STRAIGHT-IN: 1,200' MSL
      STRAIGHT-IN BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
      LOW CLOSED: 800' MSL
      LOW CLOSED BREAKOUT: 1,200' MSL
      HIGH PATTERN: 3,000' MSL
   8.13.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) On takeoff leg, go-around, or straight through initial,
   aircraft shall not turn crosswind earlier than the departure end of the outside runway unless
   cleared present position.
   8.13.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VFR Pattern Breakout to Radar. Aircraft will climb
   to 2,500' MSL heading 040, contact RAPCON (CH 16), and make a request. To comply
   with Columbus AFB Class C airspace, aircrew must establish two-way radio communication
   with RAPCON prior to leaving a practice area while breaking out ("C/S, standby" is
   clearance to depart the practice area, whereas, "Aircraft calling departure, standby" is not). If
   unable to make contact prior to 9 DME, return to the appropriate gate.
   8.13.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Night Procedures. Pattern procedures are the same as
   during the day except there are no practice breakouts between sunset and sunrise. The
   default status at night will be ―VFR Straight-in‖ flown at 1200 MSL. If there is a conflict
   between aircraft established in the pattern and a gate entry, aircraft established in the pattern
   are responsible for deconfliction to include breaking out. For actual night breakouts, climb to
   2,500’ MSL heading 040, contact RAPCON (CH 16), and make a request.
   8.13.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Radar Pattern. T-38C aircraft shall fly a maximum
   of 300 KIAS in the radar pattern. Radar patterns are depicted as follows.

  8.13.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Standard “Local Climb Out”. In order to protect the
  360 degree overhead pattern when the weather is VFR, the standard instrument climb out
  procedure for runway 13C/31C is, ―FLY RUNWAY HEADING. CROSS DEPARTURE
  END AT OR BELOW 700’. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 4000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE
  CHANNEL 16.‖ When the weather is less than VFR, "FLY RUNWAY HEADING, CLIMB
  AND MAINTAIN 4,000’. CONTACT DEPARTURE CHANNEL 16." RAPCON may
  abbreviate climb out instructions for local aircraft by stating, ―AFTER COMPLETING LOW
  APPROACH/TOUCH AND GO/OPTION, EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMB OUT.‖
8.14. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) IFR/VFR Clearances.
  8.14.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircrew should request their IFR/VFR clearance prior
  to taxi for all missions that will depart Tower or RSU controlled airspace. Clearance delivery
  will issue Class C departure instructions, squawk, and a frequency for VFR departures. If an
  extended delay is expected with the clearance, aircrew may request taxi and inform Ground
  Control ―AWAITING CLEARANCE.‖ Aircrew will inform Ground Control if encountering
  a problem with the clearance and contact Squadron Ops for assistance.
  8.14.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) On VFR pattern-only sorties, which do not require an
  IFR clearance, the aircrew will state ―PATTERN ONLY‖ to Ground Control on taxi request.
  8.14.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) No more than five local aircraft will be scheduled in
  the radar traffic pattern during multiple radar pattern operations. If the pattern becomes
  saturated with more than five aircraft, RAPCON may direct aircraft to the VFR pattern or to
  full stop.
  8.14.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When Live Oak coordinates for a release, the IFR
  clearance begins when the aircraft crosses the landing threshold. Any other time, a breakout
  to radar is a VFR departure and IFR clearance will be activated upon receipt of "RADAR
  CONTACT" by RAPCON. If for any reason RAPCON states ―return to the practice area or
  Live Oak‖, remain inside the practice area, contact controlling agency (Live Oak or Tower),
  and re-enter at the appropriate gate using breakout procedures.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                    57


  8.14.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) To reduce verbiage, RAPCON may acknowledge 14
  FTW aircraft canceling IFR with ―C/S, ROGER.‖ Aircrew will understand that radar service
  is terminated, will squawk stand-by or the appropriate code.
  8.14.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) IFR Recovery or Slots Status. Prior to departing on
  either status, aircrew must receive an IFR clearance. The IFR clearance is effective once
  cleared for takeoff by the Tower.
  8.14.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Non-Radar Procedures. See Inflight Guide for Non-
  Radar Operating Procedures.
8.15. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Departures.
  8.15.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircrew shall maintain at or below 700' MSL until
  departure end of the runway during VFR weather.
  8.15.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) See FLIP for current Columbus SID.                    Departure
  profiles begin at termination of SID.
  8.15.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) For Canned routes, see IFG.
     8.15.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Canned routing to JAN and MEI will utilize
     West Profile.
     8.15.3.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Canned routing to BHM, MGM and HSV will
     utilize East Profile.
     8.15.3.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) For Cross-country (DD175), aircraft will fly
     profile best suited for projected route of flight.
         8.15.3.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Westbound departures will file IGB or
         CLOUT as initial fix, and will fly West profile.
         8.15.3.3.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Eastbound departures will file MINIM as
         initial fix and will fly East profile.
         8.15.3.3.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Northbound departures will file HAB or
         CBM 008/41 as initial fix, and will fly North profile.
8.15.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) North Profile. See IFG.
  8.15.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) East Profile. See IFG.
  8.15.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) West Profile. See IFG.
  8.15.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Ripley Profile. See IFG.
  8.15.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Live Oak Departures.
     8.15.8.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) After crossing the center runway, hold short and
     offset the taxiway line closest to the approach end. Call when ready for take-off and add
     anything non-standard (i.e.: VFR Delay, Rolling). Do not call Live Oak until number
     one for departure.
     8.15.8.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) As soon as the aircraft is cleared on the runway
     to hold or is cleared for takeoff, conditions permitting, lower the canopies to minimize
     the time spent on the runway.
58           AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


     8.15.8.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots will delay switching to departure control
     frequency until past the departure end when departing from the outside runway in case
     the BAK-15 barrier is needed. Formations should attempt to use visual signals or Aux
     radio for frequency changes to minimize radio congestion.
  8.15.9. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Departure Clearances.
     8.15.9.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) North MOA: ―(C/S, CLEARED NORTH MOA,

     8.15.9.10. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VFR Class ―C‖ departure:                 ―(C/S, FLY
     RUNWAY HEADING, MAINTAIN XXXX’, SQUAWK (XXXX).‖ Aircrew shall fly
     runway heading, maintain VFR at assigned altitude; departure frequency will be CH 4.
     Aircrew shall expect own navigation and altitude outside 10 DME.
     8.15.9.11. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) SEARAY:                 ―(C/S, CLEARED SEARAY,
     SQUAWK XXXX).‖ Aircrew shall fly runway heading, climb and maintain 4,000’ and
     contact departure Ch 14. Expect radar vectors to R4404 (IGB 199/027).
     8.15.9.12. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Outside Runway Departures. Aircraft receive
     takeoff clearance from the controlling agency. When departing on an IFR clearance,
     aircrew shall switch to the departure frequency after takeoff passing the departure end.
     8.15.9.13. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) TORCH-TWO Profile (used for T-38C FCF
     only). IAW the Memphis Center LOA, this is a day/VMC use only profile for supersonic
     FCFs. Aircrew shall obtain clearance (Ch 19) when holding number one. Aircrew shall
     request a frequency change from Tower, prior to contacting clearance delivery, once
     aircraft is confirmed number one for takeoff. Aircrew shall inform the runway
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                       59


     controlling agency when ready for takeoff and add any void time associated with the
     clearance. Aircrew shall expect block FL 310 to FL 390 from Memphis for the
     supersonic run.
8.16. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Trail Departures.
  8.16.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Formations must be rejoined to standard formation
  prior to leaving Columbus airspace, coordinate for separate clearances, or request airspace
  for join-up.
  8.16.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The lead aircraft will squawk ATC assigned code. The
  last aircraft in the nonstandard formation will squawk 0400 until standard formation. In a
  Four-ship, all trailing aircraft will squawk 0400 in Columbus airspace until in standard
  formation.
  8.16.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Once airborne, the lead aircraft will call ―C/S,
  airborne, out of X (altitude) for Y (final altitude), NON STANDARD.‖ If MARSA, aircrew
  shall use both flight’s call signs on initial contact with each ATC agency (i.e., Snake
  MARSA Gundog).
8.17. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Radar Termination Points.
  8.17.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircraft shall make every effort to avoid over-flying
  populated areas at low altitude and advise RAPCON of deviations.
  8.17.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) All aircrew will monitor RAPCON and squawk
  assigned code until within 3 miles of the radar termination point (IFR or VFR) or told to
  contact controlling agency (Live Oak or Tower). RAPCON may continue to provide vectors
  after the aircrew has cancelled IFR to aid in separation between other aircraft on recovery.
  Aircrew shall comply with these vectors until the conflict is resolved either by visual contact
  or other means.
  8.17.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When approaching the radar termination point and able
  to proceed VFR, aircraft shall cancel IFR with RAPCON. RAPCON will respond with
  ―ROGER‖ meaning radar service is terminated and squawk 0000.
  8.17.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircraft shall remain outside 10 DME until reaching
  the radar termination point. Aircrew shall change to Live Oak or Tower and report the
  appropriate gate. Aircrew are expected to cancel IFR no later than 3 miles prior to radar
  termination. If unable to cancel IFR due to frequency congestion, aircraft will squawk 0000
  and contact Live Oak or Tower at 3 miles from gate.
8.18. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Live Oak Pattern Procedures.
  8.18.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Live Oak airspace extends from the surface to 3,500'
  MSL along the 10 DME arc to the north of runway 13L/31R, excluding airspace 3 DME past
  the departure end of the runway. The T-38C VFR pattern depiction is illustrated in the IFG.
  8.18.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Live Oak may be entered via Initial takeoff from Live
  Oak, North/South Gate entries, or crosswind/closed from the center runway.
  8.18.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Live Oak Entry Points. North gate is the primary
  point of entry to Live Oak’s pattern for runway 13L. North gate is a highway interchange
  shaped like a cloverleaf located at CBM 348/011. South gate is the primary point of entry to
60            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


  Live Oak’s pattern for runway 31R. South gate is the southeast edge of a large power plant
  located at CBM 086/009.
  8.18.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) North and South Gate Entry Procedures. The status
  must be at least Dual to accomplish gate entries when Live Oak is controlling the outside
  runway. The gate entry points are also used to re-enter the pattern following a breakout. If
  on an IFR clearance and proceeding direct to north/south gate, aircrew must cancel IFR on
  their own prior to switching to Live Oak’s frequency.
  8.18.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) With the exception of emergencies and aircraft
  accomplishing runway change procedures, aircraft shall not make a north or south gate entry
  between runway change time and 10 minutes past runway change time.
  8.18.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When the status is Restricted Overhead or VFR
  straight-ins, aircraft on departure leg will contact Live Oak, when instructed, for pattern
  entry.
  8.18.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If closed/crosswind entry is denied, aircrew shall
  maintain VFR and accomplish one of the following: Contact RAPCON (Ch 16) for vectors
  to another approach or climb to 2,500’ MSL on runway heading (Dual or better), then turn
  toward the appropriate gate entry point, notifying controller of intentions ―TRANSITION TO
  NORTH/SOUTH GATE.‖
  8.18.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Additional Live Oak Pattern Procedures.
     8.18.8.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Solo Pattern Only. Solo students on ―pattern
     only‖ missions do not need to call clearance delivery. Solo students on a ―pattern only‖
     mission will inform Ground, Tower, and/or Live Oak on initial contact that their profile is
     ―VFR PATTERNS.‖ Upon initial contact with Live Oak, request ―C/S CENTER,
     REQUEST CROSSWIND TO THE HIGH PATTERN.‖ If approved, climb and maintain
     3,000’ MSL, remaining below 1,200’ MSL until clear of inside downwind.
         8.18.8.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Fly the normal pattern ground track at
         3,000’ MSL. Report ―HIGH INITIAL‖ at the normal initial reporting point. When
         less than 2,500 lbs of fuel, report ―HIGH INITIAL, (FUEL).
         8.18.8.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Initiate descent to pattern altitude on the
         turn to outside downwind. Call ―C/S, DESCENDING OUTSIDE DOWNWIND‖.
         Ensure outside downwind is clear before descending and resume the normal pattern
         ground track and altitude.
     8.18.8.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Giving Way. The status must be at least Dual.
     Aircraft on 45/90 to initial, who are already established in the pattern, will normally ―give
     way‖ to initial entries from the respective gate due to pattern priorities. Breakouts from
     this position are not allowed due to a collision hazard associated with simultaneous
     breakouts from the perch.
         8.18.8.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) To give way, from 45/90 to initial, climb to
         2,500 MSL, call ―C/S, POSITION, GIVING WAY‖, and fly an offset initial to the
         Northeast.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                      61


        8.18.8.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Initiate descent to pattern altitude on the
        turn to outside downwind. Call ―C/S, DESCENDING OUTSIDE DOWNWIND‖.
        Ensure outside downwind is clear before descending.
     8.18.8.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Breakout. The status must be at least Dual for
     breaking out. Breakouts from Restricted Overhead and VFR straight-ins are considered
     an emergency procedure. Breakout ground tracks are depicted in the IFG.
        8.18.8.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If denied St-in after Gate Entry. If
        denied a straight-in after a gate entry, aircraft may breakout to re-enter at the active
        gate for another attempt at a straight-in. Aircraft will start a climbing turn away from
        the pattern and state, ―C/S, POND, BREAKING OUT.‖ Aircraft will climb to 2500’
        on a 040 heading to parallel the inbound heading for the gates. When sufficient
        turning room will allow the aircraft to turn towards the North/South Gate, descend to
        1700’, and be on a 220° heading 1NM prior to the gate, call, ―C/S, DESCENDING
        NORTH/SOUTH GATE.‖
        8.18.8.3.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Overhead Pattern. After deconfiguring,
        report ―C/S, POSITION, BREAKING OUT‖. Execute a turn away from the runway
        while climbing to 2500’ MSL. Once clear of Live Oak pattern, and sufficient turning
        room will allow the aircraft to turn towards the North/South Gate, descend to 1700’,
        and be on a 220° heading 1NM prior to the gate, call, ―C/S, DESCENDING
        NORTH/SOUTH GATE.‖
        8.18.8.3.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Straight-in Breakout Prior to 4-mile
        Point. Descend and maintain 1200 MSL, deconfigure, call ―C/S, POSITION (5
        miles, etc.), BREAKING OUT‖ and turn toward the appropriate gate. Once clear of
        Live Oak pattern, and sufficient turning room will allow the aircraft to turn towards
        the North/South Gate, climb to 1700’, and be on a 220° heading 1NM prior to the
        gate, call, ―C/S, CLIMBING NORTH/SOUTH GATE.‖
        8.18.8.3.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Inside the 4-mile point. Perform a normal
        go-around or follow controller’s instructions.
        8.18.8.3.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Low Closed Breakout. Maintain 1200
        MSL and follow the straight-in breakout procedures.
        8.18.8.3.6. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Restricted Overhead Breakout. Aircraft
        required to breakout will climb to 3500 MSL, fly heading 040°, and squawk
        EMERGENCY until receiving an IFR clearance.
        8.18.8.3.7. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Formation                Breakout. A      formation
        required to breakout will maintain element integrity when proceeding to North/South
        Gate. Formations may take spacing when descending to North/South Gate and enter
        the pattern single ship, or reenter as a formation.
        8.18.8.3.8. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Breakout to Radar. Fly heading 040º,
        climb to 2500’ MSL, and report ―C/S, POSITION, BREAKING OUT TO RADAR.‖
        Contact RAPCON (Ch 16) and continue squawking 0000 until assigned a discrete
        squawk. If radio contact is not established prior to CBM 9 DME, turn back towards
        the pattern and execute gate entry procedures.

8.19. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.
   8.19.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Radar vectors to initial may be conducted at anytime
   the Tower has operational control of the center and outside runway, traffic permitting.
   8.19.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircrew shall request the overhead approach on initial
   contact with RAPCON or prior to reaching 15 flying miles from the runway. Aircrew shall
   report, ―COLUMBUS APPROACH, (CALL SIGN), 20 MILES SOUTHEAST WITH
   (ATIS), REQUESTING OVERHEAD (TYPE LANDING).‖
   8.19.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When requesting radar vectors to initial, aircraft shall
   normally be vectored to a 10-mile final. The aircraft's IFR flight plan is automatically
   cancelled when the aircrew reports "10 MILES.‖ If 10-mile call is not given, RAPCON may
   clear aircraft for an ILS approach or re-sequence the aircraft.
8.20. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Tactical Initial. Tactical initial will only be available for
use when tower is controlling at a minimum 13/31C and 13L/31R simultaneously, with a Dual
status or better. Tactical initial may be flown in 2, 3 or 4 ship formation.
   8.20.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots will request ―Tac Initial‖ on first contact with
   RAPCON. Approval for tactical initial is through Tower.
   8.20.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When tower approves tactical initial flight leads will
   line up east of 13L/31R but not to be a conflict with inside downwind (lineup with tree line
   east of 13L/31R) and wingmen will lineup no further West than 13C/31C in spread line-
   abreast; this will provide approximately 3000’ spacing between aircraft. If in a 3-ship, the
   trailing aircraft will line up between the leading element, approx 6,000 feet in trail. If in a 4-
   ship, the formation will be a container (not offset), with the trailing element approx 6,000
   feet behind the leading element.
   8.20.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Add ―for Tac Initial‖ with first radio call to Tower and
   report ―4 mile Tac Initial‖ at 4 nm from the runway. If 3 ship report ―C/S 2 + 1 Tac Initial,‖
   if 4 ship report ―C/S 2 + 2 Tac Initial.‖
   8.20.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) In the break zone, the element will perform an in-place
   90 degree turn towards inside downwind. The flight lead(s) will continue the turn to roll out
   on the normal inside downwind ground track. The wingmen will roll out after 90 degrees of
   turn, and delay their next turn to roll out on inside downwind, behind their flight leads on the
   normal inside downwind ground track. If in a 3 or 4-ship formation, the trailing element will
   delay their turn until the preceding element is clear of the formation and minimum spacing
   can be attained. If told to ―carry straight thru,‖ flight leads may rejoin flight or remain in
   tactical and re-request TAC initial on outside downwind.
   8.20.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Tac Initial may be flown at out bases if approved by
   tower.
8.21. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Center Runway Arrival Procedures.
   8.21.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Contact Straight-In Approach. Aircrew shall
   declare ―CONTACT‖ with RAPCON prior to 10 DME, but not prior to base leg. After
   RAPCON approves the approach, aircrew shall maintain 2,000’ MSL until intercepting a
   visual glidepath. Runway centerline will be established prior to 10 DME and maintained to
   the runway.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                       63


   8.21.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The Tower will direct all frequency changes to
   departure or arrival. When the aircrew requests to stay with the Tower in the VFR pattern,
   IFR clearance is terminated after crossing the runway threshold on IFR approaches.
8.22. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Split-to-Land Approach Procedures. Aircrew and ATC
may request a split-to-land maneuver for more expeditious recoveries when Tower controls all
runways involved.
   8.22.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Weather conditions for split-to-land maneuvers must
   be at or above the sidestep minimums for the approach being flown. In the absence of
   sidestep minimums, circling minimums will be used.
   8.22.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) In order to request a split-to-land maneuver, aircrew
   must do one of the following.
       8.22.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Advise RAPCON of request for split-to-land
       maneuver and state type of landing when requesting an approach prior to 10 miles.
       RAPCON should contact Tower local controller for approval to allow a split-to-land
       maneuver.
       8.22.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Request a split-to-land maneuver with Tower
       prior to the Final Approach Fix.
   8.22.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Split-to-land maneuvers may be executed off all
   approaches and will commence no earlier than the FAF. Flight lead shall advise ATC when
   commencing the split-to-land maneuver. Aircrew shall maintain their own separation during
   the split-to-land maneuver.
NOTE: When controlling other aircraft in conjunction with a flight which will execute a split-
to-land, the rule is, the flight which has been cleared for a split-to-land ―OWNS‖ both runways
until the last element lands.
   8.22.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Split-to-Land maneuvers should normally terminate
   via full stop. If not a full stop, VFR aircraft shall maintain VFR and contact Tower. IFR
   aircraft shall execute climb out or proceed as directed by RAPCON. Aircrew shall maintain
   their own separation upon missed approach and until standard separation is achieved.
8.23. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Local Flying Airspace.
   8.23.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) RAPCON airspace spans approximately 50 nautical
   miles around Columbus AFB from the surface up to and including FL 230. There is a major
   victor airway (V278) that runs east/west directly through Columbus airspace from west to
   east approximately 15 nautical miles south of the airfield. V245 joins V278 from the
   southwest at the Bigbee VORTAC and splits to the southeast at the MINIM intersection. Jet
   Route 52 (J52), which mirrors V278, is a feeder route for numerous civilian aircraft into
   Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
   8.23.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) CAFB Class C airspace includes an outer area, which

  ATC assigns a vector.
  8.27.14. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) VFR Arrivals. During recovery, aircraft shall
  contact Columbus Approach at approximately 30 NM for radar advisory service and runway
  approach clearance.
8.28. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Lost Communication.
  8.28.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Lost Communications on the Ground. When
  communication loss procedures require an aircraft to enter or cross an active runway the
  Tower/RSU will ensure the operation is safe and any required coordination is completed
  prior to initiating a light gun signal that will allow the aircraft with no radio capabilities to
  enter the runway. See the IFG for Ground Radio Failure and ATC Tower Light Gun Signals
  Table.
     8.28.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Holding for Runway 31C. Aircrew shall hold

     lower the canopy.
  8.28.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Lost Communications in Tower Airspace. If the
  aircraft loses communication in Tower airspace prior to receiving landing clearance, aircraft
  will continue the approach, squawk 7600, and aircrew will watch the Tower for a green light
  (clearance to land). If a flashing red light, steady red light or flare is observed, aircraft will
  execute the go around/missed approach procedures and follow lost communication
  procedures.
  8.28.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Lost Communications while in RAPCON Airspace.
     8.28.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircraft shall squawk IFF code 7600. If fuel
     does not permit compliance with FLIP or local procedures or if another emergency exists,
     squawk emergency code 7700 continuously. Expect ATC to attempt contact on GUARD
     (243.0) or suitable NAVAID with instructions. If asked to ―squawk fuel,‖ set pounds of
     fuel remaining in transponder (use 7 for an 8 or 9).

  through initial and turn crosswind as the cannons are fired. This will continue until 3 minutes
  after the cannons have been fired.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                      69


8.30. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) R4404 (SeaRay) Procedures. In addition to BASH Plan
guidance and AFI 11-202V3 CAFB Sup, flight leads will:
  8.30.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Following a ―Knock-it-off‖ (KIO) for bird activity,
  aircrew will transmit geographic location and altitude with intensity of bird activity to all
  affected players on the primary frequency.
  8.30.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The Flight Lead will raise the Bird Watch Condition
  (BWC) one level from the set BWC. Given the circumstance, the flight lead may raise the
  condition even higher.
8.31. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Abnormal Operations.
  8.31.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilot Responsibility. When an emergency or a
  malfunction requires traffic priority, declare an emergency with ATC and state intentions.
  Time and conditions permitting, contact the SOF, stating the nature of the emergency, actions
  taken, and intentions. If in the VFR pattern, relay the information through the RSU
  Controller/Tower.
  8.31.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Definitions.
     8.31.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Emergency. Any in-flight condition where the
     safe recovery of the aircraft is in doubt or traffic priority is required.
     8.31.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Medical Emergency. Condition requiring flight
     surgeon and fire/rescue personnel response.
     8.31.2.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Air Abort - Early Return. Condition which
     requires return to base due to a minor aircraft problem or weather unsuitable for the
     mission.
     8.31.2.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Area Hold. Cease maneuvering, climb to the top
     of assigned altitude block, and hold at maximum endurance airspeed. Contact the SUP
     for primary divert base and relay fuel status and intentions.
     8.31.2.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Divert. Time and conditions permitting, notify
     the SOF when diverting. Request direct routing to the divert base with the controlling
     agency. If fuel is critical, declare ―EMERGENCY FUEL‖ and use the Emergency Divert
     Mode or the Mil Thrust Climb Schedule located at the bottom of the Diversion Range
     Summary Table in the T-38C Checklist.
         8.31.2.5.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The             T-38C     primary   divert   base   is
         Birmingham Shuttlesworth INTL, AL.
         8.31.2.5.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Non-military parking preferences are as
         follows: BHM use Atlantic East, HSV use Signature, MEM use Wilson Air, MEI use
         Meridian Aviation.
8.32. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) RSU Responsibility During Emergencies.
  8.32.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The RSU Controller will notify the SOF ASAP and
  assist in any way possible. Advisories/questions from the SOF to the aircrew will be relayed
  via landline through the RSU. The Class A RSU may continue normal operations if it is
 70             AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


   determined the runway is clear and no hazards exist to other aircraft. Otherwise, the
   Controller will implement ―Emergency Pattern Procedures,‖ as follows.
   8.32.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) T-38 pilots carry straight-through-initial at 1,700’
   MSL until reaching 1200 lbs, or the emergency aircraft lands.
   8.32.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If the emergency aircraft has or will shut down the
   runway, the RSU controller should transfer control of the runway surface to Tower as soon as
   possible after ―Emergency Pattern Procedures‖ are safely put into effect. This will allow
   Tower to clear emergency vehicles onto the runway more efficiently.
   8.32.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If pattern aircraft are below divert fuel when an
   emergency occurs and do not have fuel to hold, controllers may authorize aircraft to full-stop
   if they determine that runway FOD is limited to a particular side or area.
8.33. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Emergency Runway Utilization.
   8.33.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) T-38C aircraft with emergencies occurring outside the
   VFR pattern, and/or no-flap, single-engine, heavyweight, brake, tire or directional control
   problems will normally land on the center runway. Emergency aircraft may land on Live
   Oak if the pilot and Live Oak controller determine the center runway is not required for a
   safe recovery.
   8.33.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) T-38C aircraft below divert fuel can land on the inside
   runway with OG/CC approval. Horizontal additional markings on the inside runway indicate
   the leading edge of the surface suitable for T-38 emergency landings (Surface available from
   start of landing zone to end of roll out is: RWY 31L - 8890’/RWY 13R - 7892’). The inside
   runway is not suitable for T-38C night landings due to the placement of the visual approach
   path indicator Runway Point of Interception.
8.34. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Runway Closure. Refer to T-38C IFG for Runway Change
Timeline.
8.35. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Center Runway Landings. If necessary, an emergency
aircraft established in a VFR pattern may land on the center via an extended overhead or visual
straight-in. Normally, the RSU will obtain landing clearance from tower, after which the RSU
will direct the emergency aircraft to switch to Tower frequency prior to initiating the final turn.
Solo students may be directed to remain on Live Oak’s frequency and will receive their landing
clearance from Live Oak. RSU controllers will notify Tower when it becomes apparent a center
runway landing is required. Tower will immediately clear the final approach corridor.
8.36. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircraft Crash Off Base. Refer to 13-204 CAFBSUP. The
RSU controller will direct all aircraft not directly involved in search and rescue efforts to remain
clear of the crash area. The RSU controller will land aircraft under their control as soon as
practical.
8.37. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) RSU Radio Failure. RSU will attempt to contact Tower.
Tower will make a call on guard, ―All aircraft in Live Oak’s Pattern, Contact tower, Ch 3.‖
8.38. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Communications Failure. Aircrews experiencing two-way
communications failure shall follow procedures outlined in the Flight Information Handbook.
When applicable, locally assigned aircrews will use the lost communications procedures outlined
in their IFGs.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                         71


8.39. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Bird Strikes. If a bird strike occurs, discontinue the
mission. If structural damage is suspected, declare an emergency and consider a controllability
check. Record the incident in the AFTO Form 781. Report the incident to 14 FTW/SE and
complete an AF IMT 853, Air Force Wildlife Strike Report.
8.40. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Hot Brakes. If hot brakes are suspected, aircraft will
inform Ground Control and taxi to a designated hot brake area and park aircraft facing upwind.
Designated hot brake areas are the North and South Hammerheads and Taxiway Juliet. Wait for
maintenance and fire-fighting personnel to arrive, and follow the Fire Chief’s instructions. Refer
to IFG.
8.41. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Landing In The Overrun. If an overrun landing is
suspected, full stop as soon as practical. If a go-around is accomplished, leave the gear and flaps
extended. Fuel permitting, request a chase aircraft to visually check the gear and flaps. Inform
the Tower or RSU of the possibility of a barrier strike. Make a write up in the AFTO Form 781.
8.42. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Malfunctions Requiring Gear Pinning. Normally, stop
the aircraft straight ahead and shut the engines down unless necessary to pin the aircraft with
engines running. Coordinate game plan with ATC and SOF.
8.43. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Physiological Incidents. If symptoms of hypoxia,
hyperventilation, G-Induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) or decompression are detected,
terminate the sortie, notify the SOF, declare an emergency, and record the incident in the AFTO
Form 781. With any rapid loss of cabin pressure above FL180 report the incident to14 FTW/SE.
If a rapid decompression occurs above FL250, declare an emergency and report to the Flight
Surgeon’s Office for testing before flying another sortie. Any suspected or confirmed
physiological episode/incident involving oxygen equipment results in impoundment of the
aircraft after engine shutdown. Expect to meet the Flight Surgeon at the end of the runway. Do
not disconnect oxygen equipment until directed by the flight surgeon unless necessary for safety
of flight. Notify 14 FTW/SE of physiological incidents as soon as possible. If the incident occurs
off-station, notify the squadron supervisor and 14 FTW/SE via the command post.
8.44. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Dropped Objects. Report all dropped objects to ATC as
soon as conditions permit. Pinpoint the location of the dropped object using all available aids,
including ATC, and inform the controlling agency. Inform the SOF and 14 FTW/SE. Record the
incident in the AFTO Form 781.
8.45. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Termination of Emergencies. Emergencies can only be
terminated by the Fire Chief after coordinating with the aircraft commander and 14 FTW/SE.
8.46. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Debriefing Emergencies. Pilots are required to debrief any
emergency or unusual situations with the SUP and representatives from 14 FTW/SE and/or 14
OG/MXQI immediately following the flight. The SUP will report occurrences to 14 FTW/SE
when the aircraft has landed at another base.
8.47. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) FOD Prevention. If you suspect a foreign object (FO) in
the cockpit, leave the canopy closed until after engine shutdown. Make an AFTO Form 781
write-up for FO in the cockpit, identifying all lost items. If airborne with suspected FO in the
cockpit, discontinue maneuvering and RTB via a straight in.

8.48. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Index of Thermal Stress (ITS) and Wind Chill
Precautions. ITS Caution, Danger and Chill Factor procedures are outlined in the IFG.
8.49. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Hazardous Weather and Lightning within 5 Miles
Procedures. Report potentially dangerous weather to the SOF or SUP ASAP. Maintenance
personnel are not allowed to park aircraft with reported lightning inside of 5 miles. The SOF may
direct aircraft to divert. Contact the SUP for directions, but use the following guidelines.
   8.49.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If lightning is called within 5 miles, stay in the aircraft
   (unless unsafe) and hold the brakes.
   8.49.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Do not taxi into a parking spot without a marshaller.
8.50. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) General              Procedures       for     Dual     Runway
Operations. Instrument approaches will only be flown to the center runway when Tower is in
control.
   8.50.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Recovery Fuels. With any one runway closed at
   Columbus AFB, the following recovery fuels apply: 1,000 lbs for T-38C (1,200 lbs for T-
   38C SUPT solo students).
   8.50.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Restrictions. Instrument profile missions will plan the
   first VFR pattern to a full stop. Formations will fly the minimum number of overhead
   patterns necessary for training.
8.51. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Operating Procedures During Center Runway
Closure. Minimum forecast weather conditions for returning to CAFB are side-step minimums.
Radar delay patterns and multiple approaches should be minimized. These affect departures and
must be coordinated by the SUPs and the SOF. Contact or instrument restricted low approaches
to the center runway will descend no lower than 700’ MSL.
   8.51.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) During Live Oak recoveries, Live Oak will continue
   normal operations of the T-38 VFR pattern on the outside runway. T-1 aircraft will request
   one VFR straight in to a full stop. Expect Live Oak controllers to have all aircraft carry
   straight-through initial until the T-1 is on the ground.
   8.51.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When Tower controls the outside runway, minimize
   pattern operation. Departures have priority, anticipate restricted low approaches.
   8.51.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) A restricted low approach to the center may be flown.
   It should be followed by a crosswind entry to outside pattern. Plan on sufficient fuel to return
   to radar. If scheduled for the outside pattern and denied a crosswind entry, maintain runway
   heading and climb to 2500’ MSL. Proceed to the North or South gate and remain clear of the
   outside pattern ground track.
8.52. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Operating Procedures During Outside Runway
Closure. The outside pattern is flown to the center runway. No practice approaches or radar
delays will be flown to the center runway during VFR pattern operations.
8.53. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Operating Procedures During Inside Runway Closure
(Long Term). Expect Sunfish to operate the T-6 VFR pattern on the center runway. No T-38C
practice approaches or radar delays will be flown to the center runway during VFR pattern
operations.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011                                        73


   8.53.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When Tower controls the outside runway, minimize
   pattern time.
8.54. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Single Runway Operating Procedures. Takeoffs for local
flying will be temporarily discontinued. If runway availability or fuel do not permit landing at
CAFB, pilots will divert. The SOF may direct Area Hold. Pilots will adjust Joker/Bingo fuels to
land with 1200 lbs. or fuel to divert, whichever is higher. Solo students will be directed to full
stop as soon as possible.
8.54.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Recovery Procedures With Both Overhead Patterns
Open, Single Runway open.
       8.54.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Each aircraft will recover using normal
       procedures. All T-6’s will utilize the Sunfish pattern ground track and frequency. T-38 or
       T-1 aircraft already operating in the pattern will continue in the pattern, while the other
       aircraft will approach via the center to a side-step/circle.
       8.54.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Once established in the pattern, carry straight
       through initial. Report initial with 1200 lbs. and expect clearance from the Controller to
       break and land on the open runway. When flying the final turn, use caution for aircraft on
       initial.
   8.54.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Recovery Procedures With Live Oak Pattern Closed,
   Single Runway open. All T-38/T-1s will recovery via an instrument approach and expect to
   land, side-step, or circle to land on the open runway.
   8.54.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Recovery with Both Overhead Patterns Closed,
   Single Runway open. Recovery is via vectors to an instrument approach, expect to
   land/side-step/circle to land on the open runway.
8.55. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Operating Procedures During Radar Outage. See IFG.
8.56. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) BAK-15 Operations.
   8.56.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots anticipating the need for the barrier during an
   abort should immediately call ―BARRIER, BARRIER, BARRIER‖ to ensure the BAK-15 is
   raised and available on the outside runway.
   8.56.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If the takeoff is continued during an emergency, the
   barrier should remain in the down position to avoid entanglement on climb out.
   8.56.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots expecting a long landing roll, due to aircraft
   malfunction or runway condition, should call for the BAK-15 to be raised for landing.
   8.56.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The SOF or Live Oak may consider raising the barrier
   in front of a solo student with no request if they deem it necessary.
   8.56.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) If a pilot suspects a short landing or contact with the
   barrier occurs, notify the controlling agency immediately.
8.57. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. In the event an
aircraft is lost in flight, take immediate action to locate survivors and initiate rescue efforts.
Expect that the aircrews may initially suffer from shock or have delayed reactions due to ejection
injuries. The following procedures are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet
 74            AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2011


each unique situation. The squadron may supplement these procedures in their standards, as
desired.
   8.57.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) SQUAWK. Immediately terminate maneuvering with
   appropriate Knock-It-Off procedures. Normal priority for SAR on-scene commander (OSC)
   will be the flight lead (#1), then deputy flight lead (#3), then #2, then #4. Solo students
   should coordinate for an IP or dual crew as soon as possible to assume OSC duties. Place IFF
   to EMER to alert ATC.
   8.57.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) TALK. Communicate the emergency situation and
   aircraft/flight intentions immediately to control agencies. Use GUARD if necessary. Do not
   use names on the radio. Refer to crewmembers by call sign and alpha/bravo (front seat/back
   seat). If downed aircrew has a survival radio, establish contact on 243.0, then switch all
   players to 282.8. When able, contact 14 FTW SOF (Ch12) and give him the following
   information.
      8.57.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Number of parachutes.
      8.57.2.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Radial/DME/Lat/Long to crash site.
      8.57.2.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Visual reference point for downed aircrew
      8.57.2.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Condition of aircrew, if known.
      8.57.2.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Your playtime (time until bingo) in minutes.
   8.57.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) MARK. Mark the last known position of
   survivors/crash site using any means available—VOR / TACAN radial/DME, EGI MRK
   function. ATC radar position and visual landmarks.
   8.57.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) SEPARATE. Remain above the last observed
   parachute altitudes until determining the position of all possible survivors. If visual contact
   with a parachute is lost, allow one minute per thousand feet for parachute descent. Deconflict
   other aircraft by altitude to preclude midair collision. Establish high/low CAPs as necessary
   to facilitate communication with other agencies. Do not fly below 1,000’ AGL. Solo students
   should not fly below 8,000’ MSL.
   8.57.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) BINGO. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as
   required to maintain maximum SARCAP coverage over survivor/crash site. Do not overfly
   BINGO fuel (consider lower altitude). Relinquish SARCAP operation to designated rescue
   forces upon their arrival. Ensure they are aware of position, altitude, and call sign of all
   players.

                            UFT AND PIT TRAINING RULES

A14.1. (Added-AETC) Knock-It-Off (KIO) Situations. KIO will be called when safety of
flight is a factor or where doubt or confusion exists. Situations requiring a KIO include:
   A14.1.1. (Added-AETC) A dangerous situation is developing.
   A14.1.2. (Added-AETC) Situational awareness is lost.
   A14.1.3. (Added-AETC) A violation of any of the following has occurred or appears
   imminent:
      A14.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) Area boundaries.
      A14.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) Minimum cloud separation.
      A14.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Minimum altitude.
      A14.1.3.4. (Added-AETC) Minimum range.
   A14.1.4. (Added-AETC) Weather is below minimums for the area or route.
   A14.1.5. (Added-AETC) Any aircraft exceeds maneuvering limits such that safety of flight
   is compromised (i.e., over-G, min airspeed, etc.).
   A14.1.6. (Added-AETC) A recognized radio failure or observation of a continuous wing
   rock.
   A14.1.7. (Added-AETC) Bingo fuel is inadvertently overflown.
   A14.1.8. (Added-AETC) An unbriefed or unscheduled flight enters the working area and is
   detrimental to the safe conduct of the mission.
   A14.1.9. (Added-AETC) Aircraft flying the extended trail/fluid maneuvering exercise
   inside the minimum range of 500 feet or forward of the 3/9 line.
   A14.1.10. (Added-AETC) Lost sight. The pilot flying the aircraft that loses sight will call
   ―Blind.‖ The visual aircraft will assume formation deconfliction and execute the following:
      A14.1.10.1. (Added-AETC) Lead Aircraft Blind. Transmit ―blind‖ and maintain a
      predictable flightpath. The wingman will either call ―continue‖ and state position or call
      ―KNOCK-IT-OFF.‖
      A14.1.10.2. (Added-AETC) Wingman Blind. Transmit ―blind‖ and maneuver away
      from lead’s last known position. Lead will call ―continue‖ and state position or call
      ―KNOCK-IT-OFF.‖
   A14.1.11. (Added-AETC) Any player calls "KNOCK-IT-OFF."
A14.2. (Added-AETC) KIO Actions:
   A14.2.1. (Added-AETC) Clear flightpath.
   A14.2.2. (Added-AETC) Cease maneuvering and climb/descend to a safe altitude.
   A14.2.3. (Added-AETC) Maintain visual.

   A14.2.4. (Added-AETC) Acknowledge with full call sign.
A14.3. (Added-AETC) Terminate Situations. Terminate will be used to discontinue
maneuvering when safety of flight is not a factor and called when:
   A14.3.1. (Added-AETC) Bingo fuel is reached.
   A14.3.2. (Added-AETC) Desired learning objectives are met.
   A14.3.3. (Added-AETC) An aircraft is out of position (extended trail/fluid maneuvering
   cone, wing work, etc.) with no expectation of expeditious return to position.
   A14.3.4. (Added-AETC) Any player calls ―TERMINATE.‖
A14.4. (Added-AETC) Terminate Actions:
   A14.4.1. (Added-AETC) Clear flightpath.
   A14.4.2. (Added-AETC) Cease maneuvering and climb/descend to a safe altitude.
   A14.4.3. (Added-AETC) Maintain visual.
   A14.4.4. (Added-AETC) Acknowledge with call sign.
A14.5. (Added-AETC) Minimum Weather:
   A14.5.1. (Added-AETC) Extended trail. Clear of clouds with 3 nm in-flight visibility and
   discernible horizon.
