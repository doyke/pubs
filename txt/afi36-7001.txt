                                            Chapter 1

                  OVERVIEW AND FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Program Purpose. This Instruction establishes guidance and procedures for the
administration and management of Air Force diversity initiatives. Air Force capabilities and war
fighting skills are enhanced by diversity among its personnel. At its core, diversity provides our
Total Force an aggregation of strengths, perspectives, and capabilities that transcends individual
contributions. Air Force personnel who work in a diverse environment learn to maximize
individual strengths and to combine individual abilities and perspectives for the good of the
mission. Our ability to attract a larger, highly talented, diverse pool of applicants for service
with the Air Force, both military and civilian, and develop and retain our current personnel will
impact our future Total Force. Diversity is about strengthening our force and ensuring our long-
term viability to support our mission to Fly, Fight, and Win…in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.
Diversity is a military necessity.
1.2. Applicability and Scope. This Instruction applies to all Airmen of the Total Force. This
includes officer and enlisted, Active Duty (AD), Air Force Reserve (AFR), Air National Guard
(ANG) units in Federal Status along with Department of the Air Force civilian employees.
1.3. Air Force Definition of Diversity. The Air Force broadly defines diversity as a composite
of individual characteristics, experiences, and abilities consistent with the Air Force Core Values
and the Air Force Mission. Air Force diversity includes but is not limited to: personal life
experiences, geographic background, socioeconomic background, cultural knowledge,
educational background, work background, language abilities, physical abilities,
philosophical/spiritual perspectives, age, race, ethnicity, and gender.
     1.3.1. This concept of diversity is to be tailored as specific circumstances and the law
     require.
     1.3.2. Diversity encompasses:
        1.3.2.1. Demographic diversity - inherent or socially defined personal characteristics,
        including age, race/ethnicity, religion, gender, socioeconomic status, family status,
        disability, and geographic origin.
        1.3.2.2. Cognitive/behavioral diversity - differences in styles of work, thinking, learning,
        and personality.
        1.3.2.3. Organizational/structural diversity - organizational/institutional background
        characteristics affecting interaction, including Service, Component, and
        occupation/career field.
        1.3.2.4. Global diversity - intimate knowledge of and experience with foreign languages
        and cultures, inclusive of both citizen and non-citizen personnel, exchange officers,
        coalition partners, and foreign nationals with whom we interact as part of a globally
        engaged Air Force.
     1.3.3. Air Force diversity initiatives complement, but remain separate and distinct from, Air
     Force Equal Opportunity (EO) compliance programs and activities.
AFI36-7001 20 JULY 2012                                                                           5


   1.3.4. Air Force diversity is grounded on inclusion and mutual respect among all personnel.
1.4. Air Force Diversity Policy.
   1.4.1. The Air Force will develop and maintain comprehensive diversity initiatives to
   enhance the all-volunteer Total Force.
   1.4.2. The initiatives will:
       1.4.2.1. Ensure all qualified personnel are welcome in America’s Air Force.
       1.4.2.2. Educate and train all personnel on the importance of diversity, including mutual
       respect, thus promoting an Air Force culture that values inclusion of all personnel in the
       Total Force and views diversity and inclusion throughout the workforce as a force
       multiplier in accomplishing the Air Force mission.
       1.4.2.3. Ensure that all personnel in the Total Force have the opportunity to achieve their
       full potential while contributing to the Air Force mission.
       1.4.2.4. Establish diversity training, mentoring, and professional development programs
       that provide the tools for personnel to navigate career progression. Mentoring is further
       addressed in AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program, (as yet unpublished).
       1.4.2.5. Be reported on and assessed for progression and effectiveness.
1.5. Prohibited Activities.
   1.5.1. Numerical Goals. No numerical goals may be set for the hiring or promotion of Air
   Force military or civilian personnel on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin,
   or age. Nor may race, color, sex, religion, national origin, or age be a basis for admission to
   any training or development program.
       1.5.1.1. The prohibition on consideration of sex does not apply to positions covered by
       10 United States Code (USC) 652, Notice to Congress of proposed changes in units,
       assignments, etc. to which female members may be assigned, and implementing
       Department of Defense memoranda, relating to women in combat positions.
       1.5.1.2. Numerical goals are permissible for veterans and other civilians with disabilities.
       1.5.1.3. Numerical goals are permissible for representation in a pool of applicants (i.e. it
       is permissible to set a goal of a 10% increase in applicants of a particular race, sex or
       ethnicity to certain job categories, but it is impermissible to set a goal of increasing the
       number of members of a particular race, sex, or ethnicity hired or promoted into those job
       categories).
   1.5.2. Limiting Diversity Initiatives to Race, Sex and National Origin or Substituting Special
   Emphasis Programs (SEPs) for Diversity Initiatives. SEPs may supplement diversity
   initiatives, but SEP programs are not sufficient to meet the diversity obligations set out by
   this Instruction. Diversity initiatives must encompass other attributes of the broad Air Force
   definition of diversity and not be limited to race, sex, and national origin-based programs.
1.6. Roles and Responsibilities. Implementation of the Air Force diversity policy is the
responsibility of every Air Force leader.

3.1. The Air Force promotes and supports both national and local outreach
events. Outreach includes intentional steps taken to expose people to Air Force civilian and
military career opportunities. It also enhances and broadens the Air Force recruitment and
applicant pool. Outreach opportunities include presentations and participation in meetings,
conferences and seminars with employee and employer groups, professional associations,
students, non-profit entities, community organizations, and other members of the general public
to provide general information about the Air Force, its mission, and employment opportunities.
Outreach assists in supporting the five Air Force Diversity Strategic Priorities: Institutionalize,
Attract, Recruit, Develop, and Retain.
3.2. National diversity outreach events are supported by AF/A1DV based on qualitative/
quantitative data from the National Diversity Outreach Event Return on Investment Report
(Attachment 3), and available National Outreach Trip Reports (Attachment 4). These reports
reflect potential Return on Investment (ROI) for the Air Force in terms of public relations value,
number of positive contacts and the extent to which the event expenditures are a responsible use
of Air Force funds. (Do not report SEP initiatives/events, see AFI (in coordination, as yet un-
numbered) Affirmative Employment Program (AEP), Special Emphasis Programs (SEPs) and
Reasonable Accommodation Policy. The primary considerations in making determinations to
support national outreach events are as follows:
   3.2.1. Significance and relevance of the event as defined by the Office of the Secretary of
   Defense, Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (OSD/ODMEO).
   3.2.2. The degree to which the Air Force’s absence from an event could significantly
   degrade future Air Force diversity outreach efforts as determined by AF/A1.
3.3. In support of national diversity outreach events AF/A1DV will:
   3.3.1. Coordinate with the Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs Engagement
   (SAF/PAY) on all national diversity outreach events.
