1. Scope. The following requirements apply throughout OC-ALC:
     1.1. Chemicals covered by OSHA’s expanded standards are found in a variety of materials
     encountered in Air Force operations. Examples include, but are not limited to, anticorrosive
     agents in surface coatings, paint stripping chemicals, soldering, electroplating processes,
     welding processes, welding flux material or filler metal and wood treated with preservative.
     This instruction is intended to provide guidance regarding control of occupational exposure
     to chemicals utilized in the OC-ALC covered by OSHA’s expanded standards. It is OC-ALC
     policy that potential exposure to chemicals addressed in the OSHA 1910.1000 series (i.e., 29
     CFR 1910.1001 through 1910.1052) of federal regulations, commonly referred to as the
     “OSHA Expanded Standards,” shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible through
     the application of the hierarchy of controls given in paragraphs 2.1.1. through 2.1.3. of this
     instruction. Note: All hard copies of instructions are considered uncontrolled copies, only
     the electronic version that resides on the AF e-publishing website will be considered
     controlled. In instances where a hard copy of an instruction is utilized, it is the user's
     responsibility to verify that the copy is the most current one available. This will be
     accomplished by comparing the date on the hard copy with the date of the electronic version.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Complex and Group-Level Commanders/Directors shall:
        2.1.1. Ensure that the Department of Defense (DoD) directive on chromium VI
        (hexavalent chromium, Cr6+) is implemented IAW AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life
        Cycle Management. Reference section 5.4.6.4. of the instruction.
        2.1.2. Ensure that product substitution and/or process modification that eliminates the
        generation of aerosol contamination are pursued as the primary means of controlling
        employee exposure. Aerosols include liquid droplets and solid particles.
        2.1.3. Ensure that when product substitution or process modification are not possible that
        the following hierarchy of control methods are implemented in the workplace: 1) 100%
        usage of applicable Engineering Controls for all processes (e.g., initial design; process
OC-ALCI48-140 2 APRIL 2014                                                                     3


     isolation; employee isolation; industrial ventilation systems with High Efficiency
     Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration on equipment such as downdraft tables and booths;
     shrouds for dust producing equipment, such as sanders, grinders, buffers, attached to a
     sealed (reference paragraph 2.1.3.3. of this instruction regarding “sealed”) HEPA filtered
     vacuum); 2) Work Practice Controls (e.g., perform task in a manner which maximizes the
     efficiency of ventilation equipment, such as positioning one’s body upstream from the
     point of operation; material handling such as transporting material in closed containers
     and keeping containers closed when not in use; establishing a regulated area; inspecting
     and maintaining process and control equipment on a regular basis; implementing
     effective housekeeping procedures); 3) Administrative Controls (e.g., personal hygiene;
     moving an employee to a place of lower exposure or reducing individual employee work
     hours on tasks if either is allowed by applicable OSHA standard) and; 4) Personal
     Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., respiratory protection, Tyvek coveralls, gloves).
        2.1.3.1. The shop specific Industrial Hygiene (IH) Survey Letter issued by the
        Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF) (72AMDS/SGPB) provides guidance
        and direction regarding controls and PPE.
        2.1.3.2. HEPA filters shall meet the established criteria of at least 99.97% filtration
        efficiency for particle sizes equal to or greater than 0.3µ (i.e., microns). The
        equivalent minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) is 17. Filtration media rated
        at less efficiency (i.e., less than 99.97%), particle capture size greater than 0.3µ or a
        MERV of less than 17, are not HEPA filters.
        2.1.3.3. All HEPA vacuums shall be sealed units so that air is passed through the
        HEPA filter prior to being exhausted.
     2.1.4. Ensure implementation of the guidance document Occupational Hygiene:
     Contamination Control and Housekeeping issued by the United States Air Force School
     of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) in the development of housekeeping plans. Contact
     BEF for guidance regarding implementation, or for a copy of the document.

 1) This verification checklist shall be used in conjunction with the shop’s housekeeping plan, developed by the shop supervisor and
 BEF, which provides specific information regarding what is to be cleaned, what techniques are to be used (e.g., HEPA, wet wipe, etc.)
 and the frequency for cleaning. THE CHECKLIST APPLIES TO A CALENDAR MONTH (e.g., May, June, July, etc.).
 2) Each person who performs cleaning tasks shall place their initials in block letters in the box which identifies the day, area and shift
 the task was performed.
 3) Supervisors or their designee (e.g., WL), shall inspect and verify, at the end of their shift, that all housekeeping tasks have been
 completed IAW the shop’s housekeeping plan. Verification is indicated by placing one’s initials in legible block letters in the verification
 column box which designates the correct day and shift.
 4) Each break room and locker room shall have their checklist posted in the room, along with a copy of the corresponding
 housekeeping plan. Supervisors shall maintain all checklists IAW OC-ALC 48-140, chapter 3, Housekeeping.
 5) NA or the words “not applicable” shall be used to indicate blocks or columns which do not apply (e.g., there is no graveyard shift,
 the frequency is weekly instead of daily).
 6) Supervisors shall fill in blank column headings with applicable name for shop areas to be cleaned by shop personnel (e.g.,
 Regulated Area, Doffing or Transition Area, Downdraft Table, Blasting Cabinets, Tool Crib, etc.).
 7) WIC/CF#: Shop I.D. number assigned by Bioenvironmental Engineering. It is shown in the SUBJECT line on the first page of
 Industrial Hygiene Survey Letters (e.g., 391A, 015I, 201F, 600C, etc.).
