     the 16 MUNS) during normal duty hours, or within the first 3 hours of the next duty day
     for RAM received after normal duty hours, of packages containing radioactive materials.
     IRSO can assist in checking for contamination.
     3.6.3. No packages containing radioactive materials will be released to the users until the
     IRSO accomplishes this survey (except DOE shipments to the 16 MUNS).
     3.6.4. No damaged container or containers with broken seals will be accepted from

     100 mrem in a year to any human being.
     3.6.7. Areas where radiation levels potentially exceed 2 mrem in any one hour will be
     restricted areas, and units will coordinate surveys to ensure the area’s perimeter doesn’t
     exceed 2 mrem in any one hour.

     3.7.1. The IRSO and Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) must issue thermoluminescent
     dosimeters (TLDs), in some cases electronic personnel dosimeters (EPDs), to unit RSOs
     and supervisors of personnel whose occupational exposure to ionizing radiation could
     exceed 10% of any of the annual limits found in AFI 48-148 or whose participation in the
     radiation dosimetry program has been mandated by the IRSO, 341 MW/CC, or higher
     authority.

      RSO).
      7.3.5. ALARA philosophy and practice.
   7.4. Documentation. Training documentation is maintained locally by the respective unit
   RSO and a copy is forwarded to Public Health for inclusion in Tab F of the facility case files.
   AF Information Management Tool (IMT) 2767, Occupational Health Training and
   Protective Equipment Fit Testing, can be used to document this training.
   7.5. Quality Control Program.
      7.5.1. The IRSO conducts quality assurance review of the radiation program to include:
          7.5.1.1. Quarterly review of personnel dosimetry (monthly for pregnant workers) to
          ensure overexposure, abnormal exposure, investigation, and pregnant female action
          levels have not been exceeded.
          7.5.1.2. IRSO investigated personnel dosimetry results above the specific IAL and
          reports the results of the investigation reported to the Aerospace Medicine Council.
          7.5.1.3. Personnel dosimetry results for declared pregnant workers are reviewed
          monthly and documentation maintained on all actions taken to ensure that the total
          dose to the fetus does not exceed 500 mrem during the term of pregnancy. Positive
          efforts should be made to limit the dose to ALARA but no more than an IAL of 10
          mrem per month.

        7.5.1.4. Yearly radiation protection program reviews are accomplished and
        documented. The results are presented to the AMC and ESOH Council. The reviews
        will include:
           7.5.1.4.1. A review of all personnel dosimetry results for the previous year to
           ensure adverse trends are noted and that all personnel dosimetry results which
           exceed action levels outlined in this instruction are acted upon.
           7.5.1.4.2. A review of all radiation protection survey results for the previous year
           to ensure all required surveys have been performed and documented properly and
           that corrective action, if necessary, has been accomplished.
           7.5.1.4.3. A review of the current inventory of known radiation producing
           devices and NRC regulated radioactive materials.

   CONTRACTOR USE OF RAM AND RADIATION PRODUCING DEVICES (RPD)

A3.1. Requirement to Use RAM or RPDs. Notify the contract monitor of your requirement to
use RAM or RPDs. Ensure you have appropriate licenses and certifications required to perform
radiation work. See explanation on Areas of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction inside this brochure.
Obtain written approval through the installation radiation safety officer (IRSO).
A3.2. Areas of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction. IAW federal law, contractors may only use
licensable quantities of RAM under two conditions: Possess NRC license, or NRC reciprocity
(for an Agreement State license) via NRC Form 241.
A3.3. Areas under Agreement State Authority. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
established licensing requirements for areas of “exclusive federal jurisdiction” and “agreement
states.”    These      can    be     reviewed      at    http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-
collections/nuregs/staff/sr1556/v19/#_1_25.
A3.4. What Contractors Need to Know!
   A3.4.1. Notify contracting officer or IRSO whenever the use of RAM or RPDs is
   anticipated.
   A3.4.2. Licensing/Permitting: For operations on areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction,
   contractor must hold a valid NRC license for RM or have a current NRC Form 241 reflecting
   reciprocity paid to NRC. For operations on areas of agreement state jurisdiction, must hold a
   valid state license for RAM for that state or have currently paid reciprocity to the state (in
   case of out-of-state license).
   A3.4.3. Nature of Operations: Provide information on location, description of use and
   duration. Specific information describing the type/isotope, qty/activity and intensity of
   radiation should be included. This enables AF to assess impacts to operations, personnel and
   facilities, and in the event of an accident enables emergency responders to safely conduct
   operations.
   A3.4.4. Contractor Health and Safety Plan: These procedures must be followed IAW the
   federal or state license/permit. Contractors are solely responsible for the safety and health of
   their employees.
   A3.4.5. Risks to AF Operations, Personnel, Facilities or Real Estate: Program managers and
   contractors have a responsibility to immediately contact the contracting officer and IRSO
   whenever their radioactive items/devices may impact AF operations, personnel, facilities or
   real estate. Once aware of the impacts, the IRSO is responsible for assessing these risks,
   ensuring compliance, and making appropriate notifications.
   A3.4.6. Spot Check/Audit, as required: Spot checks of contractor operations are necessary to
   enforce AF policy on management and control of RAM on AF installations.
A3.5. What Contract Monitors Need to Know!
   A3.5.1. If possible, prior to letting contract, review Purchase Request Package (SOO, SOW,
   PWS, etc.) and determine whether or not it requires contractors to use RAM or RPDs.
341MWI48-101 19 OCTOBER 2011                                                               23


  A3.5.2. Provide recommendation to the government contracting officer on whether or not
  the FAR clause should be included (FAR 52.223-7).
  A3.5.3. Include the topic of RAM and RPDs in program reviews, as applicable. Limit the
  use of RAM and RPDs where feasible, consistent with AF needs.
  A3.5.4. Notify the IRSO to obtain written approval prior to allowing any RAM or RPD on
  AFB.
  A3.5.5. Follow requirements of AFI 40-201, AACI                  48-103,   and   any   other
  restrictions/requirements established by the Installation RSO.
  A3.5.6. Notify the installation RSO of any accident, incidents, or unplanned/unapproved
  operations that occur related to RAM or RPDs.
