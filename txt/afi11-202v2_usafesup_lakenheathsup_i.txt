 3.2.2. OGV Functions.
 3.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) 11 OGV has no assigned OPR responsibilities for airspace and/or
 air-refueling tracks. USAFE-UK/A3 Chief of Weapons Ranges and Training is the OPR for
 reviews with the host nation of the suitability of existing airspace and tracks. USAFE-
 UK/A3 Chief of Weapons Ranges and Training will be the OPR for review and management
 procedures.
     3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
     of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
     Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
     3.2.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) Programs and procedures (critical, non-critical and OGV-
     exclusive) are listed in the Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe (HQ
     USAFE) Stan/Eval Inspection Checklists on the HQ USAFE Stan/Eval (HQ
     USAFE/A3TV) ICE page (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/
     default.aspx). The Chief of OGV manages the flight examiner upgrade program (see
     Chapter 4). To standardize documents and processes such as the designation letter, Letter
     of Certification (Letter of Xs), etc., 48 OG/OGV will maintain unit Stan/Eval information
     on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page.
     Reference AFI 10-3502 Volume 2 for PJ and CRO guidance.
     3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
     Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew

     (paper) tests will be maintained to prevent impact by PEX outage or transition (see
     Chapter 6).
        3.2.2.4.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Semi-annual aircrew examinations will be
        written by 48 OG/OGV (see paragraph 6.10).
        3.2.2.4.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) OGV will ensure that all Secure Question
        Banks (SQB) for periodic and requisite testing are current with existing Mission
        Design Series (MDS) Master Question Files (MQF) (see paragraph 6.4.2.1).
     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will review data at the end of each half of the
        calendar year. OGV will obtain trend information from flight evaluations,
        Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE) and requisite examinations using PEX or a
        hardcopy trend tracker as a backup (see paragraph 6.6.5.)
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
        3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
        3.2.2.5.4. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will analyze trend data, monitor CCV corrective
        actions, and if required, forward recommendations to the squadron commander
        (SQ/CC). Flight evaluation and EPE trend items will be emphasized during
        evaluations until trends are resolved (see paragraph 9.4.1 for supplementary
        evaluations of negative evaluation trends). Requisite examination trend questions
        will be included on subsequent examinations until the trend item is resolved. See
        paragraph 3.3.2.4 for trending unit periodic examinations. See paragraph 9.2 for
        guidance on emphasizing trends via flight related Special Interest Items (SII).
        3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
        Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
        the trend was identified.
        3.2.2.5.5. (USAFE) Trend guidance in the unit supplement will include minimum
        sample size and percentages that constitute a trend. Trend information will be
        archived for 2 years.

            3.2.2.5.5.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) F-15C and F-15E trends. If the total
            number of evaluations or examinations during the calendar half is nine or less,
            two discrepancies or commendable items in the same area will constitute a
            reportable trend. If the total number of evaluations and examinations is 10 or
            more, a rate of 20 percent discrepancies or commendable items in the same area
            will constitute a reportable trend. (See paragraph 3.2.2.5.2).
               3.2.2.5.5.1.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) HH-60 trends. Due to the small
               size of the 56 RQS, HH-60 flight examiners will determine on a case-by-case
               basis if discrepancies or commendable items observed during evaluations
               should be reported as trends to CCV and OGV. HH-60 flight examiners
               should use other tools available such as instructor meetings, testing, and items
               highlighted in post-flight recaps to determine trends. Additionally, when
               determining evaluation trends, HH-60 SEFEs may consult Air Combat
               Command (ACC) unit OGVs to assist in the assessment. For determining
               testing trends, only local information will be used. (See paragraph 3.2.2.5.2).
               3.2.2.5.5.1.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) PJ and CRO. Reference AFI 10-

   4.2.4. For AFRC and ANG units:
      4.2.4.1. The USAF advisor may be designated as a flight examiner.
      4.2.4.2. Air Technician (AT)/Air Reserve Technician (ART) /Active Guard and Reserve
      (AGR) serving in a military position that does not require maintaining mission
      ready/combat mission ready (MR/CMR) status may perform duties as flight examiners.
4.3. Flight Examiner Functions.
   4.3.1. Conduct aircrew evaluations IAW Chapter 5 and document IAW Chapter 7.
   4.3.2. Maintain qualification as instructors (N/A for senior flight examiners, see paragraph
   4.4.2).
   4.3.2. (USAFE) The intent of parent AFI guidance is that SEFEs maintain ―
                                                                           full‖ instructor
   qualification. See paragraph 5.2.4.2.3 (USAFE).
      4.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) CAF SEFE flying requirements. These requirements are
      for the purpose of SEFE “active” status only and do not supersede AFI 11-202 Vol 1
      and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1 flying requirements for MR aircrew in CMR/BMC billets.
          4.3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) To maintain an ―  active‖ status (i.e. able to evaluate AF
          Form 8/8a qualifying events), SEFEs will adhere to the following minimum flying
          requirements. See Figure 4.1 (Added) to aid in determining CMR SEFE ―        active‖
          status.
              4.3.2.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For the purpose of this guidance, the use of
              ―sortie‖ includes both flights and sims as allowed by the MDS RAP Tasking
              Memorandum (RTM).
              4.3.2.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) ―  In-active‖ status does not necessarily equate to
              being decertified as a SEFE. Decertification is an OG/CC (for OGV-designated
              evaluators) or SQ/CC (for SQ-designated evaluators) action (reference
              paragraph A11.4 (Added)).
          4.3.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) All SQ-designated SEFEs, must maintain CMR status.
          SQ/CC, SQ/DO and API-6/B flight examiners under the OG/CC’s command must, at
          a minimum, maintain BMC status. As used in this guidance, CMR/BMC ―     status‖ is
          based solely on sortie rate (ground training items tied to CMR/BMC status are not
          applicable).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                          29


         4.3.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) HHQ SEFEs and Senior Flight Examiners (see
         paragraph 4.4), to the maximum extent practical, will maintain BMC status based
         solely on sortie rate (lookback IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, commensurate with their
         API number [6/8/B/D]).
         4.3.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Waiver. The following guidance is based on the AFI
         11-2MDS Vol 1 understanding that the previous month’s sortie rate determines the
         current month’s CMR/BMC status.
            4.3.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC may waive the CMR-status
            requirement to BMC status, but for no more than two consecutive months. BMC
            ―probation‖ rules do not apply for BMC status waivers.
            4.3.2.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Insert a copy of approved waivers into the
            individual’s training folder (or equivalent training documentation). Summarize all
            approved waivers by recording in SEB minutes (see Attachment 2).

  4.3.3. Administer evaluations only within their weapon system/aircrew specialty and only
  evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
  EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
     4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
     are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
     authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
     4.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: A Senior Flight Examiner (designated IAW
     paragraph 4.4) may not evaluate an instructor if they themselves are not instructor
     qualified; however, USAFE/A3 may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis IAW
     paragraph 1.3
 4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
 requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
 MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
 their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
 their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
 4.3.4. (USAFE) See paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.11 (Added) for guidance on documenting
 approval for a cross-command evaluation on the examinee’s AF Form 8/8a. See also
 paragraph 7.7.6 for documentation on the AF Form 942.
 4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
 and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
 4.3.5. (LAKENHEATH) Flight examiners will reference the 48th Fighter Wing F-15C/E
 Flight Examiner Guide or the 48th Fighter Wing HH-60G Flight Examiner Guide for all
 evaluation briefs and debriefs (see paragraph 3.2.2.13.3).
 4.3.6. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an evaluation
 (applies to both the examinee as well as any accompanying aircrew).
  4.3.6. (USAFE) If current and qualified/certified in the crew position and/or event being
  executed SEFEs may assume the in-flight duties of the examinee. If applicable advise the
  crew and assume full responsibility for the examinee’s crew position for the rest of the
  mission.
  4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
  supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
  or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
 4.3.8. (Added-USAFE) Use a pyramid evaluation system IAW Table 4.1 (Added) When
 unable to comply with pyramid evaluation system, obtain a waiver from HQ USAFE/A3TV
 using the waiver template found on the USAFE/A3TV ICE. The best available evaluator will
 be used to conduct waived pyramid evaluations. Annotate waiver IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2
     4.3.8.1. (Added-USAFE) The pyramid evaluation system does not apply to evaluation
     requisites (i.e. any appropriately certified SEFE may administer an EPE).
     4.3.8.2. (Added-USAFE) No waiver is needed when there is no certified examiner
     above the examinee (to include none at HQ USAFE). In these cases, use the highest level
     evaluator available to conduct the evaluation.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                             31


      4.3.8.3. (Added-USAFE) For the following individuals, the pyramid evaluation system
      applies regardless of their SEFE status: SQ/CC, OGV Chief, OG/CC/CD, WG/CC/CV.

      4.4.1.1. NAF/CVs and OG/CDs may perform this function if the principal incumbent is
      not qualified or available.
      4.4.1.2. OG/CDs that fly different MDSs from the OG/CC in multi-MDS wings, or
      occupy a different crew position in the same MDS, may be designated as senior flight
      examiners at the OG/CC’s discretion.
      4.4.1.3. Document designations IAW paragraph 4.2.3.2.
   4.4.2. Individuals eligible for Senior flight examiner status do not require, nor do they have
   to maintain, instructor qualification, but they must have completed flight examiner
   certification IAW unit standards.

                                          Chapter 5

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
       5.2.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) (C/E) Pilots will receive a combined Instrument and
       Qualification (INSTM/QUAL) evaluation. Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs) will
       receive a combined MSN and Qualification (MSN/QUAL) evaluation.           Pilot
       INSTM/QUAL evaluations will normally be chased; however, the evaluation may be
       completed with the flight examiner pilot flying in the rear cockpit. (HH-60)
       INSTM/QUAL evaluations will be IAW AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 2, HH-60 - Aircrew
       Evaluation Criteria.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                              33


        5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
        aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
        INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
        5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
        under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
        requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
  5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.2.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) (F-15E) All aircrew will be evaluated at their highest
     qualification or certification (4-ship flight leads may be evaluated as number three of a 4-
     ship at SQ/CC discretion). Under exceptional circumstances with SQ/CC approval
     (verbal or otherwise), when sufficient assets are not available (air and space
     expeditionary force (AEF) deployments, etc.), 4-ship flight leads may plan and brief a
     minimum of 2v2 (Dissimilar) Air Combat Training (D)ACT, 2v2 Surface Attack Tactics
     (SAT), 2v1+1 Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM). (F-15C) MSN evaluations will be
     planned and briefed as (D)ACT at the highest examinee qualification. Instructor Pilot
     (IP) evaluations may also be flown in conjunction with Mission Qualification Training
     (MQT) syllabus sorties at the discretion of the SQ/CC. Under exceptional circumstances
     with SQ/CC approval (verbal or otherwise), when sufficient assets are not available (AEF
     deployments, etc.), 4-ship flight leads may plan and brief a minimum of 2v2 (D)ACT.
     However, examinees may fly 2v1 (Dissimilar) Air Combat Maneuvers (D)ACM as a fall-
     out option to evaluate engaged offensive maneuvering and weapons employment. (HH-
     60) MSN evaluations will normally be planned and briefed as night vision goggle (NVG)
     tactical (TAC) missions using unit formations and tactics to the highest examinee
     qualification/certification (i.e., 2-ship for flight lead certified pilots). A MSN Day TAC
     sortie evaluation can be accomplished at the discretion of the flight examiner with
     concurrence of the 56 RQS Commander if Night Tactical (NTAC) is not possible.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
34                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


        5.2.3.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) (F-15E) Periodic MSN evaluation scenarios will
        concentrate on unit primary Design Operational Capability (DOC) with Inertially
        Aided Munitions (IAM) or Paveway II or III employment. Scenario permitting,
        backup deliveries on the primary target and deliveries on a secondary target should
        utilize a targeting pod, at low altitude if necessary. If weather precludes the use of the
        targeting pod, examinees should be given an option to employ IAM through the
        weather. To the maximum extent possible, IAM targeting will be via a radar
        designated transfer or verified with the radar if employing Bomb-on-Coordinates
        (BOC). Opposed scenarios should be accomplished whenever available. When
        opportunities or situations arise, SQ/CCs have the authority to evaluate aircrew
        members on special weapons at their discretion.
        5.2.3.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Boom operators will designate cargo loading
        evaluations as ―MSN (CARGO).‖ Attempt to align cargo loading evaluation with the
        qualification/mission (QUAL/MSN) evaluation (i.e. accomplish within the same
        month). When alignment is not possible, document the evaluations on separate AF
        Forms 8 to avoid expiration date discrepancies.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
        5.2.4.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) IP Rear Cockpit (RCP) evaluations: Accomplished
        IAW AFI 11-2MDS-specific Volume 2, and may be aligned with the instrument
        qualification (INSTM/QUAL) evaluation zone.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                              35


        5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
        evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
        MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
        AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
        5.2.4.2.3. (USAFE) SEFE-certifed aircrew who expire on any periodic checkride
        will not be certified to perform SEFE duties until the expired evaluation is
        reaccomplished.
        5.2.4.2.4. (Added-USAFE) INIT and RQ INSTR evaluations may be conducted in
        conjunction with any periodic evaluation. For INIT INSTR evaluations, place
        emphasis on examinee demonstration of instructional ability. Incomplete INIT
        INSTR flight phase requirements do not preclude the update of the combined periodic
        evaluation if, 1) all flight-phase requirements are successfully completed, and 2) all
        ground phase requirements are completed within the periods described in paragraph
        5.5.3 Conversely, not completing all periodic flight phase requirements does not
        preclude the completion of the INIT/RQ INSTR evaluation if all INSTR items have
        been evaluated. See Chapter 7 for documentation guidance.
        5.2.4.2.4. (LAKENHEATH) (C/E/HH-60) Initial (INIT) and Requalification (RQ)
        Instructor (INSTR) evaluations may be flown in conjunction with MQT syllabus
        sorties at the discretion of the SQ/CC. IP and Instructor WSO (IWSO) evaluations
        may also be flown in conjunction with MQT syllabus sorties at the discretion of the
        SQ/CC.       (F-15E) Initial/Requalification Mission (INIT/RQ MSN) evaluation
        scenarios will concentrate on unit primary DOC with Paveway II or IAM medium-
        altitude employment. Scenario permitting, backup deliveries on the primary target
        and deliveries on a secondary target should utilize a targeting pod. If weather
        precludes the use of a targeting pod, examinees should be given an option to drop
        through the weather. To the maximum extent possible, IAM targeting will be via a
        radar designated transfer or verified with the radar if employing BOC. Opposed
        scenarios should be accomplished whenever available.
        5.2.4.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Unless otherwise stated in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 2, for
        multiple qualified aircrew members, one INIT INSTR evaluation is valid for all
        aircraft in which the aircrew member is qualified.
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
  5.2.5. (USAFE) 4 (Added) SEFE Objectivity Evaluations. See Attachment 8 (Added)
  for guidance, documentation, and grading criteria on SEFE Objectivity Evaluations.
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
        5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
        QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
        evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
        the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
36                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
            5.2.5.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) If not limited by paragraph 5.2.5.2.1.2, , the
            SEFE must advise the examinee of the option to use a SPOT evaluation to update
            his/her periodic evaluation zone prior to the beginning of the aircrew mission
            brief.
            5.2.5.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Examinees intending to use a SPOT evaluation to
            update their periodic evaluation zone must declare their intent prior to the
            beginning of the aircrew mission brief.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. (USAFE) EXAMPLE: AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
     Ground, Chapter 1, prescribes evaluation requirements for non-pilot aircrew authorized
     to conduct engine start, run-up, and test of engines. Unless incorporated as a periodic
     evaluation requisite in AFI 11-2MDSV2, a SPOT evaluation would be the appropriate
     type of evaluation for this requirement (documented IAW Chapter 7).
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
         The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
         those items for which the individual is non-current.
         5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
         IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
         5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
         paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
         Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
         5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                           37


            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) SQ/CCs and CCV will actively participate in
        identifying and scheduling eligible personnel for N/N evaluations. SQ/CCs (or their
        designated representative) will be notified before accomplishing an N/N evaluation.
        CCVs will provide SQ/CC and OGV a quarterly N/N report in addition to the N/N
        results and progress reports required for the SEB (see paragraph 3.3.1.5 and AFI 11-
        202 Volume 2 Attachment 2).
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. ―
                                                                                    Normal
        preparation‖ will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.2. (USAFE) ―  Normal preparation‖ will be defined as no sooner than 24
        hours prior to schedule takeoff and no later than aircrew brief time. MAF only: For
        N/N SPOT, notification may be at any time [paragraphs 5.2.5.2.1.3 (Added) and
        5.2.5.2.1.4 (Added) still apply]. In this case evaluators will coordinate with squadron
        supervision as to when notification will occur.
        5.2.6.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) Notification should be given no earlier than the
        afternoon prior for a morning brief, and the morning of for an afternoon brief, and no
        later than one hour prior to brief.
            5.2.6.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) N/N checkrides will not be given in the sixth
            month of the eligibility period. Waiver authority is the OG/CC.
            5.2.6.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC will determine quantifiable N/N
            program goals that will be included in the unit supplement along with guidance on
            program implementation. Distribute no-notice evaluations proportionately among
            aircraft (for multi-MDS wings), crew positions, and evaluation types. At unit
            discretion, N/N evaluations conducted by HQ USAFE SEFEs may count toward
            unit N/N program goals.
            5.2.6.3.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) (C/E/HH-60) The 48 OG/CC’s goal for the N/N
            evaluation program and night evaluations is 15 percent each of eligible N/N
            evaluations for the calendar year; distributed proportionally among aircrew
            position and mission types. Any aircrew can be no-noticed; however, primary
            candidates are aircrew who receive Qualification Level 2 (Q-2), Qualification
            Level 3 (Q-3), or multiple discrepancies on previous evaluations. Squadrons will
            make every effort to accomplish this goal, and OGV will assess the progress
            towards this goal at each SEB. As a minimum per 6-month reporting period, one
 38                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


             N/N evaluation (MSN or INSTM/QUAL) should be conducted per aircrew
             position. (HH-60) As a goal for each calendar year, at least two pilots and two
             enlisted aircrew members should receive an N/N evaluation in the 56 RQS due to
             the unit’s size.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
      5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
      either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
          5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
          the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
          discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
          proficiency.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                             39


         5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
         remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
             5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
             or flying.
             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ― required‖ in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as ―
                                                                            Commendable‖
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
         5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
         the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
 40                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


          5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
          assigned.
          5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
          5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
       performance or knowledge.
          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
          5.3.3.4.5. (Added-USAFE) A requisite (flight or ground) graded Q2, does not
          automatically drive the overall grade to a Q2 (see paragraph 5.3.3.4.1). Likewise,
          the flight-phase SEFE may assign a flight phase grade that is different from the
          overall qualification level. Reference paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.4 (USAFE) for
          documentation.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                           41


  expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
  coordinating the establishment of the following:
     5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
     required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
     and specific evaluation areas.
        5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
        affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
        limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
     5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
     evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
        5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
        publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
        5.4.1.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) In addition to publications listed in AFI 11-2F-15
        Volume 2, F-15 -- Aircrew Evaluation Criteria; AFI 11-2F-15EV2, F-15E -- Aircrew
        Evaluation Criteria; and AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 2, aircrew will carry the following
        publications on the aircraft as applicable for local area sorties:
            5.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) (HH-60) AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 3,
            HH-60--Operations Procedures. AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 3 CL-1, HH-60--
            Crew/Briefing Guide/Checklists, IAW AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 2.
            5.4.1.2.1.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Flight Information Handbook.
            5.4.1.2.1.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) RAF United Kingdom (UK)(L)2 and
            UK(L)5 en route low altitude chart.
            5.4.1.2.1.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Department of Defense (DoD) Europe,
            North Africa, Middle East (ENAME) En route Supplement.
            5.4.1.2.1.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) (C)(E) DoD ENAME High/Low Volume
            1 and Volume 3.
            5.4.1.2.1.6. (Added-LAKENHEATH) If applicable, Terminal Change Notice
            (TCN).
        5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
        properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
        members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
        required for the mission.
        5.4.1.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) To ensure currency, crewmembers will reference the
        sample publications checkers for TOs, publications, and the 48th Fighter Wing In-
        Flight Guide accessible on the 48 OG Stan/Eval CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval
        ICE page.
     5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)

 42                        AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


         5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
         and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
         outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
      5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
         5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
            5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
            Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
            5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
            5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
         5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
            5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
            and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
            systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
            5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
            evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
            simulator/ATD, or verbally.
            5.5.1.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) (C)(E) A simulator will be the primary means of
            evaluating EPEs. The examinee(s) will carry the required in-flight publications to the
            EPE. Flight examiners are encouraged to use the 48 FW EPE profile binder located
            in the F-15C and F-15E specific simulator bays. Terrain following procedures will be
            evaluated on all F-15E MSN EPEs. With SQ/CC approval, a WSO MSN EPE may
            be conducted with a pilot INSTM/QUAL EPE, but required events for both EPEs
            must be accomplished. (HH-60) EPEs will be administered IAW AFI 11-2HH-60,
            Volume 2. EPE profiles will be created by OGV or squadron CCV. OGV will
            approve profiles created by CCV to ensure all evaluation areas are covered.
                5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
                evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
                5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
                INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
                cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
                evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
                5.5.1.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) EPEs will consist of at least one boldface/CAPs (if
                applicable) and one non-boldface/CAPs EP per phase of flight (i.e., start/taxi,
                takeoff/departure, cruise/mission employment, and approach/landing) or as
                directed by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. If an aircraft does not have Boldface/CAPs,
                then only one EP per phase of flight is required.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            43


          5.5.1.2.2.3. (LAKENHEATH) (C)(E) A hardcopy of the EPE profiles will be
          maintained in OGV, CCV and 48 OSS Simulator (48 OSS/OSQ) (see paragraphs
          3.2.2.1 and 3.3.2.1). EPE profiles are accessible on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division
          CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page. The profiles are suggested and the
          flight examiner may adjust for current squadron emphasis items and/or trends.
          Detailed procedures for EPE profile management are documented in OGV’s
          continuity book for the EPE program.
          5.5.1.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) All EPEs will be of sufficient length to ensure
          adequate coverage of applicable material. Do not accomplish the EPE in-flight
          when the examinee is a required crewmember unless specifically allowed in AFI
          11-2MDS Vol 2.
          5.5.1.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Record EPE results, to include discrepancies, on a
          USAFE Form 135G, Emergency Procedures Grade Sheet, PEX EPE worksheet,
          or OGV-approved unit-produced worksheet. Keep a copy of the signed
          form/worksheet on file until a suitable temporary AF Form 8/8a (see paragraph
          7.3.8) is posted in the FEF.
       5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
       the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
       for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
       5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
       examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
       unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
       and 7.3.7.3.4.
       5.5.1.2.4. (LAKENHEATH) When additional training is required as a result of an
       evaluation, the flight examiner will debrief the SQ/CC or SQ/DO or designated
       representative and CCV Chief (see paragraphs 3.3.1.2 and 3.3.2.1). The debriefing
       will include the downgraded area(s), recommended training, due date, and any
       restrictions imposed. The debriefed SQ/CC or SQ/DO or designated representative
       and CCV Chief will ensure that the examinee is placed on supervised status as
       required. CCV or OGV will assign the individual’s supervised status in PEX and
       annotate on the Letter of Xs (see AFI 11-202 Volume 2 USAFE Supplement
       Attachment 11). CCV will monitor the status of additional training (see paragraph
       3.3.2.8). If an instructor or flight examiner is graded Q-2 on any evaluation, the flight
       examiner giving the grade will debrief the SQ/CC, SQ/DO or designated
       representative and CCV. CCV will coordinate with DOT and DOS to ensure the
       aircrew member shows No-Go (red) for the ability to perform instructor or flight
       examiner duties (see paragraphs 3.3.2.7 and 3.3.2.9). This restriction will be lifted
       after additional training or debriefing is completed as documented on the AF Form 8.
       5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
       situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
       circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
       accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
       flight examiner)
44                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
     5.5.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) Based on SEFE availability, SEFEs should issue the
     simulated Air Tasking Order (ATO) the day prior (reference the 48th Fighter Wing F-
     15C/E Flight Examiner Guide or the 48th Fighter Wing HH-60G Flight Examiner
     Guide). Operations security (OPSEC) permitting, OGV should brief at the SEB
     suggested MSN check profiles for the next six months based on real-world, current or
     potential conflict areas/threats (see paragraph 3.2.2.7).
     5.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) CAF only. Include unit procedures for the conduct of MSN
     evaluations in the unit supplement. As a minimum, procedures will include
     SEFE/examinee responsibilities and what profile information (e.g. ATO) the SEFE will
     furnish to the examinee.
     5.5.2.3. (LAKENHEATH) SEFEs should issue the simulated ATO or ATO equivalent
     information, which should normally include all information necessary to execute the
     tasked MSN, e.g., special instructions (SPINS), rules of engagement (ROE), combat
     identification (CID), etc. (see paragraph 5.5.2.2). The examinee should normally be
     responsible for planning the tasked mission and production of MSN materials e.g., line-
     up cards, comm. cards, etc., at the level appropriate to the examinee’s qualification, and
     as required by the MSN.
     5.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) If an event is required to be completed in-flight (i.e. not
     normally in a simulator/ATD) and the evaluation would be considered incomplete if the
     event were not accomplished on an additional flight, at SQ/CC discretion a suitable
     sim/ATD may be used to fulfill the requirement (unless specifically prohibited by AFI
     11-2MDS Vol 2). Ensure documentation is IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.2.2.4 (USAFE) and
     7.3.7.3.5.5.
     5.5.2.5. (Added-LAKENHEATH) For scheduled evaluations, aircrew notification
     should be a minimum of 24 hours in advance and examinees will contact the scheduled
     SEFE on the duty day prior to the flight evaluation.
  5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
     5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
     current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
     case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                              45


       5.5.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) CCV will notify OGV and applicable SQ/CC when an
       individual is in their sixth month of the eligibility period with incomplete requisites and
       include the status of the flight eval. Notification should normally be accomplished via e-
       mail. Copies of notifications should be maintained (hardcopy or electronic) in the
       continuity book until the requisites are completed (see paragraphs 3.3.2.1 and 5.8).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.4. (USAFE) If an examinee performs to Q- criteria for each area previously
       graded U, but additional training is still required, an additional recheck must be
       accomplished after completion of the assigned additional training. In this case, the time
       limit to complete the recheck is still based on paragraph 5.6.1 and an additional recheck
       AF Form 8/8a will be completed.
46                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


     5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
     recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
     evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
     5.6.1.7. (Added-USAFE) At OG/CC discretion, a flight recheck may be combined with
     other periodic evaluations to facilitate completion of evaluations that are normally
     combined based on the MDS/crew position.
         5.6.1.7.1. (Added-USAFE) The non-recheck portion of the combined evaluation
         (along with any associated requisites) must be completed within the zones described
         in paragraphs 5.5.3 and 5.8 The recheck portion (and any associated requisites)
         must be completed within the time period described above.
         5.6.1.7.2. (Added-USAFE) See Chapter 7 for AF Form 8/8a documentation with
         special emphasis on paragraphs 7.3.4.4.4.1 (Added) and 7.3.9
         5.6.1.7.3. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: If the INSTM and QUAL evaluations are
         normally combined, but the examinee earns a Q3 due to a U on a QUAL event prior
         to completion of the evaluation, the OG/CC may approve the examinee to fly a
         combined RQ QUAL (to satisfy recheck requirements IAW guidance above) and
         INSTM evaluation.
 5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
 evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
 mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
 For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
 the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            47


          5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
          being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
          area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
      5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
      completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
      5.6.3.2. (USAFE) Restrict instructors graded Q2 on any evaluation (to include EPEs)
      from performing instructor duties on downgraded areas until additional
      training/debriefing is complete. Likewise, SEFEs receiving a Q2 on any evaluation will
      be restricted from giving evaluations (to include EPEs) until additional training is
      completed.
      5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
      restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
      limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
      certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
      not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
      specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
      5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
   5.7.3. (Added-USAFE) See paragraph 7.3.7.1.2 for documentation of ―
                                                                     designated
   supervisor‖ on the AF Form 8/8a.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.2. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 5.5.3.1 for tracking procedures.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.

        5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
        or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
        subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
        5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s        may    extend
        evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
        IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
        supplements to this instruction.
        5.8.3.2.2. (USAFE) Units will forward extension requests not otherwise approved
        by the SQ/CC using the ―  USAFE Evaluation Extension Request‖ template located
        on the USAFE/A3TV ICE (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/
        default.aspx) under the ―
                                Waivers‖ folder.
           5.8.3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Coordination will originate with the CCV that
           manages the individual’s FEF then proceed as follows: SQ/CC → OGV →
           OG/CC → WG/CC → USAFE/A3T → USAFE/A3 (for final approval).
           5.8.3.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) To the maximum extent practical, units will
           coordinate requests so as to arrive at HQ USAFE at least one month prior to the
           original zone expiring. Incorporate documentation of approved extensions into the
           examinee’s FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2
        5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
        of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
        IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
        paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
        longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
        see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
        period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
           5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
           5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
           5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
           5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
           5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
           than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
           before or during deployment.
     5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
        5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
        authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
        5.8.3.3.1. (USAFE) The intent of the non-standard approval guidance in paragraph
        5.8.3.3.1 is for approvals of the zone extension circumstances in paragraph 5.8.3.2.3
        for senior leadership (SQ/CCs and above).
           5.8.3.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For all API-8 O-6s and above (e.g. USAFE/IG, 3

           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.8.4.2. (USAFE) The OG/CC waiver will explain the circumstances causing the
       delinquent evaluation and the specific requisites being waived. Furnish a copy to HQ
       USAFE/A3TV.
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
 50                       AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
      5.9.5. (Added-USAFE) See Attachment 11 (Added) for Commander-Directed
      decertification (e.g. downgrades on non-AF Form 8/8a qualifying events, non-punitive
      removal of certifications due to manning, etc.),
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (USAFE) Squadrons will use a Letter of Xs (see Attachment 11 (Added)) in lieu of
   the AF Form 4348 unless the AF Form 4348 is specifically directed by the applicable AFI
   11-2MDSV2.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                             51


5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.1. (USAFE) USAFE AECMs are universally qualified IAW AFI 11-2AEV1, Chapter
   2.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
52                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


  5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
  and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
  5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
  Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
  5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
  5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
  capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
  similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
  MDS Vol 2/MOU.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                               53


                                           Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (USAFE) In addition to guidance on the overall execution of the unit Aircrew Exam
   program, describe how PEX will be used for the aircrew exam program at all Stan/Eval
   functional levels.
   6.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) As a minimum, OGV will use the following functions of PEX for
   the aircrew examination program: practice exams, proctor exams, Question Data Bank
   (QDB) management, exam management, trending of tests and production of reports for the
   SEB. Reference the 46 TW/XPI (PEX) PEX user manual for the current software suite and
   on line instruction (see paragraph 3.2.2.14).
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.2. (USAFE) PEX will be the primary means to administer requisite open/close book,
   instrument, and semi-annual testing. Hard copy testing is permissible, but units shall strive to
   incorporate PEX as much as possible.
       6.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Units may use a locally-derived aircrew testing system once
       certified and approved by USAFE/A3TV and its implementation described in the unit
       supplement. Units desiring certification will allow USAFE/A3TV to verify that the
       desired system complies with the intent of this volume. Certification/approval
       documentation will be included in SEB minutes (see Attachment 2).
       6.3.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) The 48 OG uses PEX with hard copy (paper) testing as a
       backup.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
 54                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   6.3.3. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will enter graded exam answer sheets from hard copy
   testing into PEX as off-line exams. Additionally, the records will be kept on file for 6
   months or until trended for the SEB whichever occurs first.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
   6.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) References and subjects are selected in PEX in the testing admin
   section. A list of current sources (references) is filed in the continuity book for the aircrew
   examination program (see paragraph 6.4.4).
      6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
      be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
      references for open book examinations.
          6.4.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Units may provide aircrew access to a completely
          electronic library in lieu of a hardcopy library for the purposes of Open Book testing.
              6.4.1.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If used, an electronic library will be accessible in a
              suitable testing environment (see paragraph 3.2.1.4) and will include all relevant
              publications in one electronic location (i.e. aircrew should not have to search
              around the internet for the individual publications).
              6.4.1.1.1.1. (LAKENHEATH) The electronic library is accessible on the 48 OG
              Stan/Eval ICE page (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/48OG/OGV/default.aspx).
              Access to digital TO files will be limited to comply with TO 00-5-1-WA-1 and
              IAW AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use; and AFI 61-204,
              Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information.
              6.4.1.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The electronic library will ensure aircrew are
              accessing the document as it was released from the release/publishing authority
              (i.e. scanned copies of hardcopy source documents are not allowed).
      6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
      the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
      safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
      6.4.1.2. (USAFE) OGVs will develop an SQB for each crew position of each unit MDS.
      SQBs may be combined if different crew positions are responsible for the same
      information (e.g. F-15E pilots and WSOs).
          6.4.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Do not select open book questions from any closed-
          book MQF (MDS or local).
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
      6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
      specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
      aircrew.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                          55


     6.4.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) MDS-specific and local MQFs are accessible on the 48 OG
     Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page. OGV will ensure that
     digital MQFs are concurrent IAW paragraph 6.4.4 (see paragraphs 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.4.2).
         6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
         administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
         procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
         6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
         necessary.
         6.4.2.1.2. (USAFE) Forward MQF edits and suggestions for MQF changes using the
         AF Form 847 IAW local procedures to the ―
                                                 USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖ org account.
         USAFE/A3TV will review the changes and forward to the appropriate lead
         MAJCOM Stan/Eval function.
     6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
     MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
     6.4.2.2. (USAFE) Units will develop a local procedures MQF derived from relevant
     USAFESUP guidance, local supplements, and local operating guidance.
     6.4.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) The local MDS-specific MQFs are accessible on the 48 OG
     Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (see paragraph 3.2.2.1).
         6.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Closed book exams will include questions from the
         local MQF.
  6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
  Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
  procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
  test.
  6.4.3. (USAFE) Unit supplements will include guidance on how the unit plans to manage
  instrument exam creation and quality control.
  6.4.3. (LAKENHEATH) The requisite Instrument open book exam will be created by
  OGV in coordination with the 48 OSS contract simulator Instrument Refresher Program
  (IRP) instructors (48 OSS/OSQB). OGV will administer these exams (review annually and
  import the created exam into PEX, maintain two hardcopy (paper) exams and assign the
  exam in PEX). The instrument examination can be administered at the completion of the
  Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) in OGV or as a discrete event as required by evaluation
  requisites. Detailed procedures for test scheduling are documented in OGV’s continuity
  book for the aircrew examination program (see paragraph 6.6.5).
  6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
  review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
  and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
  source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
  procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
 56                        AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   6.4.4. (USAFE) Exam Question Review. Units have 60 days after any changes in source
   guidance to complete reviews of affected exams. If no changes in source guidance have
   occurred throughout the year (thus constituting an exam review), units will plan on
   completing and documenting their annual reviews before holding the first semi-annual SEB
   (reference paragraph 3.2.2.7.1 (Added)).
   6.4.4. (LAKENHEATH) PEX lists only the last update/review of an exam. OGV will use
   an Exam Review Tracker to track all reviews resulting from changes to each source
   (references). Examples of changes are: publication and TO revisions and changes, waivers
   to publications, interim/administrative changes to publications, TO revisions and changes,
   TO supplements, and FCIFs. Detailed procedures for examination management are
   documented in OGV’s continuity book for the aircrew examination program.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
         6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
         crew position.
         6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
         6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
         not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
         6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
         calendar year.
      6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
         6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
         6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
         required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
         questions in the exam database).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                          57


   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
   6.6.4. (Added-USAFE) Open and closed book exams will consist of a minimum of 25
   questions.
   6.6.5. (Added-USAFE) The unit supplement will be clear about which type of exam
   management is being used (prepared v. randomly generated). Even if PEX is used to
   administer the exam, the exam may actually be a ―   prepared exam‖ if PEX is not randomly
   generating the test from an exam database IAW paragraph 6.6.2.2 Whichever method is
   used, units will make every effort to capture legitimate trend information that is both
   meaningful and relevant to the unit’s mission and the commander’s overall unit vision.
   6.6.5. (LAKENHEATH) Requisite exams will be created and administered by OGV on-
   line in PEX or off-line via paper copy. Open and closed book exams administered in PEX
   will be randomly generated via the ―  template‖ function while the instrument test will be
   MDS specific. Hardcopy exams will be prepared tests generated in PEX via the ―       save‖
   function. OGV will maintain two hardcopy (paper) exams concurrent with the electronic
   version in PEX. Hardcopy tests will be entered into PEX at the earliest opportunity. OGV
   should notify the applicable CCV when hardcopy examinations are administered during a
   PEX outage. Minimum information required is the examinee’s name, exam type, date
   completed and score.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.7. (LAKENHEATH) Reference AFI 11-202 Volume 2, paragraph 6.4.2., Stan/Eval test
banks, including local MQFs, SQBs and periodic question banks, will be maintained by OGV in
PEX. Hardcopy testing materials will be secured in a locking container. Requisite testing will
normally be accomplished in the OGV testing room (CCV, if deployed). Closed book
examinations will be completed in one sitting. Open book examinations may be started and then
finished at a later date.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.1. (USAFE) Boldface/CAPs. Boldface/CAPs will be written from memory.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
 58                         AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   6.9.1. (USAFE) Reexamination Policy. An ―        adequate study period‖ will be defined in the
   unit supplement, but may be no less than 12 hours from the conclusion of the fail exam or the
   beginning of the next duty day, whichever occurs first. OG/CC is waiver authority for
   retesting with less than an "adequate study period."
   6.9.1. (LAKENHEATH) Aircrew members failing a requisite exam will not retest any
   earlier than the following duty day.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
      6.9.3. (USAFE) Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew failing a
      Boldface/CAPS requisite exam will retest no earlier than the beginning of the next duty day.
      OG/CC is waiver authority for same-day retesting.
      6.9.4. Supervised Status.
         6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
         exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
         6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
         resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
         aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
         results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
         instrument qualification is required.
   6.9.5. (Added-USAFE) Include procedures for tracking failed examination dates and how
   leadership will be informed in unit supplements.
   6.9.5. (LAKENHEATH) Failed examination and successful re-examination will be tracked
   in PEX. Failed hardcopy exams and successful re-examination using a hardcopy exam will
   be entered into PEX at the earliest opportunity (see paragraph 6.6.5). OGV will notify the
   examinee’s SQ/CC (or SQ/DO) immediately of failed exams via a Memorandum For Record
   (MFR) or e-mail to back up supervised status tracked in PEX. OGV will file the MFR/copy
   of e-mail notification in the continuity binder for the aircrew examination program. OGV
   will destroy the MFR when the examinee has successfully completed the reexamination and
   supervised status will be removed in PEX.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                           59


  6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
  6.10.2. (LAKENHEATH) Semi-annual aircrew examinations are Go/No-Go items (see
  paragraphs 3.2.2.4.1. and 9.3.1.3).
  6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
  the requirement for a periodic exam.
  6.10.4. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, OGVs or CCVs will conduct semi-annual testing
  for all flight crewmembers. Timing of the semi-annual test is at unit discretion and will be
  defined in the unit supplement.
  6.10.4. (LAKENHEATH) CCVs will normally administer OGV-produced MDS-specific
  closed book semi-annual examinations to assigned and attached flight crewmembers. Tests
  will be administered in December and June. The prepared hardcopy (paper) tests will be
  administered and entered into PEX (the same day, before next flight or before the end of the
  semi-annual period) (see paragraph 9.3.1.3). CCVs should notify OGV of any personnel
  who are not available to test (Temporary Duty (TDY), leave, and attached aircrew who are
  not located at RAF Lakenheath and are returning to fly after a periodic window, etc.). In
  such cases, separate prepared periodic tests will be generated by OGV to ensure test security
  and will be administered by CCV or OGV on return to base (RTB) (before first flight).
     6.10.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Semi-annual tests will be a minimum of 20 questions and at
     least 25 percent of the questions must come from sources other than MDS and local
     MQFs or SQBs (e.g. FCIFs).
     6.10.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) The test will comprise 25 questions. Non-MQF/SQB
     sources can include questions from recent publication changes, recent supplementary
     evaluation topics, trends, FCIFs and SIIs. Completed semi-annual test answer sheets will
     be destroyed after the test has been entered into PEX. CCVs will notify OGV of any
     trends. Trends will be calculated IAW paragraphs 3.2.2.5.5.1 and 3.2.2.5.1.2.
     6.10.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Units may use aircrew testing accomplished during
     USAFE/A3TV ASEVs as the semi-annual test, but must communicate this desire to the
     administering A3TV inspector prior to the commencement of testing (aircrew testing
     during USAFE/A3TV ASEVs shall not be used to meet requisite examination
     requirements).
     6.10.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Flight surgeons and non-CEA aircrew (e.g. CRO/PJ) are
     exempted from semi-annual testing, but may test at OG/CC’s discretion. This exemption
     does not apply to AE personnel.
     6.10.4.3. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 8.2 for the flight surgeons’ required testing.
  6.10.5. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, all applicable aircrew will successfully complete a
  Boldface/CAPs written exam every prior to the first flight of each calendar month.
     6.10.5.1. (Added-USAFE) A Boldface/CAPs written exam will be accomplished in
     each MDS for which the aircrew is qualified.
     6.10.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Boldface/CAPs exam will be written from memory.
     Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
60                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


     6.10.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Boldface/CAPs exams will be graded by the squadron
     operations supervisor or designated representative (Fighter); Aircraft Commander (AC)
     or any available instructor (MAF and HH-60s) IAW paragraph 6.8.1. Failure of this
     written exam grounds the individual until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
     6.10.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Outline unit execution in the unit supplement under Go/No-
     Go Procedures (paragraph 9.3.3 (Added)). Unit supplements will clearly define failure
     procedures (grounding, amount of time until retesting, level of supervision required for
     retest) regarding monthly Boldface/CAPS requirements.
     6.10.5.4. (LAKENHEATH) The guidance for failed requisite exams applies (see
     paragraph 6.9.5). Squadrons will ensure failed exams are corrected to 100 percent
     (examinee is debriefed on any incorrect answers). The examinee can re-test as early as
     the following day and NLT the last working day of the calendar month following
     administration of the exam.

                                           Chapter 7

                                    DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.1. (LAKENHEATH) After the evaluation is complete (including requisites), the AF
   Form 8 will be generated.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
   7.1.2. (USAFE) Digital (i.e. use of a CAC signature) and electronic (i.e. //SIGNED//)
   signatures are authorized on all AF Forms 8/8a and FEF documentation generated by USAFE
   units. A combination of signature formats (including those on the same document) are
   allowed.
       7.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) When electronically signing a document, USAFE units will
       use the following standard (IAW AFI 33-119 and AFI 33-321): //SIGNED/initials//. The
       date will be included in the appropriate ―
                                                date‖ block of the respective form
       7.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The stan/eval function responsible for routing the AF Form
       8/8a for signature will QC the form upon receipt after a signature is added prior to
       sending it out for further signatures. The intent is to mitigate unknown content changes
       from occurring while the document is being routed.
       7.1.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) Accomplish quality control reviews using the AF Form 8 or
       AF Form 1381 checkers. Reference guidance in the AF Form 8 guide for routing forms
       (see paragraph 3.2.2.2).
       7.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) To the max extent possible, AF Forms 8/8a will be sent via
       encrypted email to personal NIPR accounts (i.e. no org accounts or civilian addresses--
       Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) with the appropriate ― Official Use Only‖ (FOUO) paragraph
                                                  For
       (see example below) included on the email.
          7.1.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE: ―          CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This
          document, including all attachments, may contain information that is For Official
          Use only (FOUO). Information may be FOUO because it includes information
          protected by the Privacy Act. If any information in this e-mail falls under the Privacy

          Act of 1974, you must safeguard the information and, if applicable, all attachments.
          Disclosure of information is IAW DOD 5400.11R.‖
       7.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Other than through PEX, USAFE units will not use wholly
       electronic FEFs unless the desired system is certified and approved by USAFE/A3TV.
       Units desiring certification will allow A3TV to verify that the desired system complies
       with the intent of this volume. See paragraph 7.8.2 for more information on electronic
       FEFs.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (USAFE)Qualifications versus Certifications. Squadrons will use a Letter of Xs [see
Attachment 11 (Added)] in lieu of the AF Form 4348 unless the AF Form 4348 is specifically
directed by the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
       7.3.1.3. (USAFE) EXCEPTION: Commander-directed downgrade AF Form 8 is
       completed by the Commander directing the downgrade and the individual being
       downgraded. See paragraph 7.4
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
       7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
       (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
       7.3.2.3. The ― Eligibility Period‖ and ―
                                              Expiration Date of Qualification‖ blocks will use a
       three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
       7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
       ―INSTR‖), use upper and lower case letters.
       7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
       data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
       desired.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                              63


     7.3.2.6. (Added-USAFE) PEX will be used as the primary system for AF Form 8/8a
     and AF Form 942 data entry. As needed, once PEX data are input the appropriate
     Stan/Eval function completing the form may finalize the form outside of PEX.
     7.3.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Unit supplements will provide guidance on PEX usage
     regarding evaluation data entry (e.g. direct PEX entry by SEFEs, worksheet use by
     SEFEs that is then input into PEX by SELOs, etc.).
     7.3.2.7. (LAKENHEATH) SEFEs will primarily use the PEX-generated evaluation
     worksheet for data entry by CCV personnel. SEFEs and CCVs will reference the 48 FW
     AF Form 8 Guide and documentation guidance in paragraph section 7.3.8 when
     documenting evaluations. CCV will reference the PEX user manual for the current
     software suite and on line instruction when inputting data into PEX from: AF Form 8/8a
     and AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, prescribed by AFI 11-202 Volume 2.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).
     7.3.4.2. Organization and Location.
         7.3.4.2.1. Enter the unit designation and location where the examinee is
         assigned/attached for flying (actual unit/office symbol will be annotated IAW
         paragraph 7.3.6.4).
         7.3.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
64                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last
         similar periodic aircrew qualification evaluation (e.g., if the last MSN evaluation
         expires Sep 12, enter Apr-Sep 12).
         7.3.4.4.2. Enter N/A (not applicable) for INIT, SPOT, RQ, and out-of-the-eligibility
         period evaluations (see paragraph 5.8.3.2).
         7.3.4.4.2. (USAFE) Since a flight recheck following a failed evaluation is by
         definition an ―
                       RQ‖ evaluation, ―
                                       N/A‖ will be entered on flight recheck AF Forms
         8/8a.
            7.3.4.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If, at the discretion of the OG/CC, a flight recheck
            is combined with other periodic evaluations (i.e. RQ QUAL combined with an
            INSTM), document IAW paragraph 7.3.4.4.4
         7.3.4.4.3. For periodic evaluations where the evaluation expiration date of the
         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.3. (USAFE) The intent of paragraph 7.4.4.3 guidance is that any extension
         approval (SQ/CC, USAFE/A3, etc.) only extends the expiration date, not the
         eligibility period.
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         ―INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13‖ for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).
         7.3.4.4.4. (USAFE) This is true for INIT/RQ INSTR evaluations that are combined
         with MSN evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.4.2.4 (Added) (i.e., for an INIT
         INSTR/MSN, enter ― INSTR: N/A‖ then on the next line, ―
                                                               MSN: Aug 12-Jan 13‖).
            7.3.4.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Flight rechecks due to failed evaluations combined
            with other, non-recheck periodic evaluations will be documented with the RQ
            portion as ― N/A‖. EXAMPLE: An RQ QUAL (due to a recheck from a failed
            evaluation) combined with an INSTM would be documented ―    QUAL: N/A‖ then
            on the next line, ―
                              INSTM Aug 12-Jan 13‖.
  7.3.5. - Qualification.
     7.3.5.1. Ground Phase.
         7.3.5.1.1. Examination/Check.
            7.3.5.1.1.1. Make a separate entry for each ground requisite exam/evaluation.
            Discrepancies will be noted in the examiner’s remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3.3).
            7.3.5.1.1.2. If requisites exceed available lines, make combined entries or
            document additional requisite completion in the Comments section.
            7.3.5.1.1.3. Annotate an EPE as 1, 2, or 3 regardless of whether all or a portion of
            the EPE was performed inflight.
                7.3.5.1.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Document any N/N EPE (see paragraph
                5.2.6.3) as ―N EPE‖.

            11-2MDS Vol 2.
            7.3.5.1.1.6. (Form 8a) Make a separate entry for each ground requisite
            exam/evaluation by MDS IAW published guidance.
            7.3.5.1.1.7. (Form 8a) For a combined ground requisite that includes all
            applicable aircraft under Universal Qualification guidelines (example: one
            closed/open book examination which contains questions for more than one
            aircraft or one EPE which evaluates more than one aircraft) make a single line
            entry for each requisite (i.e. Open Book, Closed Book, EPE etc.).
        7.3.5.1.2. Date. In the date column, enter the date that the requisite is successfully
        completed. Enter the recheck (EPE)/reexam (test/Boldface/CAPs) date if a

            grades when on the same line by enclosing them in parentheses as follows: 84/98
            (U/Q).
            7.3.5.1.3.4. Enter failed EPE grades with a successful recheck as follows: 3/1.
     7.3.5.2. Flight Phase.
        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.1. (USAFE) Evaluations may be listed in any order as long as prefixes
            (if used) are in front of the evaluation they are describing.

        7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
        evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
        describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
            7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
            INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
            7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
            8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
            (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
            7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
            instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
        7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
        complete the evaluation.
        7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
        flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
        on separate days.
        7.3.5.2.2.4. (USAFE) If executing IAW paragraph 5.5.2.4 (Added) a second
        sortie entry is required. In this case, the second sortie entry will be entered with a
        SIM prefix (see paragraph 5.2.6.4). See also paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.5.
        7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
        flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
        may be used.
        7.3.5.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Multiple single-line entries for multiple flight
        evaluations accomplished in the same calendar month may be used if directed by
        the unit supplement.
            7.3.5.2.2.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Use a separate AF Form 8/8a for flight
            evaluations accomplished in different months even if a combined EPE was
            accomplished IAW paragraph 5.5.1.2.2.2.
            7.3.5.2.2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) EXAMPLE (If option is directed by the
            unit supplement): A KC-135 INSTM/QUAL evaluation is conducted on 15
            Sep with a MSN evaluation on 22 Sep, and a combined INSTM/QUAL/MSN
            EPE on 25 Sep. On one AF Form 8, document the EPE IAW paragraph
            7.3.5.1.1.3., but document the flight evaluations on separate lines.
     7.3.5.2.3. Date.
        7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
        7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
        over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
        flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
        7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
        spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
        completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.

     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a ― (for Q1) or ― (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
                                      1‖              2‖
        ― (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
         3‖
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., ― INSTM: 1‖ and
            ―QUAL: 2‖ in the qualified block or ―   INSTM/MSN: 1‖ in the qualified block and
            ―QUAL: 3‖ in the unqualified block).
            7.3.5.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Reference paragraph 7.3.9 for documentation of
            flight and ground rechecks.
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable
        flight phase.
        7.3.5.3.4. (Form 8a) This section does not apply to Universal Qualified aircrew
        members or to crewmembers that do not require a flight phase evaluation (see
        Chapter 8).
     7.3.5.4. Expiration Date of Qualification.
        7.3.5.4.1. IAW paragraph 5.8.1. for evaluations that establish a new eligibility
        period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which the flight
        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter ―
                                                                                         N/A.‖
        7.3.5.4.2. (USAFE) This is true for INIT/RQ INSTR evaluations that are combined
        with MSN evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.4.2.4 (Added) (i.e., for an INIT
        INSTR/MSN, enter ― INSTR: N/A‖ then next line, ―
                                                       MSN: Aug 12‖).
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or ―N/A‖ if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            ―N/A‖ for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter ― QUAL-Jul 12‖ under Qualified and ―  INSTM-N/A‖ under
            Unqualified).
        7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that
        establish a new eligibility period enter the month and year that is 17 months after the
        month in which the latest ground requisite was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.5. (Form 8a) For evaluations with a flight phase that establish a new
        eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
        the flight phase evaluation was successfully completed.

        7.3.6.1. Flight Examiner.
            7.3.6.1.1. (Form 8a) With only ground phase requisites required, any unit
            designated flight examiner can sign the AF Form 8a.
            7.3.6.1.2. The flight examiner signing Section III of the AF Form 8:
            7.3.6.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) CCV will generate the AF Form 8 and have OGV
            review it prior to getting signatures. The OGV reviewer will initial the AF Form 8 in
            the Additional Reviews in Section IV verifying it has been reviewed. OGV personnel
            will visit each CCV on a regular basis to review AF Forms 8.
               7.3.6.1.2.1. Is responsible for the content of the AF Form 8/8a, and will not sign
               Section III until verifying all required items (IAW this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS
               Vol 2) are documented.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            69


           7.3.6.1.2.2. Will always place an ― in the remarks block and make comments
                                             X‖
           in the comments block
               7.3.6.1.2.2.1. (Form 8a) This applies only when a flight phase is required; if
               only a ground phase is required, do not place an "X" in the remarks block and
               no Examiner Remarks are required in the Comments block in Section IV.
        7.3.6.1.3. If two or more flights are required to complete an evaluation, only the
        flight examiner completing the evaluation will sign Section III, any other evaluator(s)
        will enter remarks in the Mission Description block describing those parts of the
        flight evaluation they evaluated and sign a signature block immediately adjacent to
        their remarks (see examples in Attachment 3).
        7.3.6.1.3. (USAFE) The signature block may be electronically signed and will be
        written as follows:
     7.3.6.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers.
        7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a) A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
        only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
        7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
        positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
        necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
        and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
        adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an ― inX‖
        the ―Concur‖ block.
        7.3.6.2.2. (USAFE) The intent of ―     acting in their stead‖ applies to acting
        CCs/CVs/DOs if the reviewing and/or approving officer is unavailable to sign within
        the time period described in paragraph 7.3.8.5.
           7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
           8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
           ― in the ― Not Concur‖ block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
            X‖          Do
           7.3.6.2.2.2. If ― Not Concur‖ is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
                            Do
           provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
           additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
           7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
           7.3.6.2.2.2. (USAFE) Non-concur comments may direct additional restrictions,
           but will not add downgrades. See paragraph 7.3.6.2.5
        7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
        examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
        7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
        Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
        Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
        5.9 if further action is warranted.
        7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course

         evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
         Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
         7.3.6.2.5. (USAFE) Table 7 1. (Added) lists reviewing and final approval
         authorities for AF Forms 8/8a. In the organization block, list both the organization
         and the office symbol.
             7.3.6.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) In no case will the SEFE also sign as the
             reviewing/approving officer for an evaluation he/she administered. If the SEFE
             would normally be the reviewing or approving officer and an exception is not
             noted in Table 7.1 (Added), the SEFE’s deputy/vice commander (e.g. OG/CD for
             the OG/CC, WG/CV fr the WG/CC) may be used. If there is no deputy/vice
             available, use the next reviewing/approving officer in the examinee’s chain of
             command (i.e. Flt/CC, SQ/CC, OG/CC, WG/CC, NAF/CC, COMUSAFE).
             7.3.6.2.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) Whenever supervision circumstances occur that
             are not directly covered by Table 7.1, use the squadron chain of command. If the
             examinee is a flight commander and the flight examiner is the SQ/CC or SQ/DO,
             then, the senior assistant director of operations will be the reviewing officer and
             the SQ/CC or SQ/DO (whichever was not the flight examiner) will be the
             approving officer. In no circumstances can the reviewing or approving officer be
             either the examinee or the flight examiner.

AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                                71


3. If the immediate supervisor is not rated, then use the next rated supervisor in the examinee’s
chain of command
4. If the OG/CC is the SEFE, the WG/CC will be the approving officer
5. For HQ USAFE and HQ NAF personnel below the division chief level, the applicable
division chief is the approving officer (e.g. for A3TV SEFEs, A3T is the approving officer).
6. MAF Only: At unit discretion (as described in the unit supplement), the Chief of CCV
may sign as Reviewing Officer in instances where the DO would sign.
7. After attached SQ/CC review, route AF Form 8 to USAFE/A3T (with info to
USAFE/A3TV) for further staffing.
          7.3.6.2.6. For evaluations completed at formal course FTU locations, the reviewing
          and final approving officers will be assigned to the FTU.
      7.3.6.3. Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the
      Organization block for the flight examiner and reviewing and final approving officers
      will be as follows:
          7.3.6.3.1. Flight examiner. Annotate unit/organization and office symbol of the
          flight examiner that completed the evaluation (e.g., 526 ARS/DOT, 12AF/OV,
          USAFE/A3TV).
          7.3.6.3.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers. Annotate unit/organization
          and office symbol as directed by MAJCOM supplement (e.g., 93 BS/DO, 388
          OG/CC, 4 FW/CC).
          7.3.6.3.2. (USAFE) Annotate unit/organization office symbol IAW with examples
          in paragraph 7.3.6.3.2
          7.3.6.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) 48 OG/CC (verbal or email notification for evaluation
          graded Q-2, Q-3, or exceptionally qualified, or signature required).
      7.3.6.4. Examinee. The examinee will sign and date after the Final Approving Officer
      certifying that they have been debriefed and understand the action(s) being taken.
      Annotate unit/organization and office symbol in the Typed Name and Grade block (e.g.
      HQ ACC/A3TV, 48 OG/OGV, etc.).
      7.3.6.4. (LAKENHEATH) If charged-out of CCV, the examinee will return the signed
      AF Form 8/8a to CCV.
          7.3.6.4.1. (Added-USAFE) If the examinee chooses not to sign, the AF Form 8/8a
          is still considered valid and will be filed in the FEF without the examinee’s signature.
          A Major Discrepancy MFR (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) will then be written and signed
          by the approving officer stating the circumstances behind the examinee’s lack of
          signature. Ensure that the MFR communicates whether or not the examinee has been
          briefed on the results of their evaluation.
  7.3.7. – Comments.
      7.3.7.1. Restrictions (if required).
          7.3.7.1.1. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will

            needed annotate with ―N   one‖.
        7.3.7.3.2. Mission Description. The verbiage of the Mission Description will be
        IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and will verify that the required areas for the evaluation
        were accomplished. Comments addressing specific areas in which instructional ability
        was demonstrated are mandatory for all evaluations of instructors (if the instructor
        taught throughout the entire mission and there were numerous areas in which
        instructional ability was demonstrated, one general comment will suffice).
        7.3.7.3.3. Discrepancies. Document discrepancies by annotating the grading area
        number, grading area title (followed by any subarea title in parenthesis), grade (Q-
        /U), annotation if discrepancy was debriefed and synopsis of discrepancy. Associate

        7.3.7.3.4. Recommended Additional Training.
            7.3.7.3.4.1. If discrepancies are documented in paragraph B and are not listed as
            Debriefed, annotate Paragraph C with recommended additional training.
            7.3.7.3.4.2. Descriptions of assigned additional training will include how
            satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or
            an instructor.
            7.3.7.3.4.3. If additional training items will not fit on the AF Form 8/8a, at a
            minimum annotate the proficiency that will be required by the examinee prior to
            the recheck.
            7.3.7.3.4.4. Flight and ground discrepancies will be listed separately. If there is
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                          73

          Training. None.‖
          7.3.7.3.4.5. (Added-USAFE) In the event of a failed evaluation, the intent of
          documentation under the ―  Additional Training‖ heading is only to annotate what
          the examinee must do PRIOR to any requalification actions. Comments detailing
          requalification events and/or how an examinee will regain qualification after
          additional training is completed will not be annotated in this section.
          Requalification requirements and criteria will be annotated under ― Restrictions‖
          (see paragraph 7.3.7.1.1).

          parenthesis) and flight examiner’s description of commendable circumstances
          (see Attachment 3).
          7.3.7.3.5.3. OPR/EPR-type comments or comments comparing the examinee to
          other individuals are prohibited.
          7.3.7.3.5.4. If the flight phase grade differs from the overall qualification level,
          the flight phase grade will be entered in this paragraph.
          7.3.7.3.5.4. (USAFE) This applies to both flight and/or ground requisites where
          the requisite grade differs from the overall grade (see paragraph 5.3.3.4.5
          (Added)). Include a brief explanation of the difference in grades.
          7.3.7.3.5.5. If an alternate evaluation method is used to satisfy a part of the
          ground or flight phase requirements (unless always accomplished verbally, on the
          ground, or in the simulator/ATD according to the AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 grading
          criteria), enter area number, area title, reason not accomplished in the normal
          method, alternate evaluation method used and date.

          evaluation must be reaccomplished, or just specific areas/subareas.
          7.3.7.3.5.7. If the recheck examiner of a ground recheck is different from the
          initial flight examiner, the recheck examiner will sign and date a statement under
          this paragraph.
          7.3.7.3.5.8. IAW paragraph 5.2.5.2.1, if a SPOT evaluation is used to update a
          periodic evaluation and/or the OG/CC authorizes additional flights after the SPOT
          to accomplish a periodic evaluation, document the circumstances in this section.
          7.3.7.3.5.9. Incorporate the information contained in any applicable MFRs (e.g.
          extension, waivers, etc.) in this paragraph (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
          7.3.7.3.5.10. Document individual or group waivers applicable to the evaluation.

     discretion and will be defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.3.7.6. (USAFE) Additional Reviews (Optional). An additional review will be
     conducted and annotated by OGV. Format of annotation is at unit discretion (as defined
     in the unit supplement), but at a minimum will include initials of the reviewer.
     7.3.7.6. (LAKENHEATH) OGV personnel will visit each CCV on a regular basis to
     review AF Forms 8. The OGV reviewer will verify the review by initialing the AF Form
     8 in the Additional Reviews in Section IV or as formatted by PEX (reference the 46
     TW/XPI (PEX) PEX user manual for the current software suite and on line instruction
     (see samples in the 48 FW AF Form 8 Guide).
 7.3.8. Temporary Evaluation Documentation.
     7.3.8.1. File temporary evaluation documentation in the aircrew member’s FEF after all
     evaluation requirements are complete (i.e., all ground and flight requisites) as a
     temporary record of the flight evaluation results.
     7.3.8.2. The temporary evaluation documentation will include examinee, examiner, type
     evaluation, qualification level, requisites results, and date completed. List any
     discrepancies by area/subarea, any restrictions, any additional training and any additional
     training due dates.
     7.3.8.3. The examiner completing the evaluation will sign and date the temporary
     evaluation documentation.
     7.3.8.4. Remove temporary evaluation documentation when the permanent AF Form
     8/8a is filed in the FEF.
     7.3.8.5. File the completed AF Form 8/8a in the FEF not later than the end of the third
     month following the date completed annotated on the AF Form 8/8a.
     7.3.8.5. (USAFE) Annotate on the USAFE Form 136 in the respective FEF any alibis
     for not meeting this requirement.
     7.3.8.6. Further guidance concerning temporary evaluation documentation will be
     outlined in MAJCOM and unit supplement.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                             75


        7.3.8.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Any signed documentation (to include PEX-produced
        worksheets) that meet the requirements of paragraph 7.3.8.2 may be used as
        temporary evaluation documentation.
        7.3.8.6.1. (LAKENHEATH) CCVs may create standardized Examiner Remarks to
        ensure standardization within the unit at the commander’s discretion. Flight
        examiners will change the mission descriptions as required to include weapons
        employment. (HH-60) AF Form 4038, HH-60 Evaluation Worksheet; prescribed by
        AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 2, will be used. Place the temporary certificate in the
        examinee’s FEF following the completion of the flight evaluation and ground
        requisites.
        7.3.8.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Reference paragraph 7.7 (USAFE) for updating the
        AF Form 942 upon the filing of temporary eval documentation in the FEF.
        7.3.8.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Once units have compiled all AF Form 8/8a
        documentation requirements and are simply waiting on signatures to complete the
        form, all previous temporary documentation will be removed from the FEF and a
        copy of the AF Form 8/8a with the evaluator’s signature (pen & ink, electronic, or
        digital) will be filed as the new temporary evaluation documentation.
  7.3.9. Rechecks
     7.3.9.1. Flight Rechecks
        7.3.9.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8/8a from the Q3 AF Form 8/8a for flight phase
        rechecks.
        7.3.9.1.2. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include documentation of the flight
        phase evaluation, Requisite completion dates from the Q3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
        annotated on the recheck form unless requisites were not completed or are required to
        complete the recheck.
        7.3.9.1.3. If the flight recheck is completed prior to completion of required requisites,
        delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until requisites are complete and enter the
        requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
        7.3.9.1.3. (USAFE) EXAMPLE: An examinee takes and fails an INSTM flight
        evaluation in the third month of eligibility, but successfully completes a flight
        recheck in the fourth month; however, ground requisites are not completed until the
        fifth month. In this case, the Q3 AF Form 8 will not have the ground requisites
        annotated and may be completed and signed with just the flight phase documented
        (with associated verbiage in Section II). The flight recheck AF Form 8 will then
        annotate the results of both ground requisites and the flight phase recheck (with
        associated verbiage in Section II.
     7.3.9.2. Ground Rechecks.
        7.3.9.2.1. A ground recheck will be documented on the Q3 AF Form 8/8a that
        generated it.
        7.3.9.2.2. Except as described below, the AF Form 8/8a will be documented as
        described in paragraphs 7.3.4 through 7.3.7.

              in the qualified block.
              7.3.9.2.2.4. The flight examiner that completed the flight evaluation (i.e. the one
              that gave the overall Q3) will sign the front of the AF Form 8/8a. If the recheck
              examiner is different than the flight examiner that gave the Q3, the recheck
              examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in Section IV - Comments,
              Examiner’s Remarks (see paragraph 7.3.7.3).
7.4. Commander-Directed Downgrade (see also paragraph 5. 9). Except as described below,
the AF Form 8/8a for a Commander-directed Downgrade will be IAW paragraph 7.3.
   7.4.1. Date Completed. The effective date of the downgrade. This is the date the
   commander initiated the downgrade action. If this is a result of a downgrade for non-flying
   related issues, the date the commander mandated the downgrade action will be used.
   7.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) (HH-60) CCV will annotate Commander-Directed Downgrade
   Form 8s for initial assignment mission pilots (MP) from the Replacement Training Unit
   (RTU) who do not meet AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 1 MP experience requirements IAW AFI
   11-2HH-60 Volume 2. Since there is no flight-phase and the restriction is based upon MDS
   hour requirements, 56 RQS/CCV will leave the qualification level blank IAW paragraph
   7.3.5.3.4.
   7.4.2. - Examinee Identification.
      7.4.2.1. Aircraft/Crew Position. In addition to the aircrew member’s MDS, if the
      downgrade includes a loss of a qualification (i.e. instructor) enter the downgraded crew
      position. If the individual is downgraded to a completely unqualified status (i.e. IP to
      UP), enter the crew position to which he/she will be re-qualified upon successful
      completion of either an RQ evaluation or ground recheck.
      7.4.2.2. Eligibility Period. Enter ―

7.6. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications (Optional). See Attachment 7 for sample
AF Forms 4348.
7.6. (LAKENHEATH) (F-15C/E) The 492/3/4 FS do not use the AF Form 4348, USAF
Aircrew Certifications, prescribed by AFI 11-202 Volume 2. The Letter of Xs is used to
document certifications. (HH-60) Utilize AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew
Training, prescribed by AFI 11-401, Aviation Management; or AF Form 4348 to document
certifications not attained through an AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a qualification, as required by AFI
11-2HH-60 Volume 1 guidance.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
   kept in the FEF.
       7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
       documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
       members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
       qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
       required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
       7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
       aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
       certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
       7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
       entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
       member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
       unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
       7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
       SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
       transcriptions are accurate.
       7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
       directed by MAJCOM.
80                        AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012

     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
     7.6.1.7. (Added-USAFE) Unless specifically directed by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, USAFE
     units will not use the AF Form 4348, but will instead use a Squadron Letter of Xs [see
     Attachment 11 Added)]
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (USAFE) The flying SQ/CC (or equivalent) or designated representative will be
     the certifying official.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
 7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
 Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            81


         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an ― in the appropriate
                                                                         X‖

     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an ― in the appropriate
                                                                          X‖
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate ―  Renamed (new
         title)‖ under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional information
  for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the AF Form
  4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
     section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
         7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 4348.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron

        – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
        7.8.3.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) CCV will place an insert in the FEF on top of the last
        AF Form 8 completed prior to assignment to the 48 OG. The insert will establish the
        48 OG is not responsible for materials behind the insert. Units may personalize the
        insert such as including the squadron emblem.
        7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
               7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
               applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
               Comments, when action is complete.
               7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
               remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
               7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
               authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
               7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
               periodic evaluation.
               7.8.3.2.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Send a copy of the memo to the
               ―USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖ org account prior to the original evaluation’s
               expiration date.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.

  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the ― Official Use Only‖ label/stamp on both sides of the
                                    For
     FEF.
 7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
 and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
 7.8.5. (LAKENHEATH) CCV will utilize 48 OG FEF Review Checker (see paragraph
 3.2.2.3) for all FEF reviews.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            87


        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (USAFE) CCVs will conduct FEF reviews annually (defined as once
        every 12 months). A ―   posting‖ review may count as an annual review if both
        paragraphs 7.8.5.2 and 7.8.5.3 are complied with at the time of review.
     7.8.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Document initial, posting, and annual reviews on the USAFE
     Form 136.
     7.8.5.4. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will accomplish spot reviews of FEFs annually (at a
     minimum) normally during supplementary evaluations of CCV programs. These reviews
     will be documented as ―s on the USAFE Form 136.
                            pot‖
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Minor discrepancies will be recorded on the USAFE
        Form 136. Each minor discrepancy listed on the form will contain the affected AF
        Forms 8/8a/4348 (if used), completion date on form (if applicable), short description
        of discrepancy and date the discrepancy was discovered. Units are not responsible for
        documenting the minor discrepancies on any stan/eval form that was generated prior
        to the individuals arrival in USAFE.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
88                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
            7.8.6.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SEFE initials on corrections do not need to be wet
            ink. Since electronic/digital signatures are allowed on the final form, if the SEFE
            is no longer available in person, initials may be obtained whereby the AF Form
            8/8a is emailed IAW paragraph 7.1.2.3 (Added) and the SEFE emails a scanned,
            initialed copy for filing in the FEF.
            7.8.6.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) OGV Chiefs may initial for corrections of minor
            discrepancies in the original SEFE’s absence; however, a ―        Lack of SEFE
            availability‖ that would drive this requirement is limited to instances where the
            SEFE has separated/retired or otherwise is not able to receive an electronic
            document IAW paragraph 7.1.2.3 (Added).
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
        7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
        allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
        and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
        7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
        folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
        7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
        clear identification of the individual concerned.
        7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
        copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
        7.8.7.3.4. (Added-USAFE) A copy of the latest Letter of Xs (see Attachment 11
        (Added)) will be placed in the member’s FEF prior to an extended TDY (where the
        FEF is required to be transported by the member) or a PCS.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                        89


     7.8.7.4. (Added-LAKENHEATH) TDY of Individual. For individuals deploying on a
     TDY that requires their FEF, CCVs should scan all contents of the FEF and retain a soft
     (electronic) copy of the FEF until the individual returns to base and the FEF is
     inprocessed to the squadron CCV (see paragraph 7.8.5.1).
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.

                                           Chapter 8

                                 SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
       8.1.2.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) CCV will ensure flight surgeons have OGV sign
       and approve the 48 OG ―   First Flight‖ Prerequisite Checklist (―
                                                                       cleared to fly‖ checklist)
       before flying in the squadron. This checklist is accessible on the 48 OSS/OSOT ICE
       page https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/48OG/OSS/default.aspx.
       8.1.2.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Flight surgeons will not fly with more than 60 days
       since the last flight until they take the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS)
       maintained (USAF School of Aerospace Medicine) open book exam (see paragraph
       8.2.1). The assigned unit’s CCV should normally notify the SQ/CC and the flight
       surgeon (verbally or via e-mail) when a break of 60 days occurs between flights.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
   8.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) Squadron Aviation Resource Managers (SARM) will utilize
   ARMS to confirm that flight surgeons are current IAW paragraph 8.1.2.1 prior to each flight.
   If flight surgeons are not current, they will not permit the flight surgeon to step until a copy
   of the open book exam completion certificate is provided (see paragraph 8.2.1).
       8.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) If a flight phase event is required thereby generating an AF
       Form 8/8a, an FEF will be built and maintained by the applicable Stan/Eval function.
       8.1.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) Existing flight surgeon FEFs will be maintained IAW
       paragraph 7.8. However, AF Form 8/8a will only be generated and added to the FEF if a
       flight phase event occurs. Flight surgeon AF Form 8/8a will have ―      ALL‖ entered for
       aircraft qualification unless qualification is for a specific MDS. CCV will send a copy of
       the flight surgeon’s AF Form 8/8a to OGV after signatures are obtained.
       8.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) If no flight phase event is required, the applicable Stan/Eval
       function will not include the affected specialized aircrew on the Squadron Letter of Xs
       (see Attachment 11 (Added)) until ARMs and the associated AF Form 1522 has been
       verified.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                           91


       8.1.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) If no flight phase event is required and the flight surgeon
       does not maintain an FEF, then, no FEF should be created by the CCV’s unless a AF
       Form 8/8a is generated. The flight surgeon’s ― cleared to fly‖ checklist and most recent
       test completion certificate should be maintained in the CCV’s flight surgeon continuity
       binder after completion of the AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training
       Accomplishment Report, prescribed by AFI 11-202 Volume 1; and ARMS update
       (regardless of FEF existence). The flight surgeon (examinee), the unit aviation resource
       manager (1C0) and SARM will comply with AFI 11-202 Volume 1 guidance for the
       completion, routing and filing of the AF Form 1522 and certificate documenting the
       flight surgeon exam. CCVs will not maintain the flight surgeon on the Letter of Xs (see
       paragraph A11.3.2.2.1).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
8.2. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 6.10.4.3 for the flight surgeons’ exemption from
periodic testing.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) Flight surgeons are authorized to take the ADLS maintained
   (USAF School of Aerospace Medicine) open book exam in their work area. The exam is
   accessible via the AF Portal (Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Knowledge Exchange).
   See paragraph 8.1.3.2 for guidance on filing the exam certificate and subsequent
   documentation. No hardcopy exam is maintained. The SQ/CC is authorized to verbally
   waive the 60-day exam requirement due to extenuating circumstances (if the site is not
   accessible for a prolonged period) (see paragraph 8.1.2.2). The flight surgeon will make
   every effort to accomplish the exam as soon as practical.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                                            Chapter 9

         ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                            EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 9.1.5 for guidance on the format of the library (see
   paragraph 6.4.1.1.1.1).
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
      9.1.2. (USAFE) The intent of this guidance is not to prohibit the release of waivers to
      publications via FCIF.
   9.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will maintain detailed procedures to standardize
   distribution of ―
                   publications‖ via FCIF in the continuity book for the FCIF library.
         9.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HQ USAFE/A3 will not release FCIFs to issue publications.
         Units will issue TOs (to include operational/safety supplements), USAF, Lead-MAJCOM
         (that has not associated USAFE guidance), USAFE, and local instructions required for
         flight via unit FCIFs.
         9.1.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will refer to AFI 11-215 guidance for concurrent
         distribution of flight manuals (TOs).
         9.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) MAF. Even if unit TODOs received formal releases of TOs
         and associated checklist from their Flight Manual Managers, OGVs will not release to
         aircrew until AMC has issued a formal release message (usually via AMC FCIF).
         USAFE/A3TV SMEs will provide awareness to the OGVs of AMC’s formal release
         message; however, this is for information only and units should not withhold release of
         publications waiting for a USAFE/A3TV notification.
            9.1.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) This guidance also applies to non-TO, non-AFI
            publications managed and released by lead-MAJCOM and annotated as required by
            AFI 11-2MDS Volumes.
            9.1.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) This guidance does not apply to AFIs. Once an AFI is
            officially published on USAF E-Publishing site, it is considered official, enforceable
            guidance.
         9.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) CAF. Upon receipt of TO (and associated checklists) release
         notification from the applicable Flight Manual Manager, OGVs may release to aircrew at
         their discretion.
         9.1.2.3. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 9.1.2.1 for concurrent distribution.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                               93


      9.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) In all instances, if units encounter difficulties (e.g. receipt of
      paper products, errors in product distribution) that cannot be resolved directly with the
      applicable Flight Manual Manager, send any questions or requests for assistance to
      USAFE/A3TV.
      9.1.2.4. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will brief the reported problem at the next SEB and
      record in the meeting minutes until final closing action is achieved (see paragraph
      3.2.2.7.5 and AFI 11-202 Volume 2 Attachment 2).
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) Required Volumes. Volume V is not optional and is reserved for
   the Squadron Flight Safety Officer. The minimum contents are Flight Safety Read Files.
   OGV will enter, rescind and delete Flight Safety Read Files into PEX as a go/no-go item if

   9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
   9.1.4. (LAKENHEATH) Part C is mandatory for the 492 FS, 493 FS, 494 FS and the 56
   RQS.
      9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
      through V.
      9.1.4.1. (USAFE) Include squadron appointment letter for primary and alternate FCIF
      monitor (see paragraph 9.1.5.8 (Added)).
      9.1.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will reference the FCIF Library Requirement index on
      the HQ USAFE/A3TV ICE page for the minimum format and content of the Table of
      Contents (Volumes I-VI). Additionally, the notification of FPL establishment letter
94                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


     (reference AFI 33-360), FCIF monitor appointment letters and the USAFE library
     certification letter will be filed in Part A Volume 1 (see paragraph 9.1.5.1.2.4).
     9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
     temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
     before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
     using MAJCOMs.
     9.1.4.2. (LAKENHEATH) FCIFs are either USAFE-directed or 48 OG-directed.
     Additionally, to ensure widest dissemination of Guardian Angel (GA) lead command
     (ACC) FCIFs, 48 OG/OGV is on the ACC Stan/Eval (ACC/A3TV) FCIF distribution list
     to provide the 48 OG/CC the option to disseminate applicable ACC GA FCIFs. Due to
     the single sequential numbering system in PEX, all FCIFs will be released as unit (48
     FW) FCIFs (based on calendar year-sequence number). See paragraph 9.1.4.5 for
     procedures.
        9.1.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Part B will be divided into two sections (with associated
        indexes): Current and Rescinded FCIF Read Files. HQ USAFE/A3 approves/rescinds
        all USAFE-directed Part B FCIF items. The OG/CC approves all unit-directed FCIF
        items. Squadron’s will not issue FCIFs, but may use a Squadron Read File or similar
        forum for release of squadron-specific FCIF-type information.
        9.1.4.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) Current FCIF Read Files are filed in Volume IA of the
        hardcopy FCIF library. OGV produces the 48 FW Flight Crew Information File
        (FCIF), Volume IA, Part B, Current FCIF Read File index. Rescinded FCIF Read
        Files are filed in Volume IB of the hardcopy FCIF library. OGV produces the 48 FW
        Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Volume IB, Part B, Rescinded FCIF Read File
        index. Volumes IA and IB will not be filed in the same binder. OGV enters current
        and rescinded FCIF Read Files in the PEX FCIF module (current and rescinded
        FCIFs are separated on the FCIF Admin page). The 48 OG/CC (or designated
        representative holding OG/CC availability) approves all new and revised USAFE-
        directed and 48 OG-directed (48 FW) FCIFs prior to release (hardcopy, in PEX,
        upload to the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP or e-mail). The Chief of OGV (or Chief
        of MDS OGV) approves all publications distribution and corrected copy 48 OG-
        directed (48 FW) FCIFs prior to release (hardcopy, in PEX, upload to CoP or e-mail).
        USAFE/A3TV will task OGV to rescind or rescind and replace USAFE-directed
        FCIFs. OGV is authorized to rescind or rescind and replace 48 OG-directed (48 FW)
        FCIFs (see paragraph 9.1.4.5.3). OG/CC has authorized the Chief of OGV (or Chief
        of MDS OGV) to approve/sign the FCIF indexes. The SQ/CC or designated
        representative approves all new or revised SARFs. The Chief of CCV approves all
        corrected copy SARFs prior to release (primarily PEX with e-mail or hardcopy as a
        backup). SARFs are defined in paragraph 9.1.4.3.
            9.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Rescinded items will be maintained for six months
            according to T13-08 R38.00 of the Air Force RDS. Upon rescission, the date
            rescinded, 6-month removal date, and disposition will be entered in the
            appropriate index (see Table 9.3 (Added)).
            9.1.4.2.1.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will direct the review/removal of
            individual FCIF Volume I, Part B items according to their expiration date and
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                      95


          publish an index of current items, along with an overall FCIF table of contents.
          Expired rescinded hardcopy FCIFs will be concurrently removed from Part B, and
          deleted from PEX and the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP. Part B items with
          unspecified review/removal dates will be reviewed upon receipt of each USAFE
          Semi-Annual Update. Reference AFMAN 33-363 for guidelines for managing all
          records (regardless of media).
          9.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Index and divide FCIF read files by MDS or
          squadron designation.
          9.1.4.2.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) Volume IA is divided into two sections. Section
          one contains FCIF Read Files applicable to multiple 48 FW MDS aircraft.
          Section two is MDS aircraft specific. Only 48 OG/OGV files all current 48 FW
          FCIF Read Files in Volume IA. Squadrons will post hardcopy FCIFs that apply
          to both their MDS and all 48 FW aircraft. For example, the 56 RQS will file 48
          FW FCIFs marked with an ― to indicate HH-60 applicability on the 48 FW
                                       X‖
          FCIF Read File. To ensure currency, the 56 RQS will review the 48 FW Flight
          Crew Information File (FCIF), Volume IA, Part B, Current FCIF Read File index
          and 48 FW Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Volume IB, Part B, Rescinded
          FCIF Read File index and file all listed 48 FW FCIFs marked ― ALL‖ and ―  HH-
          60‖.
          9.1.4.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Index and file individual FCIFs in reverse
          numerical sequence with the latest item on top.
          9.1.4.2.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) Volume IB is divided by destruction month.
          Rescinded FCIF Read Files are filed under the destruction month by destruction
          day date in reverse numerical sequence with the latest item on top. Only 48
          OG/OGV files all rescinded 48 FW FCIF Read Files in Volume IB.
          9.1.4.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Annotate the current index with the assigned
          control number, title, OPR/USAFE item number, distribution date, and
          suspense/expiration. Annotate the rescinded index with the assigned control
          number, title, OPR/USAFE item number, date rescinded, and 6-month removal
          date (see Table 9.3 (Added)).
             9.1.4.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) A single index may be used for both current
             and rescinded FCIFs. If used annotated items IAW Table 9.3 (Added) below.
             9.1.4.2.1.4.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV            maintains   two    indexes    (see
             paragraph 9.1.4.2.1).
             9.1.4.2.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) In all cases cross-reference classified entries
             to the appropriate location.
             9.1.4.2.1.4.2. (LAKENHEATH) All 48 FW FCIFs (hardcopy and in PEX)
             will be unclassified. OGV will maintain an example in the continuity book
             for the FCIF library.
             9.1.4.2.1.4.3. (Added-USAFE) The annotated suspense will also be
             considered a review date. If the item is still determined valid and necessary
             after review, the suspense date must be changed or the item must be reissued.
 96                        AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


                    9.1.4.2.1.4.3. (LAKENHEATH) The            index    will     list the  first
                    suspense/expiration review date and the revised suspense/expiration review
                    date in separate columns. OGV will file superseded 48 FW Flight Crew
                    Information File (FCIF), Volume IA, Part B, Current FCIF Read File indexes
                    to record changed suspense dates resulting from validity reviews.
          9.1.4.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB).,
             9.1.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If an FCB is used place it in Part B of Vol I. The
             FCB may be used in lieu of the FCIFs annotated in the FCB as long as the FCB
             contains all current FCIFs (as applicable to the OG’s assigned MDSs) at the time
             the FCB is published.
             9.1.4.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) OGV is responsible for the update and
             maintenance of the FCB and will reference the HQ USAFE/A3TV ICE for an
             updated listing of current and rescinded FCIFs.
             9.1.4.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) New FCIFs will be placed on top of the FCB per
             instructions in paragraph 9.1.4.2.1 (Added) until a new FCB is published.
             9.1.4.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Annotate each FCB entry by the date (month and
             year) of original FCIF release, the releasing authority (e.g. HQ USAFE, OGV,
             etc.), and whether the item has been carried over from a previous edition of the
             FCB. See also any FCB requirements in the appropriate AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3.
             9.1.4.2.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Once an FCB is published, all FCIFs contained in
             the FCB may be removed from the Current section of Part B. Incorporation of an
             FCIF item into an FCB does not constitute rescission of that FCIF. The
             incorporated FCIFs will be filed elsewhere until such time that they become
             rescinded.
             9.1.4.2.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Once an FCIF is rescinded, it will be deleted from
             the FCB and filed in the Rescinded section of Part B.

     9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
     not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
     9.1.4.3. (USAFE) Part C will be annotated as a ―    Squadron Read File‖ and will include
     current operational and mission guidance that does not have a direct impact on flight-
     safety. At SQ/CC discretion items in the squadron read file may be required reading prior
     to flight. Clearly document such intention on the actual read file.
     9.1.4.3. (LAKENHEATH) Hardcopy Part C will be divided into two sections: Current
     and Rescinded SARFs (see paragraph 9.1.4.2.1). In PEX, current and rescinded SARFs
     are separated on the FCIF Admin page. When drafting a SARF, CCVs should reference
     the example FCIF template at AFI 11-202 Volume 2 Attachment 7. Other references for
     the format and content of memorandums are: AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official
     Communications; and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 33-337, Tongue and Quill. When
     entering a SARF into PEX, CCV will identify if a SARF is to be used as part of the No-
     go process (see paragraph 9.3.1.5.1). The squadron CCV may maintain a single, up-to-
     date Part C index for both current and rescinded SARFs or separate indexes for current
     and rescinded SARFs (see paragraphs 3.3.2.6 and 9.1.4.3.2). All squadron-generated SIIs
     will be released via SARF in PEX and hardcopy (see paragraphs 9.2.2 and 9.3). OGV
     will not normally coordinate on SARFs before release (see paragraph 3.2.2.8). Reference
     AFMAN 33-363 for guidelines for managing all records (regardless of media). OGV will
     review SARFs periodically to ensure that content is not less restrictive (see paragraph
     3.2.2.8). Hardcopy rescinded SARFs will be filed under the destruction month (by
     destruction day date) in reverse numerical sequence with the latest item on top. Expired
     rescinded hardcopy SARFs will be concurrently removed from Part C and deleted from
     PEX. As a minimum, OGV will review SARFs annually during supplementary
     evaluations of squadron Stan/Eval programs (see paragraphs 3.2.2.8 and 9.4.1.3.1.3).
        9.1.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Part C items will not be less restrictive than any
        published guidance.
        9.1.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Index and file individual documents in reverse
        numerical sequence with the latest item on top.
        9.1.4.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) CCVs will file the index/indexes and SARFs in the
        hardcopy FCIF FPL as a backup to PEX. In PEX, SARFs are added to the SARF list
        by the saved date (see paragraph 3.3.2.6). The index/indexes and SARFs will be
        formatted and filed IAW guidance for FCIFs (see paragraphs 9.1.4.2.1 –
        9.1.4.2.1.4.3). As a minimum, the single or divided index should include: control
        number, title (subject) of the SARF, OPR of the index, distribution date,
        suspense/expiration date, date rescinded, 6-month removal date and disposition.
     9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
     separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
     exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
     in the FCIF volumes.
     9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.

     9.1.4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Within two duty days of receiving HQ USAFE FCIFs,
     affected OGVs will acknowledge receipt via email to the ―           USAFE/A3TV
     (Workflow)‖ org account and post the FCIF IAW the guidance in this Chapter.
     9.1.4.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) If a USAFE-directed FCIF is not filed within two duty
     days of receipt, OGV will document the reason for non-compliance in a memo for
     record. OGV will include all deficiencies, unique occurrences and requests for
     USAFE/A3TV/other agency assistance/clarification if applicable. Only OGV will
     file the MFR with the 48 FW FCIF Read File until final disposition (removal from
     Volume IB).
     9.1.4.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Approval authority for waivers to USAFE FCIFs is
     USAFE/A3 unless otherwise stated in the USAFE FCIF. Submit waivers IAW
     paragraph 1.3
     9.1.4.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Units may use any FCIF format that suits their mission
     requirements as long as the following minimum items are annotated: unit control
     number, date distributed, post-not-later-than date (for squadrons), and
     review/rescission date. FCIFs will be approved and signed by the OG/CC or
     designated representative.
     9.1.4.5.3. (LAKENHEATH) OGV releases 48 FW FCIFs as a word document with
     attachments, as applicable, not as memorandums. Additional requirements for FCIFs
     releasing SIIs are in paragraph 9.2.2. In PEX, the following dialog is mandatory:
     approved date (date distributed), number (unit control number), subject and content.
     OGV will reference the PEX user manual for the current software suite and on line
     instruction.
        9.1.4.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) For the release of HQ USAFE FCIFs, units will
        either release as-is or, if needed, provide more restrictive implementation
        guidance. At no time will units issue less restrictive guidance than is
        communicated in the USAFE FCIF.
        9.1.4.5.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) USAFE-directed FCIFs will be disseminated in
        the same format as they are distributed as the first attachment to a 48 FW FCIF
        (see paragraph 9.1.5.1.2.1).
     9.1.4.5.4. (Added-USAFE) OGV is the focal point for any information released to
     aircrew via FCIF. Staff agencies at the wing-level and below that desire to release
     information via FCIF will coordinate with OGV (Volume V of the FCIF library
     excluded). Above the wing level, HQ USAFE/A3TV is the focal point for FCIF
     information.
     9.1.4.5.4. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 9.1.4.2.1 for the FCIF distribution
     process. FCIF will normally be posted at the end of daily flying, unless directed
     otherwise. The date, time, and initials of the posting CCV representative will be
     annotated on the FCIF. Publications distributed via 48 FW FCIF will be
     shipped/transmitted to affected deployed units by the most expeditious method
     (digital publications will be e-mailed to the deployed CCV IAW TO 00-5-1-WA-1)
     (see paragraph 9.1.5.4.3).
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                             99


     9.1.4.6. (Added-USAFE) OGVs may add additional components to Volume I as
     desired.
  9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
  Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
  requirements.
  9.1.5. (LAKENHEATH) Volume V is dedicated to and maintained by the unit flight safety
  officer (see paragraphs 9.1.1 and 9.1.3). See TO 00-5-1-WA-1 for TO management policy
  and procedures.
     9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
     authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
     configuration.
     9.1.5.1. (USAFE) OGV and squadrons will establish a Publications Library that contain
     all USAF, MAJCOM, Technical Orders, and local publications applicable to the unit’s
     operation. If any part of the library is separated, it will be cross-referenced using a DD
     Form 2861, Cross Reference sheet for Technical Orders or identified on the publication
     library index for Air Force Instructions.
     9.1.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will maintain a concurrent electronic library and a
     hardcopy library (see paragraph 9.1.1). OGV will include all relevant publications in one
     electronic location on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/
     48OG/OGV/default.aspx) (see paragraphs 6.4.1.1.1.1, 9.1.5.1.2.1 and 9.1.5.1.2.2).
     CCVs will reference the electronic library and maintain a hardcopy library. The
     hardcopy library will contain: FCIFs, SARFs, mandatory publications (see paragraph
     9.1.1 and Table 9.2), other publication types (waivers), TOs and guides. CCVs will refer
     to the Table of Contents on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG
     Stan/Eval ICE page.
        9.1.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) OGV and squadrons will appoint a primary and
        alternate Publications Library monitor to ensure proper maintenance as directed by
        this supplement, AFI 33-360; section 2J, TO 00-5-1 AF Technical Order System, and
        local guidance. Place the appointment letter in Part A, Volume I of the FCIF Library.
        9.1.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Reference the USAFE Publication Library Index on the
        USAFE/A3TV ICE (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx)
        to determine minimum requirements for Volumes II through IV of the Publication
        Library. As directed in the unit supplement, units may maintain any/all of the library
        in electronic format as long as all of the following conditions are met.
        9.1.5.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) Reference the Table of Contents on the 48 OG
        Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (see paragraphs
        3.2.2.1 and 9.1.4.1) to determine minimum requirements for Volumes II through IV
        of the Publication Library. See Attachment 13 for typical instructions for
        posting/filing FCIF issued items.
            9.1.5.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All publications must be stored in the same format
            as they are distributed from the release/publishing authority, i.e. scanned copies of
            documents that are released/published only in hardcopy format are not allowed.
100                  AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


         9.1.5.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) All relevant publications will be available from
         one electronic location (i.e., the library will not force aircrew to search for
         individual publications) and will be accessible and viewable by multiple aircrew
         simultaneously. This does not preclude the use of links to networked storage (e.g.
         USAF Epubs site), but the links will be directly to the publications and not to sub-
         folders that aircrew must look through to find the desired document.
         9.1.5.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Each location that must keep an FCIF library will
         also have at least one tier of a non-network, standalone backup capability (e.g.
         external harddrive, laptop, CD-ROM, etc.). The intent is to ensure the e-library is
         accessible and viewable when required regardless of primary e-library
         availability.
         9.1.5.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Prior to allowing aircrew use of an e-library, units
         will gain USAFE/A3TV certification to ensure it complies with the standards in
         this supplement. E-library certification will be obtained from any A3TV evaluator
         on a formal (during a SAV/ASEV) or informal (during a regular flying visit) basis
         and will be annotated in Part A of Vol I signed by both the certifying individual
         and the OGV Chief.
         9.1.5.1.2.4. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 9.1.4.1.
         9.1.5.1.2.5. (Added-USAFE) The unit supplement will provide guidance on
         establishment of the e-library to include guidance on any unit-mandated hardcopy
         requirements. Units will maintain process descriptions with the e-library to
         facilitate program continuity. This process description may be published in the
         unit supplement or as a standalone document.
         9.1.5.1.2.5. (LAKENHEATH) Reference the Table of Contents on the 48 OG
         Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (see paragraphs
         3.2.2.1 and 9.1.4.1) to determine the currency, format/media of the FCIF
         hardcopy FPL and e-library. Detailed procedures for management of the FCIF
         Library are documented in OGV’s continuity book for the FCIF Library program.
         FS/CCVs and 56 RQS Squadron Mission Planning (DOMP) are responsible for
         downloading current digital publications to support any electronic in-flight media
         the unit employs.
      9.1.5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Units will reference the USAF E-Pubs site and ETIMS
      to verify the currency of library publications.
      9.1.5.1.4. (Added-USAFE) EXCEPTION: As described in the unit supplement,
      OGVs may allow their squadrons to maintain only the TO guidance on aircraft
      configurations assigned to that squadron. In the event units must host or be
      temporarily responsible for alternately configured aircraft (e.g. -220 engines at -229-
      equipped units), OGVs will document in the unit supplement the standards and
      expectations for referencing applicable TOs.
      9.1.5.1.4. (LAKENHEATH) IAW AFI 11-215, F-15C pilots are authorized to
      remove and strike through all F100-PW-100 engine and Conformal Fuel Tank (CFT)
      data/pages from TO 1F-15A-1CL-1, Flight Crew Checklist - F-15A/B/C/D; and F-
      15E aircrew members are authorized to remove and strike through all F100-PW-220
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            101


         engine pages from TO 1F-15E-1-2-1CL-1, Flight Crew Checklist - F-15E Aircraft
         Suite 6E and Up. To standardize data removal, OGV will produce sample pubs
         checkers accessible for aircrews use on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on
         the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page. If the unit hosts alternately configured aircraft for six
         months or less, the visiting unit will normally receive TODO support from the parent
         installation not the host CCV or OGV. For longer periods, the visiting unit should
         establish a TODO at RAF Lakenheath or request accession to OGV’s TODO F*16XI
         account. Requests should be submitted 30-60 days before the desired effective date.
         (Reference TO 00-5-1-WA-1).
      9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
      containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
      Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.
      9.1.5.2. (USAFE) OGV will develop, maintain, and distribute a Master Publications
      Library Index to subordinate squadrons. The Master Index will identify publications
      required by OGV to be in hard copy format (if applicable).
      9.1.5.2. (LAKENHEATH) 48 OG/OGV will maintain the table of contents on the 48
      OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (see paragraph
      9.1.4.1). Detailed procedures for the maintenance of this table of contents are filed in
      OGV’s continuity book for the FCIF Library.

       FCIF monitor to ensure proper maintenance as directed by this supplement, AFI 33-360,
       TO 00-5-1, and local guidance. Place the appointment letter in Volume I, Part A.
9.2. Flight Related SII.
   9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
   mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
   9.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraphs 3.2.2.5.4 and 9.2.1.2.
       9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
       issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
       9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
       include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
       incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
       equipment/procedures.
       9.2.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will liaise with 48 FW Safety (48 FW/SE) after Safety
       Investigation Boards (SIB) to evaluate the necessity/suitability of an SII based on any
       findings/recommendations by the board. 48 FW/SE should coordinate on SIIs resulting
       from SIBs to ensure information is controlled IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
       Reports.
       9.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) HAF or COMUSAFE SIIs released under the AF Inspector
       General program as defined in AFI 90-201, paragraph 2.7. are not Stan/Eval SIIs in and
       of themselves. Unless an AFI 90-201 SII is subsequently released via FCIF as a
       Stan/Eval SII IAW the guidance in this section, a HAF or COMUSAFE SII will be
       inspected by the IG only during UCIs IAW AFI 90-201 guidance.
   9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
   following elements:
   9.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraphs 9.1.4.3 and 9.1.4.5.3.
       9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
       9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
       9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
       9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
       SII.
       9.2.2.5. Effective date of rescission
          9.2.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Effective date of rescission will be IAW paragraph
          9.2.3.1 (Added).

       9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
   9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
       9.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) All SIIs will have a review/rescission date no more than 90
       days from the date of issue. If after 90 days the SII is still valid, the issuing authority may
       reissue the SII at 90-day increments. The intent of this guidance is preclude SIIs from
       losing their effectiveness. If SII items need to become part of normal aircrew briefings,
       units will issue changes to unit standards or recommend changes to governing
       publications via the AF Form 847.
   9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
   from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
   units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
   SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
   within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
   9.2.4. (USAFE) SIIs may be issued from either the OG or SQ level.
   9.2.4. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will review squadron SIIs periodically to ensure
   compliance with SARF procedures and to identify potential 48 OG trends. Chief, MDS
   Stan/Eval signs off the applicable SII SARF in PEX (or on the USAFE Form 287, Flight
   Crew Information File Certification, prescribed by AFI 11-202 Volume 2 USAFE
   Supplement) to document the review. SARFs are also reviewed during supplementary
   evaluations (see paragraph 9.1.4.3).
   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.5. (USAFE) If issued from the squadron level, SIIs will be released via Squadron Read
   File (or equivalent) and stored in FCIF Volume I, Part C (see paragraph 9.1.4.3). Reference
   paragraph 9.2.3.1 (Added) for rescission guidance.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
   9.2.6. (USAFE) A listing of all current SII topics separated by issuing authority (e.g.
   USAFE, OG, SQ) will be posted in each briefing room or applicable aircrew flight briefing
   area for immediate reference during aircrew briefs. Additionally, post any quick-reference
   briefing aids that may accompany the release of an SII. Unless specifically prohibited by the
   FCIF releasing the SII, units may tailor briefings aids released in USAFE Stan/Eval SIIs to
   suit unit requirements.
   9.2.6. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph A10.9.7.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (LAKENHEATH) Squadron CCVs monitoring Go/No-Go will ensure that procedures are
documented and available at the Ops desk (see paragraph 3.3.2.9). All Go/No-Go items will be
checked by the individual crewmember, Flight Lead/Aircraft Commander, Duty Desk Officer
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                          105


(DDO)/NCO and Ops Sup prior to step (see paragraphs 9.3.2, and A11.3.2.1.3 for Letter of Xs
procedures). Alert crews will complete Go/No-Go items before the beginning of their alert
period.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 9.3.2.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) The semi-annual test will be entered as an ―      event‖ into PEX
       and will be updated by the squadron CCV. At end of flying on 30 June and 31
       December, CCV will ensure that all aircrew that have not completed semi-annual testing
       will show ― red‖ in PEX. CCV will clear the semi-annual test event in PEX once the
       aircrew has passed the examination. (See paragraph 3.3.2.2 and Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.4. (LAKENHEATH) ARMS will be used to track Duty Not Involving Flying
       (DNIF) status.
       9.3.1.5. Currency on all FCIF (Volume 1, Part B) items.
          9.3.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) All aircrew (assigned and attached) will review and sign
          off FCIFs (Vol 1, part B) using either the USAFE Form 287, Flight Crew Information
          File Certification, or an automated FCIF tracking system (e.g. PEX). If an automated
          tracking system is used, a temporary USAFE Form 287 will be used if the automated
          tracking system cannot be accessed for any reason. The temporary USAFE Form 287
          may be disposed of when all reviews have subsequently been re-entered into the
          automated tracking system.
          9.3.1.5.1. (LAKENHEATH) PEX is the primary system used by the 48 OG to track
          Go/No-Go items. Deployed squadrons who are unable to access the PEX server will
          track Go/No-Go via a ―    paper copy‖ in addition to signing off FCIFs on the USAFE
          Form 287. Squadron CCV will maintain up-to-date, hard copy printouts of go/no-go
          items for use during squadron deployments or computer failures. Deployed
          squadrons are authorized to develop and employ their own automated go/no-go
          tracking system if PEX is not available. (HH-60) TDY crews without PEX access
          may sign their initials on flight authorizations when all FCIFs have been signed off.
          9.3.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Initial/Annual FCIF Reviews.
          9.3.1.5.2. (LAKENHEATH) All aircrews’ initial review of FCIFs and SARFs is
          documented on the 48 OSS/OSOT first flight checklist accessible on the 48
          OSS/OSOT ICE page (see paragraph 8.1.2). This checklist will be maintained in the
          individual’s grade book for assigned flyers and maintained at the Ops desk for guest
          aircrew. Annual review of FCIFs and SARFs will be directed by 48 OG FCIF.
          Aircrew will document completion of the review by signing off the FCIF.
106                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


             9.3.1.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) All aircrew (both assigned and attached) will
             accomplish an initial and annual review of all FCIFs (vol 1, Part B). The initial
             review will be completed prior to the first flight after being assigned/attached to a
             squadron (not required for attached flyers if the initial review was accomplished
             when the attached flyer was previously assigned to the same unit regardless of
             squadron).
             9.3.1.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Assigned or attached crewmembers absence from
             flying at their home station 90 days or more will accomplish a complete review
             prior to flight (this review may be counted as the annual review).
             9.3.1.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Document reviews            IAW paragraph 9.3.1.5.1
             (Added).
  9.3.2. (Added-USAFE) SARM personnel will be the primary verifiers of Go/No-Go status.
  The unit supplement may designate additional levels of supervision to include
  Aircraft/Mission Commanders (MAF) as able to verify Go/No-Go status prior to releasing
  aircrews for scheduled missions.
      9.3.2.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) The squadron Ops Sup is responsible for verifying
      aircrew do not fly with overdue Go/No-Go requirements and that they only perform
      events for which they are current and qualified (see AFI 11-418 Lakenheath
      Supplement). Ground and flying training currency will be tracked through ARMS
      products, which are printed out weekly. SARM personnel (1C0s) will ensure these
      products are available for the Ops Sup and aircrew at the duty desk each morning. The
      opening 1C0 will also post on the flying schedule any grounding currency that should
      prevent an aircrew member from flying that day (e.g., DNIF, ancillary training, etc.)
      9.3.2.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) (HH-60) The 56 RQS DDO/Ops Duty NCO will
      place all individuals in No-Go status when a new item is entered in FCIF Volume I Part
      B and at the beginning of each month for Boldface testing or if a Situational Emergency
      Procedures Training (SEPT) is required. When a new FCIF Volume I Part C item is
      entered, the CCV section will place all individuals in No-Go. Individuals will
      acknowledge completion of grounding and non-grounding items IAW their squadron’s
      monitoring system. The Flight Lead/Aircraft Commander and Ops Sup/DDO/Duty NCO
      will verify the Go status of all crewmembers prior to releasing them to fly.
  9.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Monthly Boldface/CAPs. Reference paragraph 6.10.5 (Added),
  monthly Boldface/CAPs exams are a Go/No-Go item. Unit supplements will include
  guidance on implementation under this paragraph.
 9.3.3. (LAKENHEATH) (HH-60) The 56 RQS Ops Sup and DDO will verify in PEX
 successful completion of the monthly Boldface examination by all aircrew members before
 allowing them to fly. Failing the monthly Boldface examination will result in grounding
 until the examination is successfully re-accomplished.
 9.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Situation Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT). For fighter
 aircrew, SEPTs are a Go/No-Go item. Accomplish SEPTs in accordance with AFI 11-2MDS,
 Vol 1.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            107


   9.3.4. (LAKENHEATH) SEPT will be checked for currency prior to each flight. Aircrew
   will accomplish one SEPT every month. SEPT currency will expire at the end of the month if
   accomplished before the 21st or at the end of the following month if accomplished on or after
   the 21st (expiration is a grounding item until SEPT accomplished).
      9.3.4.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) Completion of SEPT training will be documented
      on the SEPT Tracker and tracked in PEX. Squadrons will maintain a SEPT binder
      including, as a minimum, the monthly SEPT scenario and the SEPT tracker for all
      aircrew. If the SEPT tracker is not filed in the SEPT binder, a DD Form 2861 will be
      filed to cite where the tracker is located. An EP simulator with an instructor, squadron
      supervisor, or contract simulator instructor will count as a supervised SEPT. (HH-60)
      Aircrew may log an SEPT for any simulated Emergency Procedures (EP) sorties.
      9.3.4.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) SEPTs should last a minimum of 30 minutes.
      Present situations and then discuss actions to cope with the malfunction through to a
      logical conclusion. Emphasize critical action procedures and SIIs. All aircrew should
      participate fully and equally. SQ/CCs, SQ/DOs, and CCV should consider any identified
      trends along with squadron Safety (SE) coordination in the development of monthly
      SEPT scenarios (see paragraph 3.2.2.5).
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander
   to ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
      9.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SUPEVALs aid the commander in determining if there is a
      problem in standardization or execution of the unit’s mission(s) as reflected in inspection
      findings or negative trends during checkrides. SUPEVALs also are the last link in the
      chain connecting known problems and the implementation of corrective actions. The
      consequences of SUPEVALs may be as small as implementing an extra step in a
      checklist to as far reaching as changing a squadron’s entire annual training program. See
      Attachment 12 (Added) for more information
      9.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) SUPEVALs should be implemented by all levels of flying
      supervision, not just by the OG/CC.
      9.4.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) OGV will administer in-flight and operational
      supplementary evaluations to agencies under 48 OG/CC control (see paragraph 3.2.2.6).
      CCVs will administer SQ/CC-directed in-flight and operational supplementary
      evaluations to agencies under SQ/CC control (see paragraph 3.3.2.1). To evaluate
      suspected or known problems, OGV and CCVs will reference AFI 11-202 Volume 2
      USAFE Supplement Attachment 12.
      9.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE SUPEVAL program consist of both operational
      and in-flight evaluations.
      9.4.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) Operational supplementary evaluations will use the current
      HQ USAFE/A3TV SAV/ASEV Criteria Guide, applicable AFI checklists, and/or unit-
      developed checklists. The agency to be evaluated will be notified at least 5 work-days in
108                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


      advance to ensure key personnel are present, unless unusual circumstances preclude
      advance notification. The evaluation team chief will in-brief with the SQ/CC or division
      supervisor, detailing the purpose of the evaluation.
         9.4.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Operational SUPEVALs. Operational SUPEVALs
         cover shop duties that require compliance with published guidance.
             9.4.1.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Conduct unit operational SUPEVALs once every
             calendar year, but not to exceed 12 months. Units will use the USAFE/A3TV
             Inspection Checklists posted on the USAFE/A3TV ICE under the ―       SAV/ASEV
             Info‖ folder as the baseline for constructing their own SUPEVAL checklists.
             9.4.1.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of
             required operational SUPEVALs up to 3 months. Document extensions in SEB
             minutes.
             9.4.1.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, the unit program will conduct a
             SUPEVAL on all squadron Stan/Eval programs areas as listed in the most current
             USAFE/A3TV SAV/ASEV Criteria Guide.
         9.4.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) In-flight SUPEVALs. In-flight SUPEVALs cover a
         specific topic for a finite period. Examples include (but are not limited to): SFO
         execution, flight discipline, flight leadership, noise abatement, communication
         discipline, CRM issues, etc..
         9.4.1.3.2. (LAKENHEATH) In-flight supplementary evaluations will be recorded
         and maintained by OGV. In-flight supplementary evaluations may be used to gather
         data and make recommendations to correct trends.
 9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
  9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
  evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
  evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
  management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
      9.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Reporting. Submit a written report to the commander that
      initiated the SUPEVAL no later than 2 weeks after completion of the SUPEVAL (info
      copy to USAF/A3TV). OGV (for mandatory and OG-directed SUPEVALS) and CCV
      (for SQ/CC-directed SUPEVALs) shall retain a 2 year history of all SUPEVAL reports
      (may be electronic, hardcopy, or both at unit’s discretion). The report shall include the
      following items at a minimum:
      9.4.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) After the evaluation, the evaluation team chief will debrief
      the SQ/CC or division supervisor on results of the supplementary evaluation.
         9.4.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose and objectives of SUPEVAL (e.g. in response
         to SEB findings, trends, etc.)
         9.4.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Discrepancies
         9.4.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Recommendation(s) for corrective actions

EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED: The examinee demonstrated exceptional aircraft handling
and instrument skills during all phases of this evaluation. Rapidly changing weather and denial
of service at two planned out-bases caused the examinee to have to change his plan several
times in-flight, each time done quickly and efficiently so that all aspects of the mission could
still be accomplished.

                               Attachment 8 (Added-USAFE)
 SEFE OBJECTIVITY EVALUATION GRADING CRITERIA & DOCUMENTATION
                           GUIDANCE

A8.1. (Added) Purpose. To hold SEFEs accountable to objectively evaluating aircrew against
the standards of performance outlined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 as well as provide commanders a
way to assess the capabilities of the SEFEs under their command.
A8.2. (Added) Execution. SEFE-certified commanders at any level (to include Senior Flight
Examiners) may give or direct SEFE objectivity evaluations at any time. Additionally, a SEFE
objectivity evaluation (given either in-flight or during the administration of an EPE) will be
given to initially-certified SEFEs (SEFEs who have never been certified before) by any HQ
USAFE SEFE, OGV SEFE, the OG/CC, or the SEFE’s assigned SQ/CC within the first 12
months after becoming a SEFE (may not be accomplished on the first evaluation after becoming
a SEFE). See Table A8.1 (Added) for grading criteria.
   A8.2.1. (Added) Waiver authority for extending the 12 month window for Objectivity
   Evaluations conducted on initially certified SEFEs is the SQ/CC. Document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2
   A8.2.2. (Added) Use the area grading criteria in Table A8.1 (Added) to assign both area
   and overall grades based on the two-tier grading system Q/U.
       A8.2.2.1. (Added) An overall Q indicates that the SEFE complied with HHQ and local
       stan/eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified
       discrepancies, awarded an appropriate grade for each area evaluated, awarded an
       appropriate overall grade, and, if required, assigned appropriate additional training.
       A8.2.2.2. (Added) Award an overall U when, in the SEFE’s judgment, the SEFE
       examinee failed to satisfy Q requirements or additional training is warranted. Awarding a
       U will result in loss of SEFE certification until re-certified by the SQ/CC (squadron-
       designated evaluators) or the OG/CC (OGV-designated evaluators). Recertification
       standards will be stipulated in the unit supplement.
       A8.2.2.2. (LAKENHEATH) SEFE recertification program following an unqualified
       (U) graded checkride will be determined by the SQ/CC (squadron-designated evaluators)
       or the OG/CC (OG-designated evaluators). At a minimum, the recertification
       requirements will include a self-guided review of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Volume
       2, AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and all implementing supplements, in addition to a reevaluation
       of the event that resulted in the U grade. The recertification program will be documented
       on a MFR and filed in the examinee SEFE’s FEF until the recertification program is
       completed. If necessary, the MFR information will be documented on the AF Form 8/8a
       IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.1.
   A8.2.3. (Added) The OG/CC and Chief of OGV may administer objectivity evaluations in
   all unit aircraft to a SEFE in any crew position.
   A8.2.4. (Added) HQ USAFE SEFEs may conduct objectivity evaluations in all command
   aircraft to a SEFE in any crew position.
 142                      AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


   A8.2.5. (Added) SEFEs authorized by AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 to administer evaluations to
   other crew positions can also administer these crewmembers an objectivity evaluation, e.g. F-
   15E Weapon System Operator (WSO) SEFEs can give F-15E pilot SEFEs objectivity
   evaluations.
   A8.2.6. (Added) Objectivity evaluations may be combined with any other evaluation.
A8.3. (Added) Grading. SEFEs will use the grading criteria shown in Table A8.1 (Added)
when conducting SEFE Objectivity Evaluations.
A8.4. (Added) Documentation. Except as described below, the AF Form 8 for a SEFE
Objectivity Evaluation will be completed IAW paragraph 7.3 Use a separate AF Form 8 if the
objectivity evaluation is combined with any other evaluation.

                                Attachment 10 (Added-USAFE)
                            BRIEFING FACILITIES GUIDANCE

A10.1. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, the following materials will be available in either the
mission planning area or flight briefing room(s) for the express purpose of facilitating the
mission planning/briefing process as described in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3. Items not applicable
based on MDS and/or host nation requirements may be omitted. Use the following definitions:
A10.1. (LAKENHEATH)CCVs are responsible for ensuring squadron briefing facilities
are IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 USAFE Supplement Attachment 10 (see paragraph
3. 3.2.10). 48 OG squadrons have large conference rooms both in unclassified and classified
areas. These conference rooms are not considered briefing rooms and are not required to contain
planning or briefing materials.
   A10.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Mission Planning: Includes the time period from the start of
   dedicated planning and any material used/produced specifically for the execution of the
   tasked mission.
   A10.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Briefing: Starts with the beginning of the official aircrew pre-
   mission brief as described in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3. Does not include pre-brief ―rallies‖ or
   informal gatherings not a part of the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3 briefing process.
   A10.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Supervision of Flying: Includes SOF, Ops Sup/Top 3, or any
   similar duty position within the squadron involved with advising aircrew while they are on-
   mission starting from ground ops and continuing through engine shutdown.
A10.2. (Added-USAFE) All information, either hard copy or electronic, used for mission
planning, briefing, and supervision of flying must be current and correct (i.e. no ― Reference
                                                                                   For
Use Only‖ material will be used). See also paragraph 3.2.1.3.1. (Added).
A10.2. (LAKENHEATH)Hard copy will be the primary means for referencing required
briefing rooms materials. (HH-60G) Items may be maintained electronically if they are
presented in a suitable format for briefing (large screen television, projector, etc.) and a suitable
back-up is maintained (see paragraph A10.5).
   A10.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Items listed below will be current and correct to the level of
   detail commensurate with their role in the planned mission/brief IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 3
   and AFI 11-202 Vol 3 (e.g. if the local area map is also used for planning/briefing low-level
   ops then it must have current DAFIF/ECHUM).
   A10.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph A10.9.
A10.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Information need not be updated for items of a temporary nature
(i.e. released through NOTAM, FCIF, or similar guidance), but aircrew will include temporary
updates that are relevant to the mission in the briefing.

   A10.2.3. (Added-USAFE) In lieu of replacing required information each time new
   guidance is released, units may provide a summary of changes relevant to the unit’s missions
   (either individually for each applicable item listed below or combined for all items) that
   is/are available for each briefing.
AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012                                            149


   A10.2.3. (LAKENHEATH) New guidance to required information (to include items of a
   temporary nature or permanent nature) will normally be released via the standard NOTAM
   service and/or PEX and will be available at all times and should be briefed prior to every
   mission.
A10.3. (Added-USAFE) Flight briefing rooms will be well lit and of adequate size to
comfortably seat all flight members. In squadrons where space is limited, the flight planning
room and briefing room may be collocated.
A10.4. (USAFE) A hard copy of the unit Pilot/Aircrew Aid, In-Flight Guide (IFG), and/or
electronic briefing material may be used to satisfy these requirements as long as they are
accessible and viewable by all flight members during the brief.
A10.4. (LAKENHEATH)See Table A10. 2 for the file location of the hardcopy 48 FW IFG,
available for reference in briefing rooms.
A10.5. (USAFE) If electronic briefing items are used to fulfill any of these requirements,
squadrons will maintain an effective backup capability. The backup products need not be to
the same resolution as the primary, but will be current/complete IAW A10.2.2. (Added).
A10.6. (USAFE) Regardless of the method used to display the material or the location in
which it is maintained, aircrew will ensure that items relevant to the mission are present in
the flight briefing room at the time of briefing.
A10.6. (LAKENHEATH)Aircrew will ensure the MDS-specific Briefing Room Self
Inspection Checklist and the Briefing Room Boards Currency Tracker are complied
with. These products are accessible on the 48 OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG
Stan/Eval ICE page and should be maintained IAW paragraph A10.8.
A10.7. (USAFE) SQ/CCs (or equivalent) of forward operating locations may waive any of
the below requirements as long as aircrew briefing capabilities are not degraded.
A10.7. (LAKENHEATH) SQ/CCs may verbally waive any of the requirements IAW AFI 11-
202 Volume 2 USAFE Supplement paragraph A10.7.
A10.8. (USAFE) Unit supplement will stipulate the specific location(s) required materials
in this attachment will be maintained, how the squadrons will verify/maintain currency
and correctness of required items, and how the squadrons will ensure aircrew are aware of
any applicable changes.
   A10.8.1. (Added-LAKENHEATH) OGV will maintain an MDS-specific Briefing Room
   Self Inspection Checklist to specify briefing materials/products and file locations (see
   paragraphs 3.2.2.15, A10.9, A10.10 and Tables A10.1 – A10.3). Each briefing room will
   contain four, three-ring binders, as a minimum. CCvs may subdivide briefing room binders
   if the contents exceed the capacity of the binder. CCVs will identify the first and subsequent
   binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., 1A, 1B, etc.). (F-15C/F-15E) Each briefing room will
   contain a sliding briefing board (six deep on each side and will be numbered R1 for front
   right and L6 for back left). See paragraph A10.9 for board configuration. (HH-60G) If using
   the main briefing room for briefing or debriefing, only applicable information required for
   the mission needs to be present. See paragraph A10.9 and Table 10.3).
   A10.8.2. (Added-LAKENHEATH) In addition to the checklist maintained in the briefing
   rooms, a hardcopy of the most recent, completed MDS-specific Briefing Room Self

     Inspection Checklist will be filed in OGV’s and CCV’s continuity book for flight planning
     and briefing rooms. OGV will maintain an electronic copy of the current briefing room self-
     inspection checklist on the 48 OG/OGV CoP or ICE page. CCVs will perform spot
     inspections as required and annotate on the provided checklist. At a minimum, OGV should
     inspect the briefing rooms on an annual basis in conjunction with OGV supplementary
     evaluations (see paragraphs 3.2.2.6 and 9.4).
     A10.8.3. (Added-LAKENHEATH) OGV will print new charts as required for all squadron
     briefing rooms. Detailed procedures for the maintenance of charts, diagrams and other
     planning/briefing room documents are maintained in OGV’s continuity book for the Flight
     Planning/Briefing Rooms program.

                              Attachment 11 (Added-USAFE)
                       LETTER OF CERTIFICATION GUIDANCE

A11.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose. The purpose of this attachment is to further define USAFE
requirements for units to maintain a Letter of Xs. The requirement to maintain a Letter of Xs is
IAW paragraphs 4.2.3.2., 5.10.2., 7.1., and 7.2.
A11.2. (USAFE) Intent. The intent of the Letter of Xs is to provide the SQ/CC a summary
document annotating the certifications/qualifications of all aircrew in the squadron.
A11.2. (LAKENHEATH) Flight surgeons who do not require a flight                           phase
evaluation/certification will not be annotated on the Letter of Xs (paragraph 8.1.3.2).
   A11.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Being a summary document, the Letter of Xs will be used in
   concert with source training/certification/qualification documentation (e.g. gradebooks, AF
   Forms 8/8a, etc.) to verify the validity of certification/qualification claims.
   A11.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Specifically for certifications, in any instance where the source
   document cannot be located, the Master Letter of Xs, with a valid SQ/CC (or designated
   representative) signature, may be used as the source document for that certification.
A11.3. (Added-USAFE) Management and Publication.
   A11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Unit supplements will describe the overall management of the
   Letter of Xs, which may be assumed by the unit training function if desired.
   A11.3.1. (LAKENHEATH) CCVs will use the sample Letter of Xs maintained on the 48
   OG Stan/Eval Division CoP and/or on the 48 OG Stan/Eval ICE page (see paragraph
   3.3.1.1).
       A11.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If units choose to have the squadron training function
       manage the Letter of Xs, the Stan/Eval function will still verify the correctness of the
       final Letter of X prior to SQ/CC (or designated representative as annotated in the unit
       supplement) signature.
       A11.3.1.1. (LAKENHEATH) See paragraph 3.3.2.11 for responsibilities.
   A11.3.2. (Added-USAFE) As a minimum, a Master Letter of Xs will be published by the
   7th of each month IAW the following guidance.
       A11.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Signature and Posting. The Master Letter of Xs will be
       signed by the SQ/CC (or designated representative). Electronic/digital signatures are
       authorized and will conform to the guidance in paragraph 7.1.2.
       A11.3.2.1. (LAKENHEATH) The hardcopy master Letter of Xs will be signed in black
       ink by the SQ/CC (or designated representative) (see paragraph 3.3.1.1).
           A11.3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) After the SQ/CC (or designated representative as
           annotated in the unit supplement) signs the Master Letter of Xs and prior to any
           distribution of the document, the managing office will ―
                                                                  finalize‖ the document so that
           no further changes may be made.
156                     AFI11-202V2_USAFESUP_LAKENHEATHSUP_I 11 JULY 2012


         A11.3.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Units will define in their supplements how the Letter
         of Xs will be finalized (e.g. saved as a PDF file, using the "Mark as Final" function in
         MS Office, etc.)
         A11.3.2.1.2. (LAKENHEATH) DOT or CCV will finalize the document by saving
         as a PDF and will scan, email or hand deliver a copy of the PDF master Letter of Xs
         to OGV within the 7-day calendar timeline.
         A11.3.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) After being finalized, the Letter of Xs will be posted
         in a central location as stipulated in unit supplement, but will be readily available to
         squadron supervision. All other distributed copies will be taken as ― Reference
                                                                                  For
         Use Only‖.
         A11.3.2.1.3. (LAKENHEATH) Master Letter of Xs will be filed at the squadron
         operations desk. The Letter of Xs/AF Form 1381/4348 will be reviewed prior to step
         by the Ops Sup to ensure that all crewmembers are planning to fly within their current
         qualifications/certifications.
      A11.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Items. Annotate a Master Letter of Xs with the
      following minimum information as applicable to the MDS/crew position and specific

            (see Figure 4.1), in addition to the SEFE’s name being highlighted, the SEFE
            qualification identifier container will also be highlighted in the same format to
            identify approaching inactive status. If a qualified SEFE transitions to inactive
            status the Letter of Xs will be updated with an ― in the SEFE column. Once

                USAFE SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUTION GUIDANCE

A12.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose. The purpose of this attachment is provide units with more
education on how SUPEVALs may be used to maximize aircrew training and ensure the
commander has awareness of how best to vector the unit's daily mission accomplishment.
A12.2. (USAFE) To determine which SUPEVAL flow is appropriate, the unit must begin
with awareness of two types of problems within the unit: 1) a suspected problem [reference
Figure A12.1. (Added).], or 2) a known problem [reference Figure A12.2. (Added).].
