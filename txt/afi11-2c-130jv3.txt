                                             Chapter 2

                                 COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of
the following C2 centers: 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC) Global Cell, Pacific
Air Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) 603 Air Operations
Center/Air Mobility Division (AOC/AMD), Africa Command (AFRICOM) 617 AOC/AMD, Air
National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Command
Center, theater Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint
Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control
Centers (AMCC), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), Tanker Airlift Control Elements
(TALCE), and Special Tactics Teams (STT). C2 centers are action agents for the MAF
commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility missions/forces.
2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with Operational Control over MAF
resources hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority
formulate plans, allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2
element. OG/CCs serve as execution authority for local training missions. The PIC will execute
missions operating outside normal communication channels (use last known mission orders or
best course of action).
     2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, or
     MAJCOM regulation governing OST‘s for procedures and requirements governing OSTs.
        2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/A3OO) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
        Equipped OSTs.
2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an
aircraft commander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights,
on a flight authorization form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable
supplements. An unqualified pilot may not be designated as PIC. A non-mission ready (NMR)
pilot may be designated as PIC, provided the delinquent events causing the NMR status are not
performed on that flight. PICs are:
     2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
     2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly
     events authorized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC‘s judgment an emergency
     condition demands otherwise. Unscheduled training events (for example, transition training)
     may be flown after obtaining approval from the execution authority.
     2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
     2.3.4. The final authority for requesting and accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
     2.3.5. Responsible for passing mission progress reports (at least daily) to C2 agents.
     2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel
     and will establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering
     crew rest. Local C2 agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on
     the PIC‘s behalf.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   17


   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Personnel (MEP),
   passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission
clearance decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with
the PIC. If a PIC elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that
generated the decision to delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may
task another PIC to take the same mission under the same conditions.
   2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to
   resolve an emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
   2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of
   executing departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
   2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that
   may preclude re-route or divert.
   2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure
   existing and forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield
   information from the Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2/Airfield Suitability
   and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en
   route, the PIC will coordinate with the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final
   authority for accepting a suitable alternate. A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate
   ground service agencies of the aircraft‘s impending arrival.
2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
   2.5.1. Stations with MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data
   (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
   2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2 Agency. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2
   agency by any means available (i.e., Defense Switching Network (DSN), high-frequency
   (HF) radio, and satellite communication (SATCOM), etc.). HF radio is the primary method
   of communication for routine mission information. For critical C2 communications, i.e.
   aircraft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications is the primary
   method.
   2.5.3. En route Reporting.
       2.5.3.1. Make the following en route calls to 618 TACC, as required:
           2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
           2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
           2.5.3.1.3. On Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, no later than 1 hour prior to
           landing if a patient condition changes or arrival time is greater than plus or minus 30
           minutes from scheduled time.
       2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic ―ops normal‖ calls/transmissions are not required; however,
       the controlling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
       2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures
       through a communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or
18                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        FLIP. Aircrews will maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications
        plan within aircraft equipment capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-
        ALE), SATCOM, Combat Track II (CTII)).
     2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system
     malfunctions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible.
     Contact arrival C2 agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
     2.5.5. Not Used.
     2.5.6. ―Thirty Minute‖ Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination
     C2 agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks
     (ETB) and request any necessary support.
     2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers
     (FM) will be the C2 conduit for aviators. For critical C2 communications, voice
     communications (HF, DSN, etc.) are the primary method. EXCEPTION: For AFRC/ANG
     missions using IFM, AFRC/ANG will provide C2.
        2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight
        information regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase ―Pass to Hilda‖ to Air Traffic Control
        (ATC) position reports.
        2.5.7.2. Crews must receive a verbal tactics & intel briefing at the last enroute stop prior
        to entry into a hostile area/combat zone, provided the capability exists. If no tactics/intel
        functions are available at the last enroute stop, PICs shall use secure communications
        (SIPRnet, STU/STE, etc.) to receive this briefing. If unable to comply, the PIC should
        contact the C2 agency to receive clearance to proceed based on previous intel briefings.
     2.5.8. HF Communications.      HF is the primary means of access to the worldwide C2
     network.
     2.5.9. SATCOM Messages and Advisories (when required).
        2.5.9.1. On-station Message. Transmit an on-station message at the beginning of each
        crew duty day.
        2.5.9.2. Arrival Advisory. IAW paragraph 2.5.6
        2.5.9.3. Advisories. Transmit mission delay, on/off-load reports.
     2.5.10. Not Used.
     2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be
     transmitted at the discretion of the PIC.
     2.5.12. Iridium Phones. Crews are authorized to use Iridium phones with the following
     restrictions:
        2.5.12.1. Limit in-flight phone use to cruise (normally above 10,000 feet AGL) altitude.
        The phone shall be off during takeoff, climb/departure, descent/approach, and landing
        phases of flight.
        2.5.12.2. Do not transmit on secure radios when the Iridium phone is coupled to the
        aircraft intercom system using the Iridium Subscriber Unit (ISU). To ensure security of
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                19


       classified transmissions, disconnect the ISU and Iridium phone from the intercom before
       using secure radios.
   2.5.13. Combat Track II. CTII provides two way, beyond line of sight, secure
   communication text messaging between multiple ground and airborne nodes. It also provides
   in-flight following via automatic Global Position System (GPS) position reports displayed on
   standard digital navigation charts, when installed on the aircraft.
       2.5.13.1. Home Station. CTII units at home station are intended for training use only.
       Unless specifically designated by the C2 agency do not deploy with home station
       equipment.
2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
   2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate an MC when more than two aircraft are assembled
   to perform missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing
   a MC for special, high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall
   responsibility and is the final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC
   shall properly coordinate mission details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate
   any special mission planning requirements with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24
   hours prior to mission execution.
       2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and
       designate a lead planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an airdrop, or
       tactical airland operation. For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit
       involved, the theater AOC shall designate a central planning agency responsible for
       coordinating the entire mission with all involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead
       planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will be a rated (normally field grade)
       officer qualified in the type mission.
       2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
       2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency)
       will ensure non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include
       rendezvous, formation, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will relay anticipated
       delays or mission changes to the controlling agency and all non-collocated PICs.
2.7. Not Used.
2.8. C2 Agency Telephone Numbers. Table 2.1 contains a list of 618 TACC phone numbers.

2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (i.e. Combat Search and Rescue, AE,
PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention. PICs will promptly notify the appropriate
C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-time departure. Provide the C2 agent
with an estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned Estimated Time of Departure (ETD), and
estimated time of arrival (ETA) within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safely possible.
2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to
cooperate with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-
801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures
service members must follow when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement
agencies. Coordinate all civilian law enforcement authorities‘ requests for assistance through
appropriate C2 channels.

                       AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews.
Commanders at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-related
work/rest schedules that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.
3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission
directive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member
qualifications, and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking. Table 3.1
summarizes crew position requirements for different crew types.

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.
 Crew Position                Basic                   Augmented               Tactical

 NOTES:
 (1) The ACs must be qualified in the appropriate mission to be accomplished. Transfer of
 PIC duties between qualified ACs will be briefed to the crew.
 (2) Two loadmasters may be required, at the unit commander‘s discretion, depending on
 mission complexity. Combat or contingency missions with hostilities require two loadmasters.
 (3) Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified crewmember are required if
 more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried (except during unit moves or
 contingencies). Both crew members must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward and
 one aft for takeoffs and landings, or as required by the tactical/emergency situation.
 (4) Only one loadmaster is required for tactical missions if any of the situations below apply:
 Personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs) drops using only one paratroop door.
 High altitude (up to 13,000 feet MSL) non-static line personnel are dropped from the ramp and
 door or, only one paratroop door is opened.
 CDS airdrops, including TRIADS.
 Dropping only standard airdrop training bundles (SATBs).
 A no-drop (dry pass) is planned.
 Unilateral heavy equipment training loads utilizing the EPJS.
 (5) At SQ/CC discretion, an IL and student fulfills the two loadmaster requirement to drop
 unilateral training heavy equipment loads without EPJS.
22                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     3.2.1. The minimum crew complement for local flights is an aircraft commander, flight pilot,
     and loadmaster. When a mission requires more than one aircrew member at a position, the
     SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and NMR crewmember meet mission
     requirements.
     3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a
     basic FDP. Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready
     (MR) IAW AFI 11-2C-130J, Vol 1, C-130J Aircrew Training (or equivalent).
     EXCEPTION: A NMR pilot may augment provided the other two pilots are MR IPs.
     SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full FDP. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may augment
     aircrews while the flight is underway.
     3.2.3. Tactical Airlift Formation Lead Requirements.
        3.2.3.1. Definitions:
            3.2.3.1.1. Flight Lead crew: consists of an aircraft commander who is either flight
            lead certified or is receiving lead upgrade training from an instructor. Can
            accomplish mission commander duties, lead multiple element formations, and
            perform element lead duties in a multiple element formation.
            3.2.3.1.2. Two-Ship Lead crew: consists of a MR aircraft commander, or an upgrade
            candidate receiving mission training from an instructor. Can perform lead duties in a
            single element two-ship formation,
            3.2.3.1.3. Deputy Lead crew: a flight lead crew that is ready to assume formation
            lead duties if the formation lead aborts. A deputy lead is required for formations
            greater than 3 aircraft. Deputy lead may fly as the number 2 aircraft in the first
            element or may fly as second element lead as long as no other aircraft occupies the
            number 2 position.
            3.2.3.1.4. An element consists of 2 aircraft. A flight consists of 3 or more aircraft.
        3.2.3.2. Unilateral VMC training: No special requirements.
        3.2.3.3. Unilateral IMC training and other than unilateral formations:
            3.2.3.3.1. Single-element formations. No special requirements.
            3.2.3.3.2. Multiple-element formation. A flight lead crew is required in the lead and
            deputy lead position. If deputy lead aborts after station time, any crew can assume
            their position with the concurrence of the mission commander. A flight lead crew is
            required in any element lead position; however, any crew can fly as the last ship of a
            formation even if it is an element lead position.
     3.2.4. NVG Aircrew Complements. Normally, an NVG crew will consist of a NVG certified
     crewmember in each of the primary crew positions (a crewmember in upgrade supervised by
     a qualified instructor meets this requirement). The pilots may use NVGs even if the
     loadmaster is not NVG current/certified. However, NVG taxi operations requiring the
     loadmaster to clear the taxi route/wingtip clearance require a current NVG-certified
     loadmaster to utilize NVGs.
     3.2.5. Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System (JPADS)/Improved Container Delivery
     System (I-CDS) Aircrew Complement. JPADS/I-CDS crews consist of JPADS certified
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               23


   basic airdrop crew and a PADS Operator (PO). The PO does not have to be MDS qualified
   but must be a rated airdrop qualified officer. The PO must be JPADS certified. It is essential
   the PO receive a thorough ACM briefing prior to performing duties on aircraft other than
   their primary MDS.
3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification
training to perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
   3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF Form
   8) or orientation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position
   when under direct instructor supervision.
3.4. Pilots. An IP must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
   3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The
   PIC shall brief the aircrew on the plan to transfer AC duties.
   3.4.2. Missions With Passengers. Only current and qualified pilots (possessing an AF Form
   8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
   EXCEPTION: A non-current but qualified pilot under direct IP supervision may fly with
   passengers on board.
       3.4.2.1. Pilots shall not fly touch-and-go landings with passengers on board.
       EXCEPTION: Touch-and-go and stop-and-go landings are authorized with MEP on
       board.
3.5. Not Used.
3.6. Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew
member on any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct
supervision for critical phases of flight).
3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles
permit an aircrew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP) – Begins 1 hour after alert notification (or at established
   report time for self-alerts) and ends at final engine shutdown of the day. SQ/CCs shall form
   aircrews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Reduce FDP when the autopilot
   fails after departure IAW information below. If the autopilot fails after departure, consider
   mission requirements and determine the best course of action to preclude further mission
   delays due to reduced FDP. The best course of action may include diverting to an airfield
   with maintenance capability. Contact C2, coordinate intentions, and comply with limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16 hours (12 hours
       when both autopilots are inoperative or neither autopilot can be coupled to the Flight
       Director (FD)). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO may
       extend to augmented FDP, regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall
       augment basic crew to extend FDP).
       3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 18 hours
       (16 hours when both autopilots are inoperative or neither autopilot can be coupled to the
24                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        FD). Only the pilot portion of the crew needs to be augmented when both autopilots are
        inoperative.
        3.7.1.3. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
        3.7.1.4. Training, Tactical, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), and
        Functional Check Flights/Acceptance Check Flights (FCFs/ACFs) FDP:
            3.7.1.4.1. Maximum FDP for training/tactical/FCF/ACF missions is 16 hours (12
            hours when both autopilots are inoperative or neither autopilot can be coupled to the
            FD). Conduct the mission as follows:
            3.7.1.4.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition
            events, or tactical events) during the first 12 hours of the FDP. EXCEPTION: ANG
            and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local training missions up to
            a 16 hour FDP.
     3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform
     combined ground/flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-
     mission duties within maximum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related
     duties for other missions when approved by member‘s home station SQ/CC or equivalent.
     Maximum CDT is 18 hours for a basic aircrew and 20 hours for an augmented aircrew.
        3.7.2.1. CDT and FDP include both military and civilian work. CDT and FDP begin
        when an individual reports for their first duty period (military or civilian).
     3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1 hour after aircrew alert notification. For
     self-alerts, CDT/FDP begins at established report time. SQ/CC or equivalent may task
     aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin flight-related duties or
     MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member early: begin
     CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
        3.7.3.1. For self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report
        times with C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
        3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions.  PICs may request CDT/FDP extensions from
        MAJCOM/A3/DO. C2 agents shall not ask PICs to exercise this option.
     3.7.4. Deadhead Time. IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, deadhead time is the time
     computed traveling in passenger status. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the
     purpose of positioning or de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support
     function. Crewmembers may deadhead for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent
     may approve crewmembers to deadhead in excess of 24 hours.
        3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after
        deadheading, provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for
        deadhead flight).
        3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a
        maximum of 24 hours from the time the crewmember‘s FDP began.
     3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-
     load, start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, paragraph 9.7.2.
     The duty day begins when the aircrew member reports for official duties.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                25


3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. IAW AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules. In addition, SQ/CCs
shall not schedule an aircrew member to fly nor will an aircrew member perform aircrew duties:
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff or
   ALFA standby force legal for alert time or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while
   under the influence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight.
   An aircrew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as ―get-me-
   downs‖ following an unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.
3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following
   ground testing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section
   provides guidance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew
   initiate and maintain restful sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest periods. Fliers
   on augmented aircrews shall not use no-go pills in flight.
   3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-
   fatigue management tool.
   3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests
   with the home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than
   squadron commander), and with each individual aircrew member. During extended
   deployments, aircrew members will only obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight
   surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult with the home unit medical team prior to
   dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
   3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go
   medication with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available
   for mission planners, OG/CC, crew, and FS on the HQ AMC/A3V website.
   3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command)
   counter fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS
   will advise/assist the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by
   duty day length, departure and arrival times, and other mission timelines.
   3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP
   notification procedures if prescribed no-go pills.
   3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of
   the following categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go
   medications):
       3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
       3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, climate
       controlled, and darkened).
       3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
26                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour
        flight time duration.
        3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
     3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours
     of consuming no-go pills (consider DNIF). EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12-
     hour timeline after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short
     duration effect [6 hours for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case
     will crewmembers consume a no-go pill on a timeline where they would be under the effect
     of the medication while they perform aircrew duties (use mission report or legal for alert time
     to determine latest time to take no-go medication).
     3.9.9. Aircrew member‘s responsibilities:
        3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight
        surgeon clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
        3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within the DNIF periods for each
        of the no-go pills as specified in paragraph 3.9.8 of this instruction.
        3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming
        alcohol.
        3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional
        supplements and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate
        potential interactions.
        3.9.9.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no
        more than 20 days in a 60-day period.
        3.9.9.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28
        days in a 60-day period.
3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place
crewmembers in crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or
ground time as needed to meet mission tasking.
     3.10.1. Home Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew
     members off station 16 hours or more, unit commanders will enter primary and deadhead
     aircrew members into pre-departure crew rest at least 24 hours before the legal for alert time.
     Aircrew members may perform limited non-flying duties like mission planning during the
     first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may waive any portion of the first 12
     hours of pre-departure crew rest. Do not manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers
     to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION: AFRC, ANG and AETC in accordance with
     AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
     3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours
     before legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting.
        3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents
        shall not disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew
        members‘ crew rest period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew
        rest period after they complete official duties.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             27


     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-
     flight duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-
     load, aircrew arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners shall provide aircrews at least
  16 hours ground time between engine shutdown and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Missions planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify normal ground time as
     follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time
         the aircrew entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time
         to complete mission planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related
         duties. C2 agents will not ask PICs to accept less than 16 hours ground time.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground
     times longer than 16 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the
     cumulative effects of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to
     transiting several time zones. If practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours
     (maximum) after three consecutive near maximum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-
  flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and
  report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and
  are normally used during de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve PIC requests
  to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when
  mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the
  reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR). SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to
  home base sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to
  personal needs. PMCR begins upon mission termination. (N/A to AFRC and ANG).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that kept an aircrew off station 16 hours or more, the SQ/CC shall
     provide 1 hour (up to 96 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter aircrew
     members in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
     3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may
     suspend PMCR during contingency operations.
     3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
  3.10.6. Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the
  deployed FCC or MEP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with
  en route/transient maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief
  can safely perform aircraft maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the FCC has sufficient
  time in each 24-hour period to get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101, Aerospace
  Equipment Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
28                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest
     criteria in the Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN)
     or Concept of Operations (CONOPs).
     3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft
     parking ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive
     accurate aircrew/mission information in a timely manner.
        3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on
        the departing aircrew‘s orders to a POC for the next crew rest location‘s Prime Knight
        function.
        3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a
        C2 agent has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight
        POC. If departing from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew
        rest location Prime Knight POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
        3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders
        clearly indicate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in
        advance. Without a unit fund site on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance
        reservations using a government travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.
3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the
PIC and when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of AE crews. Whenever possible,
C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected patient up load time, and other
pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
     3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+l5 hours before scheduled takeoff time (allows 1
     hour for reporting and 2+l5 hours for mission preparation). Individual locations may
     increase or decrease this time depending on specific capabilities. OG/CCs may establish
     self-alert procedures for local training missions.
        3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an
        alert time that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC
        may also accept alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all
        cases, the PIC shall coordinate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2
        agency.
        3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and TO 1C-
        130J-9 section VI cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2 hours before normal
        alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the
        loadmaster before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster more than 1 hour
        before beginning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the loadmaster‘s show time.
        3.11.1.3. C2 agents shall not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there
        is reasonable assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the
        aircrew time to pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
        3.11.1.4. C2 agents shall not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-
        3 status until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the
        aircraft will be repaired within the target ground time.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  29


       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews may self-alert with C2 (618 TACC for AMC and AMC-
       gained missions) concurrence prior to entering crew rest. The PIC must coordinate (618
       TACC approval required for AMC and AMC-gained missions) the self-alert time before
       entering crew rest.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew's initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2
       agent, or PIC during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected
       alert time. The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or
       12 hours when flying in deadhead status. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC
       to accept more than the 6 hour window. ANG/ AFRC aircrew members may extend the
       window as necessary to deadhead to home station to meet the Firm Scheduled Return
       Time (FSRT).
       3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting
       during the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time,
       the C2 agent will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12 hours
       from the time of notification.
       3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if the mission risk becomes elevated
       and the PIC determines the overall risk of the mission prohibits safe continuation, he/she
       will contact the C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
3.12. Stage Management.
   3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert
   aircrews using the following priority/hierarchy:
       3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
       3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their FSRTs.
       3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
       3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a
       mission delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
   3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or
   aborted mission will not resume before that aircrew‘s FDP expires. Aircrews in a
   mechanical stage will be first out when a mission in the same direction transits their location
   while they are legal for alert. A C2 agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to
   complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a mechanical stage. C2 agents should not
   normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC crews flying unit-equipped
   aircraft.
3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not
later than 18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows 6 hours for aircraft pre-flight duty
prior to crewmembers entering 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are
unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour
crew rest and follow aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5. to prepare the aircraft for
launch.     SQ/CC may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours.
30                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period for contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or
re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs may provide additional local
procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
     3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC
     shall posture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour
     after alert. The following procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft
     generated for ALFA alerts. A maintenance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be
     completed. Preflight validity will be in accordance with applicable T.O. After the preflight,
     the PIC will notify the controlling agency. The aircraft will remain in a sealed posture and be
     referred to as ―cocked on alert‖. Documentation of when the aircraft was cocked on alert
     must be placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before entering crew
     rest. Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. Close and lock the crew
     entrance door with a lock or other controllable device, which will prevent entry without
     damage to the door or lock. The aircrew preflight portion remains valid if performed by one
     crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew. Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a
     standard procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case basis. The PIC or a
     designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required. Ensure
     C2 agent is notified when uncocking and recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights
     done during normal waking hours do not interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2
     agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while performing pre-flight (begin
     CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
     3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or
     aircrew in BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours after alert. Follow-on
     pre-flights, if required, interrupt crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty.
     3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a
     CHARLIE Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be
     legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE
     status up to 72 hours. After 72 hours, release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter
     them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission, training mission, or subsequent standby
     force duty.
     3.13.4. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a
     12 hour pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be
     able to launch within 3+15 hours. After 12 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12
     hour crew rest period before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
     3.13.5. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be
     dispatched on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start
     of pre-departure crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the
     post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time.
     3.13.6. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following
     standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
        3.13.6.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is
        computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                31


       3.13.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
       authorized.
3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DOD                   4515.13-R,    Air
Transportation, AFI 11-401, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs (AW/CC for ANG and
AFRC/AD interfly) or equivalent to permit the exchange or substitution of aircrew members
and/or aircraft between mobility units to accomplish flying missions. Normally, interfly should
be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances. However, it may be used
for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to another model design series (MDS).
Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by the lead command or as specified in the
OPLAN or CONOPS. EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
Conduct interfly operations as follows:
   3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the Mission Design Series (MDS)
   (aircraft and model), as well as unique systems or configuration required to fly the
   aircraft/mission. EXCEPTION: Non-current/unqualified aircrew members under the direct
   supervision of an instructor may participate in interfly operations.
   3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead
   command for the MDS. The MC or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.
   3.15.3. Each affected OG/CC who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must concur
   with interfly proposal.
   3.15.4. MDS conversion training.
       3.15.4.1. Units may request interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs
       will forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include
       as a minimum a list of affected units, duration of agreement, and purpose.
3.16. Not Used.
3.17. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). Procedures and policies regarding MEP, to include
Additional Crewmembers are contained in AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM specific publications (i.e.
AMCI 11-208). PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are properly authorized.
3.18. Mobility Mission Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives
may establish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility
mission familiarization. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.

                                           Chapter 4

                         AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a
component/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall
suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the
discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document; include the following maintenance identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft
status:
     4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
     component essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion as ME.
     4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem
     component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These
     discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or
     mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a
     MC discrepancy.
     4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely
     impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally
     cleared at home station.
4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL sets forth command policy regarding
equipment/systems necessary to continue or complete missions after the aircraft is released from
the responsible maintenance organization. Equipment/systems not listed in Table 4.1 through
Table 4.21 shall be considered required for flight without exception. This list cannot anticipate
all combinations of failures and contingencies, and is not intended for continued operations, over
an indefinite period, with failed or degraded equipment/systems.
     4.2.1. PIC Responsibility. PICs must account for the possibility of additional failures when
     accepting aircraft with inoperative equipment/systems. A PIC who accepts an aircraft with
     failed or degraded equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the
     same failures/degradations. PICs are not committed to operations with failed or degraded
     equipment accepted by another PIC.
     4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission
     requirements/directives.
     4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a
     waiver through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2)
     individual crew member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the
     governing directive of waiver request to include volume, chapter, and paragraph. Initiate
     waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at least a 1-hour waiver process time.
     4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission
     requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements,
     etc.) with the controlling C2 agency and/or flight managers.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   33


   4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or
   aircraft from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC
   may deviate according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through
   channels to MAJCOM/A3/DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background
   information and submit a follow-up written report upon request.
4.3. Waiver Authority. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-
case basis. The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical
level of command. MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority
   for active duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes
   Operational Readiness Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For
   AMC-directed missions contact HQ AMC/A3V through 618 TACC. Send info copies to
   Owning Command, i.e., if it is an AFRC crew send a copy to HQ AFRC A3V.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not
   specified in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority
   for ANG or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight
   Manual, Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify
   the appropriate waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response
   time.
4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance
from their home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.
4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers.
   4.5.1. Installed - Number of components or systems installed.
       4.5.1.1. In some cases, a component can be controlled from either a conventional (hard)
       panel or from a Communication Navigation Identification Management Unit (CNI-MU)
       display (soft panel). Similarly, some indications can be viewed on either a hard panel or a
       soft panel. Since switch functions (or indications) may be duplicated on each of the three
       CNI-MU displays, the number of switches (or indications) installed may not always be
       clear. To clarify this condition, switches (or indications) are listed as ‗1‗ in the installed
       column even when they are duplicated on a soft panel.
       4.5.1.2. Although the indications on each pilot‘s Heads Down Displays (HDDs) can be
       repeated on more than one HDD, repetitions of data in excess of one per pilot are not
       relevant for flight and are not counted in this MEL. In general, the flight deck is designed
       to provide one set of data for each (in addition to the standby instruments). Thus, for most
       HDD indications, the ―number installed‖ is listed as ―2‖, one for each pilot.
   4.5.2. Required - The minimum number (quantity) of items required for operation provided
   the conditions specified in the remarks or exception column are met.
34                                                         AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        4.5.2.1. Unless otherwise noted, when the item is a switch (or indication) which is
        duplicated on a soft panel, the number required for dispatch may be satisfied by either the
        hard panel switch (or indication) or by the switch/indication on one of the associated soft
        panels. For HDD indications, the ‗number required‗ is ‗2‗ if both pilots must have an
        indication, ‗1‗ if only one pilot must have an indication and ‗0‗ if neither pilot is required
        to have the indication.
     4.5.3. Remarks and Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are contained
     in this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight manual and
     other directives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
4.6. Navigation Systems. Chapter 11 lists authorized airspace and procedures for the C-130J.
Equipment listed in FLIP for compliance with appropriate airspace is mandatory. Loss of any
component before airspace entry requires return to a station with maintenance capability or re-
filing via routes permitting operation with degraded equipment.
4.7. Soft Panel Operations.
     4.7.1. For partial or complete hard panel failures, aircrews may revert to soft panel
     operations. Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be used
     for the remainder of the flight. Doing so will mitigate the hazards associated with restoring
     hard panel functionality for an item when the mission computer commanded-state is
     unknown. Accomplishing the ENGINE SHUTDOWN and BEFORE LEAVING AIRPLANE
     checklists after the aircraft is parked will ensure the soft panel retains control of the particular
     item throughout shutdown. In all cases, PICs must consider the increased workload
     associated with using soft panels.
     4.7.2. Hard panel failures may be the result of a physical failure or loss of communication
     with the mission computer (MC), an aircraft ―reboot‖ may recover hard panel functionality.
     To determine if hard panel functionality can be regained, the following procedures must be
     followed in sequential order:
        4.7.2.1. Completely power down when accomplishing the BEFORE LEAVING
        AIRPLANE checklist.
        4.7.2.2. Complete all checklist items in the POWER UP checklist. Do not proceed past
        the POWER UP checklist until it can be determined if the hard panel has recovered.
        Depending on the system effected (such as APU, bleed air, landing gear, etc.), do not
        apply bleed air or hydraulics until hard panel functionality can be determined.
        4.7.2.3. To determine if a hard panel has recovered, ensure hard panel and soft panel
        selections/settings are identical. Press the line select key (LSK) to turn the soft panel
        OFF. If a CNI ―CHK HARD PNL‖ or a referenced hard panel fault ACAWS message
        (i.e., ―APU PNL FAULT‖, ―DEF SYS PNL FAULT‖, etc.) does not appear, press the
        ―VERIFY OFF‖ LSK. If feasible, check hard panel functionality.
        4.7.2.4. If a CNI ―CHK HARD PNL‖ or a referenced hard panel fault ACAWS message
        appears, the hard panel has not recovered. The ―CHK HARD PNL‖ message indicates
        there is a mismatch between the soft panel and hard panel commands to the Mission
        Computer (MC) independent of physical switch positions. Referenced hard panel fault
        messages are self-explanatory.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 35


       4.7.2.5. If it is determined that the hard panel has not recovered, at the PIC‘s discretion,
       the mission may continue to a station supporting a repair capability, including en route
       stops. Do not reselect the hard panel. If a flight must continue under the control of two
       or more soft panels, a waiver is required.
    4.7.3. After returning to home station or repair facility with a hard panel malfunction,
    aircrews will shut down and turn the aircraft over to logistics personnel for required
    maintenance actions.

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished.
Momentary hesitations for coordination items, ATC interruptions, and deviations specified in the
flight manual, etc. are authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be
added to the checklists (in pencil). Currency of notes is a crewmember‘s responsibility.
Checklist pages may be carried in separate binders provided checklist integrity is not
compromised.
   5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts
   IAW AFI 11-215. The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in
   an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall approve local in-flight
   guides and inserts not affecting T.O. guidance and procedures.
5.2. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seat during critical phases of flight. One of the
pilots may be out of their seat during a non-critical phase of flight for brief periods to meet
physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot
occupying a primary duty station during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be
awake and alert). Notify the PIC prior to departing assigned primary duty station.
   5.2.1. Augmented Crew Station. The PIC may allow individuals to occupy the augmented
   crew station as long as their presence will not hinder the performance of the crew. Qualified
   crewmembers, or unqualified crewmembers under the supervision of an instructor, may
   perform tasks assigned by the PIC.
5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight
station during all phases of flight. The total number of persons permitted in the flight station is
limited to the number of seats with operable seat belts and a sufficient oxygen source. At no
time should this exceed six (unless otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to this AFI).
Passengers and observers will not be permitted access to either pilot position.
5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander, or above, will occupy either the left
or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code) is not required to
occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
   5.4.1. An AC or IP will make all takeoffs and landings during:
       5.4.1.1. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
       5.4.1.2. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
   5.4.2. PICs with less than 100 PAA hours since AC certification. If the pilot in the other
   seat is not an AC or above, a new AC will make all takeoffs and landings under any of the
   following conditions:
       5.4.2.1. Ceiling/visibility less than 300 feet and/or RVR 40 (3/4 SM visibility).
       5.4.2.2. RCR less than 12.
       5.4.2.3. Crosswind component greater than 15 knots.
60                                                        AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     5.4.3. Maximum Effort Takeoff/Landing Policy. Only instructor pilots or a pilot under the
     direct supervision of an instructor pilot may conduct maximum effort or substandard airfield
     operations from the right seat.
5.5. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command. The right seat pilot will
operate the landing gear and the PM will operate the flaps.
5.6. Outside Observer/ACM Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during
taxi operations, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL as crew duties permit.
5.7. Seat Belts.
     5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Crewmembers will have
     seat belts fastened when occupying a duty position, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
     5.7.2. Loadmasters, or authorized scanners, will only use the permanently installed paratroop
     door seats during combat or contingency missions with hostilities, or while participating in
     training missions that enable aircrews to improve their visual threat scanning techniques and
     procedures. Loadmasters will always have an assigned seat, even if using the paratroop door
     for scanning. When scanning duties are completed the loadmaster must use their assigned
     seat for subsequent take-offs and landings in non-threat environments. When used in
     combat/contingencies, the following conditions must be met:
        5.7.2.1. The flight helmet will be worn.
        5.7.2.2. Paratroop door armor will be in place.
        5.7.2.3. Loadmasters/scanners will restrain themselves by either the primary or
        secondary method:
            5.7.2.3.1. Use the restraint harness depicted in T.O. 13A1-1-1 as the primary means
            of loadmaster/scanner restraint. Route the harness straps through the support braces
            forward and aft of the paratroop doors with a girth hitch and attach to the restraint
            harness riser quick disconnect fittings. Ensure the leg and chest straps are connected.
            Attach the harness lifeline to a floor/Enhanced Cargo Handling System (ECHS) rail
            tiedown ring and adjust to limit vertical movement.
            5.7.2.3.2. A secondary method is the use of 5000 pound straps routed around each of
            the supports located forward and aft of the paratroop door. Attach the hook end of
            the strap to the riser clip of the restraint harness and attach the ratchet end to a
            tiedown ring on top of the ECHS rails. Wrap the hook of the ratchet with cloth
            backed tape to ensure it does not separate from the tiedown ring. Attach the lifeline
            to a floor/ECHS tiedown ring and adjust to limit vertical movement.
     5.7.3. All crewmembers will have seat belts fastened during takeoff and landing. Fasten
     shoulder harness unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Crewmembers performing instructor
     or flight examiner duties or are in upgrade training to instructor or flight examiner are
     exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary crew position; however, they
     will have a seat available with an operable seat belt.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               61


   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, may remain secured on litters for takeoff and
   landing.
5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations Movement on
the Ground, and applicable T.O.s.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting. Follow the exterior lighting guide in AFTTP 3-3.C-130J for all NVG
   training situations. Lights-out operations during peacetime will be conducted IAW AFI 11-
   202V3.
       5.8.1.1. Total lights out operations are authorized with concurrence of the controlling
       agency in restricted airspace and warning areas.
   5.8.2. Cargo compartment lighting will be dictated by the tactical situation and will be
   coordinated between the mission commander/PIC and loadmaster(s). Cargo compartment
   emergencies may require overt lighting on full bright. The nature of the emergency and the
   tactical situation will dictate what level of lights are used, and whether the loadmaster
   continues the use of NVGs.
   5.8.3. Strobe Lights. For tactical operations refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130J. For non-tactical
   operations, the aircraft strobe lights will be operated as follows:
       5.8.3.1. ―Before Starting Engines‖ Checklist. Set the top strobe to RED. NOTE: When
       operating the APU, set the top strobe to RED.
       5.8.3.2. ―Lineup‖ Checklist. Set both strobes to WHT for day and night single-ship and
       day formation. Set both strobes to RED for night formation.
       5.8.3.3. ―After Landing‖ Checklist. Set the top strobe to RED. The top strobe shall
       remain in RED until APU shutdown.
5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food
   preparation equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA, or
   radio systems.
   5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
   or personal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard
   class 1 explosive cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones and laptop
   computers/PDAs with wireless capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure
   passengers comply with this restriction. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as
   PFPS laptops, handheld (HH) GPS, and PDAs with infrared transmitters.
   5.9.3. The following handheld (HH) GPS units meet the requirements of AFI 11-202
   Volume 3 and may be used with approved laptop computers in flight: Bendix King KLX100
   and Garmin GPS 35-USB.
       5.9.3.1. The use of HH GPS for moving map display (MMD) is designed as a situational
       awareness tool and its use is voluntary.
5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force
aircraft.
62                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


5.11. Advisory Calls. The PF will announce changes to the level of automation, flight director
and autopilot mode selections, and mode transitions, (e.g. ―Autopilot engaged ‖, ―Altitude Hold‖,
―Autothrottles‖, ―Nav-Capture‖, etc.) and/or when circumstances require deviating from normal
procedures. The PM will make all advisory calls except those designated for other crewmembers.
Mandatory calls are as follows:
     5.11.1. Takeoff. State ―V-ONE‖ at V1 (Refusal Speed). State ―ROTATE‖ at VR (Rotation
     Speed). If V1 is adjusted to = VR, state, ―ROTATE‖ at VR.
     5.11.2. Takeoff Aborts and Landings. The PM will advise the PF which power levers to
     bring to reverse (―All 4‖, ―Inboards‖, ―Outboards‖).
     5.11.3. Deviations. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of heading (+/- 10 degrees),
     airspeed (+/-10 kts), or altitude (+/- 100 feet), and no attempt is being made to correct the
     deviation will immediately notify the PF.
     5.11.4. Any crewmember seeing a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately
     notify the PF.
     5.11.5. Advisory calls: Refer to Table 5.1 through Table 5.4 for a listing of mandatory
     advisory calls, responses, and aircrew actions.

 NOTES:
 (1) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
 environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go
 around will be made.
 (2) With weather at CAT I minimums on a CAT I ILS, the pilot may not see the runway
 environment at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights may be visible. The
 pilot may continue to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights only. The pilot may not
 descend below 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as
 reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and
 identifiable.
 (3) The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue (CAT I), or go-around.
 Respond with the intention to land if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight
 throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
 (4) If the pilot flying has stated ―landing‖ then this call is not required.
 (5) Refer to stabilized approach criteria in paragraph 5.12.
 (6) For Category II (CAT II) approaches crosscheck offside Radar Altimeter if not
 accomplished previously on approach (i.e. 1000 AGL).


5.12. Stabilized Approach Philosophy. Unstable approaches are primary contributors to
numerous military and civilian mishaps. Stabilized approaches are essential for the safe
operation of aircraft and are mandatory. This criteria defines specific parameters that mitigate
64                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


the risk during this critical phase of flight. This philosophy requires aircrew to take immediate
corrective actions to stabilize the approach when outside designated parameters.
     5.12.1. The following criteria applies to all non-tactical approaches:
        5.12.1.1. At 1000 feet AGL (IMC):
            5.12.1.1.1. Airspeed is -10/+20 knots of computed approach speed for aircraft
            configuration.
            5.12.1.1.2. Aircraft is in a landing configuration.
            5.12.1.1.3. Sink rate is no greater than 1500 FPM.
            5.12.1.1.4. All briefings and checklists are complete.
            5.12.1.1.5. If these criteria are not met by 1000 feet AGL (IMC), the PM will
            announce the deviation.
        5.12.1.2. At 500 feet AGL (IMC/VMC):
            5.12.1.2.1. Airspeed is -10/+10 knots of computed approach speed for aircraft
            configuration.
            5.12.1.2.2. Aircraft is in a landing configuration.
            5.12.1.2.3. Sink rate is no greater 1000 FPM.
            5.12.1.2.4. All briefings and checklists are complete.
            5.12.1.2.5. If these criteria are not met by 500 feet AGL for all non-tactical
            approaches, the PM will announce "Unstable, go around." The PF will execute a
            missed approach.
     5.12.2. Tactical Approaches/VFR Patterns. Stabilized approach criteria for tactical
     approaches/VFR patterns is recommended and desired. However, it is recognized that this
     criteria is not always valid due to the type of approach being conducted. In this situation, the
     PF is required to brief the maneuver parameters prior to execution.
5.13. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to
aircrews regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to
maintain a high degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
     5.13.1. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor VOX and interphone
     during all phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the PF before checking off interphone.
     Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset or within listening distance are cleared prior
     to discussing classified information over interphone.
     5.13.2. Radios:
        5.13.2.1. The PM normally makes all ATC radio calls.
        5.13.2.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the primary ATC
        radio unless directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2
        frequencies on the inbound and outbound legs.
        5.13.2.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and
        update the crew when the primary radio changes.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 65


      5.13.2.4. One pilot should record and read back all ATC clearances.
      5.13.2.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the
      maximum extent possible.
      5.13.2.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of
      unauthorized frequencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
5.14. Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   5.14.1. ―Time Out" is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use
   of "Time Out" will:
      5.14.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
      5.14.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
      5.14.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
      established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable
      with the developing conditions.
   5.14.2. As soon as possible after a "Time Out" has been called, the aircrew will take the
   following actions:
      5.14.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft and ensure terrain clearance.
      5.14.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice their concerns to the crew.
      5.14.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice
      inputs relative to the stated concerns.
      5.14.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the
      current course of action or direct a new course of action.
   5.14.3. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
   mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000
   feet MSL.
   5.14.4. Fuel Panel. The fuel panel is considered a ―verification panel.‖ The PM/LM should
   advise the PF before operating the panel (i.e., priming, cross-feeding, tank-to-engine,
   transferring, non-standard configurations, and dumping). After completing the task, the
   PF/PM should verify the panel is set correctly. To facilitate this coordination, pilots should
   plan to make changes to the fuel panel during periods of low workload such as before taxi
   and during cruise segments.
   5.14.5. Critical Action Coordination.
      5.14.5.1. Flight critical/irreversible actions should always be confirmed by two crew
      members. These actions include, but are not limited to, pulling the engine fire handle,
      placing the engine start switch to stop, moving a propeller control switch to feather,
      discharging agent, and dumping fuel. The crew member performing the action points to
      the affected switch/handle and verbally seeks confirmation from a second crew member
      (i.e. ―CONFIRM NUMBER ONE‖). The crew member confirming the action looks at the
      affected switch/handle and acknowledges (i.e. ―NUMBER ONE CONFIRMED‖).
66                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        5.14.5.2. Once the fire handle is pulled, the ACAWS messages indicating the shutdown
        condition/situation may disappear. Verifying and verbally confirming associated
        ACAWS messages prior to engine shutdown will assist the aircrew determine if the
        engine can be restarted if a greater emergency arises.
5.15. Automation. The purpose of the automation is to assist the flight crew with mission
accomplishment. Aircraft automation will not command crew actions. The automated systems
will recommend/perform actions and the crew will determine/verify the proper course of action.
     5.15.1. Crewmembers will understand the operation and limitations of automation and be
     proficient at operating the aircraft in all levels of automation. The level of automation used at
     any specific time should be the most appropriate to reduce crew workload, increase
     situational awareness, and enhance mission effectiveness and safety. The PF will determine
     the most desirable level of automation for a given situation. The AC has the ultimate
     responsibility and authority for the safety of the aircraft, passengers, and crew and will
     manage workload, set priorities and employ the available resources accordingly. As flight
     situations change, do not feel locked into a level of automation.
     5.15.2. If the AFCS/Flight Director provides unexpected commands to the flight controls,
     the PF will revert to lower levels of automation or manual flight as necessary before
     attempting to resolve system problems.
     5.15.3. Crews will follow the guidance below, except for cruise flight (above 10,000 ft):
        5.15.3.1. The PF will fly the aircraft and maintain a dedicated head-up lookout. If the PF
        intends to be head-down, aircraft control shall be transferred to the PM, who will remain
        head-up. Head-down time does not include momentary scanning of the CNI-MU, HDDs,
        and panels.
        5.15.3.2. Any crewmember that observes both pilots head-down at the same time shall
        alert the PF without delay.
        5.15.3.3. If the PM must divert attention away from normal clearing and monitoring
        duties for an extended period of time, the PM will state ―head-down.‖ The PF will
        verbally acknowledge this call. The PM will verbalize ―head-up‖ after completion of
        duties. The PF will then update the PM on current status as required.
     5.15.4. The importance of entering the proper data into the system is elevated with
     automated flight. Historical data has indicated a significant decrease in the level of safe
     operations due to pilots becoming complacent and overly reliant on automated systems.
        5.15.4.1. A closed loop system of entering data and verifying the correct data is entered
        before allowing the aircraft automation to perform a function is critically important.
        Regardless of who initiates the action, the other pilot must verify the data and both pilots
        will monitor the aircraft for the appropriate response.
        5.15.4.2. Table 5. 5 and Table 5.6 provide standard actions for both pilots during
        Automated and Manual flight.
        5.15.4.3. Automated Flight is defined as the autopilot fully engaged and coupled to the
        Flight director. Use autothrottles as desired. (CAUTION: If the autothrottles are
        disengaged for sustained descents during automatic flight, it is possible that Altitude
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                          67


       Capture may occur with the power levers at or near Flight Idle and result in an approach
       to stall condition.).
       5.15.4.4. Manual Flight is defined as the PF providing manual input to the flight controls
       or autopilot. Use autothrottles as desired.

NOTES:
1. For arrival/approach planning, the PF may transfer aircraft control to the PM and set all
reference settings as required for the planned approach.
2. The PF may direct the PM to select desired modes. In this case, the PM will make the
necessary announcements and the PF will verify and acknowledge.


5.16. Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS) / Terrain Awareness and Warning
System (TAWS).
     5.16.1. When a GCAS TERRAIN or TAWS TERRAIN / OBSTACLE AHEAD alert occurs
     and terrain/obstacle clearance cannot be assured visually, immediately change the flight path
     (within 3 to 5 seconds) by initiating a takeoff power climb. Continue the climb until a safe
     altitude is reached or until exiting the alert envelope. With terrain and obstacles clearly in
     sight, the PF will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions and visually remain clear of
     terrain/obstacles. If the situation degrades and a GCAS PULL UP or TAWS TERRAIN /
     OBSTACLE PULL UP alert occurs, immediately execute the Wind Shear/GCAS/TAWS
     alert recovery in the flight manual. WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the
     low altitude warning.
     5.16.2. In TACTICAL mode, several GCAS alert envelopes are modified to allow for
     maneuvering in close proximity to terrain. Normally, this mode is most suitable for modified
     contour flight and VFR low-altitude arrivals but, at the AC‘s discretion, may be used for any
     tactical operation.
5.17. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow
resolution advisories (RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow
the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. Pilots who deviate from an
ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and
promptly return to the ATC clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new
clearance.
     5.17.1. Mission requirements may allow selection of ―TA only‖ when operating from
     parallel runways, in the visual traffic pattern, or in formation since the proximity to aircraft
     may result in unwarranted RAs. Excessive climb and descent rates could lead to inadvertent
     ―TA/RA‖. Reducing climb/descent rates near level off can limit inadvertent TCAS
     advisories.
5.18. Radar Altimeter.
     5.18.1. Instrument Approaches.
        5.18.1.1. Precision Approaches.
            5.18.1.1.1. Set RADALT reference to HAT minus 50 feet.
            5.18.1.1.2. CAT II ILS. Set published RA minimums.
        5.18.1.2. Non-Precision Approaches. Setting the RADALT as prescribed below is meant
        to adequately alert the crew to an unsafe terrain clearance condition (―Altitude-Altitude‖)
        in the absence of a ―Minimums-Minimums‖ alert. Setting the RAD ALT to a higher
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               69


      setting than prescribed may result in premature/unexpected ―Altitude-Altitude‖ advisories
      and prevent the GCAS ―Minimums‖ alert.
          5.18.1.2.1. Straight-In Approaches. Normally set RAD ALT reference to 250 feet
          (minimum setting).
          5.18.1.2.2. Circling Approaches. Normally set RAD ALT reference to 300 feet
          (minimum setting).
      5.18.1.3. When established on a published approach in IMC, or at night when terrain
      clearance cannot be assured, and an ―Altitude-Altitude‖ special alert is heard, initiate an
      immediate go-around. Once terrain clearance is confirmed, resume normal operations.
      In day VMC, the aircrew will evaluate the alert and determine the appropriate course of
      action (continue the approach or go-around).
   5.18.2. Tactical Operations. For modified contour flight, the RADALT should be set no
   lower than 80% of the planned contour (i.e. for 500 AGL contours, set the RADALT no
   lower than 400 feet). Other settings may be briefed and used based on terrain and mission
   needs.
5.19. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the
sponsor‘s permanent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally
prohibited, but may be moved according to DOD 4515.13R.
5.20. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic
beverages.
5.21. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements:
   5.21.1. Minimum Runway and Taxiway Requirements. For peace-time do not use runways
   less than 3,000 feet. Minimum runway width is 80 feet (60 feet for max effort). Minimum
   taxiway width is 30 feet. The MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive runway/taxiway width
   requirements.
   5.21.2. Normal Operations.
      5.21.2.1. The minimum runway required for a normal takeoff is the charted CFL.
      5.21.2.2. Normal takeoffs shall not be made when Refusal Speed is less than Ground
      Minimum Control Speed (Vmcg). In this condition the PIC will either:
          5.21.2.2.1. Download cargo or fuel.
          5.21.2.2.2. Wait until weather conditions improve.
          5.21.2.2.3. Utilize maximum effort procedures, see paragraph 5.21.6.
      5.21.2.3. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs will
      be initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.
      Intersection takeoffs may be made at the discretion of the AC provided the operating
      environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows for a
      safe takeoff and departure. CNI TOLD computations must be based on the runway
      remaining.
70                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        5.21.2.4. The minimum runway required for normal landings is the charted landing
        distance over 50 foot obstacle with outboard engines in high speed ground idle and
        inboard engines in max reverse.
        5.21.2.5. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available, stressed, and
        authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for
        takeoff. Departure end overruns (if stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing
        if needed.
        5.21.2.6. Acceleration Check Time. An acceleration check time is required when refusal
        speed is less than rotation speed. An Acceleration Time Check should also be computed
        when, in the opinion of the AC, a critical condition exists (heavy GW, high PA,
        obstacles, RSC, etc.).
     5.21.3. Arresting Cables.
        5.21.3.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include
        recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower
        to have the cable inspected.
        5.21.3.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
        slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automatic terminal information service
        (ATIS), or ATC.
        5.21.3.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems are installed,
        with an eight point cable tie-down system, without regard to the Dash-One Caution.
        When operating from runways equipped with other types of systems, or if it is unknown
        if the BAK-12 system includes eight point tiedowns, aircrews should recognize the
        increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
     5.21.4. Other Airfield Requirements.
        5.21.4.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability
        guidance. Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield
        suitability based upon operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed
        in the ASRR.
        5.21.4.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A3AS for all questions
        pertaining to airfield weight bearing capability and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR
        before all off-station operations. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions
        in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR, unless specifically delegated in AFI 11-2MDS
        Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests
        to HQ AMC/A3AS for operational missions. HQ AMC A3V is the OPR for waivers to
        airfield restrictions. Route requests through MAJCOM Stan/Eval. MAJCOM/A3/DO is
        the waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver
        compliance. Crews that have access to the World Wide Web will review airfield
        suitability in the airfield data base via the HQ AMC Aircrew Portal. Consult the ASRR
        for airfield certification requirements.
        5.21.4.3. A current landing zone (LZ) survey (within the past five years as specified in
        AFI 13-217) is needed before using other than hard-surfaced runways or taxiways.
     5.21.5. RCR and RSC Limitations.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  71


      5.21.5.1. When other than RCR or RSC is used to report the runway conditions, the PIC
      will refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) for standard ICAO conversions
      based on general runway condition; be conservative when dealing with unknown
      conditions (e.g., forward operating bases (FOBs), unpaved runways). Normally, RCR
      values are not reported for taxiways and ramps. During periods of reported low RCR, the
      taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. The
      runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective
      glare.
      5.21.5.2. The performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete
      runways. Use the RCR values given in Table 5.7 when landing on other than concrete
      surfaces. The RCR values Table 5.7 are estimates based on operational experience and
      should be used only as a guide.

      5.21.5.3. Limit operations on snow, slush and water covered runways to an RSC of 10.
      This equates to a covering of one inch of slush/water and up to three inches of loose,
      blowing snow. Performance data does not exist for coverings in excess of these amounts.
      5.21.5.4. On runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff computations will be
      based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of
      40 feet either side of centerline should be cleared (30 feet for maximum effort
      operations). If 40 feet either side of centerline is not cleared (30 feet for max effort ops),
      computations will be based on the non-cleared portion.
   5.21.6. Maximum Effort Operations.
      5.21.6.1. Use Maximum Effort procedures when conditions (runway dimensions and/or
      obstacles) or directives require their use. Runway widths less than 80 feet require a
      maximum effort qualified crew. All maximum effort operations must fall in the
      ―Recommended‖ area of the wind limitations charts unless otherwise approved by the
      OG/CC. For peace-time, do not use runways less than 3,000 feet long unless waived by
      the MAJCOM/A3/DO or designated representative.
      5.21.6.2. Maximum Effort Takeoff. Use maximum effort takeoff procedures if available
      runway length is less than CFL.
          5.21.6.2.1. Minimum runway length is the charted ADJUSTED MFLMETO.
          EXCEPTION: MAJCOM A3/DO may approve the use of MFLMETO not corrected
          for VMCA or VMU3 if mission necessity dictates.
72                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


            5.21.6.2.2. Minimum rotation speed is Adjusted Maximum Effort Rotation Speed
            (VRamax). EXCEPTION: MAJCOM A3/DO may approve the use of VRmax if mission
            necessity dictates.
            5.21.6.2.3. Acceleration Check Time. An acceleration check time is required when
            refusal speed is less than rotation speed.
        5.21.6.3. Maximum Effort Landing: Use maximum effort landing procedures whenever
        the runway available for landing is less than that required for a normal landing. Plan the
        touchdown within the first 500 feet of usable runway.
            5.21.6.3.1. The minimum runway required for a maximum effort landing is equal to
            the charted Maximum Effort landing ground roll plus 500 feet.
            5.21.6.3.2. Compute landing performance using: two outboard engines in ground
            idle, two inboard engines in reverse, (―2OB HGI; 2IB REV‖ in the Performance
            Manual), and maximum anti-skid braking.
5.22. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage
(FOD) Avoidance .
     5.22.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
     monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstruction. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
     obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and
     Movement on the Ground, aircraft may taxi into or out of a marked parking spot without
     marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to
     ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any permanent obstruction. Adjacent aircraft
     are considered a permanent obstruction provided the aircraft is parked properly in its
     designated spot and not moving. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are
     considered a permanent obstruction provided it is parked entirely within a designated area.
     Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp
     or another suitable means.
     5.22.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
     unavailable, the PIC will deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction
     clearance and provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned
     crewmembers, or a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to
     act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
     marshallers and wing walkers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Observers should
     be in a position to see wing walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate
     with the pilot.
     5.22.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD.
     Crews should:
        5.22.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout during mission planning. Be familiar with taxi
        routes, turn requirements, and areas for potential FOD.
        5.22.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
     5.22.4. Reverse Taxi: The PIC shall coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the
     loadmaster and marshaller (when available). Before reverse taxiing, the loadmaster shall:
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  73


      5.22.4.1. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
      5.22.4.2. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12-inches above
      horizontal.
      5.22.4.3. Position himself/herself on the aircraft ramp to direct reverse taxi, report any
      hazards, and to provide the PIC with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance
      remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
      5.22.4.4. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
      5.22.4.5. During night reverse taxi operations without NVGs, the PIC and loadmaster
      will ensure the taxi area is sufficiently lighted.
   5.22.5. After landing and clearing the runway, and with approval of the PIC, the loadmaster
   may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to horizontal to prepare for cargo off/onload
   provided equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secure in the cargo compartment. Careful
   attention must be given to the ramp position when taxiing on rough, or unprepared surfaces.
5.23. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
   5.23.1. Aircraft commanders should elect to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of
   flight dictates an immediate jettison (as determined by the PIC). Except in the case of an
   emergency, before jettisoning fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of
   intentions, altitude, and location. If available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas,
   except when safety of flight would be compromised.
   5.23.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency (618
   TACC, AOC/AMD, CAOC, etc.) may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational
   requirement dictates immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The
   tasking C2 agency may provide fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive,
   SPINS, etc.
   5.23.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent
   operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have
   been exhausted.
   5.23.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel
   jettisoning. Ideally, establish jettison areas at altitudes above 20,000 feet above ground level,
   off published airways, avoiding urban areas, agricultural regions, and water supply sources.
   Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis,
   and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
   5.23.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the PIC immediately
   after landing (AMC Form 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence
   Worksheet). Submit AMC Form 97 through unit OGV to MAJCOM Stan/Eval. Unit OGVs
   will retain AMC Form 97 for 6 months. Document all pertinent information, including the
   following items:
      5.23.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
      5.23.5.2. Actual Duration.
      5.23.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.

5.24. Aircraft Speed. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
5.25. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are
centralized unit efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a
consolidated course of action. As a minimum, unit commanders must implement the following
procedures:
     5.25.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
        5.25.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low - No operating restrictions.
        5.25.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate - Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed
        only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic
        pattern activity is prohibited.
        5.25.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe - All takeoffs and landings are prohibited.
        Waiver authority is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is
        required to operate at airfields not controlled by the MAF.
     5.25.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of
     migratory bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs,
     landings, and low-levels from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the
     Phase II period. Publish significant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR
     Supplement along with the associated airfield operating hour restrictions and avoidance
     instructions.
     5.25.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, a PIC has the authority
     to delay takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition after coordinating with the appropriate C2
     authority.
     5.25.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help
     minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ
     AFSC/SEF website contains BASH information including regionalized CONUS bird
     migration patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest
     news. The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) website is another source for real time
     bird hazard information. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC aircrew mission
     planning portal. See AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
     Management Techniques, for additional information.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 75


   5.25.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as conditions permit, or as
   practicable, to have the aircraft inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike
   damage cannot be accurately assessed in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a
   complex airborne emergency; only qualified maintenance personnel, on the ground, can
   make reliable damage assessments.
5.26. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). FCFs and
ACFs will be accomplished IAW T.O. 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance
Operational Checks, TO 1C-130J-6CF-1, Acceptance or Functional Check Flight Procedures,
and AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management. Crews should only perform
tasks or functions contained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to perform a non-
standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.26.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300 and AFI 21-101.
       5.26.1.1. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional
       guidance in local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial
       FCF to check only those systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or
       modification.
       5.26.1.2. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base
       from which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under
       specific conditions, not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
       5.26.1.3. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility
       of the MAJCOM/A3/DO.
       5.26.1.4. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF
       crewmembers. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to
       FCF aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. The OG/CC will determine
       FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that specific FCF flight.
       5.26.1.5. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under
       a combination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all
       systems are operating properly, the crew may proceed IFR through IMC to ―VFR on
       Top‖ for the altitude phase of the flight.
       5.26.1.6. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release
       the aircraft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating
       the FCF, and the original condition operationally checked good.
       5.26.1.7. Only FCF crews shall perform high-speed taxi checks. Perform checks IAW
       the flight manual and maintenance technical orders. Prepare the aircraft with minimum
       fuel necessary to accomplish the check to limit brake/tire wear, (ensure fuel on board will
       permit a safe return to base should the aircraft unexpectedly become airborne) and turn
       on the anti-skid system. The PIC will calculate takeoff data for the highest speed planned
       and ensure runway available allows sufficient stopping distance for existing conditions
       without exceeding normal brake energy limits.
5.27. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial
Events, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Aerial events must be sanctioned and
individually approved by the appropriate military authority, and with the Federal Aviation
76                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


Administration (FAA). AFI 11-209 and MAJCOM supplements identify events sanctioned for
support, and specifies the approval authority for each type.
5.28. Not Used.
5.29. Not Used.
5.30. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground
crews will accomplish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may
only accomplish recovery if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and
the PIC has coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities
through 618 TACC or appropriate C2 agency.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 77

   have applied for, but not yet received, a passport to act as crewmembers on missions not
   scheduled to transit locations where passports are required.
   6.2.2. Shot Record. Crewmembers must maintain worldwide shot requirements.
   6.2.3. Driver‘s License. A valid state driver's license is required on each TDY where use of
   US government general purpose vehicles may be required. Crewmembers will contact the
   local airfield manager before driving on the flight line.
   6.2.4. Identification Tags. Crewmembers will wear two identification tags around the neck
   or carry them in a flight suit pocket on all flights.
   6.2.5. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, or
   earrings in the aircraft or on the flight line. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers may wear plain
   elastic hair fasteners and/or pins, clips, or barrettes providing they do not interfere with the
   wearing of headsets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. They will be accounted for before
   and after flight.

     6.2.8. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on flight lines during hours of
     darkness or periods of reduced visibility.
     6.2.9. Tool and Airdrop Kits. At least one loadmaster‘s tool kit will be on board for all
     missions. One loadmaster airdrop kit will also be aboard the aircraft for aerial delivery
     missions. Units will identify tool kit contents and inventory procedures in local supplements.
     6.2.10. Night-Vision Operations. For night-vision operations, the aircraft commander
     should preflight and carry a spare set of NVGs onboard the aircraft. If a spare set is not
     carried, NVG operations should cease if either pilot‘s NVGs fail or visual acuity deteriorates.
     Each crewmember will preflight their own NVGs before flight and carry a spare set of
     batteries. Each crewmember will also carry an NVG-compatible light source.
6.3. Pre-mission Actions.
     6.3.1. Before transiting areas outside the CONUS, aircrews will review theater-specific
     information necessary to successfully operate there. The review, at a minimum, should
     include the items in AFI 11-202 Vol 3, AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and the following:
     6.3.2. Review tasking, itinerary, and altitude reservation (ALTRV) requirements.

6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements. Primary crew members will ensure the publications
specified in Table 6.1 are current and available on the aircraft for all missions. Units may
specify additional publications in their local supplement. The use of electronic flight manuals in
flight will be for reference purposes only (paper copies are always required). When the crew
includes two additional crewmembers in the same specialty (i.e. two loadmasters on airdrop
missions) each will carry a checklist but otherwise only one set of publications is required.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ
AMC/A3AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates
to airfield operability and weight bearing capability.
6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Aircrews will receive an intelligence briefing that will
emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and military development in the area in which
they will be flying. Obtain timely intelligence updates prior to entering a specific area of
operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a
forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereafter when significant developments
occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence office as soon
as practical to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs).

Section 6B— Pre-Departure

6.7. GDSS2 Account. Pilots will obtain an GDSS2 account prior to operating on IFM-planned
sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the GDSS2 account, at locations without an
AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure GDSS2 account passwords are active prior
to departing home station.
6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew
   duties, and update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and
   crewmember's initials. If an electronic sign-in system is used (i.e., PEX), then FCIF currency
   will be verified appropriately utilizing that system.

     6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an
     FCIF update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
     6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify
     FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file
     copy of the flight authorization or file copy of their crew orders. This applies to all
     crewmembers if the electronic sign in system is not working properly at alert time.
6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Group Standardization and Evaluation (OGV/AGV) is the
office of primary responsibility (OPR) for FCBs. Items in FCBs may include local procedures
and policies concerning equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications.

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
82                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm
     mission requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify
     special briefing requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare
     activities, SAFE PASSAGE, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance,
     hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking procedures, operations and safety supplements to flight
     manuals, and OPORD procedure.
     6.12.2. PIC Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing, including
     MAJCOM, NAF, and unit special interest items (SIIs). Brief crewmembers on the specific
     mission details if not previously accomplished. Use approved briefing guides; reference
     AFTTP 3-3.C-130J, Combat Mission Guide. For tactical missions, additional briefings may
     be required.
        6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted
        prior to the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission
        details for that day's sortie(s) and the ORM level for the mission. Complete this briefing
        prior to engine start.
        6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. For missions conducting NVG operations, crews
        will review and coordinate NVG failure procedures for all phases of the mission. Discuss
        actions for Smoke and Fumes in the aircraft. The PIC will consider crew experience,
        mission priority, and Intel, tactics and threat briefings in determining if the mission can
        be completed safely should NVGs fail.
     6.12.3. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and
     forecast for the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary
     crewmembers on appropriate weather conditions before departure.
        6.12.3.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided
        with the IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local
        takeoff weather data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will
        use 618 TACC weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)
        supporting the theater AOC/AMD) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and
        further updates.
        6.12.3.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather
        information from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at
        their location.
        6.12.3.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home
        weather flight, OWS, or 618 TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any
        means available prior to mission accomplishment.
        6.12.3.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
        FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
        6.12.3.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings
        are not required.
     6.12.4. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within, or adjacent to, an established
     buffer zone, the PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone
     procedures outlined in appropriate directives.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    83


   6.12.5. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with
   peacetime and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft.
   6.12.6. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided
   for IFM sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative,
   will contact the flight manager before signing the flight plan.
6.13. Call Signs.
   6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-
   digit suffix assigned by the parent unit.
   6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic
   clearance. If no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC
   missions, and no other call sign has been assigned, use the ―REACH‖ call sign followed by
   the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number
   (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH"
   followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft
   tail number.
   6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
   6.13.4. AE. For actual AE missions, use the call sign ―Evac" followed by the five-digit
   aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator. Refer to FLIP GP Chapter 4.
   When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call signs will be used. This does
   not alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call signs when required.
   6.13.5. Search and Rescue. On actual search, rescue, and recovery missions, use the call
   sign "Air Force Rescue" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.14. Instrument Flight Rules. Conduct flight operations under IFR to the maximum extent
possible without unacceptable mission degradation. This does not preclude VFR training to
maintain proficiency in mission essential VFR operations.
6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
   6.15.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance,
   navigation, and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer
   based plans are used, each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only
   MAJCOM validated CFPs.
       6.15.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually
       compute flight plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and
       diplomatic clearance compliance.
       6.15.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure.
       Pass any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed
       sorties, promptly notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the
       correct route of flight is filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to
       618 TACC/XOCZF if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in
       direction or 25 knots in speed.
   6.15.2. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by one or more of the
   following methods:
84                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        6.15.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP.
        6.15.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan.
        6.15.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDs.
     6.15.3. When conducting DZ/LZ operations, both pilots will verify CNI-MU CARP/LZ
     information with a valid DZ/LZ survey. Refer to AFI 13-217 for DZ/LZ survey
     information/requirements/applicability.
6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217, this chapter, and the
appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/VFR),
review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate,
NOTAMS, GDSS Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts. To verify CNI TOLD, both pilots
will cross-check CNI TOLD INIT entries and the PM will compare CNI TOLD outputs (if
required by flight manual) to the data obtained from the performance manual, tab data, or
MAJCOM approved Flight Performance Module (FPM). The minimum outputs that must be
checked and the allowable tolerances for those outputs are outlined in the performance manual.
     6.16.1. VFR Departures. NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle
     clearance planning.
        6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure
        method for the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure
        methods contained in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational
        requirements dictate (i.e. tactical necessity), or when most of the mission is planned as a
        VFR flight for training. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and
        high terrain are avoided.
        6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by
        ensuring all the following conditions are met:
           6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the
           departure route.
           6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or
           emergency return route provides obstacle avoidance. NOTE: If unable to comply
           with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until conditions that
           are more favorable exist.
        6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of
        CONUS.
        6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR
        clearance or reaching the IFR MEA.
     6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined
     in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
        6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR
        IAW paragraph 6.16.1 An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an
        instrument approach.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             85


     6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
     are avoided. Adhere to screen height (SH)/departure end of runway (DER) requirements
     for IFR departure planning (AFMAN 11-217V1).
        6.16.2.2.1. TOLD. Enter the required climb gradient, altitude(s), screen height, and
        obstruction distance. For an IFR departure, aircraft weight must be less than or equal
        to the calculated maximum aircraft weight for the type of three-engine departure
        listed (normal or 50-flap at obstacle clearance speed).
        6.16.2.2.2. Standard screen heights are listed below: NOTE: Screen height
        requirements for departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or the
        airfield where the departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for
        crews to determine screen height requirements. Therefore, when using departures
        other than those listed below, or when any doubt exists about which screen height to
        use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet (minimum) unless you can ascertain a different
        screen height requirement from an appropriate authority.
        6.16.2.2.3. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
        6.16.2.2.4. USAF/USN produced departure or USAF/USN/USMC airfield:                Zero
        feet.
        6.16.2.2.5. US Army, FAA departure, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet
        or as published.
        6.16.2.2.6. All others: 35 feet or as published.
     6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with
     all engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
     NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb
     gradient, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
     6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all
     obstacles along the planned departure route with OEI:
        6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape
        procedures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an
        engine and, where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve
        current      SDPs        from       the      Jeppesen       AFOpsdata        website:
        https://www.jeppesen.com/wlcs/commerce/login.jsp.           User name: afopsdata;
        password: jeppesen. ‗Ad hoc‘ requests for fields not currently listed may be
        requested through OGV NLT 48 hrs prior to scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A3V
        authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of 30 days after the analysis date.
        The SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner of the takeoff
        performance sheet.
        6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient
        is 200 ft/nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152
        ft/nm plus the required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not
        available, the crew must ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb
        gradients for the selected departure, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb
        gradients may be published as a ‗Trouble T‘ restriction in the IFR Take-off
86                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


              Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for mission accomplishment,
              crews may subtract 48‘/nm from published climb gradients before computing engine-
              out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low, close in
              obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200‘ AGL and below) which should normally be
              published as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews
              must also ensure the aircraft can clear these obstacles. NOTE: If the requirements of
              6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions
              exist.
6.17. Weather Minimums For Takeoff. Use Table 6.3 and AFI 11-202V3.

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums For Takeoff.
 MISSION         VIS      REMARKS

 Operational 1000         When less than RVR 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000, the
             RVR          crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the runway has
                          dual RVR readouts and displays (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and
                          runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below 1600
                          RVR, the crew must be fully qualified.
 All others      1600     For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR must read
                 RVR      1600 minimum on all.

 NOTE: If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to
 be 1/2 mile (800 meters). When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling or
 visibility) a takeoff alternate is required (See paragraph 6.19.)


6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3.
Choose alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be
within the same terminal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not
restricted by FLIP, FCG, or diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and
performance characteristics of the aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of
alternates; however, selection by support agencies normally should be used if they meet the
above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.
6.19. Departure Alternates.
     6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if weather is below landing minimums for the
     available approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use CAT II ILS minimums to
     determine if a departure alternate is required.
     6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the
     aircraft must be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude
     (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as
     a departure alternate, the airfield must meet one of the following conditions:
        6.19.2.1. For an alternate within 30 minutes flying time, the existing weather must be
        equal to or better than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1
        hour after takeoff, but in no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  87


       6.19.2.2. For an alternate within 2 hours flying time, the existing weather must be at least
       500-1 above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-
       2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain
       so for 1 hour after ETA at the alternate.
6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will
be according to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
       6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for the
       available DOD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NOAA) precision approach.
       6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than
       published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement
       (for example Jeppesen approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by
       taking the published HAA or HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or
       as determined by MAJCOM TERPs review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach
       with a published HAA of 642 feet would require a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
       6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected
       for RCR.
   6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination aerodrome is
   outside the CONUS. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not exceed 3-
   hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.
   6.20.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique
   geographic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time.
   The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
       6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA
       and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and.
       6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published
       minimums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a
       precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-
       precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach
       minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours). NOTE: See Chapter 14 for fuel planning
       considerations to a remote or island destination.
   6.20.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes
   greater than 59°N, see Chapter 14 for fuel planning considerations.
6.21. Adverse Weather.
   6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
       6.21.1.1. Anytime windshear may be encountered on departure or approach, it is
       recommended that aircrews select weather mode on one NAV RADAR display and
       windshear mode on another NAV RADAR display.
       6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts
       fastened, when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated.
88                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        WARNING: Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened
        and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence.
     6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged
     operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.
        6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle.
        6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog (consider equivalent to moderate
        icing), or temperatures near 0°C, may cause ice or frost to accumulate on aircraft
        surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff, refer to the
        following:
            6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective
            flight manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their
            associated flight manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover
            times.
            6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-
            icing benefit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved
            anti-icing fluids, crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-
            2, Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables are located on the CoP:
            (https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OT-SA-
            03). The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall
            use time, temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded
            and re-apply fluid if required.
            6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is
            completed within 5 minutes of departure.
     6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
     If unable to clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet vertically,
     avoid them by at least:
        6.21.3.1. 20 NMs at or above flight level FL 230.
        6.21.3.2. 10 NMs below FL 230.
        6.21.3.3. 5 NMs for tactical low-level operations. Avoid gust fronts and winds
        preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm. CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20
        NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must familiarize themselves with
        information on thunderstorm development and hazards. Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather
        for Aircrews.
     6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be
     used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should
     never be considered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-
     based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance
     instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by:
        6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
        6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  89


       6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
   6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and
   advected clouds (horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of
   thunderstorms.
   6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or
   departing an airport in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
       6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
       6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5 NMs separation from heavy rain showers
       6.21.6.3. Avoid prolonged flight in areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within
       plus or minus 5,000 feet of the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level,
       and in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunderstorm activity.
       NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within
       10 NMs providing they are not producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail,
       lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport,
       and are not forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to
       include the planned missed approach corridor, if applicable).
   6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C
   or below, refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction
   Chart, to correct MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
   6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence.
   6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-
   flight weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military
   weather facility or flight service station for details, if applicable.
   6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known
   volcanic activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least
   20 NMs.
6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach
to making calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during,
and after all operations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9,
Operational Risk Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and
local guidance as part of preflight activities.
   6.22.1. Flying units will develop a local ORM program to include personal ORM risk
   assessment for all missions.
   6.22.2. The PIC will ensure an ORM risk assessment is accomplished by all crewmembers
   as part of pre-flight activities.

Section 6C— Pre-Flight

6.23. AFTO Forms 781 Series.
90                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     6.23.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating
     aircraft systems. An exceptional/conditional release must be signed before flight. A
     maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the
     exceptional/conditional release. If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign
     the exceptional/conditional release. When a release is signed by the PIC, it is effective only
     for those flights in which the releasing PIC participates as an aircrew member. Ensure that
     the DD1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, and AIR card are aboard the aircraft.
     6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition
     that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to
     another station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
     Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC
     crews also see AFI 11-202V3/AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained,
     coordinate mission requirements with the controlling agency. The PIC‘s concurrence is
     required before the aircraft can be flown.
     6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to
     paragraph 12.3
6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
     6.24.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
     refueling duties. Crew members acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will
     comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and refueling job guide. Aircrews will only refuel in cases
     when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. Crew
     members may augment maintenance refueling teams at enroute stops.
     6.24.2. Aircrew Dash One Preflight Inspection Requirements.
        6.24.2.1. The aircrew dash one preflight inspection will remain valid until either:
            6.24.2.1.1. Aircraft ground time exceeds 12 hours (72 hours provided the aircraft is
            sealed, not flown, and documented entry control is maintained).
            6.24.2.1.2. Another maintenance dash six preflight is performed.
        6.24.2.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick turn, a thorough visual
        inspection will be performed.
     6.24.3. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue. See AFI 13-217 and any MAJCOM specific
     guidance (i.e. AMCI 11-208) for specific Fire Fighting and Rescue requirements. When
     required, the user will preposition suitable equipment at the LZ prior to conducting
     operations.
        6.24.3.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
        for fire protection during engine start.
        6.24.3.2. A fire guard is required for all engine starts except normal APU starts. The
        loadmaster or ground controller may act as fire guard.
     6.24.4. Aircrew and Maintenance Engine Runs.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              91


      6.24.4.1. A mixture of aircrew and maintenance personnel will not normally accomplish
      engine runs. When an aircrew member is required to start or run up engines for
      maintenance purposes, the following procedures apply:
          6.24.4.1.1. Maintenance personnel will accomplish all necessary inspections and
          preparations for the engine run. These actions include but are not limited to:
          intake/exhaust inspections, access panel security servicing, and AFTO Form 781
          documentation.
          6.24.4.1.2. Use the pilot and loadmaster checklists. Begin with the "power up
          checklist," and complete all appropriate checklists through the "before leaving
          airplane" checklist.
          6.24.4.1.3. Only deviate from the flight crew checklist when maintenance requires
          less than four engines to be started.
          6.24.4.1.4. Operate symmetrical engines when power settings above ground idle are
          required.
6.25. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. The PIC is responsible for
ensuring the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings, even when qualified
maintenance specialists are unavailable.
   6.25.1. The PIC is responsible for the recovery items including:
      6.25.1.1. Parking and receiving.
      6.25.1.2. Aircraft servicing, including Aircraft Ground Equipment (AGE) usage.
      6.25.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
      6.25.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
      6.25.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
      6.25.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
      6.25.1.7. Documenting AFTO 781-series forms.
   6.25.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the aircraft without qualified maintenance
   specialist assistance, comply with the appropriate maintenance T.O.
   6.25.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those
   instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash
   symbol in the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
   Document, updating current status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that
   reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection (i.e. preflight, thru-flight, basic post-
   flight) is overdue.
6.26. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
   6.26.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned
   flight from the equal time point (ETP) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be required
   (minimum 5 liters for all flights). Calculate crew requirements using the 100 percent Oxygen
   Duration Chart in the flight manual at 10,000 ft.
92                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        6.26.1.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected
        and readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
        6.26.1.2. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 feet cabin
        altitude (except HALO). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000
        will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen in accordance with Chapter 19.
        6.26.1.3. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have
        a PBE, or EPOS within arm's reach for flights above 10,000 feet.
        6.26.1.4. On missions carrying passengers, distribute EPOS (if available) to each
        passenger regardless of planned flight altitude. EPOS will be distributed and their use
        demonstrated before departure.
        6.26.1.5. Do not remove the loadmasters' emergency equipment (cargo compartment
        quick dons/smoke masks) for use by flight deck crew members.
     6.26.2. Rafts. On overwater flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than
     wing well life rafts will accommodate.
     6.26.3. Life preserver units (LPUs). The loadmaster will place an LPU within easy reach of
     each passenger and aircrew member before takeoff on overwater flights. Crewmembers will
     fit and adjust LPUs for overwater flights and will wear them on overwater missions below
     2,000 feet. (EXCEPTION: LPUs need not be worn for takeoffs, landings, or approaches).
     Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for overwater missions
     carrying children and infants.
     6.26.4. Parachutes:
        6.26.4.1. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp
        in-flight will be restrained by a safety harness, or wear a parachute.
        6.26.4.2. Either wear, or have prefit and prepositioned, parachutes and helmets during
        specified combat conditions. Loadmasters will wear a restraining harness instead of a
        parachute during airdrops below 800 feet AGL or when performing duties near an open
        exit above 14,000 MSL.
6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure the required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough
to permit inventory prior to engine start.
6.28. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
     6.28.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 618 TACC-directed
     mission). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the aircrew will
     collect the required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first station, which has
     such a function. The report will be submitted on AF Form 4075, Aircraft Load Data
     Worksheet.
6.29. Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
     6.29.1. AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment,
     contains a description of the types and classes of hazardous cargo that may be carried. PICs
     are responsible for ensuring that all procedures contained in AFMAN 24-204 are complied
     with when airlifting hazardous cargo.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 93


      6.29.1.1. MAJCOM Instructions (i.e. AMCI 11-214) may be provided to crew members
      in order to consolidate and streamline the information from several hazardous material
      regulations. This does not preclude aircrew from the responsibility of the parent
      regulation.
   6.29.2. Flight Planning. Based on the Hazardous Cargo Briefing, the PIC will:
      6.29.2.1. Enter "Hazardous Cargo" and the mission identifier or flight number in the
      appropriate section of the flight plan. Use Remarks section of DD175, Military Flight
      Plan, and Other Information section of DD1801, International Flight Plan, DOD.
      Refer to the FCG for country specific requirements concerning over-flight when
      transporting hazardous materials cargo.
      6.29.2.2. If possible, plan the flight to minimize overflying heavily populated or
      otherwise critical areas. Approach, landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded.
      6.29.2.3. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The
      remarks section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD
      class or division for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If
      required, request special handling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams,
      etc.).
      6.29.2.4. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
      preclude timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and
      information listed in paragraph 6.29.2.3. If available, C2 will relay required information
      to next destination.
6.30. Handling Procedures. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission
Capable (MICAP) Parts, Very, Very Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System
(FSS) Shipments, and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within
   the normal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo
   manifest. For unit moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation
   (DTR), Part III, Mobility, classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested
   utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, Cargo Manifest or similar automated product (such as
   CALM or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if
   classified/sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD1907,
   Signature and Tally Record, must be used.
      6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are
      authorized to designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military
      aircraft as couriers to escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified
      personnel are not available. Qualified passengers, if carried, are designated before
      designating crewmembers. The following restrictions apply:
          6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent
          of the PIC.
          6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at
          a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated
          as couriers.
94                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


     6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are
     required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
        6.30.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in
        temporary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
            6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier.
            6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
            6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
            6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
            6.30.2.1.5. US military guards.
            6.30.2.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
     6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material
     is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier
     Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
     6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of
     such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be
     manifested separately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH
     URGENCY. All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the
     air cargo manifest or the DD1907, for unit moves. The PIC, or designated representative,
     will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D— Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if airborne within -20/+14 minutes of
scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
     6.31.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good a time over target (TOT) or
     time of arrival (TOA). Notify C2 prior to takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
     6.31.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather,
     ATC restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a
     large-scale operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and
     downrange facilities and crew duty is evaluated.
6.32. NVG Departures.
     6.32.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG departures for
     pilots who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Weather minimums for NVG
     departures for pilots who are current and qualified is 1 mile visibility. Crews must give
     careful consideration to potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other weather
     limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
     which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather
     conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and
     weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
     6.32.2. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences
     NVG failure takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC. If NVG malfunctions
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  95


   occur after the PM states ―rotate‖, consideration should be given to either continuing the
   takeoff as the PF transitions to an IMC takeoff or transferring control of the aircraft as the
   situation dictates. If either pilot‘s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climb out and follow
   the appropriate procedures for loss of NVGs. The PM will be ready to immediately assume
   aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Pilots
   must exercise sound and conservative judgment to continue NVG operations with aircraft
   malfunctions.

Section 6E— Enroute

6.33. Flight Progress. In-flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor Mission
Computer performance. Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability
that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). See
Chapter 11 for procedures to monitor flight progress.
   6.33.1. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for
   further guidance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct
   US government business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to
   enter their airspace. Foreign clearances for US international air operations are obtained
   through US officials known as Defense Attaché Officers (DAOs).
       6.33.1.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial
       airspace. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial
       seas. Military aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal
       state. Territorial airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters,
       inland waters, and land territory, and is sovereign airspace. Overflight may be conducted
       in such areas only with the consent of the sovereign country.
       6.33.1.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12 NMs.
       Diplomatic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions
       operating in international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be
       provided far enough in advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established
       by the countries concerned. The US does not normally recognize territorial claims
       beyond 12 NMs; however, specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish
       limits, which differ from the standard.
       6.33.1.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). A FIR is an area of airspace within which
       flight information and related services are provided. A FIR does not reflect international
       borders or sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without
       approval of the adjacent country, provided the PIC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
       6.33.1.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace
       into territorial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not
       amend entry point(s).
       6.33.1.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or
       departure of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a
       clearance has not been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
96                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


        6.33.1.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for
        penetration of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective
        country. Aircraft clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
        6.33.1.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts
        to negate existing clearances, pilots must evaluate the circumstances. The normal
        response will be to attempt to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to
        planned destination, as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in
        international airspace."   Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission
        continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance, which routes
        their mission over sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic
        channels before mission departure, as being valid authorization.
        6.33.1.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing
        will normally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility
        transited before performing the critical portion of the mission.
        6.33.1.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked
        to and should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate
        MAJCOM C2 and specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or
        "operational" option obligates the military AC to be their own ATC agency to separate
        their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, PIC may
        exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Aircraft will return to normal air
        traffic services as soon as practical.
6.34. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in
FLIP, and are considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, RVSM, RNP, and BRNAV.
For further details about specific airspace procedures and restrictions, see Chapter 11.
6.35. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in FLIP planning or
FLIP En route Supplement.
     6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against aircraft. Aircraft subjected to
     harassment or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF
     air and ground voice facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type,
     insignia, or any other identifying features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed,
     and the type of harassment. Request relay of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also,
     attempt to contact the nearest command post when in UHF and VHF range.
     6.35.2. Other incidents will be reported as indicated in JCS Pub 6V5 and AFMAN10-206,
     Operational Reporting.
6.36. In-Flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should
consist of different menu items.
6.37. Communications.
     6.37.1. Crews should conduct an HF radio ground check before takeoff if use of the HF
     radio may be required for ATC or C2 communications. Attempt to establish HF contact
     before going out of UHF/VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact with the controlling
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  97


   HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information is not available, the aircraft
   should return to the nearest suitable support base.
   6.37.2. Pilots shall provide ARTCC position and weather observations when required. If
   unable to contact an ATC agency, attempt to relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that
may occur as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions
permitting, inform passengers of the situation and intentions.
   6.38.1. Notification of C2 Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
   action checklists and associated actions, the PIC shall furnish ATC and appropriate C2
   agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other
   pertinent information.
   6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL when additional expertise is
   necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
       6.38.2.1. Local Area. Use appropriate UHF or VHF frequencies.
       6.38.2.2. En route. Attempt to establish a phone patch with the nearest or controlling C2
       Center using global HF network, UHF/VHF stations, SATCOM, etc. If unable, aircrews
       are permitted to use ARINC radio service as an additional avenue for phone patch
       connectivity.
       6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits:
           6.38.2.3.1. Description of the situation to include actions taken and intentions.
           6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Number of personnel and DVs on board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing destination and ETA.
6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care,
the PIC will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by
medical personnel. Notification will include the patient‘s sex, approximate age, and major
complaint.
   6.39.1. Suspected Laser Exposure. If exposed to a laser, the aircraft commander will ensure
   appropriate command and control, intelligence, safety, and medical agencies are notified as
   soon as possible. Aircrew who suspect exposure to laser radiation from either friendly or
   hostile sources should report to the Flight Surgeon‘s Office or nearest emergency room
   where individual can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing.
6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot‘s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to
descent. The primary sources are 618 TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF weather
flights via pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical station. Refer
98                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) for weather agency contact information. The ATC
system can provide weather information to en route aircraft.

Section 6F— Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, pilots will review appropriate terrain charts
to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be
involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required
checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
     6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at
     night or during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available
     approved instrument approach.
        6.41.1.1. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions if an approved
        instrument approach to the landing runway is not available or operational missions
        require a tactical approach.
        6.41.1.2. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR
        traffic patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The PM will monitor a
        precision approach when practical to enhance safety.
        6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision
        approach, if weather minimums permit.
6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
     6.42.1. Aircraft category. The C-130J is a category "C" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed
     140 knots, the minimums for category "D" will be used.
     6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply
     with the missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3.
     6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en
     route descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
        6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches. NOTE:
        See Chapter 14 for visibility only fuel requirements.
            6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730
            meters) or 1/2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
            6.42.3.1.2. CAT I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be
            as published, but no lower than a 200 ft height above touchdown (HAT).
        6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
            6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the
            required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet
            rounded up to the next one hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet,
            add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then round up to the next one hundred foot value
            which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the approach must be at or above 900
            feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by category, circling approach
            minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than:
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             99


            6.42.3.2.1.1. Category C - 500 ft - 1 1/2 SM.
            6.42.3.2.1.2. Category D - 600 ft - 2 SM.
     6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM
     or as noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach
     lighting system (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs,
     PAPIs, and other lights that are not a component of the ALS.).
  6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
     6.42.4.1. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT I ILS and precision radar approach (PAR)
     includes a HUD or PFD at each station, and no shared CADC or INU attitude reference.
     6.42.4.2. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT II ILS includes an operational HUD in
     the PF position, a HUD or PFD at the PM position, and meeting the flight manual CAT II
     ILS criteria.
     6.42.4.3. Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300 feet and RVR 40 or
     3/4 SM visibility (1220 meters) with no RVR if full flight instrumentation is not
     operational.
  6.42.5. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to
  conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational procedures:
     6.42.5.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
     6.42.5.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
     6.42.5.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA ATCSCC
     at 1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated arrival time. Pilots
     who arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach clearance, who did not
     contact ATC prior to departure, should expect an ATC directed divert to a non-PRM
     airport.
     6.42.5.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be
     disengaged when a breakout is directed.
     6.42.5.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall
     immediately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC
     clearance, the pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA,
     comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines
     safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. CAT II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. Minimum HAT is 100 feet.
  Minimum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots. Crosswind of 15 knots
  may be used for training approaches (requires weather of 200 – ½ or greater).
     6.42.6.1. The following airfield and aircraft equipment must be operational (AFMAN
     11-230, Instrument Procedures).
         6.42.6.1.1. Approach lights.
         6.42.6.1.2. Runway centerline lighting.
         6.42.6.1.3. High intensity runway lights or touchdown zone lights.
100                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          6.42.6.1.4. Approach end transmissometer.
          6.42.6.1.5. ILS far field monitor.
          6.42.6.1.6. Sequenced flashers.
      6.42.6.2. Aircrews will not execute an IMC CAT II ILS to minimums unless both pilots
      are qualified and current in CAT II ILS.
      6.42.6.3. When performing CAT II ILS procedures on a CAT I ILS for
      training/evaluations, the DH is the HAT for the CAT I ILS.
      6.42.6.4. Refer to AFI 11-217 Vol. 1 regarding equipment failure and go-around criteria.
   6.42.7. NDB Procedures. The HUD alone is not sufficient for NDB approaches. A head-
   down display, which depicts a bearing pointer tuned to the NDB, must be used in conjunction
   with the HUD throughout the approach. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or
   IMC conditions after compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR.
   Pilots should consider backing up each approach with available navaids/GPS to include
   loading the NDB coordinates in the FMS.
   6.42.8. Self Contained Approaches (SCA) (IPRA and LZ approaches). See AFI 11-202V3
      6.42.8.1. IMC Restrictions: Approaches may only be accomplished from a published
      SCA developed IAW AFI 11-202V3. Units must submit SCA to MAJCOM TERPS
      office for review and receive MAJCOM/A3 approval. Weather minimums for the SCA
      will be determined in the TERPS review based upon required navigation performance
      (RNP) criteria. Ceiling will be no lower than 300 ft and visibility will be no lower than
      RVR 4800 or 1 SM (1600 meters).
          6.42.8.1.1. FOM of 4 or less on both Navigation Solutions.
          6.42.8.1.2. Both Pilots must verify RPI or LZ coordinates.
          6.42.8.1.3. Pos Alert 1 and Alert 2 must be set to 0.03 and 0.05 respectively.
          6.42.8.1.4. No INAV POS MISCOMPARE / DIFFERENCE ACAWS.
          6.42.8.1.5. SHIP SOLN INAV 2 must be selected for IPRA Approaches.
   6.42.9. After Beginning an Enroute Descent. IAW AFI 11-202V3, after starting an enroute
   descent, and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC
   has the option of continuing the approach to the MAP/DH. Comply with the last assigned
   clearance until a new or amended clearance is received. EXCEPTION: Do not continue a
   CAT II ILS if the weather is reported to be below CAT II minimums.
      6.42.9.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment
      is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
      6.42.9.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the
      approach and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel
      reserve.
      6.42.9.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below
      designated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                101


   6.42.10. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but
   forecast to improve to or above minimums provided:
       6.42.10.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate
       and hold for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to
       remain at or above alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
       6.42.10.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel
       will be consumed.
6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
   6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual
   approaches, NVG visual pattern work, and pilots who are non-current and/or unqualified is
   1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews may fly IFR approaches with weather at
   approach minimums. Crews must give careful consideration to the potential hazards during
   these critical phases of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI
   11-202V3.
   6.43.2. NVG Malfunction during Approach and Landing. If one of the pilots experience
   NVG failure on short final, it will be at the discretion of the PIC whether or not to transition
   to normal lights or perform a go-around. The PM will be ready to immediately assume
   aircraft control if the PF experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Pilots
   must exercise sound and conservative judgment to continue NVG operations with aircraft
   malfunctions. Tactical and safety considerations will dictate the final course of action.
6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base
without a passenger facility, the AC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and
request assistance in arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following
procedures apply when obtaining support for service members, in a group travel status, who are
transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather or maintenance problems, forcing the
members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue its mission. NOTE: These
procedures do not apply to those passengers traveling on delayed C-130J aircraft flying TWCF
missions who are authorized per diem on their individual travel orders or in a space available
status.
   6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are
   available, payment for lodging (contract or on-base) and other required support is charged to
   local TWCF funds via the US Bankcorp Government Purchase Card (GPC) account, in
   accordance with locally established procedures. TWCF payment is applicable for only those
   service members in a group travel status aboard any C-130J aircraft delayed at these
   locations, regardless of the command owning the aircraft, provided the aircraft is flying a
   TWCF mission (SAAM, CJCS Exercise, JA/ATT, or Contingency) with an AMC mission
   identifier.
   6.44.2. If the aircraft delay is at a location where TWCF funds are not available (regardless
   if DoD facilities are available or not), the C-130J aircraft commander will utilize SF 44,
   Purchase Order-Invoice-Vouchering (or AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice)
   authority to acquire the necessary meals, quarters, and transportation for only the group
   travel status passengers. Upon return to home station, the aircraft commander will turn in the
102                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   SF 44 or AF Form 15 to the local accounting liaison/budget office. Supporting
   documentation should include a copy of the service members' group travel orders along with
   applicable invoices/receipts for lodging, meals, and other required support. Upon validation
   of the SF 44 or AF Form 15, the accounting liaison/budget office forwards the bills for these
   charges to the DFAS Field Site for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose aircraft
   incurred the delay.
6.45. Maintenance. Complete the AFTO Form 781 after each flight. After landing, crew
members debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance
support, when a maintenance requirement exists the AC will ensure a thorough debrief is
provided to the C2 agency. On AMC missions, notify 618 TACC Logistics Control (618
TACC/XOCL).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state
   lowest altitude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 3000 feet above sea except
   for takeoffs and landings.
6.46. Border Clearance. The border clearance responsibility will be as designated by the base
or area command in accordance with AFI 24-401, AFI 24-402, AFI 24-403, Border Clearance,
Customs Program, and other United States Entry Requirements and Related Areas.
   6.46.1. Normal Operations.
       6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border
       clearance of its aircraft.
       6.46.1.2. When support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC.
       Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains
       ultimate responsibility. When a C-130J aircraft is on-loaded at a base without an air
       traffic function, the PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
          6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid
          visas, when required.
          6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of
          immunization (shot record).
          6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
          6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border
          clearance can be obtained.
          6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and
          baggage, if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign
          area.
          6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47).
   6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
       6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when
       not accomplished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 103


     The loadmaster will also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and
     prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
     6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in
     ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
     6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft,
     which has landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base
     in the US to obtain border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of
     cargo, passengers, and crew until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate
     offloading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to
     proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the border clearance must be
     completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official. Do not make
     intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination of
     manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
     center.
     6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative
     normally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane
     passengers, troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety (i.e. flare safety check) or
     the preservation of life and property (loadmaster excepted). Do not unload until
     approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated representatives. This
     procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all landings required when
     operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete final
     border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of U.S. Aircraft by Foreign Officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow USAF policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are
     immune from searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety
     inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, ACs must be aware of, and adhere to, any
     specific FCG provisions for individual countries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use
     the following procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the
         PIC to the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to
         search without consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials
         in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as
         not to offend foreign authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have
         authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make
         every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters
         (through MAJCOM C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then
         notify these agencies of foreign request by the most expeditious means available and
         follow their instructions.
104                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending
          notification to USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should
          indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying
          time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do
          so.
          6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
          way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action
          being pursued and that they intend to notify both USAF headquarters and the
          appropriate American embassy of the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt
          physical resistance, and should thereafter report the incident to USAF headquarters
          and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC should escort foreign
          authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
      6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment.
      Follow these procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
   6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
      6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or
      exit, require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
      immunization, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding,
      between these agencies and MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
      6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic
      and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each
      operation. Inspection and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload
      base, or at the foreign onload or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
          6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General
          Declaration (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.

                 6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs
                 representative will meet the aircraft and accept the troop commander's
                 certificate with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are
                 not required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              105


               representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs
               officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection.

        6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
            6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit,
            milk, milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat,
            and animal products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop
            personal gear/cargo are to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other
            foreign material before being brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and
            equipment must be examined for snails and other plant pests to prevent their
            accidental entry into the U.S.
            6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted
            will clear vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
            6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or
            higher headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes
            before landing.
            6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after
            troops have disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight
            lunches for prompt removal by fleet service personnel.
106                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as
              offloaded. Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held
              for such treatment as the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical
              cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program. All crewmembers will ensure
   compliance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.
6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to
   AFJI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign and Domestic Quarantine Regulations for
   Vessels, Aircraft, and Other Transports of the Armed Forces (Joint), Department of Defense
   FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or
   on forms provided by the country transited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with
   passengers on board. The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent,
       National Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft.
       Wear leather or Nomex gloves while spraying.
           6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being
           sprayed.
           6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely
           loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments,
           wheel wells, and other similar spaces.
           6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the
           aircraft after the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and
           ventilation openings. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after
           use, spray before boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10
           minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on
           board.
       6.47.1.2. Spray for 105 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
       transited. NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be
       disposed of safely.
   6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the
   aircraft in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport
   manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not
   open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for
   insect or rodent infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection
   is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local
   requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

   accomplish the following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for equipment found missing. Additionally,
       ensure equipment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the
       AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column
       indicating the quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is
       entered above the check number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form
       46 on board the aircraft in the event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the AC and determine whether the missing equipment should be
       recovered or replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A3TL (or MAJCOM aircrew flight equipment
       office) and appropriate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is
   annotated on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next
   vacant column for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
   number of that column.
6.51. Passenger Restrictions.

   downloaded prior to departure. See exception at paragraph 13.4.2.6.
6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where
conditions may adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width,
   slope, and lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway
   contrast against surrounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles,
   airfield markings, or other safety critical items to MAJCOM Stan/Eval, who will forward to
   HQ AMC/A3AS.
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.
6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the
AC should impound the aircraft immediately after landing and contact the controlling C2 agency
for further instructions.
6.54. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.54.1. The maximum number of persons on the flight deck will be the minimum
   commensurate with the mission requirements. At no time should this exceed six (unless
   otherwise specified in a MAJCOM supplement to this AFI).
   6.54.2. No items (checklists, charts, etc.) will be placed on the power lever quadrant during
   critical phases of flight.
   6.54.3. Place only soft items on the top bunk.
   6.54.4. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the
   mission on the flight deck. Additional items will be secured in the cargo compartment. All
   items will be secured before passing the combat entry point through the combat exit point.
6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria.
Acceptance of traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach
clearance is acknowledgment that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts
responsibility of providing wake turbulence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP)
section 5-37 for more information concerning wake turbulence separation.
6.56. Overflying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to overfly a
scheduled en route stop (ANG/DO for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for
AFRC-directed missions).
6.57. Ordnance Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of
chaff/flares or the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
   6.57.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for
   hung ordnance.
   6.57.2. The loadmaster or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check
   all chaff/flare dispensers for hung ordnance or damage. NOTE: ALE-47 flare squibs that
   fail to fire are not considered hung ordnance.
   6.57.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare
   cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 109


   personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD
   personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
   6.57.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
6.58. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in
MAJCOM supplement.
   6.58.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or airfield
   management operations office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to
   Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft
   and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
   provides specific guidance concerning the security of various levels of classified equipment
   aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot be removed and stored, lock
   and seal the aircraft. If available, use RAVENS to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use guards
   employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded
   classified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
   6.58.2. Material. Ensure COMSEC and other classified materials are turned in at destination
   and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2 center will
   provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
   turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage
   box is GSA approved, and may be used for material classified up to and including SECRET.
   Encrypted COMSEC will only be transferred to authorized DoD personnel.
   6.58.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission
   accomplishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV (ground
   test assets permitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or
   contingency/exercise tasking.
   6.58.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor
   cancel a mission for an inoperable Mode 4, except when the aircraft will transit an area
   where safe passage procedures are implemented.
   6.58.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode IV on all missions departing the CONUS for
   overseas locations. Aircrews can request the Mode IV interrogation check through NORAD
   on UHF frequency 364.2.
   6.58.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV will continue to their intended destinations.
   Repairs will be accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and
   maintenance technicians are available. In theaters where safe passage is implemented,
   aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable Mode IV as directed in the applicable airspace
   control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   6.58.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode 4, when conducted, are mandatory
   maintenance debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of
   the Mode IV on all aircraft forms (AFTO FORM 781A).
   6.58.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the
   Mode IV on missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any
   destination without COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC
   managers for guidance.
110                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


                                            Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting
aircraft piracy (hijacking) of the C-130J aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (Hijacking), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and specific
MAJCOM security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release
information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the
public.
7.2. Security. The C-130J is a ―Protection Level 3‖ resource. Aircraft security at non-United
States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.
7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will
implement AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, requirements for C-130J
aircraft:
   7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via
   a roving patrol, a two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT), with immediate
   response not to exceed 3 minutes, and a two-person External Security Response Team,
   (ESRT) with response capability within 5 minutes.
   7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking space is available, establish
   a temporary restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area
   signs. Provide a one-person mobile patrol, supported by a two-person ISRT capable of a
   5minute response. Portable security lighting will be provided during the hours of darkness if
   sufficient permanent lighting is not available.
   7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local
   security capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If he or she
   determines security to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate
   security is available.
   7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force
   POC must be identified to the PIC.
   7.3.5. Security support is a continual requirement and is not negated by the presence of
   aircrew or ground crew members. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft
   doors are closed and the aircraft taxis.
   7.3.6. Locking and Sealing. Lock or seal the aircraft during a ―Remain over night‖ (RON)
   on non-secure ramps (see paragraph 7.5.1.).
7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. Ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door with a lock box, or other controllable device,
which will prevent entry without damaging the door or lock. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency
the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the aircraft in an emergency. Annotate
the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller may grant access to a
sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry and ensure it remains launch capable. The PIC or
designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure the
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  111


aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
sealed, and flown by another aircrew. NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for
documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1 and MAJCOM Supplement.
7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to
ensure adequate en route security is available. The PIC will receive a threat assessment and en
route security capability evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station
departure and should request updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX
RAVEN team will be assigned to the mission.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of three US Air Force security force
   members, but may include more depending on security requirements. The team's travel
   status is determined by MAJCOM. The team travels in MEP status and is responsible to the
   PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for its welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.).
   Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress/passenger briefing
   (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following
   actions as required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local
       authorities request payment for this service, use AF FORM 15.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crew members to
       remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in
       the aircraft vicinity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If, in the opinion of the PIC, airfield security is inadequate
       and the PIC determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the
       FDP limits and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base
       considered reliable. Report movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as
       practical. If a departure is not possible, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
       requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
       The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
       protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as
       appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to aircrew members and
   support personnel assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199,
   Air Force Entry Control Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders.
   Aircrew members and assigned crew chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their
       duties under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the EAL or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
112                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed
   to allow ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC‘s judgment, the aircraft needs to
   be locked and sealed in order to detect unauthorized entry, then:
      7.6.1.1. Use available aircraft ground security locking devices.
      7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape
      inside of doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
      7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal).
      7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of
      a forced entry.
      7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the Office of Special
      Investigation (OSI), security forces or local authorities, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft
      thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
   7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   In addition to normal preflight activities, aircrews must inspect areas of the aircraft not
   covered by normal preflight duties, to include: aircraft wheel wells and avionics
   compartments for unauthorized packages, personnel or other unfamiliar devices. Report any
   suspicious items to host security forces. Aircrews will maintain a heightened security
   posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
   7.7.1. The Air Transportation Act of 1974 and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as
   amended, vest the FAA Administrator with exclusive responsibility for the direction of law
   enforcement activity in aircraft hijacking situations involving all aircraft (civil and military)
   in-flight in the United States.
   7.7.2. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under
   military command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.3. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying
   documents, equipment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or
   weapons of mass destruction, DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with all pertinent information. Where possible, the FAA will
   consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.4. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft
   is operationally ready for flight.
   7.7.5. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military
   contract aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.6. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be
   resisted in a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.7. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom
   the threat of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    113


   be ineffective. Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the
   hijackers may require use of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.8. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of
   life or property.
   7.7.9. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the
   passengers.
   7.7.10. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested
   by the PIC of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the anti-
   hijacking effort.
7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are
taken to minimize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-130J is operating away
from home station, the PIC will comply with this chapter and AFI 13-207, as supplemented.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or
   manifesting facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until
   the PIC is fully satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger
   service representatives, the PIC will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and
   baggage is accomplished.
       7.8.1.1. The Transportation Security Administration provides the latest guidance on
       passenger screening and carry on allowances. The latest guidance can be downloaded
       from www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/index.shtm.
           7.8.1.1.1. Aircrew must ensure that thorough screenings are accomplished when
           processing passengers at locations without an AMC Passenger Terminal.
           7.8.1.1.2. Carry-on restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through
           the passenger terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC location. Carry-on
           restrictions do not apply to those not required to process through the passenger
           terminal, or equivalent when at a non-AMC locations. This includes:
               7.8.1.1.2.1. Aircrew members listed on the Flight Authorization for that mission.
               7.8.1.1.2.2. MEPs for that mission.
               7.8.1.1.2.3. OSA/VIPSAM passenger not required to process through the
               Passenger Terminal (primary DV, spouses/party, aides, and security details only).
               7.8.1.1.2.4. Duty passengers on ANG/AFRC mission numbers.
           7.8.1.1.3. Consider baggage contained in areas not readily accessible in flight as
           checked baggage, even if carried to the aircraft by the passengers. This includes, but
           is not limited to: segregated baggage compartments, floor loaded baggage tied down
           with cargo straps/chains, palletized baggage, and baggage in baggage bins.
           7.8.1.1.4. Brief non-exempt passengers that baggage in these areas is not to be
           accessed in flight. If any non-exempt passenger attempts to access checked baggage
           in-flight, land the aircraft at the nearest suitable airport (preferably a military facility)
           with appropriate law enforcement personnel. Request assistance in removing the
114                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


           passenger(s) and accompanying baggage from the aircraft. Comply with all law
           enforcement direction.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients.
   When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform
   required inspections prior to loading.
       7.8.2.1. For AE missions, the MCD is the final authority for determining what items can
       be carried by/for AE patients.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the
   movement of large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers
   and perform anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried
   baggage aboard an aircraft. EXECPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or
   State Department, RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to
   carry weapons.
       7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an
       aircraft. They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded
       weapons and ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the
       tactical situation dictates (in coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at
       the order of the troop commander or team leader.
       7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order
       of the team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
       7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions
       identified on the mission ―frag‖ as ―RAVEN in-flight arming required.‖
   7.8.5. If weapons must be cleared, instruct the individual(s) to:
       7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
       personnel before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
       7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.               Ensure
       troop/aircraft commander retains ammunition IAW paragraph 7.8.4.1.
7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft
within the United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time
as FAA assumes active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military
aircraft. Resistance may vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to
direct physical confrontation, including the prudent use of weapons.
   7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened,
   while the aircraft is on the ground:
       7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the
       aircrew to establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
       7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is
       vested in the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 115


       be established, or when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following
       order:
           7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
           7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose AOR the airfield lies.
           7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
           7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
   7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to
   takeoff. Refer to DoD 5210.41M, paragraph 9B (3), for additional guidance.
7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the
resourcefulness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific
counter-hijacking procedure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of
action to be taken, including the nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the
aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material
onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may consider are:
   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker(s) in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate
   what course of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a
   hostile, country.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker
   physically, including the prudent use of firearms.
   7.10.6. In any suspected or actual hijack attempt, the aircrew basic objective is to get the
   aircraft on the ground quickly as possible and to keep it there. If the pilot needs to land
   quickly, the pilot will request an emergency descent clearance from ATC.
7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking
threat will transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Notify ground agencies as
soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as circumstances permit. Covert signals are
no longer to be used per FAA guidance.
7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for
air intercept.
7.13. Arming of Crew Members. When crews are directed to carry weapons, at least one pilot
(or extra flight deck crew member) and one loadmaster will be armed. All crew members should
know who is armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
   7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box,
   lock and key. Crew members will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must
   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF
   FORM 1297.
116                                                  AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent
   identifying armed crew members. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to and
   from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities.
       7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly
       identify themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security
       checkpoints. One crewmember will present a valid set of crew orders, military
       identification card, and AF Form 523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms,
       authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once terminal personnel verify this, they
       will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew
       will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects from their
       pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are armed.
   7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. Crew members will be armed before beginning
   preflight, on-load or off-load duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. When no
   passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in the gun box in-flight after a satisfactory
   stowaway check. Crew members will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be unloaded
   before placing them in a gun box.
   7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
       7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the
       most secure facility available, normally the base armory.
       7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
   7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
       7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
       7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key.
   7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission
   termination at home station.
   7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels if available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew
   member; place the weapon on a flat surface.
7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times.

supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities IAW AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures.
   8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage
   to another organization‘s people or equipment caused by PIC‘s aircraft/crewmember. At a
   minimum, report the following:
      8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-
      flight due to medical or physiological reasons). These include:
          8.4.1.1.1. Proven or suspected case(s) of hypoxia.
          8.4.1.1.2. Carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposure.
          8.4.1.1.3. Decompression sickness due to evolved gas (bends, chokes,

          an Individual Involved in an AF Accident/Incident, Section A, Aircraft
          Accident/Incident as soon as practical.
      8.4.1.2. A human factors related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments;
      information overload (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable
      analysis/decision); aircrew task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a
      short period of time); or confused switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of
      wrong switch creates dangerous situation). Anonymous reports are acceptable.
      8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure,
      suspected engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine
      failures include, but are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component
      penetrating the engine case, engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire,
      substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately
      report incidents that involve multiple engines (may report single-engine incidents upon
      landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training and/or FCF unless the
      engine fails to restart.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 119


       8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that

and Services at Commercial Locations. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card for
the purchase of aviation fuel and ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some
military installations) worldwide. The air card is authorized for use by all U.S. government
aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some foreign government aircraft. All
PICs should plan to use the ―platinum‖ MSC card. In most cases, there will be no changes when
refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The MSC card is
122                                                  AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting merchants
can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
   8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL
   procedures and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card
   could create financial liability for the purchaser.

      training, simulated emergency training, and airdrops are prohibited unless specifically
      tasked by JA/ATT authorization. (This does not apply to MEP.)
   9.1.3. Multiple practice approaches will not be accomplished with passengers.
   EXCEPTION: When approved by the MAJCOM, maintenance and civilian employees,
   under direct contract to the DOD and engaged in official direct mission support activities,
   considered ―mission essential‖ may be onboard when touch-and-go or stop and-go landings
   are performed providing the mission is a designated training flight and an IP or EP is in
   command.
9.2. Touch and Go Landing Limitations.
   9.2.1. Touch-and-go landings will only be accomplished under the direct supervision of an
   IP or AC certified by unit commander to perform touch-and-go landings.
      9.2.1.1. Ground idle touch-and-go landings may be performed by any pilot from either
      seat, when a flight examiner pilot, instructor pilot, or an instructor pilot candidate during
      upgrade training/evaluation occupies a pilot‘s seat.
   9.2.2. Limitations.
      9.2.2.1. Minimum runway length for 50% flap flight idle touch-and-go landings is 5000

or below a refusal speed based on simulated runway length. Compare distance traveled to
runway length and point out the ramifications of operating with less than critical field length.
Subsequent aborted takeoffs can lead to excessive brake heating. Brakes must be allowed to cool
between aborted takeoffs. Do not shut down an engine due to simulated malfunctions. Do not
practice aborted max effort takeoffs from stop-and-go landings. Requires OG/CC approval.
9.17. Maintenance Opportune Training.
   9.17.1. All aircraft in the en route system on AMC missions are available for opportune
   training except those designated non-available in the advisory section of GDSS Form 59 by
   the 618 TACC (i.e. SAAM, 1A1, Phoenix Banner, and Medevac missions). Mission
   planners will annotate the GDSS Form 59 for those missions not allowed to be used for
   opportune training. The en route maintenance production supervisor will brief the aircraft
   commander of the intention to train, either at the aircraft or at the air mobility command
   center, prior to entering crew rest. If a conflict arises between the crew and en route
   maintenance teams it should be routed through 618 TACC duty officer/operations director
   for resolution. NOTE: PIC approval is not required.
   9.17.2. Training will not be performed on aircraft carrying hot cargo or on CLOSE WATCH
   missions. All training will be complete and the aircraft ready for flight not later than 2 hours
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               131


   prior to crew show. Crews are not required to remain with the aircraft while training is
   performed.
   9.17.3. Use of ANG/ARC aircraft will be supported on a pre-coordinated basis. The en

    AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
      NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-
Yield Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security
threats to the global operations of air mobility forces. AFTTP 3-3.C-130J describes the CBRNE
threat, passive defense measures to mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight
operations in a contaminated environment.
134                                                  AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


                                          Chapter 11

                              NAVIGATION PROCEDURES

11.1. General.
   11.1.1. Definitions and Terminology.
      11.1.1.1. Category I (CAT I) Route. Any route that does not meet the requirements of a
      CAT II route, including tactical navigation and overwater routes.
      11.1.1.2. Category II (CAT II) Route. Any route on which the position of the aircraft
      can be accurately determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid (NDB, VOR) or
      intersection of at least two radio aid radials (VOR, TACAN) or one radial (VOR,
      TACAN) and one DME at least once each hour.
      11.1.1.3. Controlling Navigation Solution. The controlling EGI (INAV) navigation
      solution the mission computer is using for en route navigation. The SHIP SOLN,
      selected via the NAV SELECT page of the AMU, determines which will be used to steer
      the aircraft either manually or with the autopilot.
      11.1.1.4. First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) and Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF). Utilized in
      the equal time point (ETP) calculation. These are represented as the ―First Nearest‖ and
      the ―Last Nearest‖ airports in the ETP calculation in the PROGRESS pages of the CNI.
      They are airports closest to the coast out and coast in waypoints that meet applicable
      criteria for C-130J operations. Forecast weather for the FSAF and LSAF must meet
      destination weather minimum filing requirements.
      11.1.1.5. Equal Time Point (ETP). Geographic point along the route from which the
      flight time to the FSAF or the LSAF is equal.
      11.1.1.6. Required Navigation Performance (RNP). RNP accuracy standards require an
      aircraft to remain within a specific number of nautical miles of its cleared course
      centerline for 95% of the duration of the flight. The associated track containment limit is
      twice the RNP value and represents the maximum limit of protected airspace. Airspace
      where RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and
      the specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. RNP airspace is
      being incorporated around the world to increase air traffic capacity by decreasing
      separation requirements between routes. Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts
      to determine RNP airspace.
      11.1.1.7. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace. MNPS
      airspace exists in both the North Atlantic Region (NAT) and certain Canadian portions of
      the North American Region. Refer to FLIP Area Planning publications/charts to
      determine MNPS airspace. The C-130J must comply with all MNPS equipment
      requirements when flying within the lateral dimensions of this airspace. Aircraft meeting
      the North Atlantic MNPS requirements also meet the Canadian MNPS requirements.
      Aircraft entering MNPS airspace are required to have two Long Range Navigation
      Systems (LRNS) capable of staying within 12.6 NM of cleared track for 95 percent of the
      flight. Gross navigation errors are those that exceed 24 NM from track center line. Prior
      to entering MNPS airspace, both INSs must be fully operational to meet the MNPS
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                135


      requirement of having two fully serviceable LRNSs. In order to signify that a flight is
      approved to operate in NAT MNPS airspace, the letter ―X‖ will be inserted within item
      10 of the DD1801 flight plan form.
      11.1.1.8. NAT Tracks. Contained within the North Atlantic MNPS airspace is an
      organized track system (NAT Tracks) between FL 285 and FL 420 to optimize air traffic
      flow between the North American and European continents. NAT tracks are designed
      based on meteorological data and are updated twice daily. When flying over the North
      Atlantic, crews should obtain a copy of the North Atlantic Tracks (NAT tracks) valid for
      their coast out time from the DOD NOTAM internet site.
      11.1.1.9. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. This airspace
      requires special certification and exists to increase airspace capacity, safely, by reducing
      vertical separation from 2000‘ to 1000‘ between suitably equipped aircraft. RVSM has
      been implemented in the CONUS, Europe, Africa, and Middle East. RVSM airspace
      typically extends from FL 290 through FL 410. Consult AP/1 and AP/2 for locations and
      lateral and vertical dimensions of this airspace.
11.2. Mission Planning Procedures.
   11.2.1. Refer to Chapter 6 for general mission planning requirements.
   11.2.2. Mission/Route Planning. Pilots will normally accomplish and verify mission
   planning while in a flight planning facility/base operations; the data is then loaded manually
   (or via the data transfer card) into the CNI. Pilots will also calculate and verify the required
   ramp fuel load.
      11.2.2.1. When practical, pilots will plan the most direct routing possible or utilize wind
      optimized CFP routing to enhance fuel conservation.
      11.2.2.2. Computer Flight Plan (CFP). Optimized routing with applied forecast winds
      can be obtained from ACFP (USAF) or OPARS (USN). ACFP 4.0 can produce a .rte
      file that PFPS 3.3.1 can recognize and open. Use initial ATC cruise ceiling for the en
      route altitude. Update actual flight level winds using the N-PFPS WX utility if
      necessary.
      11.2.2.3. Verify the CFP for route definition and accuracy, paying particular attention to
      adherence with over flight clearances. Pass any flight plan discrepancies to 618
      TACC/ACFP (DSN 576-1241/1243, 618-256-1241/43) or Fleet Numerical Meteorology
      and Oceanography Center/OPARS (DSN 878-4302/4325, 831-656-4302/4325).
      11.2.2.4. Refer to Chapter 14 to accomplish fuel planning.
   11.2.3. Equal Time Point (ETP) Computations.
      11.2.3.1. The ETP provides crews a tool for recovery airfield decision-making when in-
      flight emergencies occur. ETP computations are required on CAT I routes when the total
      time between the LSAF and FSAF is 5 hours or more. ETPs must be annotated and
      plotted on the MPC and MFP prior to the coast-out waypoint. Computer programs which
      use similar algorithms as the manual computation may be used. Enter ETP information
      into the CNI PROGRESS page during preflight. CNI-computed ETPs only become
      accurate upon reaching the PERF CRUISE altitude. CNI-computed ETPs can be
      obtained for different airspeeds (i.e. 260 KTAS for a 3-engine scenario).
136                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      11.2.3.2. The blocks provided on top of the C130J PFPS CFP should be used to record
      information needed by the CNI to compute an ETP. These blocks and provided formulas
      also serve as a worksheet for crews to do the manual ETP computation. The ACFP flight
      plan has information on the bottom of the flight plan for manual ETP calculations. (See
      Fig 14.2 for sample CFP.) If using the computer programs or the CNI, annotate
      applicable information on the Master Flight Plan (MFP). If the CNI is used, annotate
      ―CNI‖ in the master flight plan blocks for which the CNI does not present a number.
      11.2.3.3. To compute a manual ETP:
          11.2.3.3.1. Identify and record the LSAF, coast-out point, approximate midpoint of
          the CAT I portion, coast-in point, and FSAF. The coast-out point, approximate
          midpoint, and coast-in point are actual waypoints on the flight plan. The coast-out
          point for ETP purposes must occur after initial level-off.
          11.2.3.3.2. Determine and record the distance from the LSAF to the FSAF (entering
          the two airfields and approximate midpoint into PFPS is an easy way to do this).
          11.2.3.3.3. Determine and record the average groundspeed (GS) for the first-half
          (coast-out to midpoint) and second-half (midpoint to coast-in) of the CAT I portion.
          Divide the respective en-route distance by the en-route time to/from the midpoint to
          determine accurate average GS.
          11.2.3.3.4. Calculate a wind factor (WF1 & WF2) for each half by subtracting the
          flight-planned average TAS from the averaged GS. If a tailwind is experienced the
          WF will be positive. If a headwind is experienced the WF will be negative.
          11.2.3.3.5. Use the provided formulas to compute the time it takes to fly from the
          ETP to the FSAF. Use this time and the second-half-averaged GS to calculate a
          distance from the FSAF that the ETP occurs. NOTE: The ETP will always occur
          upwind of the geographic midpoint.
      TIME in hours (ETP-FSAF) = DISTANCE (LSAF-FSAF)
                                    (WF2 – WF1) + 2TAS
      DISTANCE (ETP-FSAF) = TIME (ETP-FSAF) * GS (2nd half)
          11.2.3.3.6. The INDEX FROM/TO and PROGRESS pages may also be utilized in
          flight to update times and distances to diversion bases along the route of flight. An
          accurate GS must be entered in order to obtain correct ETE calculations.
11.3. Master Flight Plan and Master Plotting Chart.
   11.3.1. One CFP and one plotting chart will be used as master copies for each flight utilizing
   CAT I procedures. Both will be labeled ―MASTER COPY‖ and will be referred to as Master
   Flight Plan (MFP) and Master Plotting Chart (MPC). Both documents must be retained by
   the unit for a period of 90 days following the mission.
   11.3.2. MFP Usage. The MFP is normally maintained by the PM but should be kept readily
   available to both pilots. It will be used to record the following in flight:
      11.3.2.1. All ATC clearances and changes to clearances.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               137


      11.3.2.2. The wind, temperature, altitude, fuels remaining, and the bearing/range
      between the INAV solutions over waypoints bordering and within CAT I Navigation
      airspace.
      11.3.2.3. Any loss or degraded navigation/avionics equipment.
      11.3.2.4. Compass deviation checks.
      11.3.2.5. Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check.
   11.3.3. MFP Symbology. Use the following symbology to ensure that both pilots can easily
   determine which waypoints have been programmed into the CNI-MU, which programmed
   waypoints have been verified, and which waypoints have been transitioned in flight. See
   Figure 14.2 for an example MFP.
      11.3.3.1. Place a check-mark next to the waypoint to signify the waypoint has been
      entered into the CNI-MU and the course and distance have been verified.
      11.3.3.2. Circle the check-mark to signify the coordinates, course and distance in the
      CNI-MU have been verified by another crewmember.
      11.3.3.3. Draw one diagonal line through the circled check-mark to signify the waypoint
      has been passed, reported, and all applicable annotations associated with waypoint
      passage have been completed.
      11.3.3.4. Cross the first diagonal line with another to signify that the aircraft‘s position
      has been plotted on the MPC approximately 60 nm (10 to 15 minutes depending on
      groundspeed) after waypoint passage.
   11.3.4. MPC Usage. The use of a plotting chart is required on every route requiring CAT I
   Navigation. Use an appropriate JNC, GNC, or an Oceanic Planning Chart (OPC). During
   mission planning, draw the course line representing the planned route of flight on the MPC
   and highlight the associated suitable emergency airfields. The PIC will verify this
   information and annotate the chart with his/her signature, date, and mission number/call sign.
   During flight, 10 to 15 minutes (depending on groundspeed) after each CAT I waypoint, the
   PM will Mark Position and then plot the INS-only position on the MPC (using a dot
   surrounded by a triangle) and annotate the marked time and position coordinates adjacent to
   the plot. The PM should compare the plotted point to the course line. This procedure
   confirms that the navigation system is steering the airplane to the correct waypoint.
11.4. Pre-Flight Procedures.
   11.4.1. Pre-flight procedures must include a UTC time check and resynchronization of the
   aircraft master clock, if necessary. Aircraft clock errors resulting in position report time
   errors can lead to an erosion of actual longitudinal separation between aircraft. Acceptable
   time standards that can be used include GPS (corrected to UTC), Naval Observatory Master
   Clock (DSN 762-1401/1069 or 560-6742), and WWV (2500, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000
   kHz).
   11.4.2. Pre-Flight Communications Check. A pre-flight check of the SATCOM (if
   equipped) and HF radios should be made to a suitable agency (operating authority, command
   post or ATC). At least one HF radio must be confirmed operational prior to coast out or the
   mission must be terminated.
138                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   11.4.3. Navigation Initialization and Solutions. Both the AUTONAV and manual GC
   alignment of the INSs result in the required navigation performance needed for RNP RNAV
   operation. The GPS positions may be used as initial positions as long as they agree within
   one-tenth of one minute. If GPS is not available, use precision parking coordinates or, as a
   last resort, obtain coordinates from an airfield diagram published in an approved instrument
   approach book. This position must be checked and verified by both pilots and recorded on
   the MFP.
   11.4.4. Communication/Navigation/Identification Management System (CNI-MS).                In
   addition to Chapter 6 requirements, when configuring for CAT I operations, both pilots will
   verify that the INAV Position Alert 1 is set to 4.0 miles and INAV Position Alert 2 is set to
   8.0 miles on the CNI PROGRESS page. This will generate an INAV POS DIFFERENCE
   Advisory at 4.0 miles and an INAV POS MISCOMPARE Caution at 8.0 miles.
   11.4.5. Loading the Route of Flight. Because CAT I routes usually involve the manual input
   of waypoints not found in the database, and often require aircraft maximum range capability,
   it is critical that both pilots work in sequence and independently to enter accurate route-of-
   flight data. It is not sufficient for one crewmember to simply observe another crewmember
   entering the data. The following steps will be completed by the pilots:
      11.4.5.1. One of the pilots will:
          11.4.5.1.1. Load the route of flight directly from the filed flight plan, MFP or data
          transfer card into the CNI and verify both the magnetic course and the leg distance for
          each waypoint with the MFP. Loading the route directly from the filed flight plan
          may minimize pilot/controller clearance loop (misinterpretation) errors. Label
          waypoints so they can be readily identified for subsequent position reporting. If the
          courses differ by more than 2° or the distances differ by more than 2 NM, the pilot
          will resolve the discrepancy prior to flight. Completion of this step will be annotated
          with a check-mark next to the waypoint.
          11.4.5.1.2. Using the LEGS pages, insert the forecast winds (if available) at each
          waypoint.
          11.4.5.1.3. Verify the total distance to the destination on the CNI PROGRESS page.
          Any significant disparity (more than 25 NM to allow for SIDs/STARs and
          approaches) in the total distance between the CNI and MFP will require a recheck of
          the ramp position and waypoint coordinates.
      11.4.5.2. The other pilot will verify the waypoint coordinates and course and distance
      information from the opposite side CNI to the MFP. Completion of this step will be
      annotated with the check-mark being circled on the MFP.
      11.4.5.3. If the planned route of flight is a stored route or one loaded during a data
      transfer, verification of waypoint coordinates must still be accomplished by both pilots in
      the same manner.
11.5. CAT I Navigation Procedures.
   11.5.1. This section provides general procedures and guidance for the operation of
   navigation systems on CAT I routes. For navigation system requirements, consider all
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             139


  oceanic airspace as MNPS airspace. Specific procedures for RNP RNAV airspace are
  addressed in subsequent sections.
  11.5.2. Refer to Chapter 4 for the navigation Minimum Equipment List (MEL) for CAT I
  and RNP RNAV operations.
  11.5.3. Navigation System Accuracy Checks.
     11.5.3.1. Ground. After leaving the ramp, perform the INS/INAV groundspeed check by
     stopping the aircraft and checking each pilot‘s groundspeed on the CNI-MUs or
     HDDs/HUDs. Groundspeeds in excess of 1 knot while the aircraft is stationary may
     indicate a faulty INS.
     11.5.3.2. Airborne. Determine INAV position accuracy by comparing it to en route
     NAVAIDs.
     11.5.3.3. Compass Deviation Check. Perform a compass deviation check using both
     INSs and the standby compass prior to entering CAT I airspace. Perform subsequent
     checks after heading changes of 30° (or greater) or every 3 hours. Record the deviation
     in the appropriate block of the MFP. Apply this correction to headings to be flown
     whenever it is necessary to use the standby compass as the sole source for navigation.
     11.5.3.4. Oceanic Navigation Accuracy Check. Prior to coast-out, evaluate/compare the
     accuracy of all navigation solutions. In the event of discrepancies, greater than 4 NM, the
     crew should investigate the cause and determine if CAT I flight is feasible. Record this
     gross error check in the appropriate block of the MFP. If a pure INS position is
     determined to be more than 4 miles in error, an in-flight alignment (IFA) may be
     accomplished provided sufficient time is available prior to entering RNP RNAV or
     oceanic airspace. If coast-out is made at a radial/DME fix, the appropriate radial should
     be selected on the non-active CDI as a further check that the navigation system is
     tracking to the fix.
  11.5.4. Communications. In addition to guidance in Chapter 6, crews will accomplish the
  following:
     11.5.4.1. Emergency Frequency Monitoring. In the interest of safety during oceanic and
     remote area operations (100 NM offshore), flights should maintain a listening watch on
     121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the VHF common frequency.
     11.5.4.2. BIU Backup. Ensure that one of the pilots place their transmission switch to an
     HF radio so that the crew can transmit on HF in case of BIU Backup. The other pilot
     should select VHF 2 for the same reason. VHF 1 will be available on the Get Home
     Control and crew can attempt to relay transmissions to other aircraft on 121.5 until within
     VHF range of ATC.
  11.5.5. Oceanic Clearance: If not received before take-off, the oceanic clearance should be
  obtained prior to the boundary of oceanic airspace IAW FLIP.
     11.5.5.1. The PIC will designate the duties of flying the aircraft and copying/monitoring
     clearances so that they are clearly understood by all crewmembers. The PM will
     normally receive and record the oceanic clearance. Both pilots will monitor and
     crosscheck to ensure that it has been copied correctly and clearly understood.
140                                                  AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      11.5.5.2. The clearance will be recorded on the MFP, and reviewed by both pilots. If the
      oceanic clearance received is different from the planned clearance, use the following
      procedures:
          11.5.5.2.1. Record the new route on the MFP to include applicable updates to ETP
          data.
          11.5.5.2.2. Enter the new waypoints into the CNI in accordance with the pre-flight
          procedures in this chapter.
          11.5.5.2.3. Ensure fuel will still be sufficient to arrive at the destination waypoint
          with required reserves.
          11.5.5.2.4. Mark out the old plotted track and draw the revised plot on the MPC.
          11.5.5.2.5. In no case should this process simultaneously engage the attention of both
          pilots during flight.
   11.5.6. Approaching Coast-out. Prior to coast-out and outside of RNP RNAV airspace it is
   permissible and recommended to use the EGI or GPS (INAV source in AUTO mode) as the
   INAV solution for both CNI-SPs if NAVAIDs are available for monitoring. Prior to losing
   NAVAID reception, the INAV solution that is not the controlling solution must be placed to
   INS. This ensures there is constant comparison of the controlling solution to an independent
   INS solution. Beginning at the coast-out waypoint and continuing through coast-in, CNI-MU
   bearing/range between INAV solutions should be recorded at each waypoint to provide a
   running record of INS drift relative to the controlling solution.
   11.5.7. IFF. Reset Mode 3A code to 2000, 30 minutes after entering Category I airspace.
   11.5.8. MFP and MPC Procedures.
      11.5.8.1. After takeoff, record the takeoff time in the Actual Time of Arrival (ATA)
      block of the departure airfield on the MFP. As soon as practical after takeoff, determine
      a revised Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for each line of the MFP using flight-planned
      leg times and the actual departure time.
      11.5.8.2. Prior to waypoint transition, check the MFP magnetic course and distance to
      the next waypoint against the CNI-MU. The courses should be within 2º and the
      distances should agree within approximately 2 NM. Check and verify that the subsequent
      waypoint is properly programmed. Update ETAs to the next two waypoints.
      11.5.8.3. Overhead the waypoint, confirm the ATA and determine the minutes
      ahead/behind by comparing it to the ETA. Record the CNI-MU bearing/range between
      INAV solutions to provide a running record of INS drift relative to the controlling
      solution. Record the actual fuel remaining above the flight-planned continuation fuel and
      write the difference between continuation fuel and actual fuel remaining in the EXCESS
      block of the MPF. See the in-flight fuel management section of Chapter 14 for
      additional guidance and definitions.
      11.5.8.4. Immediately after waypoint passage, and as soon as the aircraft has intercepted
      its new course, confirm that the aircraft is outbound on its flight planned magnetic course
      to the next waypoint and record the bearing/range between INAV solutions found on the
      INAV 1/3 page.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              141


     11.5.8.5. Record the actual in-flight conditions (altitude, wind, and static air temperature
     (SAT)) above the forecast conditions on the next line of the MFP. Update these
     conditions as well as fuel flow as needed on the PERF CRUISE and LEGS pages in the
     CNI-MU.
     11.5.8.6. If required, complete a position report to the controlling agency in accordance
     with FIH procedures. The layout of the CNI PROGRESS page supports the format of the
     position report; however, ensure that ETAs passed to the controlling agency match the
     ETAs on the MFP. This will enable the pilots to determine if an ETA has changed from
     what was previously reported. If an ETA changes by more than 3 minutes, notify the
     controlling agency. If on a 618 TACC integrated flight management (IFM) mission,
     include the verbiage ―pass to HILDA‖ in your initial position report.
     11.5.8.7. Draw a diagonal line through the waypoint on the MFP to indicate it has been
     passed, reported, and all applicable annotations associated with waypoint passage have
     been completed.
     11.5.8.8. Approximately 60 nm (10 to 15 minutes depending on groundspeed) after
     waypoint passage, MARK the aircraft position and plot the INS-only position on the
     MPC. Record the mark time and position coordinates next to the plot. If the plotted
     position is not within 2 NM of the course center-line, check waypoint coordinates for
     accuracy, ensure the autopilot is tracking correctly in NAV mode, re-check the accuracy
     of the charted course-line, and re-check that the position was plotted correctly.
     11.5.8.9. Cross the first diagonal on the MFP to indicate that the aircraft position has
     been plotted.
     11.5.8.10. When the frequency of waypoints along CAT I route segments is greater than
     one every thirty minutes, full-line entries and plotting can be limited to a minimum of one
     every hour. Full-line entries with the corresponding position plot are required for every
     waypoint involving a change of heading over 20 degrees.
  11.5.9. Routine Monitoring
     11.5.9.1. Because of the possibility of the autopilot disconnecting from the
     altitude/steering modes, regular checks of correct engagement with the navigation system
     should be made.
     11.5.9.2. Crews should monitor aircraft performance and outside parameters, suspect
     potential problem areas, and review the performance manual if the following conditions
     are encountered:
        11.5.9.2.1. The fuel remaining is less that the planned continuation fuel.
        11.5.9.2.2. Any Low Calculated Fuel CNI-MU advisory.
        11.5.9.2.3. ATA at any MFP fix is off by more than ± 5 minutes.
        11.5.9.2.4. SAT differs by more than ± 5ºC from flight planned.
        11.5.9.2.5. Actual winds differ by more than 30º or 15 knots from flight-planned.
        11.5.9.2.6. Any Ahead/Behind Time more than 10% of total planned en route time to
        that point.
142                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          11.5.9.2.7. Hazardous meteorological conditions.
   11.5.10. Approaching Landfall. Use the radar to help identify the coast-in position. When
   the aircraft is approaching the first landfall NAVAID, tune and identify the navigation
   facility and crosscheck the aircraft position. If coast-in is made at a radial/DME fix, the
   appropriate radial should be selected on the non-active CDI as a further check that the
   navigation system is tracking according to the current clearance. Once NAVAID reception is
   assured and flight is not being conducted in RNP RNAV airspace, all INAV solutions can be
   returned to AUTO. If entering BRNAV airspace, AUTOTUNE the NAVAIDS, select
   INS/RAD as the controlling solution, and place the other INAV solution in AUTO. Revert to
   CAT II procedures. Reset POS ALERT and IFF Mode 3 as appropriate.
11.6. Special Certification Airspace Requirements and Procedures.
   11.6.1. The GPS currently installed in the C-130J navigation suite does not meet FAA
   certification requirements for IFR navigation. AFI 11-202V3 allows the GPS to be used as a
   mission enhancement system for en route instrument navigation, if it is used to update a self-
   contained navigation system, such as INS or mission computer, and is checked against other
   approved sources (in this case an RNP-10 certified INS). Therefore, on CAT II routes (not
   including operations in BRNAV airspace), the EGI or GPS can be used as the controlling
   solution for en route instrument navigation if NAVAIDs are available for monitoring. The
   NAVAIDs must be operational and actively monitored. If deviations are observed, crews
   should revert to navigation via ground based NAVAIDs. For operations over CAT I routes
   (not including operations in RNP-10 airspace), the EGI or GPS can be used as the controlling
   solution providing the pilot can monitor its performance using the offside INS as an
   independent navigation source. The EGI or GPS cannot be used as the controlling solution in
   BRNAV or RNP-10 airspace, even when using INS as the sole input source for the EGI.
   11.6.2. The C-130J is certified for RNP-10 and Basic RNAV (BRNAV)/RNP-5 airspace, but
   with operational time restrictions. These certifications are based on raw INS data.
      11.6.2.1. RNP-10 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 10 NM for 95 % of the
      flight. The track containment limit is 20 NM. The C-130J navigation system has been
      certified to meet the requirements of RNP-10 airspace for up to 10 hours from the time
      the controlling INS was commanded to the NAV mode. The pure INS solution is the
      only certified navigation solution for flying in this airspace. Annotate the letter ―R‖ in
      Block 10 of the DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate
      RNP-10 certification.
      11.6.2.2. BRNAV/RNP-5 airspace requires a track keeping accuracy of 5 NM for 95
      percent of the flight. The track containment limit is 10 NM. Minimum equipment to
      operate in this airspace is one INS capable of updates. The INS/RAD or INS-only
      solution will be the controlling INAV solution in this airspace. The INS/RAD solution
      can be used without time restrictions if the solution is being updated from NAVAIDs. If
      the NAVAIDs become unreliable, either through radio failure or denial, the INS-only
      solution will still maintain BRNAV accuracy for 2.6 hours from the time the controlling
      INS was commanded to the NAV mode. If needed, an in-flight alignment may be used to
      restart the time-in-NAV of an INS prior to entry into this airspace. INS/RAD or INS-only
      solution will be selected prior to entering BRNAV airspace. The AUTOTUNE function
      of the CNI-MS must be enabled. BRNAV airspace currently exists throughout the
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               143


      European Region. Because BRNAV airspace exists only where NAVAID reception is
      available, CAT I procedures are not required. Annotate the letter ―R‖ in Block 10 of the
      DD Form 1801 or appropriate block of the ICAO flight plan to indicate BRNAV
      certification.
   11.6.3. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM
   is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific
   aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2
   and the following for RVSM requirements:
      11.6.3.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and
      the transponder, must be fully operational. The AC will request a new clearance to avoid
      this airspace should any of this equipment fail.
      11.6.3.2. Have the autopilot engaged during level cruise, except when circumstances
      such as the need to re-trim the aircraft or turbulence require disengagement.
      11.6.3.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out.           Record
      readings of both altimeters.
      11.6.3.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
      11.6.3.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near
      other aircraft to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
      11.6.3.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into
      RVSM airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
      11.6.3.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required
      equipment.
11.7. Navigation Malfunctions and Failures.
   11.7.1. Should INAV solutions noticeably separate and exceed 8 NM, determine and use the
   INS solution considered most accurate by evaluating both INSs using available radio aids,
   ground mapping radar, and GPS. Highest validity should be given to positions referenced via
   radar. Next highest validity should be given to positions derived via radio aid fixing. When
   left to determine most probable position (MPP) via navigation solution comparisons, two
   agreeing INS positions are more valid than two agreeing GPSs; and two agreeing GPSs and
   one agreeing INS indicate a probable INS problem. Consider INS-radar/NAVAID, INS-INS,
   and INS-GPS position comparisons that are less than 4 NM difference to be valid and in
   agreement. Once the most accurate INS is determined, select it as the controlling solution.
   Update ETAs to ATC if required.
   11.7.2. Situations may arise when crews cannot identify the faulty navigation system by
   simple comparison of positions between navigation solutions. Fly the aircraft halfway
   between the disagreeing INS solutions. Plot both CNI-SP solutions at least once every 30
   minutes on the MPC, labeling the pilot CNI-SP navigation solution MPP1 and the co-pilot‘s
   MPP2. Continue to evaluate outputs from each INS and try to use plotted position
   information to identify adverse trends.
   11.7.3. Malfunctions and failures in MNPS airspace:
144                                                 AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      11.7.3.1. Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment that
      reduces the capability to comply with MNPS prior to MNPS entry will return to a
      suitable airfield with a maintenance repair facility.
      11.7.3.2. Crews experiencing deterioration or failure of navigation equipment after entry
      into MNPS airspace should immediately report the malfunction to the controlling agency
      and subsequent agencies throughout the route of flight. Once the aircraft has entered
      oceanic airspace, the PIC should continue to operate the aircraft in accordance with the
      Oceanic Clearance already received, appreciating that the reliability of the total
      navigation system has been significantly reduced. The PIC should also prepare a
      proposal to ATC with respect to the prevailing circumstances and consult with ATC as to
      the most suitable action.
      11.7.3.3. If an aircraft in MNPS airspace is unable to continue flight in accordance with
      its ATC clearance for reasons such as severe turbulence, aircraft performance problems,
      or pressurization failure, a revised clearance should be obtained as soon as possible. If
      unable to obtain a new clearance, offset 30 NM from the assigned route by turning 90
      degrees from track and maintain altitude if possible. Once offset 30 NM, climb or
      descend to an altitude which differs from those normally used by 500 ft.
   11.7.4. Malfunctions and failures in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace:
      11.7.4.1. Aircraft unable to maintain RNP-10 or BRNAV RNAV tolerances must advise
      controlling agency immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.

                 AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT PROCEDURES

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual,
other portions of this AFI, or other publications.
12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical
contingency tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew
rest limits specified in Chapter 3 of this AFI.
12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a
situation is encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
not available to clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home
station MXG/CC or designated representative, in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1. Other crew
members are not authorized to clear a Red X. EXCEPTION: The PIC may clear Red Xs for
engine covers, pitot covers, intake/exhaust inspections, and gear pins when qualified
maintenance personnel are not available, unless prohibited by the home station MXG/CC or
OG/CC.
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Aircrews are normally not required to service the aircraft; however,
they are qualified and authorized to perform those aircrew maintenance support tasks found in
this volume. The aircrew performs these tasks only in the absence of qualified maintenance
personnel and is designed for support of the aircraft and its mission while away from home
station. Without exception, the applicable checklists will be used during all refueling and de-
fueling operations.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily
   available and the mission would be delayed.
       12.4.1.1. Crew members acting as refueling supervisors and panel operators will comply
       with T.O. 00-25-172 and refueling job guides.
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and chief servicing supervisor (CSS) shall
   ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent servicing (CS) in
   accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews performing Dash-
   1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have cooperation and
   close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous intercom contact with
   fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation. When the aircrew is at
   the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft operations and shall inform the
   CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/safety. In keeping with
   the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CS operations to
   include personnel participating in the refuel.
       12.4.2.1. Use the following guidelines when CS operations are conducted with
       passengers on board:
           12.4.2.1.1. A current and qualified crew member will be designated the passenger
           compartment monitor (PCM) and shall continuously monitor passengers during CS.
           PCMs will not perform other duties during servicing.
146                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          12.4.2.1.2. The AC shall designate a current and qualified crew member to remain on
          the flight deck to monitor interphone and be prepared to broadcast a request for
          emergency assistance on a radio tuned to the appropriate agency with ready access to
          an emergency response team. The PA may be used to direct passenger evacuation in
          an emergency.
          12.4.2.1.3. The PCM shall brief passengers on emergency egress, exits, prohibitions,
          and hazards. Passengers will remain seated but will not wear seat belts during CS.
          Passengers shall turn off all portable electronic devices, except medically required
          devices, prior to servicing.
          12.4.2.1.4. Passengers shall not board/exit the aircraft during servicing.
          12.4.2.1.5. Passengers are not required to ground themselves.
          12.4.2.1.6. Passenger representatives will assist the PCM when passengers board and
          exit. Passengers must remain outside the vapor hazard area, the fuel servicing safety
          zone, oxygen servicing area, and 25 feet from fuel vents during servicing.
          12.4.2.1.7. The AC, or designated aircrew representative, or CSS will advise PCMs
          when to evacuate passengers.
          12.4.2.1.8. Unless environmental conditions dictate, the crew entrance door and left
          paratroop door should remain open and the right paratroop door should remain closed
          and locked during concurrent servicing. The PCM may lower, but not lock, the left
          paratroop door during inclement weather.
          12.4.2.1.9. The PCM shall set the interior lighting as bright as possible to suit the
          combat environment.
          12.4.2.1.10. The loadmaster shall ensure cargo loading or unloading does not
          jeopardize passenger safety. Winching is prohibited. Do not load/unload cargo
          containing explosives, oxygen, flammable gases or liquids during CS.
      12.4.2.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
      12.4.2.3. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is
      authorized. Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel
      servicing. When loading vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either
      completely inside the cargo compartment, or outside of the established fuel servicing
      safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be pressurized. EXCEPTION: Diesel and
      turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can be on-loaded or off-
      loaded without having to stop fuel flow.
   12.4.3. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
   conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235,
   Forward Area Refueling/Rearming Point (FARRP) Operations.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                147


                                           Chapter 13

                CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or
shipping agencies; plans loads; and supervises loading or offloading operations. Performs
preflight and postflight of aircraft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and balance.
Provides for safety and comfort of passengers and troops, and security of cargo, mail, and
baggage during flight. Prepares and rigs equipment for airdrop, and participates in the aerial
delivery of equipment, supplies, and personnel.
   13.1.1. Multiple Loadmaster CRM. Although the C-130J was designed to a one loadmaster
   requirement, situations will arise when more than one will be on board the aircraft. To
   ensure good CRM, the primary loadmaster will assume overall responsibility for completion
   of all checklists and ensure no confusion exists about what duties have been or need to be
   accomplished.
13.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Air freight personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift,
       promptly completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning, computing load
       distribution, and moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure.
       They will advise the loadmaster of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified,
       hazardous, etc.) before starting loading operations to permit proper positioning. They
       will also coordinate traffic activities affecting loading and offloading and assign
       sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air freight personnel are
       responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to or from the
       aircraft cargo door, ramp, or auxiliary ground loading ramps. Under supervision of the
       loadmaster, air freight personnel prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown
       equipment if the aircraft is not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft and tie down
       cargo and equipment, and release tie-down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning, certifying
       load plans, operating aircraft equipment, supervising and directing loading and offloading
       operations, and cargo tie down. He or she is also responsible for entering weight and
       balance data into the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages, and transferring that
       information onto the DD Form 365-4 Form-F. This can either be accomplished
       manually, or electronically using the AFF program and a printer. The loadmaster
       coordinates with the loading crew supervisor to verify cargo against manifests, supervises
       loading operations, and is responsible for safe movement of cargo into and out of the
       aircraft. The loadmaster will notify the PIC, command post, or terminal operations
       officer if loading personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft structure
       is damaged during loading or offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any
       hazardous cargo and cargo jettison ability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft
       loadmaster and loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it
       will compromise flight safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders
148                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      or USAF and MAJCOM publications. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons,
      forward all applicable information, including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM
      standardization and evaluation through standardization channels. AMC personnel attach
      an AMC Form 54. EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster may deviate from load plans
      to facilitate ease of onload or offload of cargo and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft
      reconfiguration without submitting documentation. The aircraft loadmaster must take
      into consideration the next station‘s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the
      aircraft is in proper weight and balance limits.
      13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for
      airlift. Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the
      loadmaster to use his or her best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge,
      to determine the best and safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise,
      they should seek advice of other personnel (i.e., available loadmasters and squadron,
      group, wing, NAF, or MAJCOM standardization personnel).
   13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes
   responsibilities as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1 and provides sufficient qualified personnel
   and material handling equipment for loading or offloading. Loadmaster‘s responsibilities
   and authority are the same as described in paragraphs 13.2.1.2 and 13.2.1.3
   13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment
   airlift mission (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster can
   accept DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of
   equipment being offered for air shipment. This form, validated by two joint inspection
   signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in lieu of the applicable portions of the
   TO 1C-130J-9CL-1. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to document preparation of
   hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration for
   Dangerous Goods.
13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Safety aisles will be according to AFI 11-2C-
130JV3, Addenda A and this chapter.
   13.3.1. When passengers are seated in side facing seats, the loadmaster will ensure there is
   sufficient space between the cargo and the seats to permit passenger leg room. NOTE: All
   passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
   safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisleway will be stowed
   with checked baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.2. At least one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops.
   (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
   egress.) Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered an obstruction.
   13.3.3. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
   palletized netted cargo or cargo secured with straps. When the cargo, either palletized or
   non-palletized, is secured with chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. EXCEPTION:
   Maintain 30 inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying occupied litters.
13.4. Pre-mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             149


     13.4.1.1. Aircraft loadmasters in coordination with aerial port personnel establish
     loading times. Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence will be
     established, with PIC coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading time
     is governed by the type of load and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized,
     etc.) not by port saturation or management of aerial port workload levels. When
     reporting for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the air terminal operation center
     (ATOC) or other designated location to obtain load breakdown and assist in load
     planning as required.
     13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated
     statement (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not
     available due to a lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a
     cargo listing containing manifest information must accompany the load.
     13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If
     this is not possible, annotate the AF Form 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At
     non-AMC stations, 463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. Use
     only authorized cargo straps as directed by MAJCOMs.
  13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. It may be necessary
  for crews to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability.
  These functions include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport
  requirements are met. Do not hesitate to contact 618 TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control
  Center; DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial 618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as
  to who may travel to specific locations or passport/visa requirements. Aircraft operating
  within other MAJCOMs which have operational command and control over that aircraft will
  contact the appropriate AOC/AMD for specific details. File a copy of the passenger manifest
  with the most responsible on-scene agency if there is no base operations, or other agency
  responsible for filing the manifest.
     13.4.2.1. Manifesting.     Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest
     passengers at locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
         13.4.2.1.1. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible to ensure all passengers are
         properly manifested.
         13.4.2.1.2. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity, aircrew will
         manifest all passengers using DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, and leave a copy
         of the manifest with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the
         location of the manifest on the flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
         13.4.2.1.3. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing will
         also be completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
         Piracy (Hijacking).
     13.4.2.2. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned to the
     in-flight kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF Form 129, Tally
     In-Out, is received from fleet to relieve the loadmaster of meal accountability.
     13.4.2.3. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation
     Working Capital Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including ANG and AFRC flown
150                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      missions) for passenger consumption only. See AMCI 24-101 Volume 14, Military
      Airlift Passenger Service, Section F, for those flight missions that are authorized to
      receive complimentary snacks and beverages. The squadron or port operations officer
      will ensure snacks and beverages are placed on board when departing AMC stations.
      When departing from other stations and no snacks or beverages are to be placed onboard,
      the loadmaster may obtain required snacks and beverages from the local in-flight kitchen.
      Direct the in-flight kitchen to bill the accounting and finance office at the aircraft's home
      station. Record all unused snacks and beverages on AF Form 129 and return to the in-
      flight kitchen for turn-in credit.
      13.4.2.4. Ensure the auxiliary power unit is shut down before boarding passengers unless
      adequate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crew member
      will assist passengers at the bottom of the steps, and the loadmaster will assist in seating
      passengers. Ensure that only adult, English-speaking passengers are seated next to
      emergency exits. Do not seat mothers with infants, children under 15 years old or
      physically challenged persons in seats adjacent to emergency exits. Make every effort to
      seat families together.
      13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor
      has the option to either hold the child or place him or her in a Department of
      Transportation-approved infant car seats (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children
      processed through AMC-owned or controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer
      mandatory, all passengers (duty and space A), regardless of age, are required to be
      assigned their own seat. This policy will provide an infant and their sponsor with a
      dedicated seat allowing the use of an ICS seat at the sponsor‘s discretion; this mirrors
      current FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats,
      harnesses, and vest child restraints.
         13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, these seats will be secured
         to a seat using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant seats during any phase of
         flight.
         13.4.2.5.2. If the mission aircraft is equipped with aft facing "airline style‖ seats,
         secure the seat in the same manner as in an automobile. However, if the aircraft is
         configured with side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is adequately secured.
         The design of the sidewall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack to
         secure the ICS. Crewmembers may need to reroute the seatbelt by crossing the belt,
         between the sidewall and the seatback webbing, routing the belt back through the
         webbing and through the securing point on the ICS. When removing slack from the
         seatbelt ensure the buckle remains on one side or the other so that it can be easily
         accessed for release. The PIC is the final authority for determining whether the ICS
         is adequately secured.
      13.4.2.6. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight.
      In the case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with tanker
      airlift control elements or deploying unit commanders to decide if downloading of
      baggage is necessary.
13.5. Passenger Handling.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             151


  13.5.1. The loadmaster is key to good passenger relations. The following common sense
  rules should be observed:
     13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
     13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics,
     criticism of other personnel or organizations.
     13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and
     willingness to help.
  13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine
  passenger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals;
  address them collectively only when making announcements.
  13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
     13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however,
     judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any
     one time. Encourage passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to
     concern for their safety, passengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep on cargo or
     baggage.
     13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
         13.5.3.2.1. Cabin temperature.
         13.5.3.2.2. Passengers with small children.
         13.5.3.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
     13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will
     not be permitted access to checked baggage.
     13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to
     make passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
     13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good
     judgment when requesting this authority.
  13.5.4. Meal Service. WARNING: Under no circumstances will the Flameless Ration
  Heaters (FRH), included in MREs, be handled inside the aircraft. If activated, the FRH will
  become extremely hot and may cause personal injury.
     13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at
     point of departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected
     flight conditions prior to meal preparation.
     13.5.4.2. Passengers having a boarding pass, AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket,
     showing a meal was ordered are served meals in the following sequence:
         13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
         13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
         13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
     13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
152                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          13.5.4.3.1. After takeoff, distribute box lunches to passengers who boarded at the
          previous station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and
          passengers board at subsequent stations.
          13.5.4.3.2. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the
          passenger's AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket.
       13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
       13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio
       contact with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of
       spoiled meals (by menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the
       manufacturing agency, and manufacturer's lot number.
       13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, the loadmaster
       will annotate the individual's boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized.
       Inform passengers they may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or
       destination terminal.
13.6. Over-Packed Meal Procedures: Not Used.
13.7. Enroute and Post Flight Duties.
   13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is
   responsible for planning and loading the outbound load. When no crew change occurs, the
   inbound loadmaster is responsible for onloading or offloading cargo.
   13.7.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment,
   any missing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information
   pertinent to through passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous
   material, perishables, etc.).
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers
   are aboard, the loadmaster will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.
13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the
weapon. This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat)
   may carry basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or
   clips removed until immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will
   coordinate with the loadmaster prior to directing personnel to load any weapons. This
   applies to airborne assaults and airland missions.
   13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic
   ammunition loads in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective.
   Magazines or clips will not be inserted into weapons.

                                          Chapter 14

                                      FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. This chapter is designed to assist planners and pilots in fuel planning airland and
airdrop missions, with or without low-level segments. A fuel plan is required for all flights
except local area training flights with established standard fuel loads. The CFPS Computer
Flight Plan (CFP) and TOs 1C-130J-1-1 and 1C-130(C)J-1-1 Performance Manuals are the
primary preflight references. All preflight planning must be verified with aircraft mission
computer (MC) performance prior to departure. The planning procedures in this chapter apply to
AMC, ANG, AFRC, PACAF, and USAFE units on AMC-tasked and 618 TACC-flight managed
missions in addition to local missions flown by AMC units. Missions should be planned at
altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage.
14.2. Definitions. The following definitions apply to fuel planning, and take precedence over
similar definitions published elsewhere.
   14.2.1. CAT 1 route: Any route that does not meet the requirements of a CAT II route,
   including tactical navigation and overwater routes. This is designated on the ACFP by the
   ampersand symbol (&).
   14.2.2. Contingency fuel: An identified extra to compensate for unforeseen circumstances
   during any phase of flight (i.e. unforecasted weather, launch delay, etc)
   14.2.3. Required ramp fuel load (RRFL): Minimum fuel required at engine start to complete
   tasked mission.
   14.2.4. Depressurization fuel: Additional fuel required to protect the aircraft and occupants
   in the event of a cabin depressurization followed by an extended diversion to an alternate
   airport at low altitude where fuel consumption is increased.
   14.2.5. Tankered fuel: Additional fuel carried through a primary destination for use on a
   subsequent leg.
   14.2.6. Wing Relieving Fuel: Additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter
   wing bending moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations.
14.3. Alternate Selection. Plan fuel to an alternate only when AFI 11-202V3 or AFI 11-2C-
130JV3 require the filing of an alternate.
   14.3.1. When only one alternate is required, use the closest suitable airfield meeting mission
   requirements (such as special requirements for hazmat or patients) and 11-202V3 weather
   criteria.
   14.3.2. If two alternates are required, use the two closest suitable airfields meeting 11-202V3
   weather criteria and fuel plan to the more distant of the two.
   14.3.3. When selecting an alternate, suitable military airfields are preferred if within 75
   nautical miles of destination. (The ACFP default distance to an alternate is 75 nautical miles.
   Consequently, where the alternate is less than 75 nautical miles from the primary destination,
   ACFP will assume that the airfield is 75 nautical miles away.)
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                    155


   14.3.4. ACFP will provide a route of flight to the primary alternate if greater than 75 miles
   from the destination.
14.4. Fuel Planning Profiles. En route cruise airspeed normally should be planned at a
constant TAS IAW the performance manual. Missions planned using Long Range Cruise (LRC)
provide little flexibility in the air when faced with actual fuel critical situations requiring the
conservation of additional fuel. Divert profiles should be fully fuel planned and represent what
will actually be flown. Altitudes should be no higher than the ATC cruise ceiling per the
performance manual.
   14.4.1. CFPS CFP Planning Profile. The C-130J performance module of PFPS is certified to
   calculate accurate fuel planning information. Crews should use the C130JHI.frm form when
   printing the CFP so both the route of flight and fuel planning information can be recorded.
   Use the fuel planning blocks on the top of the flight plan and Table 14.1 for fuel planning.
   En Route and Minimum Landing Fuel will be automatically printed. Pilots will ensure an
   accurate Recovery Fuel is input on the CFPS Premission/Configuration/Fuel screen so
   calculated Continuation Fuels used during in-flight fuel monitoring are valid. When
   alternates are required, pilots may need to accomplish and print two iterations of the flight
   plan to incorporate an accurate Recovery Fuel. For example: After the first calculation,
   pilots will extract the en route fuel to the alternate from the last line of the flight plan and add
   this to the initial Recovery Fuel. A second flight plan will be calculated once the
   Premission/Configuration/Fuel screen is updated with the correct Recovery Fuel. If an
   alternate is required, use the Turnpoint/Additional Points screen to insert the designated
   airfield as a DVT (divert) type after the intended landing airfield. See Figure 14.2 for a
   sample of a completed CFPS CFP and Figure 14.3 for a sample of a completed fuel planning
   worksheet.
   14.4.2. Aircrew will receive an Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP) when on an
   Integrated Flight Management (IFM) mission from C2. ACFP will produce a .rte file that
   PFPS can recognize and open. The flight plan can be opened in PFPS, and an accurate fuel
   plan can be obtained. This will also allow the C130JHI form to be printed if desired, and a
   mission card can be cut from this flight plan. The PFPS flight plan may be easier for
   aircrews to log required entries when in CAT I airspace.
   14.4.3. Manual USAF Form 70 Profile. In the event pilots must rely on a manually-
   calculated USAF Form 70 (or equivalent), the C-130J Fuel Planning Worksheet found on
   Figure 14.1 should be used for fuel planning. En route fuel is manually calculated by adding
   the required components supplied as standard or derived from charts or tabulated data in the
   applicable Performance Manual. Fuel To Climb charts are used to manually calculate climb
   fuel. Range Summary or Specific Range charts are used to manually calculate cruise fuel
   from Top-of-Climb (TOC) to overhead destination using an average gross weight.
   Continuation Fuel for each leg will be calculated using the following formula:
  Continuation Fuel = Fuel Remaining (beginning of leg) – Landing Fuel + Recovery Fuel
   14.4.4. C-130J Mission Computer Profile. The C-130J Mission Computer plans a complete
   climb, cruise, descent, approach and landing profile based on the inserted LEGS DATA and
   PERF CLIMB, CRUISE, and DESCENT factors. Accurate leg fuels, as calculated by the
   MC, are dependent on pilots ensuring that airspeed, altitude, winds, temperature, and fuel
   flow are correctly represented for each leg of the route and updated/corrected as in-flight
156                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   conditions change. Because the flight profile is more than a planning tool, pilots must use
   good judgment when inputting forecast/planned information versus actual performance and
   conditions. During preflight and at each waypoint, the Fuel On Board (FOB) for remaining
   legs will be compared against the flight planned Continuation Fuel to ensure there is
   sufficient fuel to continue the mission as planned in order to meet or exceed destination fuel
   requirements. Once airborne, the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page is calculated (not
   sensed) using sensed Fuel Flow versus Time. Update the FOB on the PERF INIT WEIGHT
   page to the amount indicated by the totalizer only when the totalizer amount is less than the
   calculated FOB. Use the most conservative of the FOB or totalizer readings when recording
   fuel remaining during in-flight fuel monitoring. The CNI will provide a FUEL QTY ERROR
   advisory when the PERF INIT WEIGHT FOB and totalizer readings differ by more than
   2500 lbs for more than 10 minutes. Reserve Fuel (FIXED on PERF INIT WEIGHT) should
   be set to the Recovery Fuel value. The CNI supplies a Low Calculated Fuel advisory when
   the calculated EXTRA fuel on the PERF INIT WEIGHT page falls below zero. Destination
   and Alternate Landing Fuel can be obtained from the MC. Flight crews will use the MC to
   evaluate and verify destination landing fuel status after mission changes and reroutes and
   whenever a divert is required and/or extensive weather avoidance routing is required.
14.5. Fuel Planning Procedures. Aircrew and mission planners will manage aviation fuel as a
limited commodity and precious resource. Fuel optimization will be considered throughout all
phases of mission planning and execution. Excessive ramp and recovery fuel adds to aircraft
gross weight and increases fuel consumption. Do not ferry extra fuel beyond optimum
requirements for safe mission accomplishment and training objectives. Aircrew and mission
planners will optimize flight plans and flight routing for fuel efficiency. In-flight procedures
such as climb/descent profiles and power settings should also be considered for efficient fuel
usage. Aircrew should employ the following aviation fuel optimization measures without
compromising flight safety or jeopardizing mission/training accomplishment::
   14.5.1. Plan a 45-minute fuel reserve at destination or alternate (when an alternate is
   required).
   14.5.2. For remote destinations, holding is authorized in lieu of an alternate airport. In such
   situations, use 2+00 hrs reserve fuel (1+15 holding in lieu of an alternate and 0+45 reserve).
   14.5.3. For all missions, calculate an additional 30 minutes of contingency fuel.
   Contingency fuel should not be considered reserve fuel since crews may burn some or all of
   their contingency fuel. Contingency fuel will be included in the initial required ramp fuel
   load (RRFL).
   14.5.4. AMC‘s ACFP will calculate reserves and contingency fuel as holding fuel.
   Computer flight plans will have 1+15 holding when combining 0+45 reserve and 0+30
   contingency fuel (for remote destinations ACFP will plan 2+00 holding plus 30 minutes
   contingency).
   14.5.5. Reserve and contingency fuel will be computed using consumption rates providing
   maximum endurance at 10,000 feet MSL. When computing reserve and contingency fuel for
   remote destinations, use consumption rates providing maximum endurance at 20,000 feet
   MSL.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             157


  14.5.6. Calculate CAT 1 fuel reserve as 10% of flight time fuel over the CAT 1 route/route
  segment, not to exceed 1+00 fuel at normal cruise.
  14.5.7. Thunderstorm forecasts will be based on the DD form 175-1 or equivalent. Where
  weather forecast conditions dictate, add the following fuel corrections:
     14.5.7.1. 1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions.
     14.5.7.2. 1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the route of
     flight.
  14.5.8. Minimum landing fuel is 3,000 lbs. This fuel accounts for gauge errors. Do not
  include this 3,000 lbs of fuel in the 45-minute fuel reserve and 30 minute contingency fuel
  calculations.
  14.5.9. Routes will be planned at 320 KTAS (260 KTAS below 10,000 MSL), except for
  oceanic crossings. For oceanic crossings, routes will be planned at 300 KTAS or 290 KTAS,
  optimized for gross weight.
  14.5.10. Using all available planning tools (including ACFP) and guidance in this chapter,
  PICs will determine the RRFL. When actual fuel load exceeds the RRFL by more than 2,200
  lbs, defuel the aircraft to the RRFL.
  14.5.11. Tankering fuel for convenience is prohibited. 618 TACC-sanctioned tankered fuel
  is deemed operationally necessary, and will be included in the RRFL. When there is a
  conflict between an on-time departure and defueling, the 618 TACC deputy director of
  operations (DDO) will determine which takes precedence The OG/CC will make this
  determination when serving as execution authority for the mission.
  14.5.12. Wing Relieving Fuel
     14.5.12.1. Calculate Wing Relieving Fuel using the flight manual weight limitations
     chart for the aircraft‘s planned cargo load. Enter the chart with the aircraft empty weight
     and cargo weight, then read across to determine the fuel required to remain within limits.
     Add enough Wing Relieving Fuel, if required, to ensure that Recovery Fuel does not fall
     below the fuel required to remain within limits.
     14.5.12.2. All local and JA/ATT missions flying low-level will initially takeoff with
     main tanks full to reduce the effects of wing upbending and increase the center wingbox
     service life. Decreased takeoff fuel in the main tanks can decrease the center wingbox
     service life as much as 47 percent.
  14.5.13. Optimize fuel loads. Mission plan for the required ramp and recovery fuel. Ensure
  ramp fuel is correct upon arrival at aircraft.
  14.5.14. Minimize use of APUs. Use ground power units when practical
  14.5.15. Delay engine start time. Units should establish and implement local engines start
  time standards.
  14.5.16. Minimize aircraft weight through optimized fuel loads and reduction of equipment
  not necessary to accomplish the mission.
  14.5.17. Establish C2 and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification of
  mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time.
158                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


14.6. Depressurization Fuel. During all flight portions crews are to consider the possibility of
exercising depressurization procedures.
   14.6.1. Crews are to calculate the fuel required to reach a recovery airfield in the event of
   depressurization at the ETP. Plan to arrive at the recovery airfield with 0+30 minutes reserve
   fuel at optimal cruise speed for the depressurization transit altitude. Transit should be
   planned at 10,000 feet MSL. Plan on burning all other fuel.
   14.6.2. Prior to flight, crews must compare the calculated depressurization fuel with the
   RRFL to determine if additional fuel is required.
14.7. In-flight Fuel Management. For a flight plan and corresponding fuel log to be most
meaningful for in-flight fuel monitoring, the actual cruise altitude should be no lower than 2000
feet below planned altitude and the airspeed no lower than planned airspeed –10 KTAS or higher
than planned airspeed + 10 KTAS. If initial cruise conditions do not fall within these
parameters, the PIC should strive to reach (or beat) them as soon as possible.
   14.7.1. Fuel consumption will be monitored by comparing the FOB to predicted Fuel
   Remaining and the required Continuation Fuel on the flight plan. At a minimum,
   consumption comparisons will be accomplished and recorded on the Master Flight Plan
   (MFP):
       14.7.1.1. As soon as practical after initial level off.
       14.7.1.2. At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 1 hour.
       14.7.1.3. At convenient waypoint intervals not to exceed 30 minutes if aircraft
       performance is critical or marginal (actual fuel is less than Continuation Fuel, icing
       conditions, weather avoidance, etc.).
       14.7.1.4. Any time re-routing occurs or a lower altitude than what was flight-planned is
       required to be flown.
   14.7.2. The fuel recording portion of the master flight plan may be discontinued at the
   discretion of the PIC when ALL of the following conditions have been met:
       14.7.2.1. The Equal Time Point (ETP) has been crossed (CAT I routes).
       14.7.2.2. Fuel systems and quantity indicators are functioning normally.
       14.7.2.3. There is obvious extra fuel and the +EXCESS fuel trend is favorable.
   14.7.3. On CAT I routes, prior to the ETP, if the EXCESS fuel becomes negative the PIC
   will consider and accomplish one of the following recommended actions:
       14.7.3.1. Change the flight profile to ensure planned performance is reacquired and Fuel
       Reserves at destination will be met or exceeded.
       14.7.3.2. Continue and land short of the intended destination (i.e., First Suitable Airfield
       (FSAF)) or proceed to intended destination based on an updated weather forecast that no
       longer requires an alternate.
       14.7.3.3. Return to the departure base or the Last Suitable Airfield (LSAF).
   14.7.4. Flight Plan Changes and Diversion. When mission requirements or ATC dictate a
   change to the planned mission or route, the fuel must be recalculated to ensure safe
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               159


   completion of the flight. It is not practical to complete a new flight plan fuel log so the MC
   is the primary method of deciding if a mission change or reroute can be accommodated.
       14.7.4.1. For an unplanned or directed en route divert, the FROM/TO page, with an
       associated cruise ground speed, can be used to determine an Estimated Time En Route
       (ETE). Using a 4000 lbs/hr fuel burn, crews should be able to decide if the new routing
       is achievable without adverse effects on destination fuel. Do not accept a reroute that
       adversely depletes the destination Reserve Fuel as prescribed in this chapter.
       14.7.4.2. If the en route change does not affect the intended destination, then in-flight
       fuel monitoring will consist of comparing the MC predicted Remaining Fuel with Flight
       Plan Continuation Fuel at the next point common to the reroute and the original flight
       plan. After any route alteration, crews should actively monitor fuel state by recording the
       Fuel Remaining values at abeam positions of the original flight plan and using the
       ―Abeam‖ function of the INDEX/FIX INFO PAGE to crosscheck fuel status.
   14.7.5. Declare ―Emergency Fuel‖ when it is determined that the aircraft will land with less
   than 3000 lbs. Declare ―Minimum Fuel‖ to ATC when it is determined that the aircraft will
   land with less than 3000 lbs plus the Required Reserve.

                        Fuel required from engine start through landing at the intended
EN ROUTE                destination. Components include engine start/taxi/take-off (STTO),
                        climb, cruise, approach fuel. En route fuel will be obtained from the
                        CFPS CFP, or Performance Manual.
STTO                    A component of en route fuel. Fuel required for engine start, taxi, and
                        takeoff. Normally 800 lbs. For known taxi delays or additional engine-
                        running ground time in excess of 30 minutes, add 30 lbs/min.
CLIMB                   A component of en route fuel. Fuel required from takeoff through climb
                        to initial cruise altitude. If a manual calculation is required, the
                        applicable Performance Manuals‘ Fuel to Climb charts will be used.
                        Unless required for mission accomplishment, plan to climb no higher
                        than ATC cruise ceiling per the Performance Manual.
CRUISE                  A component of en route fuel. Fuel required from TOC to overhead
                        intended destination. If a manual calculation is required, the applicable
                        Performance Manuals‘ charts will be used.
APPR                    A component of en route fuel. Fuel required for approach, and landing
                        from overhead destination. Normally 700 lbs, which accounts for one
                        instrument approach of no longer than 10 minutes. For longer
                        approaches, follow-on visual, and/or radar pattern work, compute fuel
                        burn at 85 lbs/min.
CAT I RESERVE           Fuel for 10% of en route time along a CAT I route/segment computed at
                        cruise fuel flow, not to exceed 1 hour of flight time.

ALTERNATE        Fuel required from intended destination to alternate, or most distant
                 alternate when two are required. Flown at optimum cruise altitude,
                 using direct routing to the alternate at LRC airspeed. Fuel for a missed
                 approach (2000 lbs) and second approach at the alternate airfield is
                 required when the visibility-only weather criteria is used to determine
                 the suitability of the original destination.
REQUIRED         45 minute reserve, using maximum endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft MSL
RESERVE          (20,000 ft remote fields). Required overhead destination or alternate (if
                 alternate is needed).
CONTINGENCY      30 minutes, using max endurance airspeed at 10,000 ft MSL (20,000 ft
FUEL             MSL for remote fields).
DEPRESSURIZATION Fuel from the ETP to a recovery airfield, with 30 minute reserve.
FUEL             Calculated at LRC airspeed and 10,000 ft MSL. Plan on burning all
                 other fuel. Compare with RRFL to see if additional fuel is required
                 before flight.
MINIMUM LANDING 3000 lbs (Required). If it is determined that the aircraft will land with
FUEL             less than this amount, a fuel emergency exists and ATC must be
                 informed. This entry is separate from required reserve and contingency
                 fuel.
RECOVERY FUEL    The minimum planned landing fuel at intended destination. This is the
                 sum of the Minimum Landing Fuel, Required Reserve, Wing Relieving
                 Fuel (if required) and Alternate Fuel (if required). This fuel is critical
                 calculating accurate Continuation Fuels for each leg; it must be updated
                 in the Premission Configuration screen of PFPS if using a CFPS CFP.
CONTINUATION     Fuel required at the beginning of each leg to be able to proceed to the
FUEL             intended destination and land with the required Recovery Fuel.
TANKERED FUEL    Fuel for succeeding legs without refueling.
UNIDENTIFIED            The difference between RRFL and actual ramp fuel. This figure should
EXTRA                   not exceed 2,200 lbs of RRFL.
WING RELIEVING          Additional fuel kept in the main tanks intended to counter wing bending
FUEL                    moments and keep the aircraft within flight manual weight limitations.
WEATHER                 1,500 lbs if forecast thunderstorms are scattered or numerous along the
AVOIDANCE               route of flight.
ICING                   1,000 lbs if the route of flight has known or forecast icing conditions

                              COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides general C-130J combat mission planning guidance for
planners and aircrews by standardizing procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all
missions. Planners and aircrews should reference AFTTP 3-3.C-130J for detailed planning
guidance. The aircrew is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the mission materials.
   16.1.1. Mission Planning.     One full day of planning should be allocated for complex
   missions.
16.2. Drop Zone (DZ) Restrictions.
   16.2.1. Authorized DZ types and restrictions are listed in AFI 13-217. Ensure DZs have
   adequate dimensions. Both pilots will verify CNI-MU CARP information with a valid DZ
   survey. Refer to AFI 13-217 for DZ survey information/requirements/applicability.
       16.2.1.1. Use of unmarked DZs requires OG/CC approval for unilateral missions, and
       MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for all other peacetime training missions. Authorization to
       use unmarked DZs for contingency airdrops will be contained in SPINs, ATO or given by
       the DIRMOBFOR.
       16.2.1.2. Area DZs are not authorized for mission computer directed airdrops.
   16.2.2. Multiple Points of Impact (MPI). MPI placement must be coordinated with the user.
   16.2.3. Multiple passes should be coordinated with the user during planning when necessary.
   If multiple passes are likely, they should be annotated on the chart. Unplanned racetracks
   may be performed provided crews have verified obstruction clearance.
16.3. Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) Restrictions.
   16.3.1. Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) Selection. Detailed assault zone criteria and
   illustrations can be found in AFI 13-217. Both pilots will verify CNI-MU LZ information
   with a valid LZ survey.                 Refer to AFI 13-217 for LZ survey
   information/requirements/applicability.
   16.3.2. Approaches. Plan approaches to the ALZ IAW AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and airfield
   identification procedures published in the OPORD or SPINS. Brief any deviations from
   approaches described in AFTTP 3-3.C-130J.
   16.3.3. Aircraft Performance Planning. Aircraft performance limitations must be planned
   for ALZ operations. Determining the maximum takeoff gross weight for worst-case
   conditions is an acceptable method to simplify mission execution.
16.4. Route Planning. Low-level flights will be planned using tactical corridors. Tactical
corridors should be planned as wide as possible, to provide maximum situational awareness and
flexibility. The standard width for a tactical corridor is 3 NM. Tactical corridor width can vary
from 1 NM minimum either side of centerline, to as wide as desired (10 NM either side is the
max recommended). Corridors do not have to be symmetrical, but must be annotated when
different from the standard. As a rule of thumb, tactical corridors should be wide over flat
terrain and narrow in mountainous terrain.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               167


   16.4.1. Low-Level Altitude Restrictions. The following minimum altitudes are established
   for C-130J operations. Higher altitudes may be dictated by FLIP/ICAO procedures, training
   considerations, terrain, or operational directives. WARNING: Aeronautical charts do not
   depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a change in terrain until it exceeds the
   chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot tower sat on terrain with
   an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC (1:500,000) with a contour
   interval of 500 feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above charted
   terrain. Additionally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the highest
   terrain as in the case of gradually rising elevations. Planners must ensure accurate terrain
   analysis evaluates both spot elevations and the highest contour level. CAUTION: Some
   charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g., JOG and TLM
   charts in some areas of the world).

Figure 16.1. Inherent Chart Error.




      16.4.1.1. Day VMC En Route. Fly no lower than 300 feet AGL modified contour
      altitude above the terrain using visual references and radar altimeter. Aircrew must
      comply with restrictions of paragraph 16.6.8 to fly below 500 feet AGL.
      16.4.1.2. NVG En Route Altitude. Fly no lower than an indicated altitude of 500 feet
      above the highest spot terrain elevation, or 400 feet plus one basic contour interval above
168                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within the tactical corridor. Fly
      with reference to the pressure altimeter, using the radar altimeter as a backup.
      16.4.1.3. Non-NVG En Route Altitude. Fly no lower than Minimum Safe Altitude as
      defined in paragraph 16.4.3. Fly with reference to the pressure altimeter, using the radar
      altimeter as a backup.
      16.4.1.4. Man-Made Obstacles. All man-made obstacles must be avoided by 1 NM
      laterally, or 500 feet vertically, unless visually identified. This applies for both day and
      night flights, and also includes obstacles outside of the planned tactical corridor. NOTE:
      If the planned altitude for a leg is more than 500‘ above a man-made obstacle, this
      obstacle is not a factor. When flying at 500‘ AGL or below, all obstacles are a factor.
   16.4.2. IMC En Route Altitude. Fly no lower than 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous
   terrain) above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot
   elevation) within 5 NM of route centerline (10 NM outside the US unless 5 NM authorized
   by MAJCOM/A3). Round this altitude to the next 100-foot increment.
      16.4.2.1. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training
      Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be the computed leg MSAs unless a higher
      altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B.
   16.4.3. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides
   additional terrain and obstacle clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require
   interruption of low-level operations (route disorientation and equipment malfunctions or
   when either pilot must leave the seat during low-level operations, etc). Plan MSA at an
   indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle,
   terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the
   highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NM of route centerline to
   include turn radius. An MSA will be computed for each leg, route segment, or entire low-
   level route. See Figure 16.2.
   16.4.4. Assembly. Assembly altitude under IFR will be at or above the MEA or MOCA on
   published airways. On direct flights off airways assembly altitude will be no lower than
   OROCA, ORTCA, or an altitude that provides 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain)
   above the highest obstacle within a radius of 5 NM of the course. Under all conditions,
   aircrews ensure assembly altitude provides terrain and obstacle clearance for the formation.
   16.4.5. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC terrain
   clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low-level structure. Planners
   may compute several ESAs for route segments transiting significant terrain differentials, or a
   single ESA for the entire low-level route. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in
   mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the highest obstruction to flight within 22 NMs of
   planned route centerline.
      16.4.5.1. ESA will be computed for the route and conspicuously annotated on the chart.
      NOTE: Climbing to ESA may put the aircraft in a controlled altitude structure requiring
      coordination with air traffic control agencies. NOTE: Pressure altimeters are calibrated
      to indicate true altitudes under international standard atmospheric (ISA) conditions. Any
      deviation from these standard conditions will result in erroneous readings on the
      altimeter. This error becomes important when considering obstacle clearances in
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               169


      temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft's altitude is below the figure indicated
      by the altimeter. Refer to the flight information handbook to determine correction.
   16.4.6. If planning low-level flight in areas where barometric altimeter settings will not be
   available, plan altimeter check points along the route to determine more accurate altimeter
   settings.

Figure 16.2. Minimum Safe Altitude.




16.5. Airdrop Restrictions: WARNING: DZ surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction
clearance. Planners and aircrew are responsible for ensuring clearance through mission
planning/chart preparation.
   16.5.1. Day VMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum airdrop altitudes as specified in AFI 11-231,
   visually avoiding high terrain and obstacles in the vicinity of the drop zone.
   16.5.2. NVG Drop Altitude. Fly NVG En Route Altitude through slowdown. After
   slowdown, when the drop zone is in sight and will remain in sight, or when a positive
   position is identified and adequate terrain and obstacle clearance is assured, the aircraft may
   descend to the AFI 11-231 specified minimum drop altitude.
   16.5.3. Non-NVG Drop Altitude. If not on NVGs, fly no lower than an indicated altitude of
   500-feet above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot
   elevation), or 400-feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour,
   whichever is higher, within 3 NM of run-in centerline from slowdown through escape, or as
170                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher. After slowdown, when the drop zone is in
   sight and will remain in sight, or when a positive position is identified and adequate terrain
   and obstacle clearance is assured, the aircraft may descend to the AFI 11-231 specified
   minimum drop altitude.
   16.5.4. IMC Drop Altitude. Fly minimum IMC drop altitudes at 500 feet above the highest
   obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet
   plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher,
   within 3 NM of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point, or as specified in
   AFI 11-231, whichever is higher. During a parallel descent, do not descend to IMC drop
   altitude until the last aircraft of the element or formation is at or past the DZ entry point and
   all aircraft are within 3 NM of the run-in centerline.
       16.5.4.1. IFR Drop Corridor. As defined in FAR Exemption 4371, the corridor where
       aircraft may transition between IMC en route altitude and IMC drop altitude to perform
       airdrop operations. The beginning of the corridor, the IFR Drop Corridor Ingress Point,
       is a maximum of 40 NM from the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point (co-located with the
       DZ Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes not lower than 500 feet above the
       highest obstruction to flight (manmade obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or
       400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever
       is highest, within 3 NM either side of centerline.
   16.5.5. All airdrop missions must comply with appropriate FAA airspace restrictions. For
   all airdrops in uncontrolled FAA airspace, ensure a NOTAM is filed with the Flight Service
   Station nearest the objective area at least 48 hours in advance of the intended activity,
   regardless of actual or forecast weather. NOTAM information will include:
       16.5.5.1. Name of the nearest city or town and state.
       16.5.5.2. Date and time period of intended activity.
       16.5.5.3. Number and type of aircraft.
       16.5.5.4. Altitudes.
       16.5.5.5. When IMC operations are planned, include IFR Drop Corridor Ingress and
       Egress points of the route segment expressed in radial and DME from a NAVAID.
16.6. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific
country or theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes will not be planned
or flown:
   16.6.1. With less than 1 NM separation (3 NM in excess of 250 KIAS) when below 2,000
   feet AGL from known sensitive environmental areas such as hospitals, fish hatcheries,
   ostrich and emu farms, large poultry complexes, recreation areas, institutions, and similar
   locations.
   16.6.2. With less than 3 NM separation from prohibited airspace.
   16.6.3. Less than 3 NM separation from nuclear power plants.
   16.6.4. Through restricted airspace, except transition or termination in such areas where the
   planning unit is a primary using agency or has approval of the controlling agency.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               171


   16.6.5. In weather conditions less than specified in this AFI and AFI 11-202V3.
   16.6.6. Below 1000' AGL within a 2000' radius over cities or towns shown as magenta
   shaded areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts.
   16.6.7. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically
   designated as prohibited or restricted areas.
   16.6.8. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
       16.6.8.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
       16.6.8.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and surveyed for
       300-foot AGL operations. NOTE: This restriction does not apply to one-time-use
       routes. Consult FLIP AP/1B for published Military Training Route restrictions.
16.7. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for
mission briefings and aircrew reference. Planners may construct the chart using computerized
mission planning systems if available. Digital Map displays are the primary reference for low-
level navigation; however, the crew will carry a tactical navigation chart. As a minimum,
tactical navigation charts will be annotated with the following: turn points, IP, DZ, course line,
course data, CHUM data, and ESA. CHUM coverage must include all 30‖ quadrangles
(1:500,000 scale charts use 30‖ quadrangles) that touch or are adjacent to quadrangles touched
by the tactical corridor. ESA will be computed for the route and conspicuously annotated on the
chart.
16.8. Mission Forms and Logs. The crew will carry an approved flight log in accordance with
AFI 11-202V3.
16.9. Navigation System.
   16.9.1. Verification. Visual references and radar Offset Aim Points (OAPs) can be used to
   verify/update navigation systems according to airland or airdrop mission requirements. The
   following solutions are acceptable for verifying/updating the navigation system, listed in
   order of preference:
       16.9.1.1. OAPs generated by a targeteer during planning, with precision coordinate and
       elevation information, including those listed in PFPS. Advance coordination with a
       targeteer is normally required. If targeteer information is not available, mission planners
       and aircrew may generate OAPs. Ideally OAPs should be 5-10 miles apart and
       approximately 45 degrees off of plotted course, if able.
       16.9.1.2. Visual Reference Points (VRPs) generated during planning, which include any
       identifiable point with precision latitude/longitude and elevation information. This
       includes turn points, or identifiable structures such as an ECHUM tower.
       16.9.1.3. Ad hoc references derived from a navigation chart, such as a road intersection
       or power-line crossing.
   16.9.2. Required Navigation Accuracy. The navigation accuracy required for a given
   mission will vary depending on the type of mission and other considerations. For all airdrops
   and Self-Contained Approaches (SCAs) plan to verify navigation accuracy within 10 minutes
   of slowdown/FAF. For IMC routes, navigation accuracy will be verified at least hourly.
172                                                 AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


16.10. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low-
level environment. At a minimum, discuss aircrew coordination, division of duties, and threat
avoidance.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              173

                                AIRLAND EMPLOYMENT

17.1. General. Detailed airland employment guidance can be found in AFTTP 3-3.C-130J
Chapter 7, Airland Operations.
17.2. Passengers on Tactical Flights.
   17.2.1. MAJCOMs will establish guidance for when passengers are allowed on tactical
   flights. When flying AMC missions AMCI 11-208 governs this requirement.
17.3. Self Contained Approaches.
   17.3.1. The C-130J mission computer can derive approach course guidance using the LZ
   approach or IPRA functions. The approach course guidance however, does not ensure
   obstacle clearance. The mission computer only mathematically derives a final approach
   course and glide path from pilot input data.
   17.3.2. VMC SCAs. Aircrew may build and fly a SCA as necessary. The PM will visually
   ensure obstacle and terrain clearance.
   17.3.3. IMC SCAs. IMC SCAs will be flown with the following restrictions:
       17.3.3.1. SCAs will only be flown from a published SCA approach as defined in AFI 11-
       202V3 paragraph 8.3.1.1.
       17.3.3.2. Required navigation accuracy for an SCA is:
          17.3.3.2.1. To provide an early indication of degraded navigation accuracy, set the
          POS ALERT(s) at 0.03 NM ( 55 yards; FOM 2) and 0.05 NM ( 110 yards; FOM 4).
          If both INAV solution FOM's are less than or equal to 4 and no POS ALERTS
          (INAV Pos Miscompare ACAWS/INAV Pos Difference ACAWS) are indicated,
          navigation airdrop accuracy (300 yd CEP) is verified. If these conditions are not met
          a radar or visual update is necessary to verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to
          performing SCAs. NOTE: Anytime a position bias (update) has been added to the
          EGI INAV solution, displayed FOM values do not reflect the result of the bias.
          17.3.3.2.2. For any SCA, verify navigation accuracy within 10 minutes of the FAF.
          Do not descend from FAF altitude without verifying the active ship solution if any of
          the following conditions exists: either FOM greater than 4, INAV Pos Miscompare
          ACAWS, or INAV Pos Difference ACAWS.
       17.3.3.3. Both pilots will verify runway point of intercept (RPI) or LZ coordinates in the
       mission computer. Both pilots will verify CNI-MU LZ information with a valid LZ
       survey. Refer to AFI 13-217 for LZ survey information/requirements/applicability.
       17.3.3.4. WX minimums will be IAW the published procedure, but no lower than 300-1.
17.4. Tactical VFR Approaches.
   17.4.1. Operations to unmarked/unlit LZ are IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFI 13-217.
174                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   17.4.2. During the turn to final, do not slow below normal 100% flap approach speed. For
   maximum effort landings, the pilot will not slow to Maximum Effort Approach Speed prior
   to initiating the roll out on final. Roll out on final no lower than 150 ft AGL.
17.5. Engine Running Offload and Onload (ERO) Procedures.
   17.5.1. Use ERO procedures when necessary to expedite aircraft or cargo movement, meet
   time requirements of unit moves, joint training exercises, and contingencies or enhance crew
   duty day.
   17.5.2. With the exception of small arms ammunition (Hazardous Class/Division 1.4), do not
   use ERO procedures when explosive cargo is involved unless authorized in the JA/ATT,
   exercise, operation or contingency air tasking order.
   17.5.3. ERO procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. Material handling
   equipment should be used if palletized cargo is to be onloaded or offloaded. PICs must
   assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe operations. NOTE: At
   their discretion, ACs may ERO any category of passenger. The number of passengers and
   amount of baggage to be onloaded or offloaded should be taken into consideration. The well
   being of the passengers should be considered at all times. WARNING: Do not onload or
   offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and door at the same time. Paratroop
   doors will not normally be used.
   17.5.4. After the aircraft is slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all tie-downs
   except one forward and one aft restraint, open the aft cargo door, and position the ramp no
   lower than horizontal. WARNING: If a combat offload of pallets is to be accomplished
   before offloading vehicles, do not remove any vehicle restraint until after the combat offload
   is complete. NOTE: Loadmasters will ensure vehicles and troops proceed directly aft of the
   aircraft at least 50 feet before turning and/or 300 feet before stopping. NOTE: If
   downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required. Ensure the PERF WT
   and WT and BALANCE pages of the CNI-MU are updated prior to takeoff.
17.6. Combat Offload Procedures.
   17.6.1. Combat offload provides a means of offloading single, multiple, and married pallets,
   airdrop platforms, or container delivery systems (CDS) without the use of material handling
   equipment. The controlling C2 commander, MAJCOM/A3 or the DIRMOBFOR may
   authorize combat offload when conditions warrant. The method of combat offload will be
   determined by the aircrew based on the conditions at the offload site. Unit OG/CC may
   approve unilateral combat offload training.
   17.6.2. Combat Offload Method A.
      17.6.2.1. A taxiway or ramp at least 500 feet long is required, however, 1,000 feet is
      desired to provide a margin of safety. When pallets, platforms, or containers are
      offloaded one at a time, use a longer taxiway based on the number to be offloaded.
      WARNING: Many explosive items have specific ―drop‖ criteria that, if exceeded, render
      the item useless or dangerous to the user. Explosives and munitions shall not be combat
      offloaded without approval of MAJCOM/A3/DO. EXCEPTION: Small arms
      ammunition (hazard class and division 1.4) and explosives/munitions rigged for airdrop
      may be combat offloaded without MAJCOM/A3/DO approval. CAUTION: When using
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             175


     method A on excessively rough, sharply undulating, or battle-damaged surfaces, damage
     to the aircraft ramp may occur. Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will
     reduce aircraft oscillation. The AC must determine if the offload area will permit the
     offload operation to be conducted without damage to the aircraft or equipment.
     17.6.2.2. Combat offload of fragile and sensitive cargo items (i.e., computers) that might
     be damaged by standard method A combat offload procedures will not be attempted
     without user concurrence. If the nature of the mission dictates that cargo must be
     offloaded, aircrews may lower the ramp to approximately 18 inches above the ground.
     CAUTION:         Do not attempt to lower the ramp below horizontal unless the
     UNRESTRICTED RAMP TRAVEL light is illuminated.                             EXCEPTION:
     UNRESTRICTED RAMP TRAVEL light will not illuminate when cargo compartment
     lights are in the covert position. NOTE: Normal Method A procedures cannot be used
     with the ramp below the horizontal position. In this case the loadmaster must release the
     locks using either the PLCUs or RECP Jettison switches.
     17.6.2.3. Pallets may be offloaded, without ballast, using this method provided their total
     weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds, and the height of the pallets fall within cargo
     height jettison limit in section III of the flight manual or section V of the cargo loading
     manual
     17.6.2.4. Airdrop rigged platforms up to 24 feet in length may be offloaded, without
     ballast, using this method provided their weight does not exceed 12,000 pounds. NOTE:
     Pallets and airdrop rigged platforms over 12,000 pounds total weight may be offloaded
     using this method, provided ballast or cargo equal to the difference between 12,000
     pounds and the weight of the pallets or platforms (to be offloaded) remains in C through
     F compartments during offload. Example: A 17,000 pound married pallet or airdrop
     platform requires 5,000 pounds of ballast or cargo to remain in C through F
     compartments during the offload.
     17.6.2.5. CDS may be combat offloaded using this method. The static line retriever will
     be used via manual activation; manual gate cut may be done if the retriever is inoperative.
     With Centerline Vertical Restraint (CVR), offload will be accomplished one side at a
     time if the total bundle weight exceeds 12,000 pounds. Non-CVR sticks may be
     offloaded if the total weight is less than 12,000 pounds. Without the CVR, if the total
     weight of the bundles exceeds 12,000 pounds bundles should be restrained in groups of
     four or less and offloaded one group at a time. For the unplanned combat offload of non-
     CVR bundles, restrain the bundles as described above. Perform an initial offload via the
     static line retriever, and on sequential offload remove aft restraint before clearing the
     pilot to taxi. Consider the slope of the offload site which may cause bundles to roll aft
     upon removal of restraint.
  17.6.3. Combat Offload Method B. Use this method to offload married pallets that do not fit
  the category for method A or for which no ballast is available for married pallets weighing
  between 12,000 to 15,000 pounds. Use four serviceable steel 55-gallon drums under each
  pallet to be offloaded. The correct number of steel drums needed to complete this type of
  offload must be available at the offload site or must accompany the load when conditions at
  the offload site are unknown. WARNING: The maximum weight for pallets to be off-
  loaded across the ramp at any one time when using method B is 15,000 pounds. Do not use

   method B for airdrop-rigged platforms to prevent binding the platform under the vertical
   restraint rails.

                                           Chapter 18

                                  AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. The standard formation building block is a two-ship element. Procedures and
techniques to fly C-130J formation are outlined in AFTTP 3-3.C-130J. Formation procedures
will be conducted in accordance with this chapter and TO 1C-130J-1. Consider safety, aircrew
capability, proficiency, survivability and user needs when planning any formation tactic.
18.2. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and mission
times based on ATO, FRAG, planning staff input, fuel requirements, parachutist /passenger
comfort, taxi distances, briefing requirements, etc.
18.3. Weather Minimums. Formation takeoff and landing minimums are the minimums for the
lowest suitable approach at the airfield, but not lower than 200 feet and one-mile visibility (RVR
5000). During IFR formation operations, adhere to both ceiling and visibility minimums. If
departure ceiling or visibility is below published landing minimums, but above 200 feet and one-
mile visibility (RVR 5000), the formation may take off if the requirements for a departure
alternate as prescribed in Chapter 6, are met. If the runway has dual RVR readouts (approach
and departure end of the runway) both ends must be at least RVR 5000.
18.4. Ground Operations. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length with four engines
operating and two aircraft lengths with two engines operating (or two in HOTEL mode).
18.5. Takeoff.
   18.5.1. The minimum takeoff interval between aircraft is 15-seconds.
   18.5.2. For aborts during takeoff, the PM immediately transmits an abort call (three times
   using formation position number) on interplane. When the situation allows, the PM will
   repeat the call on primary ATC frequency. Clear the runway as quickly as safety allows.
   Succeeding aircraft not on takeoff roll will hold until the runway is clear.
   18.5.3. To prevent damage to succeeding aircraft, do not advance power above flight idle
   until takeoff roll is started. Use a judicious and smooth application to achieve takeoff power
   18.5.4. Formation leaders ensure all aircraft use the same altimeter setting.
18.6. En Route.
   18.6.1. At no time will aircraft be operated within 500 feet of another aircraft.
   18.6.2. Lead will announce airspeed changes of 15-knots or greater at night.
   18.6.3. Inadvertent weather penetration procedures will be briefed to the formation. At a
   minimum, formation lead will direct the formation to a safe altitude, heading, airspeed, and
   aircraft spacing.
18.7. No-Drop Decisions. When a situation requires a formation no-drop, lead will notify the
flight over interplane and all aircraft will acknowledge. If radio silence is necessary, lead will
pass a SKE no-drop command. Do not transmit individual aircraft no-drops outside the aircraft.
18.8. Visual Procedures.
178                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   18.8.1. Departure and Assembly. After crossing the runway departure end, wingmen adhere
   to ATC requirements and assume the pre-briefed position.
   18.8.2. Visual Rejoins.
      18.8.2.1. The rejoining aircraft will establish a minimum of 500 feet altitude separation
      until the formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.
      18.8.2.2. Rejoining aircraft must be in position at formation altitude by ―green light‖ to
      accomplish the drop.
   18.8.3. Tactical Formation Maneuvering (TFM). Both pilots must be on NVGs to fly TFM
   at night.
   18.8.4. Visual Run-In and Slow Down. Unless tactically unsound, night slowdowns will
   include an aural or visual signal.
   18.8.5. Drop Execution. Regardless of the type of drop spacing being used (In-Trail, pre-
   briefed, etc.), the minimum drop spacing is 2,000 feet from the preceding aircraft. Wingmen
   will notify lead if they see any situation which may result in an unsafe or inaccurate airdrop.
   Refer to paragraph 19.9 for additional wingman airdrop considerations.            WARNING:
   Dropping at a lower altitude than the preceding aircraft may cause loads or personnel to
   impact the lower aircraft, causing damage or fatalities.
      18.8.5.1. CDS Airdrop. Minimum spacing to drop CDS in formation is 6,000 feet.
      Aircraft not dropping CDS and using 50 percent flaps may establish normal spacing
      following a CDS aircraft. WARNING: Attempting to regain position by only reducing
      power or airspeed places the aircraft in a nose high, low-power situation and may lead to
      a stall.
   18.8.6. Visual Recovery.
      18.8.6.1. For formation recoveries roll out on final at no less than 150 feet AGL.
      18.8.6.2. Desired landing interval is 20 seconds; minimum is 15 seconds.
      18.8.6.3. Do not perform touch-and-go landings during formation recoveries.
18.9. CAPS/SKE Procedures.
   18.9.1. Accomplish a SKE flight command check prior to takeoff by passing a single
   command.
   18.9.2. Priority of maneuvers/signals is (1) altitude, (2) heading, and (3) airspeed. Element
   leads immediately relay acceleration, deceleration, climb, and descent CAPS commands.
      18.9.2.1. All altitude changes will be signaled.
      18.9.2.2. Lead will signal unplanned heading changes of more than 10 degrees.
      18.9.2.3. Lead will signal accelerations and decelerations of greater than 10 knots.
      CAUTION: With autothrottles engaged in CAPS mode, commanded speeds may be
      above aircraft configuration limiting speeds.
   18.9.3. Do not couple the autothrottles to CAPS until in formation position and at assembly
   altitude.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               179


  18.9.4. SKE Orbit/Rejoin Procedures.
     18.9.4.1. Maintain 1,000 feet above or below the formation until in position and
     permission to rejoin is granted.
     18.9.4.2. The rejoining aircraft must be stabilized in position at formation altitude by the
     IP (IMC) or by one-minute prior to TOT (VMC) to accomplish the drop.
  18.9.5. SKE En route Procedures. Normally, spacing for CAPS/SKE formation is 4,000 feet
  for wingman and 8,000 feet for element leads. Minimum spacing between aircraft will be
  4,000 feet. The cross-path distance for en route navigation is 700 feet in the most appropriate
  direction for the wingman aircraft and 0 cross-path for element leads. NOTE: During long
  missions, mission commanders may extend en route spacing and/or cross-track to reduce
  fatigue, as required.
  18.9.6. Loss of SKE. Notify lead in all cases.
     18.9.6.1. Loss of all SKE indications in IMC will require a breakout. Use the following
     procedure if an alternate plan was not briefed:
     18.9.6.2. If the formation is in straight and level flight climb 500 feet, turn 30 degrees in
     the safest direction from the base heading for 30 seconds, and then return to base
     heading. If the formation is in a turn roll out and climb 500 feet. Lead will contact (or
     direct contact to) ATC for a separate clearance. CAUTION: Performing the above
     maneuvers in a radar pattern may place an aircraft outside of protected airspace.
  18.9.7. Run-In and Slowdown. Do not initiate descent from the last en route altitude until
  the following conditions are met:
     18.9.7.1. Own position is positively known.
     18.9.7.2. Within 3 NM of DZ run-in course centerline; to include CAPS/SKE timing
     only wingmen.
     18.9.7.3. At or past the DZ entry point; to include wingmen for parallel descents.
  18.9.8. Drop Execution.
     18.9.8.1. Overrunning aircraft must regain position by one minute prior to TOT, or a no
     drop will be executed.
     18.9.8.2. CDS Airdrop. Minimum spacing to drop CDS in formation is 6,000 feet.
     Aircraft not dropping CDS and using 50 percent flaps may establish normal spacing
     following a CDS aircraft. WARNING: Attempting to regain position by only reducing
     power or airspeed places the aircraft in a nose high, low-power situation and may lead to
     a stall.
  18.9.9. DZ Escape. Assembly altitude after the drop will comply with normal IFR en route
  altitude restrictions.
  18.9.10. SKE Recovery.
     18.9.10.1. The flight director should not be in CAPS mode once established on the final
     approach segment for SKE instrument approaches. This does not preclude CAPS
     information from being displayed via the AMU.
180                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      18.9.10.2. The interval between aircraft on final is 6,000 feet desired, 5,000 feet
      minimum.
      18.9.10.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Approaches. There are no
      procedures for executing ICAO 45/180 and 80/260 procedure turn approaches, so these
      are flown single-ship only.
   18.9.11. Do not perform touch-and-go landings during formation recoveries.
18.10. I-CDS Formation Airdrop.
   18.10.1. All aircraft will fly to an individual JPADS-MP derived CARP. If an aircraft is
   unable to calculate its own CARP using the JPADS-MP a separate aircraft can pass CARP
   coordinates provide that the load‘s flight station and weights are the same. Otherwise, the
   aircraft must build (or have ready) the other aircraft‘s load information in order to calculate
   an individual CARP and pass it back.
18.11. Guided Container Formation Airdrop.
   18.11.1. All aircraft will fly to an individual JPADS-MP derived CARP or be within the
   Launch Acceptability Range (LAR). In addition, formation spacing must provide a
   minimum of 3 seconds spacing between the last bundle dropped from the previous aircraft
   and the first bundle dropped from subsequent aircraft. This is to prevent any bundles
   entangling as the bundles attempt to ―fly‖ to the same point in space. Instead of flying
   formation to the JPADS-MP derived CARP, consider sending aircraft on different routing
   within the LAR.
18.12. C-130E/H/J Interfly Procedures.
   18.12.1. When a C-130E/H departs behind a C-130J, use a 15-second minimum takeoff
   interval. When a C-130J departs behind a C-130E/H, use a 25-second minimum takeoff
   interval to ensure an adequate safety margin for wake vortices and to prevent compression on
   takeoff. For safety purposes, the above assumes all aircraft use their standard takeoff power
   setting for the formation takeoff.
   18.12.2. SKE En route Spacing. All CAPS/SKE formations are flown with standard 2-ship
   elements. EXCEPTION: The wingman in each element maintains 4000 feet ITRK (A-
   PATH) from their element, with 500 feet XTRK (X-PATH) to the right of lead.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             181

                                            AIRDROP

19.1. General. This chapter prescribes C-130J employment procedures for all airdrop
operations. For additional guidance and information, refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130J.
19.2. Identification of Airdrop Items. It may be necessary to identify items that are not
dropped or land off the DZ in unsecured areas.
   19.2.1. Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering system:
       19.2.1.1. Class I - Subsistence.
       19.2.1.2. Class II - Individual equipment.
       19.2.1.3. Class III - POL.
       19.2.1.4. Class IV - Construction materials.
       19.2.1.5. Class V - Ammunition (include the type):
           19.2.1.5.1. Type ―A‖ - Small arms.
           19.2.1.5.2. Type ―B‖ - Mortars.
           19.2.1.5.3. Type ―C‖ - Artillery.
       19.2.1.6. Class VI - Personal demand items.
       19.2.1.7. Class VII - Major end items (vehicles, howitzers, etc.).
       19.2.1.8. Class VIII - Medical supplies.
       19.2.1.9. Class IX - Repair parts.
       19.2.1.10. Class X - Non-military programs (i.e. agricultural supplies).
   19.2.2. Airdrop loads may also be identified by the following internationally recognized
   color coding system for combined operations:
       19.2.2.1. Red - Ammunition and weapons.
       19.2.2.2. Blue - Fuel and lubricants.
       19.2.2.3. Green - Rations and water.
       19.2.2.4. Yellow - Communications equipment.
       19.2.2.5. White (or Red Cross on white background) - Medical supplies.
       19.2.2.6. Black and white stripes - Mail.
19.3. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will carry enough equipment in the airdrop kit to satisfy
load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of airdrop kits will include cloth-backed
pressure sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, 550 cord, 5 cord, 80 pound cotton webbing,
and four carabiners (NSN 4240-01295-4305 or equivalent carabiner with a locking mechanism)..
19.4. Joint Airdrop Inspection.
182                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      19.4.1. The loadmaster will complete the applicable DD Form 1748, Joint Air Drop
      Inspection Records, before takeoff (see AFJI 13-210(I) Joint Airdrop Inspection Records,
      Malfunction/Incident Investigations, and Activity Reporting for specifics) and verify the
      accuracy of cargo and troop documentation. The Joint Airdrop Inspector will check all
      possible items for all loads to be dropped during that mission. For loads that require in-flight
      rigging, the Joint Airdrop Inspector will annotate on the DD Form 1748 which items are
      required to be completed during flight, and the aircrew loadmasters will ensure those items
      are completed and checked. No further inspections by the Joint Airdrop Inspector are
      required. Reject loads with inaccurate or unavailable weights, or loads hazardous to flight.
      NOTE: Equipment not rigged per 13C-series technical orders (TO) or Joint Special
      Operations Command (JSOC) 350 series manuals, requires a waiver from the appropriate
      MAJCOM Tactics agency/division.
      19.4.2. If airdrop and airland loads are carried at the same time, see the restrictions listed in
      Table 19.1 These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads from interfering with
      airdrop rigging equipment.

 exceed 96‖ width.


19.5. Verification Of And Marking Airdrop Loads. A pilot will verify with the loadmaster
the actual number and type of parachutes, load weights, sequence of extraction, and position of
loads in the aircraft agree with planned CARP data. If an individual load has a different type or
number of parachutes from other loads, compute a CARP for each load to ensure all loads will
land on the DZ. Base drop altitude on the item requiring the highest drop altitude. For training
missions (e.g. unilateral, exercise, or JA/ATT) the loadmaster will coordinate with the pilots to
ensure all equipment, drogues, CDS containers, and standard airdrop training bundles are marked
with the aircraft call sign and date. If more than one load is dropped on the same pass, mark
loads with order of exit from aircraft. Markings will be placed on the extracted end of the load,
and on the drogue line. (EXCEPTION: If more than one CDS bundle is dropped on the same
pass, mark only the first container out.)
19.6. Safety Equipment. Personnel required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during
low-level phases will wear protective headgear from the combat entry point to the combat exit
point if an actual threat is briefed. EXCEPTION: Personnel performing water jumps. All other
personnel will be seated with the seat belt fastened. Loadmasters will lower their helmet visor
when near an open door (except when NVGs are used) and keep it lowered until doors are
closed. As a minimum, the helmet will be worn from the start of the Drop Preparation Checklist
until the Completion of Drop Checklist. Loadmasters will be on interphone from completion of
Drop Preparation Checklist until Completion of Drop Checklist.
   19.6.1. During airdrops, the loadmaster will wear either a restraint harness, or a parachute,
   from the Drop Preparation Checklist until doors are closed and locked. WARNING: During
   the aircrew briefing, the AC will brief the loadmaster(s) when the mission profile requires
   flight below 800 feet AGL with the door(s) open. WARNING: The loadmaster(s) must wear
   a restraint harness when performing duties near an open exit above 14,000 feet MSL or
   below 800 feet AGL.
   19.6.2. When used, fit the restraint harness and adjust the lifeline before flight as follows:
       19.6.2.1. Troop door drops. Connect the hook to tiedown ring 32D (26D) and adjust the
       lifeline to allow mobility only to the troop door for installation of the paratroop retrieval
       strap/bar and to accomplish other emergency procedures.
       19.6.2.2. Troop door SATB drops. Connect the lifeline as described in paragraph
       19.6.2.1 or to a floor/ECHS rail tiedown ring at LS 977 (FS 677) and adjust to allow
184                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


       mobility only to the troop door being used. If mobility is required forward of the troop
       doors during troop door SATB drops the lifeline may be attached to a floor/ECHS rail
       tiedown ring at LS837 (FS637) and adjust to allow mobility only to the troop door being
       used.
       19.6.2.3. Ramp and door operations.
          19.6.2.3.1. Personnel tailgating operations. Connect the hook to a floor/ECHS
          tiedown ring no further aft than LS 1017 (FS 737). Adjust the lifeline to allow
          mobility to LS 1115 (FS 835), and to a point that will preclude the wearer from
          exiting the aircraft. Restraint harness lifelines may be attached to an unused anchor
          cable provided the anchor cable stop is positioned and taped at LS 1017 (FS 737).
          19.6.2.3.2. HE/CDS/CRRC/CRL/JPADS operations.               Connect the hook to a
          floor/ECHS tiedown ring no further aft than LS 1017 (FS 737), adjusting to a point
          that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft. Restraint harness lifelines may
          be attached to an unused anchor cable provided the anchor cable stop is positioned
          and taped at LS 1017 (FS 737). WARNING: Except for an actual contingency,
          towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the survivability of the aircraft and crew,
          the restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that would
          allow the loadmaster to fall outside the aircraft. WARNING: Anchor cables will be
          inspected IAW TO 1C-130J-9.
   19.6.3. Loadmasters will wear a life preserver unit (LPU) for operations over bodies of water
   when doors are open and a parachute is worn instead of a restraint harness.
   19.6.4. During an airdrop, occupants in the cargo compartment will have a seat belt fastened.
   Personnel required to be mobile will wear a restraint harness, or wear a parachute before
   doors are opened. EXCEPTION: Flight examiner loadmasters are exempt from wearing a
   parachute or restraint harness while conducting flight evaluations provided they do not go aft
   of LS 977 (FS 677). For static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before
   doors are opened. EXCEPTION: Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes (racetracks) may
   stand and hook up with doors open if they are forward of the aft edge of the wheel wells LS
   817 (FS 617.). NOTE: Do not use flight deck restraint harness for airdrops.
   19.6.5. JA/ATT or exercise orders will determine if additional parachutes are required for
   user safety personnel during training missions. If JA/ATT orders require parachutes for
   safety personnel, crews will ensure they are on board prior to departure. User safety
   personnel will provide their own parachutes for contingency missions.
19.7. Airdrop Weather Minimums and Wind Restrictions. Refer to AFI 13-217 and AFI 11-
231 for airdrop weather minimums and wind restrictions. SATB drops may be accomplished at
less than 300 and 1/2 with DZCO approval. The Army Drop zone safety officer determines the
suitability of surface conditions on the DZ for airdrops during joint training operations.
19.8. Airdrop Checklist. Airdrop checklists are located in the TO 1C-130J-1.
   19.8.1. The ―twenty minute‖, ―ten minute‖, ―six minute‖, ―one minute‖, and ―five second‖
   advisories are required for all personnel airdrops. Only the ―one minute‖ and ―five second‖
   advisories are required for equipment and CDS airdrops.
19.9. Navigation Accuracy.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                              185


   19.9.1. To provide an early indication of degraded navigation accuracy, set the POS
   ALERT(s) at 0.03 NM ( 55 yards; FOM 2) and 0.05 NM ( 110 yards; FOM 4). If both INAV
   solution FOM's are less than or equal to 4 and no POS ALERTS (INAV Pos Miscompare
   ACAWS/INAV Pos Difference ACAWS) are indicated, navigation airdrop accuracy (300 yd
   CEP) is verified. If these conditions are not met a radar or visual update is necessary to
   verify/improve navigation accuracy prior to performing airdrops. NOTE: Anytime a
   position bias (update) has been added to the EGI INAV solution, displayed FOM values do
   not reflect the result of the bias.
   19.9.2. For all airdrops, verify navigation accuracy within 10 minutes of slowdown. Do not
   continue an airdrop without verifying the active ship solution if any of the following
   conditions exists: either FOM greater than 4, INAV Pos Miscompare ACAWS, or INAV Pos
   Difference ACAWS.
19.10. Methods of Aerial Delivery.
   19.10.1. The primary method of aerial delivery for the C-130J is automatic release at the
   computer derived release point. See paragraph 16.9.2. for navigation system accuracy
   requirements.
   19.10.2. Both pilots will verify DZ point of impact coordinates in the mission computer.
   Both pilots will verify CNI-MU CARP information with a valid DZ survey. Refer to AFI
   13-217 for DZ survey information/requirements/applicability.
   19.10.3. Airdrops are not allowed if a CARP XTK or CARP VERT is displayed. NOTE:
   During low drift situations (3 degrees or less); if the wingman maintains the correct CAPS
   wing position and the lead aircraft is on the correct run-in, a CARP XTK advisory may
   result. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.C-130J for techniques to avoid this situation. During
   contingency operations, the DIRMOBFOR or equivalent may approve manual drops
   (pushing green light switch based on visual reference to PI only) for increased flexibility of
   PI placement. EXCEPTION: Continuing an airdrop with CARP XTK displayed or
   performing a manual drop is permissible for alternate airdrop methods.
19.11. High Altitude Airdrop Requirements. Only essential personnel who have
accomplished appropriate physiological training described in AFI 11-403 are permitted on
mission aircraft for airdrops above 10,000 feet MSL.
   19.11.1. A continuous supply of 100 percent oxygen will be used by all personnel during
   unpressurized operations above 10,000 feet MSL. Crewmembers will follow established
   MAJCOM oxygen mask requirements. Exceptions are as follows:
      19.11.1.1. Students of the Military Free Fall School, Parachutist Course (MFF-PC) will
      have a qualified USAF Physiology Technician onboard and positioned in the aft portion
      of the cargo compartment when aircraft is between 10,000-13,000 feet MSL for longer
      than 30 minutes. Unpressurized flights between these altitudes will not exceed 2 hours.
      Under circumstances where a USAF PT is unavailable, a US Army 18 Delta Medic or
      USAF Pararescue trained and certified by HQ ACC/SGOP may be used. Supplemental
      oxygen will be supplied by an oxygen console provided by the Military Free Fall.
      19.11.1.2. Students of the Military Free Fall School, Jumpmaster Course (MFF-JM):
      There is no requirement for a USAF PT to be onboard for unpressurized operations
186                                                 AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL. However, the parachutists will breathe 100%
      oxygen for a period of at least 3 minutes, immediately prior to jumping if their time
      between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL exceeds 30 minutes. Supplemental oxygen will be
      supplied by an oxygen console provided by the Military Free Fall School.
      19.11.1.3. All other parachutists may operate without supplemental oxygen during
      unpressurized flights up to 13,000 feet MSL provided the time above 10,000 feet MSL
      does not exceed 30 minutes each sortie. Jumpmasters may operate without supplemental
      oxygen for an additional 60 minutes within the 10,000-13,000 foot MSL envelope
      provided their duties do not include jumping. For unpressurized flight above 13,000 feet
      MSL, or exceeding the 30-minute envelope between 10,000 and 13,000 feet MSL, the
      use of an individual mask and regulator is required for all jumpers. The user is
      responsible for all supplemental oxygen requirements. Aircraft equipment will not be
      used by the parachutists.
      19.11.1.4. High Altitude Operational Requirements for Physiology Technicians (PT).
      PTs will support high altitude airdrop missions IAW AFI 11-409. At least 1 USAF PT is
      required per 16 personnel on the aircraft, up to a maximum of 3 PTs, for all airdrops
      conducted at or above 18,000 feet MSL. In addition, consider requesting a PT for long
      duration airdrops above 13,000' MSL. Additional PTs will be required when PTs need
      training or a waiver granted to exceed exposure limitations. All CONUS requests for PT
      support must be made to USAF HAMS current operations desk (DSN 779-6303 /
      Commercial 618-229-6303). PACAF requests must be made to Kadena AB, JA (DSN
      315-634-1967). NOTE: The USAF High Altitude Airdrop Mission Support Program
      Manager, 203 West Losey Street, Building 1700, Suite 1600, Scott AFB IL 62225 may
      authorize variations to the PT-to-personnel ratio.
   19.11.2. Prebreathing requirements. All personnel will prebreathe 100 percent oxygen
   below 10,000 feet pressure altitude or cabin altitude on any mission scheduled for a drop at
   or above 18,000 feet MSL for times shown in Table 19.2 Prebreathing will be completed
   before cabin altitude ascends through 10,000 feet MSL. All personnel will remain on 100
   percent oxygen until cabin altitude is below 10,000 feet MSL. A break in prebreathing
   requires the prebreathing period to be restarted, or the airdrop will be restricted to below
   10,000 feet MSL. When prebreathing on the ground is required, a launch crew may assist the
   primary crew as needed to assure prebreathing requirements are met. Prebreathing will be
   conducted with a personally fitted oxygen mask attached to a helmet or approved adjustable
   head harness. Portable oxygen bottles may not be used for prebreathing. NOTE: Quick don
   masks are emergency equipment and are not approved for prebreathing or high-altitude
   airdrop operations.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                187

 NOTE: Maximum Exposure Time Per Sortie is considered to be any time cabin altitude
 exceeds 10,000 feet MSL. Personnel will conduct no more than two oxygen jumps per 24-hour
 period that do not require prebreathing (between 13,000 feet and 18,000 feet MSL) one of
 which, in the same 24 hour period, that requires prebreathing (18,000 feet MSL or above).
 (Example: Scenario 1: 2 x 17,500 feet MSL or Scenario 2: 1 x 24,999 feet MSL and 1 x 17,500
 feet MSL)


   19.11.3. High Altitude Emergency Procedures. If a physiological incident occurs, the AC
   will:
       19.11.3.1. Abort the mission.
       19.11.3.2. Begin descent (pressurization and descent will be determined by the type and
       degree of sickness or pain).
       19.11.3.3. Ensure the affected person remains on 100 percent oxygen until a medical
       doctor determines the type of treatment required.
       19.11.3.4. Proceed to the nearest base with qualified medical assistance available.
       19.11.3.5. Advise the control tower of the emergency and request an ambulance meet the
       aircraft.
       19.11.3.6. Advise attending physician to call Wilford Hall Hospital, Lackland AFB
       Hyperbaric Medicine (DSN 544-3483, commercial (210)292-3483, after hours (210)292-
       5990).
19.12. Emergency Parachutist Bailout.
   19.12.1. Under satisfactory conditions (static-line exit), the minimum acceptable emergency
   bailout altitude is 400 feet above the terrain. When an aircraft emergency occurs during
   static-line airdrops, the PIC maintains an acceptable attitude and altitude for the parachutists
   to evacuate the aircraft. If the jump must be made at an airspeed in excess of 150 KIAS,
   advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude. Order evacuation by turning on the green
   light and giving the briefed alarm bell signals.
   19.12.2. Minimum emergency bail-out altitude for free-fall parachutists is 2,000 feet AGL.
188                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   19.12.3. If conditions are unsuitable for aircraft evacuation, turn the red light on until exit
   doors are closed. The PIC advises the jumpmaster through the loadmaster to have the
   parachutists unhook, take their seats, and fasten seatbelts.
19.13. Airdrop Load Information.
   19.13.1. Personnel Airdrops.
      19.13.1.1. Loadmasters will ensure jumpmasters receive all time advisories, wind
      updates, and no-drop decisions when passed.
      19.13.1.2. Air deflectors must be operational if paratroop doors are used. If an air
      deflector does not extend, do not open the affected troop door.
      19.13.1.3. Loadmasters will not position themselves directly under the center anchor
      cable supports (A-Frame, LS 937 (FS 737)) in case of anchor cable or support mounting
      failure.
   19.13.2. Combination Airdrops. Restricted to single-ship or the last aircraft of an equipment
   formation. When tailgating parachutists, the drop altitude is determined by the item
   requiring the highest drop altitude per AFI 11-231. If an additional pass is required to drop
   all the personnel after a combination CDS drop, close the ramp and door and re-rig the static-
   line retriever cable as depicted in TO 1C-130J-9.
   19.13.3. Equipment Airdrops. Towplate is the primary method of heavy equipment airdrop.
   However, crews will be thoroughly familiar with both towplate and non-towplate procedures.
   Only equipment rigged in accordance with 13-C series T.O.s or JSOC 350 series may be
   airdropped. The maximum airdrop load to be extracted over the ramp is 42,000 pounds. The
   aerial delivery unit supporting the load movement ensures current publications are available
   for loadmaster reference during joint inspections.
   19.13.4. CDS Airdrops.
      19.13.4.1. Loadmasters are permitted to pull down sharply with a gloved hand or on a
      nylon strap looped over the static-line retriever winch cable to assist the cut of the release
      gate. Loadmasters will only pull on the cable after hearing and seeing "GREEN LIGHT‖.
      19.13.4.2. Manual CDS gate cuts are authorized for all CDS/I-CDS/JPADS single-stick
      airdrops (CVR or non-CVR). A manual gate cut is defined as using a knife to cut/release
      the CDS/intermediate gates. Loadmasters will ensure they hear and see ―GREEN
      LIGHT‖ before manually cutting the CDS/intermediate release gate. Loadmasters are
      allowed to go aft of the buffer stop/alternate forward barrier to manually cut the release
      gate. Exercise caution to remain clear of any bundles in the event of an emergency.
      Manual gate cuts may be performed with CDS loaded into both sides of the CVR, as long
      as the bundles are released one stick at a time, and the loadmaster has adequate space to
      remain clear on the opposite side of the exiting CDS. WARNING: Double stick CDS
      released simultaneously will only be cut using the static-line retriever. WARNING:
      Loadmaster will not cut release gates while in the paratroop doors next to the exiting
      CDS.
   19.13.5. I-CDS/ JPADS Airdrops. I-CDS and JPADS operations are conducted using the
   GPS Retransmission kit (GPS-RTK), UHF Dropsonde Receiver Subsystem (UHF-DRS), the
   JPADS Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) software. I-CDS are normally rigged CDS loads with
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                             189


  non-steerable chutes; JPADS operations are conducted using steerable chutes with
  autonomous guidance units (AGUs).
     19.13.5.1. JPADS certified POs are authorized to use the JPADS mission planner and
     software to calculate release points for JPADS/I-CDS airdrop operations. The PO will
     determine a revised CARP using dropsonde data (if required), and will advise the crew of
     the updated release point. After the JPADS-MP produces the updated CARP it is entered
     into the Mission Computer. The PM and PO will verify the CARP and all airdrop
     parameters are entered correctly into the navigation system. For verification, the PO will
     read the JPADS-MP computed release point coordinates directly from the JPADS-MP
     while the pilot not flying verifies the same information is in the aircraft navigation
     system.
     19.13.5.2. The PO or mission planner is required to provide JPADS-MP derived
     CARP(S) for each airdrop pass and a completed Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA)
     prior to an airdrop mission. Both pilots will review preflight CARP(S)/CDA for each
     respective airdrop. Use the approved checklist for dropsonde and I-CDS/JPADS
     airdrops. During the dropsonde release, use of zero flaps at speeds between 170 – 180
     KIAS is required to preclude dropsonde tail strikes. Loadmasters should release the
     dropsondes from the corners of the cargo ramp.
     19.13.5.3. Collateral Damage Assessment (CDA). Units must perform a full collateral
     damage assessment prior to JPADS/ I-CDS airdrops. The CDA must be coordinated and
     approved by the area controlling agency. Coordinate with the owning agency of the
     restricted airspace or controlled airspace and landowners with property surrounding the
     DZ for all JPADS/I-CDS operations. Examine the area in the vicinity of the DZ for
     potential damage or hazards in the course of normal operations or during extraordinary
     system failure events. If the CDA demonstrates potential damage or hazards restrict
     airdrop release LAR, lower the drop altitude, change the run-in, change parachute type or
     cancel operations. Inform the controlling unit of the risk to their operations; the
     controlling unit, and the Joint Force Controller (JFC) designated agency are approving
     authorities for risk to the area surrounding the DZ. Intelligence personnel are responsible
     for providing the JFC-designated agency close-up and overview imagery to facilitate
     CDA. For training units are highly encouraged to contact AMC/A3DT (2-3 weeks prior)
     in order to ensure all planning, coordination and reviews/assessments have been
     accomplished. Operations conducted at Yuma Proving Ground under JPADS related test
     plan do not need AMC/A3DT review. See AFI 13-217 for further information. The CDA
     must include, at a minimum, a review of the airspace and ground space with respect to:
        19.13.5.3.1. CARP and LAR location.
        19.13.5.3.2. 63% 1-sigma I-CDS success ellipse.
        19.13.5.3.3. Chute failure footprint.
        19.13.5.3.4. Guidance failure footprint.
     19.13.5.4. IMC/VMC day/night airdrops are authorized for contingency operations.
     CONUS training operations are required to comply with FAR 105 restrictions. Drops
     conducted through or originating from IMC are only authorized from within or above an
190                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      active restricted area. JPADS parachutes will not be dropped through severe turbulence
      or severe icing.
      19.13.5.5. For I-CDS operations, GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) 3 is required. For JPADS
      operations, GPS FOM 3 is required.
      19.13.5.6. Wind Limits. Wind limitations are unrestricted for dropsonde operations, 18
      knots for Firefly, Screamer and Dragonfly and as published in AFI 13-217 for all other
      parachutes.
      19.13.5.7. Drop zone Size. Drop zone size criteria for JPADS and I-CDS drops during
      contingency operations is at the discretion of the user. AFI 13-217 drop zone size
      restrictions apply during training.
      19.13.5.8. JPADS Guided Footprint Locations. During normal training operations a
      JPADS DZ, CARP, chute failure footprint and guidance failure footprint will be located
      within a restricted airspace. If winds force the CARP outside of restricted airspace
      additional coordination with ATC is required prior to airdrop operations. This includes
      coordination with the ATC agency, filing a Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), and ensuring
      airspace is clear for the entire guided system‘s flight profile from the drop altitude to the
      ground.
      19.13.5.9. During normal training operations the entire 1-sigma (63%) I-CDS success
      footprint will be located within the surveyed DZ boundaries. The chute failure footprint
      must fall within restricted airspace. If outside of a restricted airspace the chute failure
      must fall on the surveyed DZ. If operating in a restricted area and winds force the CARP
      outside of restricted airspace coordination with ATC is required prior to airdrop
      operations. This includes coordination with the ATC agency, filing a NOTAM and
      ensuring airspace is clear from the drop altitude to the ground.
      19.13.5.10. Jettison of JPADS AGU with Military GPS (MILGPS). Instances of jettison,
      unauthorized access, tampering, theft, or loss of the JPADS MILGPS enclosure must be
      reported to the GPS Controlling Authority (CA). Each such report shall include the
      JPADS MILGPS serial number and Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module
      (SAASM) GPS serial number of the missing item and must state whether the system was
      keyed or unkeyed. Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) will relay
      such jettison to the GPS CA. NOTE: Time permitting; the LM with concurrence from
      the PO will remove the MILGPS enclosure from the AGU prior to load jettison.
      19.13.5.11. JPADS AGU MILGPS Procedure. For training missions with Air Force
      JPADS AGUs aircrew will check out the MILGPS from the unit tactics office. Upon
      mission completion and prior to removing the MILGPS enclosure, power up the AGU
      and accomplish the Recovery Mission Duration Zeroization function (if desired). Zeroize
      prior to removal by pushing, for three seconds, the zeroize button located on the front
      panel of the MILGPS enclosure. NOTE: Keying and unkeying requires the MILGPS to
      be installed in a powered ON AGU. The AGU LCD screen should update within 20
      seconds and should read MILGPS Keyed or Unkeyed. Once complete power OFF the
      AGU. The PO will remove and return the enclosure to the Unit‘s Tactics Office.

                                         Chapter 20

                             AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to Air Force C-130J Aircrews, AE Aircrews and all
   management levels concerned with operations of the C-130J aircraft. All operators involved
   in AE missions on C-130J aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-130J aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DOD members and
   their dependents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE
   personnel will utilize the procedures in applicable AFI 11-2AE-V3 and 41-307 series, in
   conjunction with this publication, to accomplish the AE mission.
20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for AE. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations (AMC/A3)
   is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of AE missions is the same as other airlift missions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is responsible for command and control of all persons aboard the aircraft
   during an AE mission. In matters of flight safety, crew duty waivers, or operational
   considerations, his/her decisions are final (see AFI 11-2MDS-specific V3 for a more detailed
   list of PIC responsibilities). In matters of patient care, decisions of the MCD are final.
   20.2.4. Medical Crew Director (MCD). The MCD is a qualified flight nurse responsible for
   the overall supervision of patient care and management of AECMs assigned to AE missions.
   He/she advises the PIC on patients‘ conditions and the use of medical equipment that may
   affect aircraft operations. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and medical well
   being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures with the
   AEOO and supporting agencies.
   20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical
   standards and procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
   20.2.6. The Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), if available, who acts as a
   liaison between the AE crew and ground support facilities. When available, the AEOO is
   responsible for coordinating the launch and recovery of the AE mission
20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC/MCD. The MCD will alert the
   medical crew. The goal is to link the primary PIC, local AMC C2 agency and MCD before
   mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact
   AMC local C2 agency and establish alert, showtime, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will
   make every effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to
   crew rest. Utilize local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest
   will be based on scheduled launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
192                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide AC/MCD AE mission information when
   he/she checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and
   the PIC, thus permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew
   rest.
   20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and
   aircraft availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems)
   or emergency patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The
   MCD is responsible for communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2
   agency to de-conflict problems.
20.4. Pilot in Command Responsibilities.
   20.4.1. Establish communications link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and
   throughout the mission.
   20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as
   applicable). Identify armed crewmembers (as required).
   20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members
   (AECM) into single crew throughout mission including en route transportation, dining,
   billeting, etc.
   20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
   patient requirements. When the sortie is being flight managed, coordinate flight restrictions
   with the FM if the FM provided plan needs to be modified.
   20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for
   loading, positioning, and egress considerations.
   20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101.
   20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight
   difficulties, and additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
   20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as
   requested by the MCD.
   20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
20.5. Loadmaster Responsibilities.
   20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
   20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
   20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, i.e., doors, ramps, emergency exits, etc.
   20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients
   by AECMs.
   20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                 193


   20.5.7. Coordinate vehicle movement/enplaning/deplaning/ERO requirements with the
   Charge Medical Technician (CMT).

   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-
   loading.
   20.6.2. Assist Loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. The MCD or designated AECM should monitor interphone (headset) during flight.
   The MCD will be on headset with the PIC during critical phases of flight and during in-flight
   emergencies.
   20.6.5. The CMT is responsible for all ground operations involved with patients. The CMT,
   in coordination with the LM, is responsible for vehicle movement/positioning around the
   aircraft.
20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients. Exception:
   ERO procedures as outlined in 20.14.
20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to
   enplaning that station's patients. The PIC and CSS shall ensure aircrew members and
   servicing personnel accomplish CS per AFI 32-2001 and TO 00-25-172.
   20.8.2. Concurrent servicing may be accomplished with patients onboard provided:
      20.8.2.1. The CSS coordinates with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent
      operations.
      20.8.2.2. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers,
      and crew on board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
      20.8.2.3. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the
      overhead escape hatches) are opened for egress.
      20.8.2.4. The aircraft is thoroughly ventilated.
      20.8.2.5. At least two AECMs (one must be a FN) remain onboard to observe and assist
      patients in the event of an egress.
   20.8.3. If cabin lights, lavatories, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft
   inter-phone are operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing
   operations. Only those systems, switches or electrical circuits needed to operate equipment
   to sustain life, may be turned on and used during refueling.
   20.8.4. Patients and passengers will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing.
   Crewmembers may enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated
   with the concurrent servicing operation.
194                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   20.8.5. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling process.
   On-load/off-load patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
   20.8.6. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
   20.8.7. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft
   operations and shall inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger
   evacuation/safety.
20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
   20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-
   flight per TO 1C-130J-9.
   20.9.2. Litter Support Provisions.
      20.9.2.1. Roller conveyers will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets.
      Rollers on the ramp will be stowed during patient on-loading or off-loading operations.
      20.9.2.2. Litter patients will be enplaned feet first and deplaned head first due to minimal
      degree of ramp incline. This eliminates the need to turn litter patients around on the
      cargo ramp prior to placing them in the litter tier.
      20.9.2.3. A five (5) high configuration using the center seat and litter stanchions is
      approved for all AE missions.
      20.9.2.4. The seat and litter stanchion ladder will be installed for all AE missions when
      cargo requirements permit.
      20.9.2.5. Litter support straps will be secured to the aircraft floor prior to take-off. If
      litters are not in the tier, loose litter support straps will be secured in a top and bottom
      litter support bracket on the center seat and litter stanchion. This will remove a free-
      swinging strap hazard.
   20.9.3. Available litter spaces and ambulatory seating will depend on the aircraft cabin‘s
   mission configuration.
   20.9.4. Therapeutic Oxygen. Therapeutic oxygen is not an integral system on the C-130J
   aircraft. Use the PTLOX system.
   20.9.5. Integral patient/passenger emergency oxygen is not available on the aircraft. In the
   event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the Emergency Passenger Oxygen
   System (EPOS).
   20.9.6. AECMs will have portable oxygen available. AECMs normally use an MA-1
   portable oxygen bottle. If MA-1 bottles are not available, PBE‘s may be used as portable
   oxygen. NOTE: If a pressure demand regulator is used, the oxygen supply will be turned
   ―off‖ when the personal oxygen equipment is removed.
   20.9.7. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a
   manner that will prevent or impede egress.
   20.9.8. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.
20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                               195


  20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft
  utilization for passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations
  will be identified when seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of
  the number seats available for passengers.
  20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the
  health and well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be
  made by the MCD, considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Conflicts
  will be referred to the respective tasking AE command element for a decision. Litter patients
  will be positioned forward of cargo pallets. Exception: If cargo is in place, and the PIC and
  MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the cargo. The MCD and Loadmaster will
  ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient loads.
  20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the
  MCD has coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
  20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional
  patients or passengers.
  20.10.5. For patient comfort and to permit in-flight rest for patients use the following for
  missions over 4 hours in duration:
     20.10.5.1. Minimum of 2 litters should be available for ambulatory patients.
     20.10.5.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
  20.10.6. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
  20.10.7. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning
  and depositioning of operational/contingency support AE Missions.
  20.10.8. A maximum of 25 PTLOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously
  without Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping
  more than six PTLOX containers as cargo, do not cover with plastic. This will prevent
  potential high concentration of oxygen levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is free
  from any oil or petroleum products.
  20.10.9. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
  20.10.10. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. It is United States
  Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) policy that patients personnel, or casualties
  with known or suspected contamination from chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare agents
  will not be transported within the aeromedical patient movement system. Decontamination
  must be performed prior to transport to prevent the potential spread of contamination. In rare
  cases, transport may be essential to preserve life or continue critical missions. If such
  transport is deemed essential, all efforts must be made to prevent the spread of
  contamination. In these cases, prior approval must be given by the involved geographic
  combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and the Secretary of Defense
  (SECDEF) in consultation with Department of Defense medical authorities.
     20.10.10.1. Patients with known or suspected or highly contagious disease will not be
     transported within the patient movement system. These include infections with any agent
     that may pose a potential threat to national security, require special public health actions,
196                                                   AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


      and/or have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Patients known or
      suspected to be infected with a highly contagious disease should be treated ―in place‖ or
      with minimal transportation to medical authorities. In extreme circumstances there may
      be a requirement to move index cases (approximately two) for evaluation or critical
      medical care. If patient movement is required, prior approval must be given by the
      involved geographic combatant commanders, Commander USTRANSCOM, and
      SECDEF in consultation with medical authorities.
      20.10.10.2. AMC will train and equip AE crews and stage required equipment at key
      hubs to carry out these limited missions for movement of contaminated and contagious
      patients. NOTE: If AECMs are utilizing the MCU-2A ground chemical mask, a FL
      below 10,000 feet is recommended due to reported valve failure during rapid
      decompression.
20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per T.O. 00-25-172.
   When concurrent fuel servicing with patients/passengers on board a major aircraft rescue and
   fire vehicle will be available to respond within three minutes or as determined by the base
   Fire Chief. NOTE: When servicing with JP-4 or Jet B Fuel, a major aircraft rescue and fire
   vehicle will be positioned at the aircraft.The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling
   agency will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle
   coverage may be denied. This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
   20.12.1. AIR EVAC Priority. If a medical emergency occurs during flight, and is determined
   by the MCD to be an urgent situation, a request for AIR EVAC Priority will be requested.
   The PIC may request ―AIR EVAC priority‖ for preferential ATC handling if a delay will
   affect a patient‘s well being. AIR EVAC priority will only be used for that portion of the
   flight requiring expedited handling. Do not request priority for routine air evacuations to
   avoid ATC delays or inconveniences. It is the PIC‘s responsibility to use this option only for
   bona fide medical situations that demand priority handling. Use this status judiciously.
20.13. Load Message.
   20.13.1. The MCD will complete an AF Form 3858, C-130/C-141 Aeromedical Evacuation
   Mission Offload Message and coordinate for transmission of patient information to C2 with
   the ―30 minutes out call‖.
20.14. ERO Procedures.
   20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI 11-2AE Volume 3. ERO procedures
   (including use of Hotel mode) for loading patients are authorized for contingency operations
   or when AE mission requirements dictate minimum ground time. ERO procedures
   (including the use of Hotel mode) can be practiced/trained during ARMs, static trainers, joint
   training operations, exercises, etc. EROs will not be used in a non-contingency environment
   unless mission essential.
   20.14.2. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on
   headset during actual on-load procedures.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                197


   20.14.3. When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak
   vests, etc.), consider loading four (4) high versus five (5) high in the center seat and litter
   stanchions, to increase space between litters to accommodate gear.                 If situation
   requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a designated
   area.
20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
   20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time
   critical environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy
   siege/hostile fire, humanitarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor
   loading procedures can be practiced/trained during aeromedical readiness missions (ARMs),
   joint training operations, exercises, etc. The cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all
   rollers stowed (cargo permitting). Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is FL 350.
   Patients will have an EPOS pre-positioned on their litter when floor loaded.
      20.15.1.1. Ambulatory Patients. If available, any cushioning material may be used for
      seating, to prevent the patient from having to sit on the cargo floor. Seat ambulatory
      patients so they face forward in the aircraft. Attach a cargo tie-down strap for each row
      of patients, in a manner that it will provide forward restraint and body stability. See TO
      1C-130J-9 for proper use of the tie down device.
      20.15.1.2. Litter Patients. Two crewmembers are required to work simultaneously in
      securing the opposite sides of the litters to the floor (applies when securing two or three
      litters together). Position litters side-by-side and longitudinally on the cargo area floor,
      with the patient‘s head toward the aft of the aircraft. A maximum of 15 litters, comprised
      of five rows of three litters, can be floor loaded. Medical equipment can be secured on a
      litter(s) in the ―I‖ or ―L‖ sidewall litter tier or on the ramp. Secure the litters to the
      aircraft floor using the following procedures. (See Figure 3.1).
          20.15.1.2.1. One litter: Center litter over ―D‖ column. Use one tie-down device at
          each end of the litter. Connect clamp end of device to a tie-down ring in the ―C‖
          column, and run strap webbing over the litter handles, wrapping once around each
          handle. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of the tie-down device to the tie-down
          ring in the ―E‖ column on the other side of the litter. Remove slack from strap
          webbing, and ratchet the tightening device (see TO 1C-130J-9 for proper use of the
          tie-down device). Repeat process at other end of litter. Ensure ratchets have 1½
          turns.
          20.15.1.2.2. Two litters: Place litters side-by-side, and align inboard litter handles
          over ―D‖ column. Use two tie-down devices at each end of the litters. Connect clamp
          end of tie-down devices to tie-down ring in ―D‖ column, and run strap webbing over
          both inboard handles, then over respective outboard handle. Do not wrap strap
          webbing around any handles. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of the tie-down
          devices to the tie-down ring in ―C‖ or ―E‖ column (as applicable). Remove slack
          from strap webbing, and ratchet the tightening device. Repeat process at other end of
          litter. Ensure ratchets have 1½ turns.
          20.15.1.2.3. Three litters: Place litters side-by-side and center inboard litter over ―D‖
          column. Use two tie-down devices at each end of the litters. Connect clamp end of
198                                                 AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


          tie-down devices to tie-down ring in ―D‖ column, and wrap strap webbing once
          around applicable paired litter handles, then over respective outboard handle. Do not
          wrap strap webbing around outboard handles. Attach the hook on the ratchet end of
          the tie-down devices to the tie-down ring in ―B‖ or ―F‖ column (as applicable).
          Remove slack from strap webbing, and ratchet the tightening device. Repeat process
          at other end of litter. Ensure ratchets have 1½ turns. NOTE: Due to forward pallet
          stop bumper locations, litter handles may have to be secured forward of the litter
          stanchions mounted at the forward bulkhead.

                       EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT (ENAF)

21.1. General. The objective is to move nuclear weapons safely. You may be tasked at any
time to airlift nuclear weapons. The amount of preparation time and degree of assistance you
receive will depend on the length of time the MAJCOM has to move the weapons.
21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews should be briefed and receive detailed instructions from a
specific OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this instruction and the
requirements in an OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.
21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and
common sense in what may be a turbulent or tense environment. Pay particular attention to the
following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons must be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high
   explosive that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Keep loading
   operations controlled and orderly at all times. Load or handle only one item or pallet at a
   time. Crews may ask shipper or receiver personnel to help, but the overall aircraft loading
   responsibility still belongs to the aircrew.
   21.3.2. Use standard TO 1C-130J-9 loading procedures.
       21.3.2.1. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how
       many weapons can be properly restrained using TO 1C-130J-9 criteria. Do not allow
       weapons to rub or touch each other when tied down.
   21.3.3. The route of flight must not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air
   Force Special Weapons Over-flight Guide (SWOG). Over-flight of a foreign country with
   nuclear weapons is an extremely sensitive issue. Comply with SWOG instructions at all
   times. Crews without access to the SWOG will request a route of flight that complies with
   the SWOG through command and control center (C2 agency) channels, 618 TACC/X000N
   (DSN 779-4584). The C2 agency must ensure the route of flight is provided to the aircrew
   by the most expeditious means available. If no route of flight is provided, fly normal ATC
   routings to the destination. Do not divulge the nature of cargo to any enroute ATC facility or
   country to obtain a specific clearance.
   21.3.4. United States military custody of nuclear weapons is required. Normally, the copilot
   is the courier who has custody of the nuclear cargo for the flight. Under certain conditions,
   the shipper may furnish United States military couriers who will retain custody of the
   weapons in flight.
21.4. Aircrew Selection. All active duty C-130J aircrews may be used for ENAF. Time
permitting, AMC will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or more of the following:
   21.4.1. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
   21.4.2. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no
   advance preparation or assistance.
21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
200                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


   21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If
   not specified, use a normal crew complement.
   21.5.2. The crew will be armed (courier and two additional crewmembers).
   21.5.3. Crewmembers tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than their
   personnel security clearance will be authorized emergency access to enough information to
   complete the mission. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or
   wing commander equivalent and cannot be delegated.
21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
   21.6.1. Crews should be briefed on the following:
      21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
      21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
      21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material
      as required by IFR supplement and alternate airfields.
      21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 line numbers should be included. Obtain line numbers
      from the fire department prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 is a classified technical order
      that assigns an unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
      21.6.1.5. ―No lone zone,‖ two-person concept, and security requirements.
      21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
      21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
      21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions.
      21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
      21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
      21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
      21.6.1.12. The PIC will ensure emergency procedures in paragraph 21.10 below are
      briefed
21.7. Enroute Procedures. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating
procedures in the rest of this regulation.
   21.7.1. Flight Plans. Enter ―hazardous cargo‖ and the mission number in the ―other
   information‖ section of the flight plan. Crews carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items
   that could be mistaken for real weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency will
   enter ―inert devices.‖
   21.7.2. Radio Calls:
      21.7.2.1. Departure (on-load) base. Before starting the on-load, tell the tower to notify
      the fire department the ―on-load is commencing.‖ Prior to engine start, give the
      controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start
      time and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is
      standing by the aircraft for engine start.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   201


       21.7.2.2. Enroute or offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of
       the following: command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission number
       and verify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base
       does not have hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately
       to the crash or fire protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
           21.7.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
           21.7.2.2.2. ETA.
           21.7.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division
           (normally 1.1).
           21.7.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
           21.7.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 if requested. Obtain line numbers
           from the base fire department prior to starting the load at the on-load location.
           21.7.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.
21.8. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. The courier must be a commissioned officer. A copilot is the
preferred option. The courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety, and
delivery of nuclear weapons to authorized receivers.
   21.8.1. Prior to accepting and loading nuclear weapons, the shipper briefs the crew (at least
   the PIC, courier officer, and primary loadmaster) on the nature and hazards of the cargo.
   PICs will brief crewmembers who didn‘t receive the shipper‘s briefing prior to flight. Ask
   the shipper to point out any specifics crews may need to handle the weapon, i.e. tiedown
   points, forklift stirrups, CDS procedures, etc.
   21.8.2. Time permitting, the courier and loadmaster will inspect the cargo before accepting
   custody. The courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapons case and
   replace any broken seals. Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if
   crews accept a damaged weapon without documentation. Document damage or broken seals
   on the DD 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
       21.8.2.1. Loadmasters will inspect weapons to ensure they are secured to carriers,
       conditions of tiedown rings, and condition of wheel casters etc.
   21.8.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD 1911 provided by the
   shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
   21.8.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to
   sign for nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or
   through the AMC command and control system.
   21.8.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 618 TACC Command Center to 618
   TACC/XOOOD DSN 779-4584 for resolution.
21.9. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft
and the nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final
authority on security matters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the
host security force as much as possible. If the situation is serious and crews must load and
depart quickly, use judgment and dispense with the formalities. Prior to takeoff, the PIC will
202                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


ensure security support at all stations being transited that day through the 618 TACC Command
Center.
   21.9.1. Home Station. Conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unauthorized
   explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not
   delay the mission to ―sanitize‖ the aircraft.
   21.9.2. On-load Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and
   stanchions, around the aircraft.
       21.9.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the
       area. The entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy
       of the flight orders for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the
       aircrew courier before allowing anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons
       convoy to enter the restricted area without delay.
       21.9.2.2. ―No lone zone.‖ Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or
       aircraft when nuclear weapons are present (inside either the area or the aircraft). The
       purpose of a ―no lone zone‖ is to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear
       weapon. The easiest way to enforce a ―no lone zone‖ is to always be in pairs inside the
       restricted area (for example, two aircrew members, two shippers, or one aircrew member
       and one shipper). Maintain the two-person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow
       anyone to be alone in the cargo compartment or the flight deck..
   21.9.3. Arrival or Enroute Base. Prior to engine shut down, deploy sufficient armed
   crewmembers around the aircraft to control access to the aircraft until the host base security
   force is established. Keep doors closed and be prepared for an immediate departure until the
   host base established security. Once security is established, the only personnel authorized
   near the aircraft are aircrew members and those support personnel necessary to install
   landing gear pins, ground power, and wheel chocks. Monitor these people at all times.
21.10. Emergency Procedures.
   21.10.1. Security Emergencies. Crews may use deadly force to protect nuclear cargo and
   will resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on
   an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against the
   nuclear weapons. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to
   thwart recovery of a nuclear weapon; the welfare and safety of the hostages should be
   considered in determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not
   deter the taking of decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes the use of deadly force
   to recover a nuclear weapon and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of a nuclear
   weapon. If crews are attacked, take the following actions:
       21.10.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
       21.10.1.2. If the attack occurs during on-loading or off-loading, load the weapons as fast
       and as safely as possible. Ensure sufficient cargo restraint and take off immediately.
       21.10.1.3. Some weapons are equipped with a CDS that internally destroys the capability
       of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture
       of a weapon is imminent.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  203


       21.10.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons.
       Emergency destruction (ED) of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval
       and will be accomplished by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive,
       authenticate, and carry out ED orders. When two properly identified shipper or receiver
       personnel concurrently request custody of the cargo for ED purposes, release the cargo
       using appropriate custody transfer procedures.
   21.10.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The loadmaster will identify which cargo is jettisonable
   IAW the dash-1. The PIC bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or crash-land where the
   least amount of damage will result. Use the CDS, if applicable, prior to jettisoning or crash-
   landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the jettison restrictions in
   the SWOG.
   21.10.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If
   confronted with demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of US military
   aircraft in the FCG which states: US military aircraft are sovereign instrumentalities. US
   military aircraft cleared to overfly or land in a foreign territory are entitled to the privileges
   and immunities customarily accorded to warships. These privileges and immunities include,
   in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity
   from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspection); or other
   exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo on
   board. Air Force PICs will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of
   jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the
   American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically, but firmly, refuse any requests
   to board or inspect, and get help through any available United States channel. Flash priority
   is authorized.
21.11. Maintenance on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
   21.11.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons must not violate safety
   rules normally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. As much as possible,
   have maintenance and servicing completed before loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft.
   Do not allow maintenance, such as the following, that could increase the possibility of a fire:
       21.11.1.1. Using flame or uncontrolled heat-producing items.
       21.11.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where
       significant fuel spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components,
       etc.
   21.11.2. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear for
   minor maintenance (tire change, brake change, etc.) is not considered jacking.
   21.11.3. Do not refuel, defuel, or service oxygen while loading or offloading nuclear
   weapons. Have a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxygen
   servicing.
   21.11.4. If a crew chief is not available the loadmaster or pilot will monitor all maintenance
   on the aircraft while nuclear cargo is on board.
21.12. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Operations Guide. This guide describes recommended
actions for courier and crew during emergency nuclear airlift operations. It is designed for those
204                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


missions diverted enroute to an on-load site where the crew does not have the opportunity to
receive a formal CRG, home station, or command post briefing. However, even if a formal
briefing is given, this guide may be used as a refresher. Security, time, and ground support may
not be sufficient to allow using this guide during emergency operations. In such cases, the
courier and crew must discuss all factors and use their judgment on the best course of action to
accomplish the mission. Safety and security is paramount in all decisions affecting
transportation of nuclear cargo.
21.13. Prior to On-load. Accomplish the following, either at home station or enroute to the on-
load site:
   21.13.1. Review crew responsibilities and the procedures to be used during onload (loading
   method, security setup, cargo receipt, two-person concept). Do not discuss classified
   information over interphone.
   21.13.2. Enroute and 30 minutes prior to landing, contact the on-load site and notify them of
   ETA. Make support requirements known (fuel, materials handling equipment (MHE),
   transportation, security, etc.) at this time.
21.14. Arrival and On-load.
   21.14.1. Contact the senior security official and comply with the following: If crews have
   nuclear cargo on board, establish a restricted area and keep everyone off the aircraft. Provide
   armed security until the host security forces assume responsibility.
       21.14.1.1. A restricted area will be established around the aircraft. Ropes and stanchions
       are normally used to denote the restricted area. However, depending on the situation,
       crews may see additional guards, security vehicles, etc., rather than ropes. Be flexible.
       The key is whether the host base is furnishing enough security to protect the nuclear
       cargo.
       21.14.1.2. A single entry control point will be established.
   21.14.2. The entry controller must allow only those individuals into the restricted area who
   have been cleared by the courier. Tell the entry controller which individuals are authorized
   into the area and, time permitting, use crew orders as an EAL and prepared shipper lists.
   21.14.3. After security is established, verify shipper identification and accomplish the
   following with the shipper:
       21.14.3.1. Shipper briefing to include the following:
           21.14.3.1.1. Nature, hazard, and safety regarding shipment of nuclear weapons cargo,
           including line numbers from TO 11N-20-11, DOD class explosive hazard class or
           division, and net explosive weight (NEW).
           21.14.3.1.2. Courier escort requirements.
           21.14.3.1.3. Items requiring the two-person concept.
           21.14.3.1.4. Items that are CDS equipped and if the CDS has been activated (weapon
           not operational).
           21.14.3.1.5. Items exposed to an abnormal environment or not operational.
AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009                                                                205


          21.14.3.1.6. Special handling or unique requirements particular to the cargo.
          21.14.3.1.7. Individuals required to assist during onload or off-load. Pass the
          information to the entry controller.
          21.14.3.1.8. Authorized recipients at offload station. Get this information in writing.
          NOTE: If the primary loadmaster and the PIC were not present for the shipper
          briefing, the courier must brief them on the applicable items.
      21.14.3.2. Cargo inspection:
          21.14.3.2.1. The primary loadmaster, courier, and shipper will inspect the cargo for
          broken seals, exterior damage, security to carrier, wheel and casters, tiedown points,
          etc. Have the shipper annotate any discovered damage or discrepancies on the DD
          1911. NOTE: Ensure the aircraft is ready for on-load prior to accepting custody of
          nuclear cargo.
          21.14.3.2.2. After the inspection, accept custody of the cargo by signing the DD
          1911.
   21.14.4. During onload or off-load monitor the operation, assist as necessary, and ensure
   personnel comply with the two-person concept.
   21.14.5. After cargo on-load is complete and the crew is ready for engine start, the armed
   courier will deplane and tell the host base security to break down security and maintain
   surveillance until aircraft departure. The courier and other armed crewmembers will monitor
   access to the aircraft and crew entrance door during engine start.
21.15. Enroute to Offload.
   21.15.1. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.15.2. Notify the 618 TACC Command Center of departure time and ETA at the offload
   station. Be prepared to encode this information.
   21.15.3. If time permits, review the security and handling procedures to be used at the
   offload station. Do not discuss classified information over the interphone.
   21.15.4. Contact the agency specified in flight information publications (command post,
   base operations, or tower) 30 minutes prior to landing; ask if they have hazardous cargo
   information. If they don‘t, pass the following information:
      21.15.4.1. Call sign, type aircraft, and mission number.
      21.15.4.2. ETA.
      21.15.4.3. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 or DD 1911.
      21.15.4.4. If line numbers were not provided, pass on the following information:
          21.15.4.4.1. DOD explosive hazard class or division (normally 1.1).
          21.15.4.4.2. NEW.
      21.15.4.5. A request for isolated parking and for their security forces to meet the aircraft.
      21.15.4.6. Inert devices, if applicable.
206                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV3 8 DECEMBER 2009


21.16. Off-load.
   21.16.1. Upon arrival, deploy the armed courier (minimum) and team (if required) to provide
   security until the host security forces assume responsibility and establish the restricted area.
   Keep all doors closed and engines running until security is established.
   21.16.2. Maintain the two-person concept.
   21.16.3. Brief the receiver on the cargo, and transfer custody.
   21.16.4. Briefing includes:

home station. Off station trainers will not be generated solely to transport passengers or cargo.
Operational Control (OPCON).—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated
and is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and
giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes
authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through
the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is exercised through
subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component commanders.
Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to
employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish
assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction
for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.

WATCH" as necessary.
Opportune Airlift.—Transportation of personnel, cargo, or both aboard aircraft with no
expenditure of additional flying hours to support the airlift.
Originating Station.—Base from which an aircraft starts on an assigned mission. May or may
not be the home station of the aircraft.
Operational Risk Management (ORM).—ORM is a logic−based, common sense approach to
making calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and
after Air Force operations. It enables commanders, functional managers and supervisors to
maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks by applying a simple, systematic
process appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions.
Opportune Airlift—. Transportation of personnel, cargo, or both aboard aircraft with no
expenditure of additional flying hours to support the airlift.
Originating Station—. Base from which an aircraft starts on an assigned mission. May or may

life, limb, or eyesight, or to prevent complication of a serious illness.
Priority.—Patients requiring prompt medical care that must be moved within 24 hours.
Routine.—Patients who should be picked up within 72 hours and moved on routine/scheduled
flights.
Permit to Proceed—. Aircraft not cleared at the first US port of entry may move to another US
airport on a permit to proceed issued by customs officials at the first port of entry. This permit
lists the requirements to be met at the next point of landing, i.e. number of crew and passengers,

the customs inspector at the base where final clearance is performed. (Heavy monetary fines can
be imposed on the aircraft commander for not complying with permit to proceed procedures.).
Point Of No Return—. A point along an aircraft track beyond which its endurance will not
permit return to its own or some other associated base on its own fuel supply.
Point of Safe Return—. Most distant point along the planned route from which an aircraft may
safely return to its point of departure or alternate airport with required fuel reserve.
Positioning and De—positioning Missions. Positioning missions are performed to relocate
aircraft for the purpose of conducting a mission. De-positioning missions are made to return
aircraft from bases at which missions have terminated.

Quick Stop—. Set of procedures designed to expedite the movement of selected missions by
reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations.
Ramp Coordinator—. Designated representative of the C2 agency whose primary duty is the
coordination of ground handling activities on the ramp during large scale operations.
Scheduled Takeoff Time—. Takeoff time is established in the schedule or OPORD. For air
aborts and diversions, this will be engine shut down time (or arrival in the blocks if engine
shutdown is not scheduled) plus authorized ground time. Early deviation does not apply to
aborts or diversions unless the mission is formally rescheduled by current operations.
Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM)—. Funded airlift that cannot be supported by
channel missions because of the unusual nature, sensitivity, or urgency of the cargo or that
requires operations to points other than the established channel structure.
Special Tactics Team (STT)—. Team of Air Force personnel organized, trained, and equipped
to establish and operate navigational or terminal guidance aids, communications, and aircraft
control facilities in support of combat aerial delivery operations.
Stabilized Approach.—Criteria that defines specific parameters in order to mitigate the risk
during this critical phase of flight.
Stabilization Point—. Point on the DZ run−in course at which the lead aircraft should plan to
be stabilized at drop altitude and airspeed. This point will be planned to be at least 6 NMs before
the point of impact.
Stations Time.—The time at which aircrews will have completed their pre−flight duties and be
at their crew positions. Passengers will be seated and cargo will be secured.
Suitable Airfield.—Airfields which meet weather, fuel, and runway requirements, and are
within 50 NM of flight plan course centerline.
Supplemental Training Mission (STM). Opportune airlift of cargo and mission personnel
may be accomplished as a by—product of crew training missions. STMs may be authorized
when minor adjustments can be made to a scheduled training mission or when a productive
aircrew training mission can be generated for the airlift. The training mission will not be
degraded in any manner to accomplish the STM. Use of STMs for logistical support will be
authorized only when normal military or commercial transportation modes are unable to provide
required support. STMs may be approved by the operations group commander. On STMs
aircraft commanders will release maximum number of space available seats commensurate with
mission requirements and safety.
Tactical Event—.        Airdrop, low level, formation, assault landings/takeoffs, tactical
approaches/departures, landings to an AMP 3 configured airfield at night.
618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (618 TACC).—The Air Mobility Command direct
reporting unit responsible for tasking and controlling operational missions for all activities
involving forces supporting US Transportation Command's global air mobility mission. The
Tanker Airlift Control Center is comprised of the following functions: current operations,
command and control, logistics operations, aerial port operations, aeromedical evacuation, flight
planning, diplomatic clearances, weather, and intelligence. Also called TACC.

Tanker Airlift Control Element (TALCE)—. Team of qualified Air Force personnel
established to control, coordinate, and function as an Air Force tanker and airlift C2 facility at a
base where normal AMC C2 facilities are not established or require augmentation. TALCEs
support and control contingency operations on both a planned and no−notice basis.
Terrain Charts.—This includes both digital and paper charts.
Theater Patient Movement Requirements Center (TPMRC).—Organization within a specific
theater of operations responsible for coordination of intra− and inter−theater patient movement.
Time Out—. Common assertive statement used to voice crew member concern when safety
may be jeopardized.
Training Mission—. Mission executed at the unit level for the sole purpose of aircrew training
for upgrade or proficiency. Does not include operational missions as defined in this AFI.
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).—Formerly known as the Airlift Service
Industrial Fund (ASIF) and Defense Business Operations Fund−Transportation (DBOF−T). Part
of the overall Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). Used to finance airlift costs that are
billed/reimbursed from an air mobility customer. Examples include aircrew TDY costs,
utilities/maintenance and repair of TWCF-assigned facilities, civilian pay costs of TWCF-
assigned personnel, airlift unit level mission planning expenses, and TDY costs for deployed
TWCF units/personnel.
Unilateral—. Operations confined to a single service.
Unit Move.—A mission airlifting military passengers or troops who originate from the same unit
and onload point, are under the control of a designated troop commander and offload at the same
destination.
Zero Fuel Weight—. Weight, expressed in pounds, of a loaded aircraft not including wing and
body tank fuel. All weight in excess of the maximum zero fuel weight will consist of usable
fuel.
