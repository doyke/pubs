1.6.1.1. (Added) At Eglin AFB, the 96th Civil Engineer Squadron Readiness and Emergency
Management Flight (96 CES/CEX) is the Installation Commander’s Air Force EM program OPR
and is the Installation Office of Emergency Management.
2.4.1.2. (Added) The Eglin AFB Corporate Readiness Structure is comprised of two major
components, Installation Readiness Board (IRB), and Working Groups (WGs). At Eglin AFB,
the Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG) has merged with the IRB to reduce
duplication of effort.
2.4.1.2.1. The IRB meets semi-annually and is chaired by the Vice Wing Commander (96
TW/CV). The IRB is the senior-level advisory committee responsible for readiness, contingency
and EM functions. As a decision-making body, the IRB applies collective judgment and
experience to installation issues of a broad, complex nature. In addition, the IRB uses Command-
specific guidance to formulate policy decisions and recommendations. The IRB will focus on
installation –level readiness contingency and EM issues.
2.4.1.2.2. Chairman Responsibilities. The 96 TW/CV presides over meetings and has final
decision authority for issues brought to the board for resolution. The 96 CES/CEX will plan,
schedule, and facilitate IRB meetings.
2.4.1.2.3. (Added) Installation Exercise and Evaluation Working Group (IEEWG). Chaired by
the installation Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Chief, who determines membership
composition and meeting frequency. The IEEWG is a forum to guide installation exercises and
competing resources (including readiness exercises, inspection activities employing exercises,
war games, experiments, capabilities/ technology/other demonstrations) which could be termed
“exercises,” or non-military exercise requirements. As a minimum, the IEEWG briefs the IRB on
installation exercise schedule, trends, exercise results and exercise related topics from HQ
AFMC.
2.4.1.2.4. (Added) Expeditionary Skills Working Group (ESWG). Installation Deployment
Officer chairs the ESWG. The ESWG includes the IDO, the unit training managers (UTMs) and
unit deployment managers (UDMs). The intent is to discuss the installation’s commitment and
plans to meet expeditionary combat skills training, deployment procedures, and equipment
requirements. The WG meets as needed unless there is a change in policy or as determined by
the chairperson. As a minimum, the ESWG briefs the IRB on the status of installation
expeditionary combat training statistics related topics from HQ AFMC.
2.4.1.2.5. (Added) Force Protection Working Group (FPWG). The Installation ATO chairs the
FPWG determines the membership composition and meeting frequency. The FPWG is a forum
to communicate and resolve actions related to anti-terrorism and force protection policy,
guidance and program issues. As a minimum, the FPWG briefs the IRB on installation FP related
topics from HQ AFMC.
2.4.1.2.6. (Added) Readiness and Emergency Management Working Group (REMWG). The
R&EM flight chairs the REMWG, and determines membership composition and meeting
frequency. The REMWG is an action forum that assures integration of cross-functional EM
concept issues IAW DoD and Air Force standards and addresses installation EM management,
planning, training; and EM SAV trends. REMWG members include Unit EM Representatives
and any additional members as determined by the chairperson. The REMWG will brief the IRB
when a decision is required, a need for a formal SAV of the installation EM program is

identified, and/or a change in threat/vulnerability and emergency management related topics
from HQ AFMC.
2.4.1.2.7. (Added) All Hazards Planning Team (AHPT). Chaired by the R&EM Flight
includes first and emergency responders. The intent is to assure that all responders are aware of
the current threats and provide the opportunity to discuss roles and responsibilities and organize
cross-functional training outside the installation exercise and evaluation system. The team meets
semi-annually unless there is a change in threat/vulnerability, response capability or the
chairperson requires meetings more frequently. As a minimum, the team briefs the IRB on the
installation all-hazards threat response CONOPs, the CBRN FPCON detection plan and the
training status of all HAZMAT/CBRN responders.
2.4.1.2.9. (Added) Public Health Emergency Working (PHEWG). The PHEO chairs the
PHEWG, which will meet semi-annually (or more often as determined) to establish the program
structure for medical and public health emergency management. The makeup and guidance is
located in AFI 10-2603, Emergency Health Powers On Air Force Installations, Chapter 4. As a
minimum, the PHEWG briefs the IRB on installation public health related topics from HQ
AFMC.
2.4.1.2.10. (Added) AFRL and AFLCMC GSUs are not required to establish and maintain a
fully robust site Disaster Response Force (DRF). Review interagency agreements, memorandums
of agreement, mutual aid agreements, and taskings in host and supporting Installation Emergency
Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2 to determine needed DRF requirements. The following units will
provide representatives for readiness board meetings.

scheduled training. Students arriving late to class or without the required equipment will not be
permitted to attend and will count as a "no show." All students are required to have a serviceable

mask, mask carrier, canister/filters, pair of chemical protective over-boots, pair of chemical
protective gloves with cotton inserts, JSLIST Suit (top with attached hood and trousers), helmet,
load bearing equipment, web belt, and canteen. It is the individual’s responsibility to account for
all equipment upon issue from the Eglin Readiness Center (Bldg 1392). This equipment will not
be available for loan at the training location and it is our recommendation to pick up all gear at
least one week prior to class to alleviate any discrepancies. Failure to produce any of the
mandatory items will result in dismissal and a “no-show”.

be any rank, must have 1 year retainability on their current assignment and must attend training
within 60 days of appointment. A minimum of six individuals must be appointed to provide
sufficient members to staff the UCC for 24 hours in two 12 hour shifts (minimum of 3 personnel
per shift: 1 manager and 2 attendants). Commanders may assign more than six individuals if
needed/required. Training will be scheduled and tracked through ACES by Unit Schedulers.
Appointment letters will be signed by the unit commander and updated at a minimum annually
and no later than 60 days prior to personnel changes (i.e. PCS, deployment, change in command,
etc). A signed copy of the letter will be submitted to 96 CES/CEX.

UCC certificates must be presented to the course instructor at the time of the class. The AERO
and UCC CBTs can be found on the main ADLS portal. At Local Procedures, the UCC members
will receive a copy of the Eglin AFB Unit Control Center Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).
