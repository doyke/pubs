                                           Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of
variations are available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most
typical encountered day-to-day. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment
configuration, standard equipment, and equipment locations aboard MC-130J aircraft. Some
MC-130J aircraft have additional equipment installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as
listed. For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an average time annotated and
number of personnel to configure the airplane. The times quoted are approximate figures and are
configuration times only. They do not include de-configuration times. For example,
reconfiguring from a P-1 configuration, 84 sidewall and center aisle seats to a C-1 configuration
(clean floor) requires more than one-half hour for one person, which is the time allocated to
configure a C-1 configuration.
1.2. Responsibility. Operational plans must consider the most appropriate configuration that
satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to
change. USAF units performing services on MC-130J aircraft (i.e., maintenance, aerial port, and
aircrew flight equipment) are responsible for configuring the aircraft IAW this instruction and as
outlined in mission directives, to include equipment stowage/installation IAW the configuration
and equipment tables. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) personnel will ensure all life support
equipment is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Table 1.1.
Maintenance personnel will ensure all required and mission specific equipment is positioned
aboard the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Tables 2.1 and 2.2. Some equipment
listed in Table 2.2 is roll-on/roll-off equipment controlled by unit designated personnel. Before
home station departure, maintenance personnel are responsible for configuring the aircraft
(including modifications) to meet mission requirements IAW Figures 3.1 thru 3.21. For the CP-
2 through CP-5 configurations, the sidewall seats will be stowed to facilitate preflight of the
Enhanced Cargo Handling System (ECHS) rails and then lowered by aircrew with maintenance
assistance. After departure from home station, the aircrew will accomplish all configurations
with assistance by maintenance/aerial port personnel if available. During preflight, aircrew will
ensure required mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed. When the
aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster will assist in
the completion of the configuration, after accomplishing required predeparture duties (i.e.,
preflight, loading, etc.). Loadmasters have overall responsibility for configuration management
and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft.
1.3. Standard Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to MC-130J
cargo compartment configurations.
   1.3.1. AE – Aeromedical Evacuation.
   1.3.2. C – Cargo.
   1.3.3. CP – Cargo and Passengers.
   1.3.4. LP – PSYOPS.
   1.3.5. P – Passengers.
 6                                          AFI11-2MC-130JV3_ADDA 14 NOVEMBER 2013


     1.3.6. RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel.
     1.3.7. TAC – Tactical Airdrop Cargo.
     1.3.8. TAP – Tactical Airdrop Paratroop.
1.4. Modifications. Configuration codes of this instruction may require modifications for a
specific mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to
ensure maximum flight safety and aircraft equipment compatibility. Each mission directive will
identify basic configuration codes and modifications to satisfy mission requirements. For
example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters than available in
configuration AE-1. Consult appropriate configuration charts to determine where the desired
additional litters can be installed and which seats must be removed. Indicate in the mission
directive, by position (left or right, and number) which seats are deleted and (by alphabetical
position) litter tier provisions are installed. Example: Configuration AE-1(Mod), remove seats
12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D.
1.5. Weight and Balance.
     1.5.1. Configuration equipment and necessary supply changes affect aircraft weight and
     balance. To standardize equipment quantities and location, items shown in Table 2.1 will be
     included in the aircraft basic weight and remain on the aircraft except for maintenance,
     inspection, and when directed by this instruction. Equipment listed in Tables 1.1 and 2.2 will
     be added as necessary when computing the weight and balance and entered in
     Communications/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU) and references 5, 6,
     or 7 of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical. The
     loadmaster will enter the weight contained in the required equipment table for the applicable
     configuration in the CNI-MU and when preparing the DD Form 365-4. Adjustments will be
     made when the actual onboard weight of these items vary from the data shown. Add aircraft
     armor (Table 4.3) into the DD Form 365-4 if armor is installed on the aircraft. Paratroop
     door armor moments need to be recalculated when armor is re-positioned. DD Form 365-4
     will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
     1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1 is accomplished
     at a Forward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance (QA) Branch weight and
     balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in
     the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, indicating the
     weight, fuselage station and moment of any equipment added or removed. The loadmaster
     will add or subtract the listed weight and moment from the last entry in the DD Form 365-3,
     Basic Weight and Balance Record, Chart C-Basic. Annotate the new weight and moment in
     Block 1 of DD Form 365-4. Configuration changes accomplished at home station require a
     QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changes after
     crew reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4 by the loadmaster.
1.6. Distribution. Commanders are responsible for bringing this publication to the attention of
all affected personnel. At least one copy (paper or electronic) will be maintained in the unit
operations section. It will be readily accessible to operations and aircrew personnel. Additional
distribution will be as follows:
     1.6.1. Staff Operations, all levels.

1.9. Aircrew Life Support Equipment Configuration. MC-130J aircraft are configured with
standard quantities of aircrew life support equipment (ALSE) IAW this instruction. Configure
aircraft as listed in Table 1.1. During aircraft contingency/deployment generations, it is
imperative that aircraft deploy with the full complement of ALSE. This equipment must be at
forward operating locations to allow maximum mission flexibility when aircraft are away from
home station. In the event installed ALSE inspection dates expire while the aircraft is on alert
status or away from the operating location, place these items in the AFTO Form 781A on a red
dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns to the operating location. When the aircraft is
released from alert or returns to the operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-1,
Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
   1.9.1. Aircraft Transfer Requirements. When transferring aircraft; position ALSE IAW
   permanent transfer configuration. Losing unit will contact the gaining organization’s AFE
   section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The
   gaining organization will conduct an acceptance inspection and forward a copy of
   discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW TO
   00-20-1. Without documented coordination and approval, do not transfer aircraft with less
   than the required equipment. The losing organization must make up any shortages from on-
   hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
   1.9.2. ALSE Stowage Bins and Racks. Handle ALSE with care to avoid damage to the
   equipment. ALSE will always be placed in the stowage bins, unless stowed elsewhere for

     aircraft CG limitations. The primary purpose of all life support stowage bins and racks are for
     ALSE. Oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids will not be placed in the stowage bins.
     1.9.3. The unit or service being airdropped will furnish the required number of life
     preservers for airdrop of personnel over or near bodies of water. Wear of flotation devices
     will be in accordance with instruction and user service directives.

NOTES:

1. Minimum equipment required. Units may add more equipment to meet specific mission or
theater requirements. At all times, the amount of tie-down equipment required will include
enough equipment to secure the landing gear in an emergency as well as secure all cargo and
loose equipment. When additional equipment is added, QA will update the DD Form 365-3 (See
exception in paragraph 1.5. of this instruction.)

2. Minimum number of ground loading ramps required. More ramps will be added for RAPID
configurations. Generation IV ramps are the only type authorized for RAPID configurations. A
full set of Bi-fold auxilliary ramps (Canary Slides) may be used in lieu of ground loading ramps.

3. Minimum life support equipment required IAW AFI 11-301, Volume 2, Life Support
Configurations for Cargo Aircraft.

4. The number of raft spaces dictates the total number of personnel (crew and passengers) that
may be on the aircraft for overwater missions. In other words, if you have two 46 man rafts
installed, you can only have 92 personnel, including crew, on board for overwater missions.

5. All two-gallon emergency water containers will be stored empty. If mission dictates,
containers will be sanitized and filled with water by support personnel. Annotate in 781K if
emergency water containers are full. After the mission, sanitize and dry containers then reinstall.
When the water containers are filled the DD Form 365-3 will be updated to reflect the added
weight. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of this instruction.)

6. These items may be removed and maintained in the CDS airdrop kit or loadmaster tool kit
within the squadron.

7. This equipment is roll-on/roll-off equipment controlled by unit designated personnel.

                                              Chapter 3

  FLOOR PLANS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA

3.1. General. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format
and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment.
3.2. Configuration. Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special
requirements, the following factors shall be considered:
   3.2.1. Single sidewall seats shall not be used unless connected to a double sidewall seat
   (except for specific configurations).
   3.2.2. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
   palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps. This does not apply to cargo restrained
   by chains/chain bridle assemblies. When palletized or non-palletized cargo is secured with
   aircraft tie-down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required.      EXCEPTION: Always
   maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.
   3.2.3. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches; however, spacing will be as mission
   dictates. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch
   spacing.
   3.2.4. Cargo height in pallet position two may be restricted if overhead equipment rack(s)
   protrude into the cargo area. This restriction will be 76 inches and will begin at the inboard
   side of the cargo handling system rails and extend inboard 12 inches. This restriction could
   be on either or both sides of the aircraft.
   3.2.5. For flight, the aircraft ramp’s cargo weight limit is 5,000 pounds of floor loaded or
   palletized cargo in pallet position six (to include the weight of pallet and nets). See
   TO 1C130(M)J-9 for other restrictions. NOTE: The addition of aircraft defensive systems,
   armor, and other modifications may result in an empty/light aircraft out of CG limits. Move
   equipment as required to remain within TO 1C130(M)J-1, MC-130J Flight Manual limits.
   Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.3 and 4.4.
   3.2.6. This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft
   locations.
   3.2.7. A 20-inch clear area is required on the forward right side of a ramp pallet to allow
   access to aft latrine facilities. A safety aisle is required in pallet positions three, four, and six.
   (Paragraph 4.2.3, Figure 4.1).
   3.2.8. Trashcans, other than integral containers, will not be carried.
   3.2.9. Seats 1 and 2, left side will be stowed to allow unrestricted flight deck/crew entrance
   door access when the seats are not needed to accomplish a specific mission.
   3.2.10. Configuration seat totals include seats designated for loadmasters.         If the
   Loadmaster/Scanner Restraint System seats are installed, the red seats immediately forward
   of the paratroop doors will not be available for use.
   3.2.11. ECHS lock/seat stanchion locations are provided in Table 4.5
AFI11-2MC-130JV3_ADDA 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            17


   3.2.12. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) configurations. Medical Crew Directors (MCD) and
   Charge Medical Technician (CMT) will determine final litter equipment configuration and
   aeromedical evacuation crew member (AECM) seating. AECM seat locations may vary
   based on patient/cabin observation requirements. Overhead equipment racks, missile defense
   system modifications, and secure voice communication systems will decrease litter capacity
   in litter tiers adjacent to their installation.         Up to six seats are required for
   AECM/loadmaster(s) depending on crew complement. Seats are numbered for identification
   from front to rear and will be referred to as seat 1-left, or seat 1-right, etc. Litter tiers are
   identified alphabetically and litter spaces identified numerically from lowest (1) to highest
   (5). On litter tier configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses indicates total litters
   per tier. Roller conveyers will be stowed where litters and seats are rigged. AE equipment,
   which may be secured in unused seats if floor space is limited, may reduce seat availability.
   Portable therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) shall be stowed in a location to prevent contact
   with fuels or hydraulic fluids. NOTE: Five portable oxygen bottles/PBEs will be available
   for AE personnel on AE configurations.
   3.2.13. Aircraft protective armor will be added as needed into the Chart C or if QA is not
   available, loadmasters will add into Ref 7 of the DD Form 365-4.
   3.2.14. Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.
   Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as
   determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations.
   3.2.15. When seating passengers next to cargo, consideration should be given to cargo
   (palletized/rolling stock) size and adequate passenger legroom. For cargo width up to 76
   inches, passengers may be seated on both sides. For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be
   seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally. For widths 97 inches or greater,
   no passengers will be seated next to the cargo. For cargo positioned within the wheel well
   area: Cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides; for widths 53-72
   inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and
   greater, no passengers will be seated in the wheel well.
3.3. Troop Life Preserver. If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the
service being airdropped will furnish required life preservers. However, life preservers, as
indicated in applicable configurations, will still be provided as required to cover emergency
ditching operations.
3.4. Crew/Passenger/Troop Drinking Water. Each basic configuration provides for an
adequate amount of drinking water. For example, a two-gallon water container will always be
provided; and for missions requiring more water in accordance with Table 5.3, additional
containers are available. Table 5.3 is provided to assist in determining water quantities.
However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to cause
mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers. At no time will a mission be flown with no water
aboard.      NOTE: When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable
water source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the
mission.
3.5. Configuration Floor Plans. Configuration floor plans are depicted on Figure 3.1 through
Figure 3.21

                                            Chapter 4

                                     REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following
emergency exits and safety aisles are available:
   4.2.1. Equipment will not be positioned in a manner that obstructs the side emergency
   escape hatches. An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid
   evacuation. Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered to be an
   obstruction.
   4.2.2. One unobstructed emergency exit will be available for each 20 passengers/troops.
   (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
   egress.)
   4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisle way will be maintained in
   the wheel well to provide access to emergency exits. In the wheel well area, the aisle way
   will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and
   will begin at the cargo floor or cargo handling system (CHS) outboard frame. Tie-down
   equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an
   obstruction. The CHS outboard frame provides 8 inches of the 14-inch requirement on the
   main cargo floor (Figure 4.1). In the ramp area, the aisle way will be a minimum of 8 inches
   beginning at the outboard edge of the CHS outboard frame. The aisle way should normally
   be on the left side of the aircraft. If the aisle way is placed on the right side of the aircraft,
   then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained. Additionally, access to aft
   latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the forward right side of cargo loaded on the
   ramp. During combat/contingency operations aisle ways must be maintained to the
   maximum extent possible to provide access to all emergency exits. If a minimum aisle way
   of 14-inches cannot be maintained in the wheel well, one unobstructed emergency exit will
   be available for every 20 combat troops.
   4.2.4. If the aisle way requirement in paragraph 4.2.3 cannot be achieved on missions
   carrying crew only or MEPs authorized by operations order/plan or Director, Mobility Forces
   (DIRMOBFOR), then an aisle way will be maintained in the wheel well area that provides a
   minimum of 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher
   than 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer
   edge of cargo and the aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the
   floor/pallet/platform. The CHS outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the
   main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).
   4.2.5. During airdrop missions loadmasters shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to
   accomplish tactical checklists. The aircraft commander will be the final authority for
   determining if safety aisles and/or access aft of cargo is adequate.
   4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to
   the rear of the aircraft. Loads in Section VI of TO 1C-130(M)J-9 are specific and do not
   require a waiver.

        WEIGHT & BALANCE INPUTS AND DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. The loadmaster is responsible for entering weight and balance data into the
CNI-MU Wt and Bal pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form 365-4, Form-F.
This can either be accomplished manually, or electronically utilizing the Automated Form F
(AFF) program and printer. Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the C-130
AFF training guide.
5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so the center of gravity of the loaded
aircraft will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition.
Consideration must also be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency
jettisoning. Math charts contained in TO 1C-130(M)J-5-1, Basic Weight Checklist and
TO 1C-130(M)J-5-2, Loading Data Manual, are tools, which may be used for load planning.
When the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of Mean Aerodynamic Chord
(MAC) zero fuel.
5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to Transport Forms F using simplified
moments. Copy the information from the CNI-MU weight and balance pages onto the Form F,
plus the heading information. A copy of the completed DD Form 365-4, Form F shall be
attached to the flight plan, or given to the controlling ground agency, quality assurance, transient
alert, maintenance, etc.
   5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number,
   departure and destination station (name or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
   identifier), home station of aircraft, and pilot's rank and last name.
   5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter the appropriate weight and CG limits for the planned
   mission using the following criteria: The maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits
   specified in TO 1C-130(M)J-1 will not be exceeded. Gross weights may also be limited by
   operating conditions; i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude,
   runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions. The pilot will inform
   the loadmaster of any gross weight restrictions prior to mission planning so an accurate ACL
   may be obtained.
       5.3.2.1. Takeoff. Unless other restrictions are imposed, use 164,000 pounds for takeoff.
       5.3.2.2. Landing. Unless other landing restrictions such as maximum effort landings are
       imposed, use 164,000 pounds. Subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel
       (references 9 and 23). Refer to the TO 1C-130(M)J-1, MC-130J Flight Manual, for
       assault landing limitations.
       5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. The CNI-MU is the primary method to compute Limiting
       Wing Fuel. The limiting wing fuel chart in TO 1C-130(M)J-1 is based on a 2.5 G
       maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight
       manual limitation charts. Specific mission requirements exceeding area "C" limitations
       must be computed using the appropriate flight manual weight limitation charts.

   5.3.3. Permissible CG Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity
   limitations using the center of gravity table in the appropriate TO 1C-130(M)J-5-2. Leave
   the block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank.
   5.3.4. Signature Blocks:
      5.3.4.1. Computed by: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.
      5.3.4.2. Weight and Balance Authority: Leave blank.
      5.3.4.3. Pilot: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.    NOTE:
      In the remarks section, enter a total takeoff fuel weight to the nearest 100 pounds and
      moments using the CNI-MU.                 NOTE: During engine running onloads or when
      planned ground times require, a combined load C/B may be used if a validated load plan
      is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan.
   5.3.5. Compute and enter zero fuel weight and zero fuel moment by zeroing out the Take-off
   and Landing Fuels on the fuel page. Return to the main weight and balance page to calculate
   the Take-off and Landing Zero Fuel Weight. After calculations have been entered, return to
   the fuel page and return the fuel to its original state. Zero fuel percent of MAC is not
   required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC.
      5.3.5.1. Reference 22. If required, subtract airdrop load weight and moment from
      reference 21 or changes in corrections column and enter as adjusted zero fuel
      weight/moment on first blank line in reference 22. First blank line title will read, “ADJ
      ZFW/M”.
      5.3.5.2. Use the following criteria to compute fuel burn off when flight plan fuel weights
