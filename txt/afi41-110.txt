This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 41-1, Health Care Programs and
Resources. The intent of this instruction is to assist the United States Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG)
in obtaining qualified medical commissioned officers on active duty by offering the F. Edward Hebert
Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program (AFHPSP), the Financial Assistance Program
(FAP), the F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University (USU) of the Health
Sciences Scholarship Program, and the Active Duty Health Professions Loan Repayment Program (ADH-
PLRP). It outlines the eligibility criteria, application, and participation process required by scholarship
candidates, as well as the managerial and execution role and responsibilities of the various offices
involved.
Applicants interested in the AFHPSP must pursue an educational track to achieve the degree of: medical
doctor (MD), doctor of osteopathy (DO), doctor of dental surgery (DDS), doctor of medical dentistry
(DMD), doctor of optometry (OD), doctor of pharmacy (Pharm-D), master of science (MS) or master of
arts (MA) degree in nurse anesthesia, or any other degree recognized as critical by the AF/SG.
Only civilian physicians and dentists enrolled in an accredited specialized training program beyond the
basic MD, DO, DDS, or DMD degree, and pursuing specialty training, may apply for FAP.
The AF/SG may also exercise the ADHPLRP to meet the needs of the AF Medical Service through
recruitment of civilians by paying their debts incurred while obtaining advanced health care education.
Requirements for each program may change annually based on the critical specialties identified by the
AF/SG.

     fewer years of service for all 45-calendar day ADTs. Participants with previous military service
     receive longevity credit only for their period of prior service determining their pay rate in grade

1.10. Separating or Discharging an Eliminated Participant
     1.10.1. All program participants hold commissions as officers in the USAFR and must serve on AD.

   and HQ ARPC/JA. Separation or discharge from the Reserve of the Air Force while participating in
   the AFHPSP/FAP does not necessarily mean that a member is relieved from service obligations
   imposed by other federal statutes.
      1.10.5.1. SAF/MIC may discharge members who were commissioned for the program, submitted
      a TOR before receiving benefits, are not otherwise obligated to the AF and/or attended COT and
