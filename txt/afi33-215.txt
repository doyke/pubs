AFCA/XPXP, on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. MAJCOMs, field oper-
ating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU) send one copy of their supplements to HQ AFCA/
GCI, and HQ AFCA/XPXP.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
This revision deletes instructions on operating and managing Communications-Electronic Operation
Instructions, Joint Communications-Electronic Operation Instructions, and Signal Operation Instructions.
It deletes roles of the National Security Agency (NSA) as a separate attachment and adds it as paragraph
4. Attachment 2 is updated and includes procedures for keymat usage, two person integrity, sensitive
compartmented information, changing the classification of keymat, how to identify test or maintenance
keymat for established systems, precautionary supersession, implementing when directed keymat, proce-
dures for COMSEC incidents, and compromise recovery. It changes the references of Hotel Juliet (HJ)
time to key change time. Attachments are added that provide examples for requests to establish a new
keymat, increasing and decreasing copies of a keymat, deactivation of a cryptonet, precautionary super-
session of a keymat, implementing a when directed keymat and revalidation of a keymat.
1. Introduction . This instruction establishes responsibilities for controlling authorities of keymat and
provides guidelines for compromise recovery. It describes functions and lists options for reacting to
emergency or crisis situations and tells how to evaluate COMSEC incidents. The term MAJCOM when
used in this publication, includes FOAs and DRUs. A glossary of references, abbreviations, acronyms,
and terms is at Attachment 1.

2. Applicability and Scope. This instruction applies to all Air Force personnel assigned or acting as,
controlling authorities to oversee and manage operational use and control of COMSEC keymat. Manage
Joint Staff Intertheater COMSEC Package (JSICP) material according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6510.03(C), CJCS-Controlled Intertheater COMSEC Support (U). Manage
positive control material according to CJCSI 3260.01(S), Joint Policy Governing Positive Control Mate-
rial and Devices (U).

3. Controlling Authority Appointment. When establishing a new cryptonet, identify a controlling
authority to manage the operational use of the keymat assigned to the cryptonet. Whenever possible,
ensure the controlling authority is organizationally senior to cryptonet members. The controlling author-
ity must have the expertise to perform essential management functions and must have the authority to
ensure its instructions are carried out. All cryptonet members, including those from other services or
agencies, must comply with directions given by the controlling authority.
   3.1. Since a cryptonet supports an operational requirement, assign controlling authority responsibili-
   ties to the operational organization directly supported by, or most closely associated with, the crypto-
   net.
   3.2. For locally generated electronic key, the organization directing key generation performs the con-
   trolling authority functions, unless those functions are specifically assigned to another organization.
       3.2.1. Only assign COMSEC accounts as controlling authority for keymat electronically gener-
       ated by the account for its own use. NOTE: Do not assign MAJCOM Information Protection
       offices as controlling authorities.
   3.3. Headquarters, United States Air Force (HQ USAF) and MAJCOMs may direct changes in con-
   trolling authority appointments under their control. Whoever directs these changes notifies all crypto-
   net members, appropriate distribution authorities, HQ CPSG/ZCK and DIRNSA/Y132, of all

                          CRYPTONET MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES

A2.1. Establishing New Keymat. Controlling authorities establish cryptonets with HQ CPSG/ZCK and
advise DIRNSA/Y132 and all holders of the quantity of keymat needed (see Attachment 4). For manual
cryptosystems (one-time pads, operations codes, authentication systems, etc.), controlling authorities
must first identify specific operational requirements to HQ AFCA/GCI according to AFI 33-216, Man-
agement of Manual Cryptosystems.

A2.2. Activating a Cryptonet. If the initial implementation and supersession dates are not provided by
the controlling authority, HQ CPSG/ZCK will designate this information. NOTE: NSA establishes
supersession rates based on security, operational need, production and resupply constraints. Except in
emergencies, controlling authorities cannot change supersession rates. A controlling authority may
extend the effective dates of an edition to make use of spare settings when resupplies are uncertain.

A2.3. Cryptonet Configuration. Controlling authorities keep a record of all cryptonet members and
prescribe the quantity of keymat for each member. This requires:
   A2.3.1. Keeping detailed records of all cryptonet members to include identification of each cryptonet
   member, supporting COMSEC account, and numbers of copies held by each cryptonet member.
   A2.3.2. Knowing problems cryptonet members may experience with the keymat.
   A2.3.3. Knowing the distribution authorities that support the holders of the material and the fastest
   ways of issuing supersession and other emergency information to all holders of the keymat.
   A2.3.4. Seeking assistance from the COMSEC manager on distribution and COMSEC channels.
   A2.3.5. Telling HQ CPSG/ZCK, DIRNSA/Y132, and all holders of changes as controlling authority.
       A2.3.5.1. Status publications contain controlling authority information. Status publications are
       maintained at COMSEC accounts only. Controlling authorities must ensure their information is
       up-to-date and accurate. Information includes: Points of contact, defense switched network
       (DSN) and commercial phone numbers, unit and office symbol, mailing address, message address,
       e-mail address, fax phone numbers (classified and unclassified), etc. (See Attachment 4.)
   A2.3.6. Notifying all cryptonet members, HQ CPSG/ZCK, and DIRNSA/Y132 of any changes in
   cryptonet configuration or keymat status. If manual cryptosystems are concerned, controlling author-
   ities must also notify DIRNSA/V31.

A2.4. Operational Requirements. Controlling authorities must know the operational requirements sup-
ported by the cryptonet and the proper use of the key. Controlling authorities must stay familiar with the
operation and capabilities of the associated equipment.

A2.5. Keymat Usage. Controlling authorities will provide destruction, holding, etc. instructions to all
cryptonet members on usage of the keymat. Keep a letter or message on file when keymat usage is differ-
ent than prescribed within the operation instructions for that specific cryptosystem.




                                                8
A2.6. Two Person Integrity. Controlling authorities must ensure that TOP SECRET keymat is handled
under TPI procedures as outlined in AFI 33-211, Communications Security (COMSEC) User Require-
ments.

A2.7. Sensitive Compartmented Information. Controlling authorities will designate keying material
used for encryption of SCI. Notify all cryptonet members of the correct handling of this material.

A2.8. Changes in Classification. Controlling authorities will approve changes in classification of the
key if the classification is downgraded. First, coordinate any upgrades to the classification with HQ
CPSG/ZCK. Before upgrading keying material to TOP SECRET, controlling authorities must ensure that
material is protected under TPI procedures and that all personnel and facilities are cleared for the TOP
SECRET level.

A2.9. Key Change Time. Controlling authorities will specify key change time for the cryptonet when
the time is not prescribed in the keymat. The time selected for key change must have the least operational
impact on the cryptonet. Keep the time selected for key change consistent throughout the cryptonet. If
key change time is not specified, it is 0001Z. Additionally, controlling authorities may change key
change time by notifying the cryptonet members.

A2.10. Spare Group Assignment. Controlling authorities make spare group assignments of operations
codes, as necessary. Notify all cryptonet members of all changes and ensure changes are included in
future production copies.

A2.11. Key Distribution. Controlling authorities prescribe electronic generation and distribution of keys
(except key encryption keys.) They also prescribe physical transfer of keys in a common fill device, or
local reproduction of keys, when established channels cannot supply the material in time to meet urgent
operational requirements. Controlling authorities make sure reproduced material is kept to the minimum
essential amount and is properly classified, controlled, and destroyed as applicable. Controlling authori-
ties obtain register numbers from HQ CPSG/ZCK for copies of Accounting Legend Code-1 material
reproduced by Air Force COMSEC accounts. Controlling authorities who routinely allow reproduction
of the same material must increase the copy count of that material.

A2.12. Test or Maintenance Keymat. AFKAG 13(C), Index and Status of COMSEC General, Operat-
ing and Maintenance Manuals(U) lists the test, maintenance, and training keys for established cryptosys-
tems. Detailed information is also provided for these keymats in the following publications, maintained
by the COMSEC account: AFKAG 11 (S), AFKAG 12 (S), Index and Status of Data Encryption Stan-
dard (DES) Systems and Fascinator Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Systems(U), AFKAG 14 (S), Status and
Index of COMSEC Operational, Exercise and Training Material (U), AFKAG 15 (S), Index and Status of
Space Related COMSEC Systems (U), and AFKAG 16 (S).

A2.13. Resupply. Controlling authorities coordinate with distribution authorities to make sure of timely
resupply of keymat. Controlling authorities must:
   A2.13.1. Promptly check the status of follow-on material when notified by a COMSEC account that
   they have only a two month supply of keymat or two segments of material for annually superseded
   material.


                                                9
   A2.13.2. Direct cryptonet members to implement the longest authorized cryptoperiod extension for
   each remaining key setting if COMSEC accounts are not assured of resupply before their remaining
   key is superseded (see paragraph A2.14).
   A2.13.3. If the extension is not enough or the resupply date is not determined, controlling authorities
   must report, by IMMEDIATE precedence message, to HQ CPSG/ZCK, INFO: DIRNSA/V51A/
   Y132. This allows responsible agencies to make contingency arrangements. The message must
   include:
       A2.13.3.1. The keymat short title.
       A2.13.3.2. Number of cryptonet members.
       A2.13.3.3. Description of the type of operations (for example, full-time, or part-time, fixed or
       mobile communications center).
       A2.13.3.4. Explanation of the necessity for the cryptoperiod extension.
NOTE: When time is critical, controlling authorities may verbally request emergency cryptoperiod
extensions from NSA/V511 DSN/STU-III 244-6831; commercial/STU-III (410) 859-6831. When autho-
rized verbally, controlling authorities must take immediate action and not wait for message documenta-
tion. Cryptonet members abide by verbal instructions relayed by controlling authorities.

A2.14. Extensions. Controlling authorities for manual cryptosystems can extend the cryptoperiod by 72
hours. Controlling authorities for automanual and machine cryptosystems can extend the cryptoperiod by
one week. That is, controlling authorities can add either 72 hours or one week, as applicable, to the regu-
lar cryptoperiod, unless the specific cryptosystem doctrine prohibits cryptoperiod extensions or autho-
rizes a longer extension. Controlling authorities are not required to report these extensions to HQ CPSG
or DIRNSA, unless there is a change in the effective dates. Cryptonet members can extend cryptoperiods
up to two hours to complete a transmission or conversation in process at key change time. Controlling
authority approval is not required and cryptonet members are not required to report these extensions (see
Attachment 3.)

A2.15. Precautionary Supersession. When the controlling authority determines that a compromise of
keymat has occurred, (for example, material was stolen, passed over non-secure means, etc.), notify HQ
CPSG/ZCK, DIRNSA/Y132, and all holders. See Attachment 8 for example of a precautionary superses-
sion message. All holders will advance to the next segment or edition, as determined by the controlling
authority. Send an immediate precedence message to advise of this change. COMSEC managers will
immediately pass messages and additional keymat, if needed, to cryptonet members.
   A2.15.1. Direct the emergency supersession of keymat under their control according to Attachment 2
   and Attachment 8, and immediately notify HQ CPSG/ZCK and DIRNSA/Y132.
   A2.15.2. Coordinate with HQ CPSG/ZCK prior to superseding key to make sure adequate material is
   available to all holders to support future needs.

A2.16. Extracts. Controlling authorities approve the number of extracts of keymat issued to a cryptonet
member at any one time, except where specified in the material. Issue protectively packaged keymat as
entire editions, except where operational necessity prevents such issue. Removing keymat from its pro-
tective packaging defeats the purpose of protective packaging and exposes the key to unauthorized copy-
ing.
                                                10
A2.17. Tactical and High Risk Situations.
   A2.17.1. Tactical Situations. Issue keymat in ample quantities to support mission requirements.
   Issue it in either hard copy or electronic form depending on the risk, as determined by the local com-
   mander. Use any multiple key storage capacity of the equipment. If equipment does not have multi-
   ple fill capacity, or has insufficient capacity, issue common fill device (CFD) (KYK-13 or KYX-15)
   or data transfer device (DTD) (AN/CYZ-10 or AN/CYZ-10A). If hard copy keymat is issued, issue
   extracts when only a few settings are required, otherwise issue the entire edition. Base your decision
   of whether to issue extracts or entire editions on a risk assessment and careful consideration of the
   logistic problems associated with emergency resupply due to compromise.
   A2.17.2. High Risk Situations. Issue keys in electronic form.

A2.18. Reproduction of COMSEC Material for Manual and Machine Cryptosys tems.
   A2.18.1. Manual Cryptosystems. COMSEC managers may locally reproduce manual cryptosystems
   (that is, codes and authenticators) for validated users as necessary to meet operational needs. You
   must have controlling authority approval to reproduce sealed manual cryptosystems. Reproduce and
   control manual cryptosystems according to instructions in AFKAG-14(S). NOTE: Reproduction
   occurs when complete editions are reproduced. When the complete edition is not reproduced, it is
   considered an extract (see A2.16).
   A2.18.2. Machine Cryptosystems. Do not reproduce keying material for machine cryptosystems
   without the consent of the controlling authority. If you cannot obtain controlling authority approval in
   time to meet operational requirements, or if a controlling authority is not designated, the local com-
   mander may authorize reproduction. Notify the controlling authority at the earliest opportunity.
   COMSEC managers will obtain register numbers of account legend code 1 material from HQ CPSG/
   ZCK, and account for the reproduced material according to AFKAG-2, Air Force COMSEC Account-
   ing Manual. NOTE: For JSICP material, contact the JSICP manager for accounting control num-
   bers.

A2.19. Defective Keymat. Controlling authorities and cryptonet members will report defective keymat
immediately to their supporting COMSEC manager. Include in the report a full description as to what is
wrong with the material, if known, or the reason for submitting the report. The COMSEC manager sub-
mits the report according to AFI 33-212.
   A2.19.1. Provide the material to the COMSEC manager, who will keep the defective material and all
   associated packaging materials until disposition instructions are received. The COMSEC manager
   will return the recalled keymat, upon request from the proper authority, by approved shipping meth-
   ods as prescribed in AFKAG-2. Transfer reports must state the authority. Refer to the recall message
   and include any other remarks requested in the recall message.
   A2.19.2. Controlling authorities must determine if they need to supersede (e.g., found several defec-
   tive key canisters) or if users can continue to operate using the current material.

A2.20. When Directed (WD) Keymat. Until keymat is implemented, it is placed in a WD status. Once
the circuit is activated, the keymat is implemented and all holders, HQ CPSG/ZCK and DIRNSA/Y132
are notified. When known circuit outages will cause an extended amount of outage time (e.g., two or
three months), the controlling authority places the keymat in WD status. Irregularly used keymat (e.g.,

                                               11
EAM codes, telemetry keymat, etc.), will generally have an effective edition in use for an undetermined
period of time while the follow-on editions remain in WD status until the controlling authority imple-
ments one or more editions. This way you can save unused keymat from unnecessary supersession or
destruction. Substantial savings in production, distribution, accounting, and destruction are possible
when unused keymat is placed in a WD status.

A2.21. Contingency Keymat. Hold contingency keymat in WD status until called out and implemented
for a crisis, contingency or exercise. Activate keymat when needed for the specific requirement, destroy
it after it is superseded, and place it back into a WD status until it is called out and implemented again.

A2.22. Revalidation. Controlling authorities carry out annual revalidation of keymat, used with machine
cryptosystems, to confirm cryptonet structure, quantities and adequacy of the key to meet operational
requirements, and continuing requirement for the key. Send revalidations to the cryptonet members and
COMSEC accounts with INFO to the COMSEC accounts supporting MAJCOM (see Attachment 10).
Deactivate the cryptonet if no longer needed (see Attachment 7). During the revalidation, identify cryp-
tosystems of low peacetime use that are candidates for placement into WD status. Revalidate keymat for
manual cryptosystems according to AFI 33-216. Send a summary of each revalidation to HQ CPSG/
ZCK.

A2.23. COMSEC Incidents. Controlling authorities must ensure cryptonet members are trained to rec-
ognize COMSEC incidents and immediately report them to the COMSEC manager. When keying mate-
rial is used by other than Air Force cryptonet members, those cryptonet members must know to report
COMSEC incidents according to service instructions. They must also address reports to HQ AFCA
SCOTT AFB IL//GCIS//. NOTE: COMSEC Incident reporting is exempt from licensing according to
AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Pub-
lic, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections (will convert to AFI 33-324).
   A2.23.1. Controlling authorities will review and evaluate COMSEC incidents to all addressees of the
   initial COMSEC incident report.
       A2.23.1.1. Evaluate and respond to initial reports of the following incidents within 24 hours:
           A2.23.1.1.1. Currently effective keymat or keymat that is effective within 15 days.
           A2.23.1.1.2. Defection, espionage, hostile cognizant agent, clandestine exploitation, tamper-
           ing, penetration or sabotage, or unauthorized copying, reproduction, or photography.
       A2.23.1.2. Evaluate and respond to initial reports of the following incidents within 48 hours:
           A2.23.1.2.1. Future keymat that becomes effective beyond the next 15 days.
           A2.23.1.2.2. Superseded, reserve, or contingency keymat.
           A2.23.1.2.3. Evaluate and respond to initial reports of COMSEC incidents not covered above
           within 5 duty days.
   A2.23.2. Use the COMSEC Incident Evaluation Guide in AFI 33-212 to evaluate COMSEC inci-
   dents.

A2.24. Compromise Recovery. Compromise recovery and incident evaluation are two separate, distinct
actions required of a controlling authority. Where substantial evidence of compromised COMSEC mate-

                                                12
rial exists, controlling authorities must take immediate action. Controlling authorities will not wait for
receipt of incident reporting and evaluating requirements, but will initiate recovery action when they have
enough information to make an informed decision. Ideally, controlling authorities will announce precau-
tionary supersession (see Attachment 8).
   A2.24.1. The feasibility of superseding hard copy keying material is contingent on several factors:
   the number of editions held at the user level, the capability of NSA to produce keying material, and
   the distribution authority’s capability to supply replacement editions. Any decision to supersede must
   take into consideration the time required to notify all cryptonet members and implement the new
   material. Report emergency supersession of hard copy key immediately to appropriate distribution
   authorities, HQ CPSG/ZCK and DIRNSA/Y132 so that they can take resupply action, produce
   replacement material, and correct status documents.
   A2.24.2. Superseding locally generated electronic key can present a unique problem for mobile or
   tactical users. Some of the communications paths used to deliver the key may no longer exist due to
   the redeployment of some of the relaying units. The controlling authority must consider the time
   needed to create or re-establish communications paths before directing supersession.
   A2.24.3. The following options are available to controlling authorities when supersession is war-
   ranted, but not all cryptonet members hold replacement key. In order of preference:
       A2.24.3.1. Electronically generate key and transmit to cryptonet members via an uncompromised
       cryptosystem approved for over-the-air key transfer.
       A2.24.3.2. Transmit printed key settings by a cryptosystem that provides end-to-end encryption
       equal to the classification of the transmitted key (e.g., the Automatic Digital Network system,
       secure facsimile, or secure telephone). Encrypt printed key settings by automanual or one-time
       pad system and transmit over a system secured at a lower level than the encrypted key.
       A2.24.3.3. Reproduce printed key settings and physically transfer to cryptonet members. Do not
       reproduce punched tape without the authorization of DIRNSA/V51. Converting hard copy keying
       material to electronic form for equipment fill is not considered reproduction.
       A2.24.3.4. Transfer physical key to cryptonet members in a CFD or DTD. When keyed, users
       must protect the CFD at the same level as the highest classification level of the key it contains.
       Refer to AFSSI 3021, (FOUO) Interim Operational Security Doctrine for the AN/CYZ-10/A Data
       Transfer Device (DTD), for handling and classification of the DTD.
   A2.24.4. When precautionary supersession is not feasible, several options are available to the con-
   trolling authority. In order of preference, the controlling authority may:
       A2.24.4.1. Extend the cryptoperiod of uncompromised keying material in accordance with A2.14
       and Attachment 3.
       A2.24.4.2. Exclude from cryptonet operations those members who do not hold or are not fur-
       nished replacement material.
       A2.24.4.3. Suspend cryptonet operations until key is resupplied.
       A2.24.4.4. Continue to use the compromise key. This action is a last resort when normal super-
       session of the compromised material will take place before emergency supersession can occur or
       where keying material changes have a serious detrimental effect on operations, or where no
       replacement material is available. The controlling authority must alert cryptonet members (by

                                                13
   other secure means if available) that a possible compromise has taken place and direct that mem-
   bers minimize transmissions using the compromised key. NOTE: Use this option only when con-
   tinued cryptonet operation is absolutely essential to the mission.
A2.24.5. Controlling authorities will direct traffic reviews of record traffic encrypted in compro-
mised keying material when warranted.
   A2.24.5.1. When a traffic review is directed, all cryptonet members must evaluate all traffic for
   the time period involved. Determine what level of traffic and the amount of information that was
   compromised. The cryptonet members gather the information and send a message to the control-
   ling authority with INFO to the supporting COMSEC account, HQ CPSG/ZCK, and supporting
   COMSEC accounts MAJCOM.

                       GUIDELINES FOR EXTENDING CRYPTOPERIODS

A3.1. Extensions. When you must extend cryptoperiods for reasons other than logistics needs (for exam-
ple, under pre-strike, battlefield, or field training conditions), controlling authorities are encouraged to
conduct a risk assessment prior to implementing the extension. Controlling authorities should consider
the following factors before making a decision as to the length of time they will extend the cryptoperiod.
   A3.1.1. Size of the Cryptonet. The key used on a large cryptonet is usually more vulnerable to com-
   promise than the key used on a small cryptonet because it is available at more locations and more peo-
   ple have access to it. Also, large nets generally carry higher volumes of traffic than small nets. The
   compromise of a key used to secure a large net could make more intelligence available to an adver-
   sary. For this reason, controlling authorities must keep their cryptonets as small as operationally fea-
   sible.
   A3.1.2. Location and Operating Environment of Cryptonet Members. Cryptonet members located in
   the United States, its territories, and its protectorates are normally at less risk than those in other loca-
   tions. Cryptonet members located in high risk environments (that is, areas outside the United States
   where there is a small or no United States or allied military presence or where the political climate is
   unstable) have an increased risk of physical compromise. Mobile and tactical users have a greater
   opportunity for loss (particularly undetected loss) of material than fixed cryptonet members. In addi-
   tion, loss on the battlefield could pose an immediate threat not only to United States communications
   but also to United States lives.
   A3.1.3. Sensitivity and Perishability of Traffic. The controlling authority should consider the classi-
   fication of the protected information, and whether the information is of long-or-short term intelligence
   value. Compromising a key used to secure upper level strategic communications would have a more
   devastating effect on United States security than compromising a key used to secure highly perishable
   or lower level tactical communications.
   A3.1.4. Emergency Supersession Plan. The controlling authority must have a plan for replacing
   compromised key. They must know approximately how quickly they can replace the key if the plan
   is realistic in a worst case scenario. The controlling authority must establish procedures for rekeying
   the net, because it is extremely difficult to accomplish an unscheduled rekey in a large net without cre-
   ating additional problems and confusion. The controlling authority must know the CMCS channels
   that support the cryptonet as well as the electronic key transfer or distribution capabilities of the asso-
   ciated equipment.
   A3.1.5. Operation Impact of an Extended Cryptoperiod. The controlling authority must make an
   assessment as to whether extending the cryptoperiod is for operational necessity. Do not extend cryp-
   toperiods for operator’s convenience. If we do not follow standard procedures during wartime, the
   value of our peacetime training is questionable.

A3.2. If cryptoperiod extensions are necessary to maintain critical communications during battle (actual
or field training), the following guidelines apply:
   A3.2.1. Begin all cryptoperiods with a new key setting.
   A3.2.2. Extend cryptoperiods by net and not by short title, whenever possible.

                                                  15
A3.2.3. Rekey all affected nets when there is a break in activity.
