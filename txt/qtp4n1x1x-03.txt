                                            INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid which will
assist Surgical Service Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable elements, which help the trainer guide the trainee into
becoming proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for
task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the
trainee’s duty position (items identified in the CFETP as core tasks are mandatory), then determine the
order in which you want the trainee to learn about each subject area. Direct the trainee to review the
training references to better understand the objective of each module. Go through the steps in the task
performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn each step; some objectives may take
more time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each
task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective,
follow the evaluation instructions. Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each objective. If the
trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training
record. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing more training until the
objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on each module. After the trainer has ensured and
documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, the trainee should be evaluated by a certifier.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them by contacting the below individual.

                    PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUES FOR REMOVAL OF BODY HAIR


                                         Dry shave Using Surgical Clippers
SUBJECT AREA:                                  Remove body hair from incision site in accordance with surgeon’s
                                               orders

TASK(s):                                       Dry Shave Using Surgical Clippers

                                               Standards, Recommended Practices and Guidelines

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                            Electric clipper, bed protector pads (chux), gloves, wide surgical tape

OBJECTIVE:                                     The trainee will, without error, properly remove body hair from
                                               incision site using electric hair clippers

REMARKS/NOTES:                                 Since this task involves direct hands-on patient care, ensure the trainee
                                               understands the process, knows inherent risk factors, and is closely
                                               supervised during the evaluation. If the patient is conscious, explain
                                               the procedure and purpose of the evaluation, and ensure you obtain the
                                               patient’s permission before performing the procedure/evaluation.
                                               Male personnel should prep male patients; female personnel should
                                               prep female patients. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
                                               immediately and correct the trainee if performance may
                                               compromise safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal protective
                                               equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.
2. After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee must
   satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.
3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.
4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
   in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form 1098,
   Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

                           Dry Shave Using Surgical Clippers                                SAT       UNSAT
                                    Preparatory Phase
1. Check physician’s orders in patient’s chart or other locally approved document for
    specific physician preferences
2. Arrange for private, well lit area to perform hair removal
3. Double-check supplies; ensure extra supplies available as needed
4. Explain the procedure to the patient (if conscious)
5. Wash hands and don gloves
                                    Performance Phase
1. Expose only the area to be shaved
2. Place protective pads or towels under and around site to contain clipped hair as it
    is removed
3. Inspect the skin. Some conditions to look for include:
    a. Irritation: do not clip unless surgeon specifically orders to do so
    b. Open lacerations or sores: do not clip unless surgeon specifically orders to do
        so
    c. Moles, skin tags, nevi: exercise caution around to prevent removing or cutting
4. Open and attach disposable head to handle (if applicable)
5. Following manufacturer instructions for use, start clippers and remove hair from
    site. Most common guidelines are:
    a. Hold the disposable head flat against the patient’s skin
    b. Clip in the direction against the direction hair is growing
    c. Lift clippers and use towel or similar item to clean loose hair from head as it
        becomes blocked
6. After site is clipped to satisfaction, use tape to “blot” remaining clipped hairs from
site, remove drapes, then blot again if necessary
7. Inspect skin. Report any irritation or abnormality immediately
8. Remove gloves and wash hands

                                                     cotton-tipped applicators for deep areas (umbilicus)
                                                     sterile containers for solution/scrub
                                                     sterile towels for blotting detergent from skin
                                             Have available: sterile scrub brush for scabs/dead tissue

OBJECTIVE:                                   The trainee will, without error, aseptically prepare the skin of a
                                             patient’s abdominal or broad anatomical area for surgery using an
                                             antiseptic agent

REMARKS/NOTES:                               The procedure outlined in this QTP assumes the operative site is clean
                                             as for routinely scheduled elective surgical procedures. If the site is
                                             dirty, as in dirt/gravel from trauma cases, ensure the trainee removes
                                             gross soil by performing a preliminary wash IAW local policy before
                                             the skin prep. Since this task involves hands-on patient care, ensure
                                             the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors, and is
                                             closely supervised during the evaluation. If the patient is conscious,
                                             explain the procedure and purpose of the evaluation, and ensure you
                                             obtain the patient’s permission before performing the
                                             procedure/evaluation. Male personnel should prep male patients;
                                             female personnel should prep female patients. The evaluator will
                                             STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
                                             performance compromises safety. Ensure the trainee dons all
                                             personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards or
                                             precautions.

                                                     nails/scabs/dead tissue

OBJECTIVE:                                   The trainee will, without error, aseptically prepare the skin of a
                                             patient’s extremity for surgery using antiseptic agent

REMARKS/NOTES:                               The procedure outlined in this QTP assumes the operative site is clean
                                             as for routinely scheduled elective surgical procedures. If the site is
                                             dirty, as in dirt/gravel from trauma cases, ensure the trainee removes
                                             gross soil by performing a preliminary wash IAW local policy before
                                             the skin prep. Since this task involves hands-on patient care, ensure
                                             the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors, and is
                                             closely supervised during the evaluation. If the patient is conscious,
                                             explain the procedure and purpose of the evaluation, and ensure you
                                             obtain the patient’s permission before performing the
                                             procedure/evaluation. Male personnel should prep male patients;
                                             female personnel should prep female patients. The evaluator will
                                             STOP the procedure immediately and correct the trainee if
                                             performance compromises safety. Ensure the trainee dons all
                                             personal protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards or
                                             precautions.


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.
2. After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee
   must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
   documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). All recurring evaluation should be documented
   using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved
   substitute record.

OBJECTIVE:                                      The trainee will, without error, aseptically prepare a contaminated
                                                wound or septic area for surgery using an antiseptic agent

REMARKS/NOTES:                                  Since this task involves hands-on patient care, ensure the trainee
                                                understands the process, knows inherent risk factors, and is closely
                                                supervised during the evaluation. If the patient is conscious, explain
                                                the procedure and purpose of the evaluation, and ensure you obtain the
                                                patient’s permission before performing the procedure/evaluation. Male
                                                personnel should prep male patients; female personnel should prep
                                                female patients. The evaluator will STOP the procedure
                                                immediately and correct the trainee if performance compromises
                                                safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal protective equipment
                                                (PPE) required by current standards or precautions.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. After the trainee has received instruction, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task. The trainee
   must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.
3. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be
   documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS). All recurring evaluation should be documented
   using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved
   substitute record.

                               Non-Sterile, Preliminary Phase
1. Check patient chart for operative site, allergies, special notes
2. Ask anesthesia provider for permission to begin prep
3. Turn on and adjust overhead lights to illuminate site
4. Explain procedure to patient (if awake)
5. Expose site and protect bed (and tourniquet, if used) from solution according to
    location of incision site
6. Move prep stand close to patient’s side
7. Move lined kick-bucket within arm’s reach of prep site
8 Double-check patient’s chart for operative site, allergies, notes
                                Sterile, Antiseptic Prep Phase
1. Wash hands, then don sterile gloves
2. Prepare prep set:
    a. Pour solutions into proper containers. NOTE: If solution bottles are not sterile,
        this is done before donning gloves
    b. Prepare applicators for “paint”
3. Isolate stoma, septic area, or contaminated area by laying solution-soaked sponges
    over it
4. Begin timed wash or scrub (local policy, commonly 5-minutes)
    a. Wet sponges or applicators with detergent; squeeze out excess
    b. If incision site is not included in the contaminated area, start at incision site, If
        incision site is in the contaminated area, start approximately 1-inch away from
        the isolated area. Use circular scrubbing motion and work out from center in a
        spiral pattern, AVOIDING the contaminated area
    c. Discard sponge/applicator when outer perimeter reached; DO NOT RETRACE
    d. Repeat process with fresh sponges/applicators for prescribed time
    e. Using fresh sponges, clean contaminated/septic area for prescribed time.
5. Dry the prep site using absorbent towels and aseptic technique; dry contaminated
    area separately from clean area (may require extra towels)
6. Begin antiseptic “paint”
    a. Wet sponge sticks or applicators with solution
    b. If incision site is not included in the contaminated area, start at incision site, If
        incision site is in the contaminated area, start approximately 1-inch away from
        the isolated area. Use circular motion and work out from center in a spiral
        pattern, AVOIDING the contaminated area
    c. Discard sponge/applicator when outer perimeter reached; DO NOT RETRACE
    d. Repeat process with fresh sponge stick/applicator a second time, ensure full
        coverage of prep site
    e. Using fresh sponges, apply two coats of “paint” to the contaminated or septic
        area
7. Check for pooled solution under patient; blot dry
                    SKIN PREP-CONTAMINATED WOUNDS                                        SAT          UNSAT
8. Visually inspect for skin reaction; immediately report positive findings
                               Non-Sterile, Final Phase
1. Remove bed protective pads, recheck for pooled solution; cover or replace wet
   linen
2. Disassemble prep set and discard all disposable items into same kick-bucket liner
   used to discard prep sponges
3. Collect non-counted sponges and other trash from other kick-bucket liners in room;
   discard with prep supplies
4. Discard gloves into same kick-bucket liner; remove liner from bucket, seal, and
   keep in the room (reline kick-bucket)
5. Wash hands
6. Document prep per local policy (usually on AF 1864)
