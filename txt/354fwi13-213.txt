                                             Chapter 1

                                GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General
     1.1.1. The goal of the airfield driving program is to create a safe airfield environment. Safe
     operation of motor vehicles on the airfield is essential to normal aircraft operations and
     maintenance. Motor vehicles present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground
     personnel. Carelessness, haste, and disregard for established safety standards are the primary
     source of aircraft or vehicle collisions, incidents, and personnel injury with motor vehicles on
     the airfield.
     1.1.2. Standards set by this instruction are designed to control airfield vehicle operations and
     will be used in conjunction with 354 FWI 11-250, Local Flying Procedures.
     1.1.3. Unit commanders, Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM), Airfield
     Management (AM) and Security Forces (SF) personnel have the authority to revoke airfield
     driving privileges.
     1.1.4. Personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring airfield vehicle safety,
     detecting unauthorized vehicles, and immediately reporting airfield driving violations to
     Airfield Management.
     1.1.5. Airfield Management will investigate airfield driving violations and take appropriate
     action IAW this instruction and AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving. If necessary, Airfield
     Management will notify the Security Forces Control Center (SFCC) for assistance with
     detaining violators and/or issuing citations.
1.2. 354th Fighter Wing Commander (354 FW/CC)
     1.2.1. Designates personnel and agencies to support the Airfield Driving Program.
     1.2.2. May reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential duties
     following suspension or revocation of an individual’s civilian driver’s license and/or base
     driving privileges. See AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, Chapter 2
     for additional information. Authority must not be delegated. ADPMs will coordinate with
     the Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM) to finalize the reinstatement and provide a copy of
     354 FW/CC approval letter for record.
     1.2.3. Approves publication of the Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
     1.2.4. May request an Air Force Safety Action Team (AFRSAT) through PACAF Airfield
     Operations Branch (A3AO) if there are recurring problems with runway incursions.
     1.2.5. Reviews runway incursion incidents and corrective actions taken.
1.3. Operations Group Commander or equivalent

3.4. Runway Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Position Markings VFR Hold Position
Markings consist of four parallel retro-reflective yellow stripes extending across the width of
each taxiway/runway intersection, 150 feet from edge of the runway. The two lines closest to the
runway are dashed and the other two are solid marks identifying the boundary of the CMA. No
vehicle will cross over this marking without control tower permission via two way radio
communication during normal airfield operating hours (0700L-2300L), or Airfield Management
permission after normal airfield operating hours. See attachment 10, Airfield Diagram.

Figure 3.3. VFR Hold Position Marking




3.5. Runway VFR Hold Position Signs VFR hold position signs have white inscriptions on a
red background and are located on either the left side or both sides of a taxiway, adjacent to VFR
runway hold position marking. This sign also indicates the boundary of the CMA. During
periods of snow cover when the VFR hold position markings cannot be seen, operators will use
the VFR hold position signs to identify the CMA.

Figure 3.4. VFR Hold Position Sign




3.6. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights Perimeter / airfield access road on the south end of the
airfield falls within instrument landing system (ILS) signal areas, which must be protected from
vehicle traffic interruptions when aircraft are on final approach. When the red light is activated
by tower, vehicles will stop until the light returns to yellow, or verbal permission is granted by
tower via two way radio communication.

4.10. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention and Control
   4.10.1. Foreign object inspections must be completed before operating a vehicle on or
   returning to any paved airfield surface from an unpaved surface. A visual check to ensure all
   external vehicle components are secured. Secure any/all items loaded on payload vehicle,
   including all tie down device loose ends such as chains, ropes, packaging or other items that
   may become dislodged during movement while on the airfield. The inspection will also
   include tires, wheel wells, fenders, and truck beds. Vehicles equipped with towable magnets
   will have debris removed from the magnets. Perform FOD checks during hours of darkness
   with a flashlight. Rollover tire checks are mandatory.
   4.10.2. During winter conditions, snow and ice accumulation will be removed from vehicles
   before they are operated on the airfield.
   4.10.3. Vehicles will be operated on hard surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If a
   transition from an unpaved to a paved surface results in a FOD hazard (mud, gravel, ice,
   etc.), the vehicle operator will ensure a sweeper is requested through Airfield Management to
   remove the debris.
   4.10.4. Vehicle operators encountering foreign debris will stop and secure the debris. Large
   amounts of debris will immediately be reported to Airfield Management, who will coordinate
   for a sweeper.
4.11. Snow Chains / Studded Tires
   4.11.1. Tire chains may only be used on airfield pavements after obtaining
   coordination/approval from the Airfield Manager, Wing Safety, and CES. The requesting
   agency will conduct a risk assessment with the above agencies when evaluating the need for
   tire chains to minimize pavement damage and FOD. Note: To reduce spark producing
   potential, only non-sparking material can be used.
   4.11.2. Studded tires will NOT be authorized on the airfield at any time.
4.12. Night Vision Devices (NVD)
   4.12.1. Night Vision Devices are NOT authorized for use while operating vehicles on the
   EAFB airfield.

4.13. Cell Phone Use Cell phone use (government or personal) while driving vehicles on the
airfield (airfield and base proper) is prohibited and will result in automatic termination of EAFB
airfield driving privileges. Violations to this guidance will be immediately reported to SFS.
Vehicles must be completely stopped in an area that will not impede aircraft traffic or emergency
response vehicles prior to cell phone use by the driver. Hands-free devices are considered a
distraction and are not authorized for use while operating vehicles on the airfield.
4.14. Disabled Vehicles
   4.14.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power, every
   means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground vehicle
   operator will:
       4.14.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
       4.14.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       “All parties BREAK, BREAK-this is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center.” State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
   4.14.2. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g., security forces, civil engineer,
   transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist removing the disabled vehicle from the
   airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or runway.
   4.14.3. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
   4.14.4. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify ATCT and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of the
   disabled vehicle from the CMA.
       4.14.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in
       the CMA.
       4.14.4.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
       safest way possible.
4.15. Pedestrian Movement
   4.15.1. At a minimum, pedestrians on the airfield must adhere to the following procedures:
       4.15.1.1. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the
       flying mission.
       4.15.1.2. Walk facing oncoming traffic.
       4.15.1.3. Do not sit or recline on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with normal
       ground vehicle and aircraft operations.
       4.15.1.4. Do not enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from the
       ATCT.
4.16. Emergency Vehicle Operations
   4.16.1. Initial runway IFE/GE responders will be limited to Fire Department, Ambulance,
   and Airfield Management personnel. Security Forces and Crash Recovery will be considered
354FWI13-213 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                             33


   secondary responders and will hold short of the CMA and runway environment unless
   otherwise requested by the responding Fire Chief.
   4.16.2. When responding to IFE/GE, emergency response vehicles will proceed cautiously
   and expeditiously. Drivers will not exceed speeds that are prudent for current visibility
   and/or pavement conditions.
4.17. Radio Communication

                                           Chapter 5

           CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA AND RADIO PROCEDURES

5.1. Controlled Movement Area (CMA)
   5.1.1. The CMA includes the runway, and 150 feet of areas adjacent to the runway edges.
   Access to the CMA shall be limited to mission essential operations.
   5.1.2. Vehicles or personnel will establish two-way radio contact with control tower and
   receive approval before entering any portion of the CMA. NOTE: Callsigns are required for
   CMA access.
      5.1.2.1. When control tower is closed, CMA entry approval authority is delegated to
      Airfield Management. Two-way radio contact must be established and maintained.
      5.1.2.2. When the airfield is closed, Airfield Operations maintains ―CMA" access
      authority. In the event Airfield Operations is unavailable, (354 OG/CC approved
      closures), ―uncontrolled CMA‖ access authority is transferred to the 354 FW Command
      Post. Regardless of whether the CMA is under ―controlled‖ or ―uncontrolled‖ status, all
      components of this regulation apply.
      5.1.2.3. Airfield Management will contact 354 FW/CP to receive status of the CMA,
      then conduct a runway check before reopening the airfield. Airfield Management will
      pass the status and control of the runway to tower once the check is complete. Any
      remaining vehicles on the CMA will be under tower control at that time.
   5.1.3. The VFR/Runway Hold Lines indicate the CMA boundary. Barrier access roads have
   white stop bars by the shelters to indicate the CMA boundary. Personnel working on the
   infield areas of the airfield will use barrier shacks as a visual reference to determine the edge
   of the CMA boundary.
   5.1.4. Tower may limit the areas of the CMA that may be accessed. For example, grass
   mowing equipment may receive approval within the CMA, but be told "...approved up to but
   not on the runway..." Note: This does not allow personnel access to any paved portion of
   the runway (including shoulders). Barrier maintenance personnel may be approved into
   barrier shacks but told to hold short of the runway.
   5.1.5. Any time tower directs vehicles or personnel to exit the CMA, they will depart the
   CMA immediately by the most direct (paved) route, and position themselves outside the
   CMA.
   5.1.6. When crossing a runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing
   point is the departure end.
   5.1.7. Taxiways (except for areas on the runway side of VFR/Runway Hold Lines) and
   parking aprons are not part of the CMA. Radio contact with control tower is not required in
   these areas, unless towing aircraft.
5.2. Convoy / Escort Procedures (snow removal team, pavement repair team, etc. )
354FWI13-213 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      35


   5.2.1. Personnel acting as airfield driving escorts must be fully aware of their associated
   responsibilities. Escorts will brief drivers on the route, speed limitations, and airfield driving
   procedures.
   5.2.2. Convoys will maintain close intervals when crossing CMA. The convoy escort is the
   lead vehicle and responsible for communications with tower as well as each vehicle in the
   convoy.
   5.2.3. The lead vehicle will contact control tower and advise how many vehicles are in the
   convoy; i.e., "...SNOW THREE, PLUS THREE." indicates a total of four vehicles. The lead
   vehicle will not enter the CMA until control tower (or Airfield Management after normal
   hours) approves, and will not call off of the CMA until last vehicle crosses the CMA
   boundary.
5.3. Radio Procedures
   5.3.1. Vehicles and personnel will contact tower via Ramp Net.
   5.3.2. If radio contact is lost between a vehicle within the CMA and tower, tower will flash
   the runway lights on and off, then use light-gun signals to direct vehicles to exit the CMA. If
   a vehicle operator or pedestrian experiences radio failure, the driver must immediately depart
   the CMA and reattempt to contact tower to report ―OFF‖ of the CMA. If contact with tower
   cannot be made, drivers will report to Airfield Management for assistance.
   5.3.3. Vehicles will use approved call signs described in Attachment 11, Vehicle Call sign
   Listing. Airfield Management may approve other temporary call signs in coordination with
   tower.
5.4. Radio Phraseology
   5.4.1. It is imperative proper phraseology be used to eliminate potential miscommunication.
   Radio transmissions are monitored (and recorded) by Airfield Management. Use of other
   than proper phraseology may result in loss of driving privileges.
   5.4.2. Radio communications will be kept to the minimum required to accomplish the
   objective. Use the phonetic alphabet (Attachment 9) for individual letters and/or numbers
   included in radio transmissions.
      5.4.2.1. Vehicles or personnel will not use the words CLEAR, CLEARED, or
      CLEARANCE. These words are reserved for communications between control tower
      and aircraft. Exception: Vehicle operators may reply ―Loud and Clear‖ in response to an
      ATCT request for radio transmission quality or clarity.
      5.4.2.2. PROCEED: The only word that authorizes access to CMA.
      5.4.2.3. ON: the proper term for entering the CMA.
      5.4.2.4. OFF: The proper term for exiting the CMA.
      5.4.2.5. HOLD-SHORT: Is disapproval of a request to enter CMA. Vehicles will hold
      short of the runway/VFR hold line.
      5.4.2.6. CROSS or ACROSS: Authorizes a vehicle to cross the CMA. If approved to
      cross, vehicles will not stop within the CMA without further tower permission.
 36                                                          354FWI13-213 11 OCTOBER 2012


   5.4.3. All ATC instructions issued by tower must be acknowledged and read back
   VERBATIM. If tower’s instructions are not completely understood, drivers will ask tower to
   SAY AGAIN.
   5.4.4. The normal communication sequence uses the call sign of station being called (who is
   being called), followed by the driver’s call sign (who is calling), followed by the vehicle’s
   location (where the caller is) and the request (what the driver wants to do).
      5.4.4.1. Sample communication sequence:
      5.4.4.2. Vehicle attempting to cross the runway: ―Eielson Tower, Airfield One,‖
      ―Airfield One, Eielson Tower.‖ ―Eielson Tower, Airfield One on Taxiway Echo, request
      to cross runway.‖ ―Airfield One, Eielson Tower, proceed across runway at Taxiway
      Echo, report when off.‖ ―Eielson Tower, Airfield One proceeding across runway at
      Taxiway Echo, will report when off.‖
      5.4.4.3. Vehicle has crossed the runway and is out of the CMA: ―Eielson Tower,
      Airfield One is off the runway at three-quarter barrier access road.‖ ―Airfield One,
      Eielson Tower, remain off runway.‖ ―Eielson Tower, Airfield One will remain off
      runway.‖
5.5. Control Tower Light Gun Signals
   5.5.1. Air traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with
   aircraft or ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences
   a radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely as
   possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to advise
   of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway, should turn
   the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait for the
   controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know and comply
   with the following signals:
      5.5.1.1. Steady Green Light: ―Cleared to cross, ―Proceed, ―Go.
      5.5.1.2. Steady Red Light: ―STOP! Vehicle will not be moved.
      5.5.1.3. Flashing Red Light: ―Clear active taxiway/runway.
      5.5.1.4. Flashing White Light: ―Return to starting point.
      5.5.1.5. Red and Green Light: ―General warning. Exercise extreme caution during
      alerts and emergency conditions all non-essential personnel will withdraw to AM or their
      work control center until the emergency is terminated. The withdrawal of contractors will
      be at the discretion of AM.
354FWI13-213 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    37

6.1. General
   6.1.1. All personnel operating on the airfield are responsible for identifying and reporting
   airfield driving violations to Airfield Management immediately. Driving violations which
   violate 354 FWI 31-201 traffic rules can result in a citation issued by the SFS.
   6.1.2. Commanders and ADPMs may only revoke privileges for personnel assigned to their
   unit, and will notify the Deputy Airfield Manager when doing so. If Airfield Management
   revokes privileges, The Deputy Airfield Manager will notify the unit commander and
   ADPM.
6.2. CMA/Airfield Driving Violations (CMAV)
   6.2.1. A CMAV event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians
   entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. This definition also includes
   runway incursions.
   6.2.2. The Deputy Airfield Manager will immediately notify the 354 OSS/CC, 354 OG/CC,
   354 FW/SE and the applicable unit commander and ADPM of CMA violations. Airfield
   Management will take immediate action to correct a problem or apply interim control
   measures to prevent further CMA violations.
   6.2.3. CMA violations that impact flight operations safety will be reported to 354 FW/SE via
   AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report, within 24 hours of violation.
   6.2.4. CMA violations that do not impact aircraft operations will be reported to 354 FW/SE
   via AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, within 24 hours of violation. The AOF/CC, SE,
   and Wing ADPM will work as a team to assign all runway incursions an operational category
   (i.e., Operational Error, Pilot Deviation and Vehicle/Pedestrian). Note: 354 FW/SE will
   process all CMA violations as Class E safety events IAW AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigation and Reports. Runway incursions will be assigned an operational category
   defined in Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information, for trend
   analysis. Safety will brief all CMA violations at quarterly Airfield Operations Boards.
   6.2.5. The AF IMT 651 and/or AF IMT 457 must include the following information in the
   narrative section:
