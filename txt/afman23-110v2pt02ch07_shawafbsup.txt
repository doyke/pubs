7.9.2.3. All individuals processing/clearing rejects through the Asset Management System
(AMS) must be appointed in writing and updated as necessary via an appointment letter by their
respective flight chief. The letter is to include name, rank, duty phone, and office symbol. These
appointment letters must be forwarded to the Materiel Management Flight, Customer Support
Section, 20 LRS/LGRMC.
           7.19.2.3. The “Reason Why” phrase must be specific and plainly state why a reject
           had to be force-cleared (clear carded), rather than correcting and re-processing the
           transaction using Option 1. The “Reason Why” phrase will include the four or five
           character office symbol of the flight or element which manages the particular input
           function or remote device. The remaining 26 positions of the “Reason Why” field
           will contain the specific reason the reject had to be force-cleared. If the transaction
           was reprocessed with another Transaction Identifier Code (TRIC), document,
           number, stock number, or system designator: enter the specific data, abbreviating
           where possible. For duplicate processing errors, provide the transaction serial
           number of the originally-processed transaction.
