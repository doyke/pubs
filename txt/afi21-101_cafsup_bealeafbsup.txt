                                      U-2 FCF PROGRAM

A25.1. U-2 FCF Program.

A251.1. FCF PILOT TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION. Follow the FCF training program
checklist developed by the 9 OG/FCF OIC.

A25.1.2. Only highly qualified and experienced U-2 instructor pilots are selected as U-2 FCF
pilots. Minimum qualifications are 500 U-2 hours for FCF certification.

A25.1.3. U-2 instructor pilots receive FCF mobile training as part of the instructor upgrade
syllabus and are qualified to mobile FCF missions.

A25.1.4. U-2 FCF flight certification. One FCF certification flight is required and will be flown
in
a two seat U-2 aircraft if available. When flown in a two seat U-2, the sortie may be a training
sortie or actual FCF and will be flown with a current FCF pilot. When flown in a single seat U-
2, the sortie will be a training sortie and a current FCF pilot will act as the mobile. When a
single seat U-2 is used for certification, the upgrade pilot and FCF pilot mobile will be scheduled
for a CTP session on mission planning day before the flight.

A25.1.5. When flying a practice FCF profile does not press battery EMER OVRIDE, as this will
require maintenance action after the flight. All other electrical steps in the FCF checklist may be
accomplished providing the aircraft is VMC and visual contact with the ground can be
maintained. Fly practice FCF sorties with modified Dash –6 checklist boards developed by the
1 RS and the FCF/OIC.

A25.2. CURRENCY AND CREW DUTY DAY

A25.2.1. U-2 FCF pilots will have a 90-day currency on FCF sorties. U-2 pilots may update
currency on a training sortie by mission planning and flying with the appropriate practice FCF
boards and performing flight control checks, manual gear extension, PRI/SEC checks, electrical
sequence checks and or IFA checks. Pilots do not need to accomplish all of these items to up
date currency.

A25.2.2. If FCF currency is lost, it may be regained by flying a practice FCF profile under the
supervision of a current FCF pilot/mobile.

A25.2.3. U-2 FCF pilots will maintain a 45-day SFO currency for FCF missions.

A25.2.4. Detachment/OL/Mission commanders may extend FCF pilot currency if the necessity
for an FCF arises at and off station location with out a more highly qualified pilot available.

A25.2.5. U-2 FCF pilots have a 10-hour crew duty day. When the pressure suit is worn, suit up
                                   AFI21-101_CAFSUP_BEALEAFBSUP 9 JANUARY 2012

time to landing will not exceed 6 hours. High flight transition duty day limits still apply.


A25.3. SCHEDULING

A25.3.1. Aircrew scheduling will notify the pilot, mobile and the FCF OIC of the FCF with
sufficient time for mission preparation. Short notice FCFs requires direct notification to the pilot
and mobile.

A25.3.2. Aircrew scheduling will incorporate the FCF into the flying schedule and notify QA of
the scheduled time.

A25.3.3. The selected pilot/mobile will contact QA as part of their mission planning to discuss
the particulars of the FCF and to coordinate the preflight QA briefing and Forms review. The
preflight briefing will be held at QA, 2 hours prior to takeoff.

A25.3.4. FCFs generated as the result of phase inspections of the TU-2 require qualified pilots in
both cockpits. One pilot must be a current FCF pilot and the other an IP, IP upgrade or an FCF
trainee. Other two seat FCFs may be flown either dual or solo, based on QA recommendation
and pilot availability.

A25.4. FCF PILOT PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS

A25.4.1. Follow established procedures for mission planning.

A25.4.2. Review FCF procedures prior to flight. At a minimum review ACCI 21-101 sup1, T.O.
1-1-300, Dash-6, and Dash-6 mission boards.

A25.4.3. Pilot and mobile will meet at the ops center NLT 2+30 and proceed to base ops. If
weather meets FCF criteria, file and proceed to QA for aircraft history and forms review.

A25.4.4. Receive aircraft maintenance and status briefing from QA prior to flight. Verify that all
maintenance is accomplished with complete documentation. All open write-ups and ERs must
be signed off prior to pilot accepting the aircraft. Final acceptance may be accomplished on the
flight line if the aircraft is ―essentially‖ ready to go at the QA briefing.

A25.4.5. Review/brief requirements with the mobile officer prior to flight. This review/brief
should include Dash-1 and Dash-6 procedures, expanded preflight procedures, weather
requirements, flight following procedures and expected pilot/mobile plan of action in the event
of an in-flight emergency.

A25.4.6. Mobile will record all ground ―Mobile Officer‖ items on the pilots FCF board and
perform preflight IAW 1 procedures.
Pay special attention to sys tems/areas in which
maintenance was performed requiring the FCF.
                                   AFI21-101_CAFSUP_BEALEAFBSUP 9 JANUARY 2012

A25.4.7. Pilot show at aircraft is normally 45 minutes prior, with engine start 15 minutes prior to
scheduled launch, to allow sufficient time to inspect systems and record data on FCF boards.

A25.4.8. Verify proper operation and displacement of all flight controls with ground crew and
verify proper rudder and turn response with mobile.

A25.4.9. Use maximum runway availability for launch when practical. FCFs on a second
attempt or when major maintenance was not performed may use intersection takeoffs IAW with
local procedures.

A25.4.10. U-2 mobile officer will flight follow the U-2 on UHF or VHF radio from takeoff to the
point where the aircraft is climbing above FL600 and then again during the descent to landing.

A25.4.11. U-2 pilots will remain within glide distance of the primary landing base, or a suitable
alternate, until all engine and fuel checks have been accomplished.

A25.4.12. U-2 FCF minimum weather is day, VMC and 3 miles visibility. OG/CC or designated
representative (Detachment/OL/Mission Commander) is waiver authority for T.O. 1-1-300 Para
6.2. authorizing ―VFR on top‖ FCFs. When conducting ―VFR on top‖ FCF missions, minimum
weather at departure base is 5000 AGL and 5 miles visibility and all FCF checklist items must be
conducted in VMC.

A25.5. ANY OF THE FOLLOWING WOULD CAUSE AN FCF TO BE A
NONRELEASE:

A25.5.1. Any system malfunction that does not allow the aircrew to complete the FCF. If the
original condition that generated the FCF check good, and the only item(s) not checked can be
easily evaluated by a pilot on a normally scheduled sortie, then the aircraft can be released with a
write-up to check the item(s).

A25.5.2. Any system malfunction that would in the course of correcting the malfunction generate
another FCF. (Example: Flight control rigging problems, or EFTC replacement)

A25.5.3. Engine surges, compressor stalls or flameout.

A25.5.4. Critical systems that do not meet criteria. Critical items on the Dash-6 checklist boards
are identified with an asterisk.

A25.5.5. If a malfunction or series of malfunctions occur that the FCF pilot feels should be
evaluated more closely, then he/she has the option of not releasing the aircraft.
