                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. AFH 23-123,Volume 2, Part 2 covers Standard Base Supply System (SBSS)
Operations information. This part specifies the functional and technical processes applicable to
status inquiries, notices, record maintenance and associated information within the Standard
Base Supply System (SBSS).
Note: In some cases because of system protocols, terminology has not been updated within this
part of AFH 23-123, Vol 2. For example, while the term Defense Logistics Agency Distribution
Service (DLADS) has replaced the term Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO), the
older term is still used for operational reference. The term has intentionally not been updated in
places because system users will encounter the older terminology in their interaction with SBSS.

1.2. Publication information. If the information in this handbook appears to conflict with the
other various volumes, parts, chapters, or sections of this handbook, the conflicts will be referred
to the designated OPR for resolution. This publication may be supplemented at the MAJCOM
level or higher, but all supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for
coordination prior to certification and approval.

                           INQUIRIES/FILE INTERROGATION

Section 4A--SBSS Inquiries.
4.1. Chapter Summary. Sec. 4A of this chapter explains how inquiries can be used in a variety
of ways to obtain file information. Input and output formats for inquiry actions are provided.
Sec. 4B explains the consolidated transaction history inquiry process. Sec. 4C explains the
query capabilities available in the ES-S component of ILS-S.
Note: While the term Materiel Support Division (MSD) is now Consolidated Sustainment
Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S), the terms Materiel Support Division and/or MSD will be
shown as reflected in SBSS outputs until programmatically updated.

4.2. Overview.
4.2.1. Section Summary. This section explains the file interrogation system and gives
instructions for the review and printing of inquiries. The major input and output formats
applicable to inquiries are discussed, as are the file interrogation system's capabilities for
requirements computations, database/key set trace actions, and bulk inquiry processing. See the
end of this section for specific input and output formats applicable to inquiries.
4.2.2. Guidelines. File information can be obtained in several different ways, but the most
sophisticated and versatile tool available is the file interrogation system. This system can be
used by all levels of management and by all input functions during the in-line mode, and by the
Remote Processing Station (RPS)/main system in the end-of-day mode. In addition, the file
interrogation system permits a great variety of input and output formats. To minimize abuse of
this system, management should use the following guidelines:
4.2.2.1. Minimize workload interruption. To minimize normal workload interruptions, all
personnel (at work and at management levels) must exercise discipline to control the volume and
types of file interrogations processed.
4.2.2.2. Review the M32 Report. All levels of management should review the M32, Monthly
Base Supply Management Report, to ensure that the computer and file interrogation systems are
not being abused. This report will help pinpoint areas of abuse so appropriate corrective action
can be taken.
4.2.2.3. Train Personnel. The overall operation of the SBSS can be improved greatly if
personnel are trained to use appropriate inputs and to identify file data from existing SBSS
output products.
4.3. Review and Printing of Inquiries.
4.3.1. Review. The commands and procedures in this paragraph can be used to review an
inquiry. These methods can only be used if page one of your device is set for both input and
output. Use the following commands to make a review:
4.3.1.1. Enter *NEXT to page through multiple page inquiries; or if using a UTS 40, press
UPPER FUNCTION and F1 (see Note 1).
4.3.1.2. Enter *HOLD any time before the next input to hold the inquiry output for review or
print.
4.3.1.3. Enter *STAT to obtain the message number of the messages held/queued for the
device. Output response will be the remote identity, message number, and the message status.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                            7

4.3.1.4. Enter *REVW N XXXX (where x = message number) to redisplay a past held message
for review. The format is the message identity, the type, and the control number of the held
message. The message number can be obtained from the *HOLD or *STAT commands (see
Notes 1 and 2).
Notes:
1. Command is a valid input from VDU only.
2. After reviewing the inquiry, enter *HOLD any time before the next input or output; then
redisplay using *REVW N XXX (where x = message number) command.

4.3.2. Printing Methods. The easiest way to print inquiries is to place the output function
number in the input format. The document will output at the device requested and will not queue
to the paging file. If printing of inquiries queued to the paging file is desired, or if only selected
pages are to be printed, the following steps are provided:
4.3.2.1. If using a UTS 40 or Sperry PC, make certain the control page of the VDU contains a
P1 in the PRINT TO subfield. This is located in the middle field of the first set of parentheses on
the second line, that is, (-/P1/-).
4.3.2.2. Locate the next page/screen using *NEXT (if it is not already displayed).
4.3.2.3. Move the cursor to the bottom line of the VDU.
4.3.2.4. Make certain the printer is ON and the forms are aligned.
4.3.2.5. Depress the PRINT key.
4.3.2.6. Move the cursor to the HOME position.
4.3.2.7. Enter *NEXT.
4.3.2.8. Repeat steps (3) through (7) above until all desired forms are printed.
4.3.3. If using a Z248 computer, simply place the cursor at the bottom of the screen and depress
the ALT & PRT SC keys simultaneously. Depress F1 to display the next page, and then repeat
these steps for each page requiring printed output.
4.3.4. Quality of Printed Outputs. Inquiry outputs can be printed on tabulation paper rather than
DD Form 1348-1A, Issue-Release/Receipt Document. (for specific formats, see Para. 4.21.
through Para. 4.30. and DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, Automated Materiel System Interfaced with
Supply System at Base Level). The narrative inquiry program is designed to use the non-
preprinted DD Form 1348-1A, resulting in an easy to read output document.
4.4. Input Formats - Four Major Types.
4.4.1. Item Records. This general heading applies to all inquiries that start with the printing of
an item record. The type record retrieval code used will determine the amount of the item record
data to be printed. This code will also determine whether or not additional item records and/or
additional records such as repair cycle or detail records are printed. When detail records are
printed from the database key of the next detail set, the document number is DMS CALC for
each, except for authorized/in-use or REM vehicle only detail records. If adjunct records are in
the computer for a requested basic item record and detail records are requested, adjunct records -
1, -2, or -9 are provided (see Para. 4.20).
4.4.2. Detail Records. This heading applies to detail records read out for a specific document
number. Readouts under the detail record heading are related by document number through the
DMS CALC routine. Details printed under the item record heading in the paragraph above are
related through the DMS CALC of the detail sets (see Para. 4.20).

4.4.3. Part Number Records. This heading applies to part number records read out for a specific
part number. Part numbers printed under the item record heading are related through the
database key of the next part number set (see Para. 4.20).
4.4.4. Other Records. This heading includes support records, transaction history records, serial
number records, and can include detail or item records when the inquiry is by the ITEM-DTLS
set (see Para. 4.20).
4.4.4.1. Serial number inquiry can be used to list due-outs (except for Mission Capable
(MICAP)), due-ins, or status linked to aircraft tail numbers or equipment ID numbers. To list the
due-ins they must be linked to the due-out.
4.4.4.2. Serial number inquiry is also used to determine the Awaiting Parts (AWP) due-outs
linked to the Due In For Maintenance (DIFM) detail, you can use the tail number inquiry
(INQTN). Enter the DIFM detail document number without the activity code. For example
INQTN123ES90230023.
4.5. Output Formats.
4.5.1. Output Format Overview. With the implementation of the narrative inquiry output
format, basic and most detail record data are identified by the data element name or by an easily
understood abbreviation. The narrative format is invoked by changing the 001-TYPE-FORM-
FLG = A or B. Also, A&F inquiries Organization Cost Center Record (OCCR) and MACR
records. These inquiries will continue the old output format.
4.5.2. Item Records. Item record data element names will print whether or not actual data are
loaded to the data elements of the record requested. Numeric data items are zero suppressed and
will print the least significant character. To help simplify the output document, item record data
are arranged into four major groups: Basic Item Record Data, Exception Data, Stock Control
Data, and Basic Data Continued (see Para. 4.21.).
4.5.3. Detail Records. Like item records, detail record data element names will print whether or
not actual data are loaded on the detail record requested. Likewise, numeric data items are zero
suppressed and will print the least significant character. Data are printed in the sequence that
data are stored on the record itself.
4.5.4. Other Records. These records, including transaction history and serial number records,
will output using the narrative format.
4.6. Requirements Computation Capability.
4.6.1. Requirements Computation Data. Requirements computation data are called for when the
releveling flag R is placed in position 23 of the item record retrieval input. This data are then
output under the S035 Management Notice heading after all requested details are printed.
4.6.2. Releveling. Releveling is performed based on the following parameters:
4.6.2.1. If the input has an alpha system designator (SD), the program provides releveling data
only for the requested system designator.
4.6.2.2. If the input has a numeric system designator, it reflects releveling data for all numeric
system designators within the set.
4.6.2.3. If the input item record has an ISG number and an interchangeable code of M or I, the
releveling data are for all item records in the group (within the limits specified in the paragraphs
above).
4.7. Data Base Key/Set Tracing Capability. The key/set tracing capability prints the database
keys of records read and it checks the relationships of items requested. This flag is designed to
aid in tracing database key/set errors. The trace information is printed for each record whether or
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                           9

not the record itself is printed. (See Para. 4.24. for database key/set trace output format.) Trace
information is called for by placing a T in position 23.
4.8. Bulk Inquiry Capability.
4.8.1. Bulk inquiries can be performed via ES-S, see ES-S user manual for additional
information.
4.9. Processing Rejects. If rejects are received during inquiry processing, see Ch 7 for required
actions and distribution instructions.
Section 4B-- Consolidated Transaction History Inquiries (CTH).
4.10. Overview. CTH inquiries are an effective way to research transactions and compile those
transactions in a defined sequence. Users can query CTH records back as far as 1 year or more.
CTH inquires also speed up the gathering of statistical data. This section explains the CTH file
interrogation system. It gives instructions for querying, reviewing, and printing records. The
Transaction History Master Inquiry Menu, output formats, and a buffer/paging file are system
features explained in this section. While AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 4 provides procedural
information for the Action Taken Code (ATC) queries, the ES-S User’s Manual provides how-to
guidance and is located on the ES-S CoP. The how-to guidance provides step-by-step guidance
and includes screen snapshots.
4.11. Transaction History Master Inquiry Menu.
4.11.1. The Transaction History Master Inquiry Menu (Para. 4.31.) simplifies the CTH inquiry
process. Users enter the TRIC CTH or the number #860 to display the Transaction History
Master Inquiry Menu. Users can select one of three input formats and define search criteria.
Listed below are the three input formats with the reference where their use is explained:
4.11.2. Stock Number (SN) Inquiry. Para. 4.32., CTH Stock Number Inquiry (CTHNSN/#865),
shows users how to select CTH records using the stock number and transaction date.
4.11.3. Transaction Serial Number Inquiry. Para. 4.33., Transaction History Serial Number
Inquiry (CTHSER/#864), shows users how to select CTH records using a transaction date and
serial number. Users can also select 901 transaction histories by including a stock number with
the transaction date/serial number.
4.11.4. Batch Miscellaneous Option Inquiry. Para. 4.34., Batch Miscellaneous Option Inquiry
(CTHMISC/#866), shows users how to select CTH records using multiple options and from
those selections to produce a printed report.
4.12. Programs.
4.12.1. The CTH System uses three programs to make the CTH inquire possible. They are
internal programs and are automatically activated by the choices made from the Transaction
History Master Inquiry Menu, by screen name, or screen number. These programs are as
follows:
4.12.1.1. Program NGV202. Consolidated History Record Online Inquiry, program NGV202, is
the CTH inquiry entry program. Program NGV202 does the following:
4.12.1.1.1. Calls the applicable input screen based on the option chosen from the Transaction
History Master Inquiry Menu. Edits input CTHNSN, CTHSER, and CTHMISC transactions for
accuracy.
4.12.1.1.2. Reads the CT-DATE-SYS-DESIG record to determine if there are any records on the
database for the dates requested. Displays an error message if there are no records found for the
requested dates.
4.12.1.1.3. Selects CTH records based on input options. Retrieves the item record data, formats
output, and writes records to the output buffer/paging file.

4.12.1.1.5. Calls sub-program NGV202A if the input TRIC is CTHNSN. Calls NGV202B for
CTHSER, NGV202C for CTH MISC, and NGV204 to handle the output buffer/paging file.
4.12.1.1.6. Uses the following database records:
4.12.1.1.6.1. CT-DATE-SYS-DESIG Record (record code 701).
4.12.1.1.6.2. CT-STOCK-NUMBER (record code 702)
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       11

4.12.1.1.6.3. CT-HISTORY Record (record code 704).
4.12.1.1.6.4. CT-SERIAL-NUMBER Record (record code 705).
4.12.1.2. Program NGV204. Consolidated History Output Buffer/Paging File Handler, program
NGV204, does the following:
4.12.1.2.1. Edits input data from program NGV202.
4.12.1.2.2. Builds output data based on input from NGV202. Output screens PAGING/#862 and
CTHDTL/#861 are the most commonly used.
4.12.1.2.3. Generates the following on screen management notices:
4.12.1.2.3.1. There is no record of an inquiry by your user ID on file.
4.12.1.2.3.2. There are no CTH inquiry results available to review.
4.12.1.3. Program NGV278. Consolidated History Batch Inquiry Report, program NGV278, is
the control program for the CTH inquiry batch requests. Concurrent processing of multiple
NGV278s causes system degradation. We recommend the RPS establish the maximum number
of NGV278s that the system can process at one time. Program NGV278 does the following:
4.12.1.3.1. Edits the input parameters for accuracy.
4.12.1.3.2. Selects the CTH records based on the selection criteria in the input parameters.
4.12.1.3.3. Sorts the selected CTH records using the sort indicators in the parameter.
4.12.1.3.4. Produces a short format or long format CTH inquiry report for all inquiries.
4.12.1.3.5. Generates management and reject notices.
4.13. Output Buffer/Paging File.
4.13.1. The Output Buffer/Paging File provides a reserved storage area on the S2200. This
allows you to view the data stored in these areas. The program automatically writes CTH short
output options to the buffer/paging file for Stock Number (CTHNSN) and Serial Number
(CTHSER) inquiries when it has read and selected records based on user input options.
4.13.2. Error Messages. If an error is received while using the buffer/paging file, contact the
RPS and have them process the runstream GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.CREATE/GV-CTH. This
runstream will initialize the buffer/paging file.
4.13.3. File Scanning. There are three ways to display the desired page(s) in the output
buffer/paging file. They are:
4.13.3.1. Moving forward page-by-page in the buffer/paging file by tabbing to Nxt at bottom of
screen and depressing transmit.
4.13.3.2. Moving backward page-by-page by tabbing to Prv and depressing transmit.
4.13.3.3. Moving directly to the desired page by entering the page number into the Page portion
and depressing RETURN/ENTER.
4.13.4. Status Line. Each time a new page displays, the buffer/paging file status line appears at
the bottom of the screen and contains the following:
4.13.4.1. Scrn # Command. The Scrn # command will allow users to either enter an SBSS
screen number or name to call a particular screen or by simply depressing transmit without a
screen number or name which takes the user back to the original CTH inquiry screen. If
CTHNSN input screen is used, depressing F1 from screen #862 (Output Buffer/paging File) will
return user to original CTHNSN screen.
4.13.4.2. Nxt Command. The Nxt command advances to the next output page. If last output
page is displayed, using the Nxt command takes user back to page 1.
4.13.4.3. Prv Command. The Prv command takes you back to the previous output page. If page
1 is displayed, using the Prv command takes user to the last page within the file.
4.13.4.4. Page Command. The page command selects a specific page.

4.13.4.5. Print Pages __ to __ on Sideby/RPS (S or R). Allows user to print a range of output
pages to either their side by printer or creates a file to be printed at the RPS. If R option is used,
the RUNID will be TIPS and the output qualifier is built as follows:

Table 4.2. Option R Output file.

Pos. 1          Gang Number
Pos. 2          Constant GV
Pos. 4          Constant 0
Pos. 5-8        ALN
Pos. 9-12       Local Time HHMM

Note: The filename is NGV202UND001.

4.13.4.6. Function Key F10. Provides online help information on screen output handling.
4.14. Output Formats.
4.14.1. Users may request a short or long output format for the CTHNSN and batch
miscellaneous (CTHMISC) inquiries. The transaction serial number inquiry displays the long
format output on screen.
4.14.2. Short Output Format. Enter an S to display the output in the short format on the screen,
or a B to print in short format at the RPS. The program retrieves the item record indicative data
for inclusion in the output format (see Para. 4.37.). If B option is used, the RUNID will be TIP$
and the output qualifier is built as follows:

Table 4.3. Option B Output file.

Pos. 1         Gang Number
Pos. 2-3       Constant GV
Pos. 4         Constant 0
Pos. 5-8       ALN
Pos. 9-12      Local Time HHMM

Note: The filename is NGV202UND001.

4.14.2.1. If the number of records selected from a CTHNSN inquiry does not exceed 25 pages,
the program puts all the selected records in the buffer/paging file.
4.14.2.2. If the number of records selected from a CTHNSN inquiry exceeds 25 pages, the
program displays a management notice stating that the maximum number of histories have been
selected. If this occurs users should narrow their selection criteria and reprocess the inquiry.
4.14.2.3. If no records are located that meet user input criteria, a message is displayed.
4.14.2.4. If records are located that meet user input criteria, the program retrieves the item
record using the stock number and system designator.
4.14.2.5. If no item record is located on a CTHNSN inquiry, a message is displayed at the top of
the inquiry. If a CTHSER inquiry is processed, the indicative data portion of the screen is blank,
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                         13

except for the programmed indicative data headers. The CTH records are written to the
buffer/paging file if it is a CTHNSN or CTHSER inquiry.
4.14.2.6. If a CTHNSN option B is requested, the output will automatically be sent to the RPS.
Enter from 1-6 characters in the REMARKS field so that the RPS operator can identify the
person who requested the report. If the REMARKS field is left blank, the program uses the
function number to identify the person requesting the report.
4.14.2.7. The entire 704 CT-HISTORY record can be displayed using the short format. User
can tab to a particular transaction date/serial number and depress enter (ensure that the cursor is
positioned immediately to the right of the transaction date/serial number). This will result in a
CTHSER inquiry being processed to retrieve the 704 CT-HISTORY record. Transmitting a non-
blank character following the Next SBSS Scr#, returns user to the original short output screen. If
user tabs to Scrn #, and depresses enter, program returns user to original CTHNSN input screen.
4.14.3. Long Output Format. Enter L to select the long output format and to have the product
printed at the RPS/main site location. The output consists of the complete transaction history.
There are three lines of print per history record with three corresponding lines of headers. Each
line of print and each line of header has a number assigned for cross-referencing and identifying
printed data (see Para. 4.38.). When using the long output format, the following applies:
4.14.3.1. Program NGV202 immediately creates a print file at the RPS when using the L option
from the CTHNSN/#865 screen. If the CTHMISC/#866 screen is used a batch job is created
(NGV278) and is entered in the backlog queue for 23 hours and 50 minutes. If L option is used,
the RUNID will be TIP$ and the output qualifier is built as follows:

Table 4.4. Option B Output File.

Pos. 1         Gang Number
Pos. 2-3       Constant GV
Pos. 4         Constant 0
Pos. 5-8       ALN
Pos. 9-12      Local Time HHMM

Notes:
1. The filename is NGV202UND001.
2. Computer Operations must ensure all NGV278 runs placed in backlog are completed before
the RPS operation terminates (that is, weekend, holidays) and before the DPC save all file
dumps.

4.14.3.2. The output is a printed report, rather than an inquiry. See Para. 4.38. for a sample of
the output format.
4.14.3.3. Enter from 1-6 characters in the REMARKS field so that the RPS operator can identify
the person who requested the report. If the REMARKS field is left blank, the program uses the
function number to identify the person requesting the report.
4.14.4. Abbreviated Format. The abbreviated format is only used on a CTHNSN inquiry. Enter
an A to select the abbreviated format, which can be displayed on screen, printed on a side by
printer, or create a print file at the RPS.
14                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

4.14.4.1. If the number of records selected does not exceed 25 pages of abbreviated data, the
program places all of the selected records in the buffer/paging file for review.
4.14.4.2. If the number of records exceeds 25 pages of abbreviated data, the program displays a
message stating that the maximum number of histories have been selected. If this occurs, user
should narrow their selection criteria.
4.14.4.3. If records are located that meet the user input criteria, the program retrieves the item
record data using the stock number and system designator.
4.14.4.4. The entire 704 CT-HISTORY record can be displayed using the abbreviated format.
User can tab to a particular transaction date/serial number and depress enter. A CTHSER inquiry
is then processed retrieving the requested 704 CT-HISTORY record. Transmitting a non-blank
character following the Next SBSS Scr#, returns user to the original abbreviated output screen.
If user tabs to Scrn #, and depresses enter, program returns user to original CTHNSN input
screen.
Section 4C--ES-S Query Capabilities.
4.15. Overview. ES-S provides the ability to query authoritative systems for near real-time
views of assets (including serial numbers when applicable), orders, shipments, and shipment
destination records. The query features of ES-S also include the ability to query Interchangeable
and Substitution Group (I&SG) data and records of auditable transactions submitted through ES-
S. An overview of these capabilities is provided below. See the ES-S CoP, for a complete
overview of ES-S.
4.16. Access. Unlimited ES-S query capabilities are available to users designated as US
Government or support contractors. Other users will be provided limited access. The ES-S CoP
provides more information on access restrictions within ES-S.
4.17. Architecture. ES-S uses a high speed query tool called LOUIS II to directly access the
SBSS database so queries to SBSS data are available even when the SBSS is not in-line (for
example, even if the database is in the twilight mode). ES-S also provides query capability into
the Stock Control System (SCS), Enterprise Business System (EBS), Global Transportation
Network (GTN) and the AF Data Services (AFDS). This access reduces the need for ES-S users
to sign on to each individual instance of the SBSS, SCS, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
EMALL, or GTN separately.
4.18. Types of Queries. Assets, serial numbers, orders, shipments, shipment destination
records, I&SG records, and audit trail records can all be queried through ES-S. The ES-S User’s
Manual provides examples of both the input and output for these query capabilities.
4.18.1. Asset Visibility. ES-S provides a near real-time unified view of asset data from the
SBSS, SCS, and DLA’s EBS. Data queries are collated into a single view that provides
unprecedented access to information needed to determine the exact location and the availability
of assets. The ES-S asset visibility capability also provides the engine for the asset sourcing
capability needed to manage and fulfill high priority orders. See the ES-S User’s Manual
Chapter 2 for more information on the asset visibility (Query Asset) capability.
4.18.2. Serial Number Data. ES-S provides the ability to directly query SBSS serial number
records that are maintained for items with Serialized Report Codes (SRC) assigned to them
(small arms, Communications Security (COMSEC), and Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel
(NWRM). The ES-S user can query one, some, or all SBSS accounts by stock number, stock
number and serial number, or detail document number. More information on this feature can be
found in the ES-S User’s Manual.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                          15

4.18.3. Order Visibility. ES-S provides a near real time query capability for customer orders
(due-outs) and requisitions (due-ins). The details and status of orders can be obtained directly
from the SBSS, SCS, or EBS (as applicable) and retail and wholesale data is displayed side by
side to provide a complete picture of the order. By combining information from base level
systems with wholesale systems, managers are able to link the requisition to the end use
customer requirement. See the ES-S User’s Manual for more information on the Query Order
capability.
4.18.4. Shipment Visibility. ES-S provides the ability to directly query the Global
Transportation Network (GTN) system for status of any shipment (serviceable or retrograde
supplies, equipment, munitions, engines, etc.) by Transportation Control Number (TCN). ES-S
is also programmed to launch automatic queries every 24 hours for all ES-S high priority orders
(MICAP, AWP, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)/Contingency Project Coded, and Forward Supply
Location (FSL) Project Coded) with status of BA, BH, or mode of shipment. When updated
shipment information is available from GTN, the information will be used to programmatically
update ES-S and SBSS order status records. The ES-S User’s Manual provides more
information on the Query Shipment (GTN) capability. Several other chapters in the ES-S User’s
Manual provide more information on the automatic GTN queries.
4.18.5. Shipment Destination Records. Shipment Destination (519) records in the SBSS can be
directly queried through ES-S. The Shipment Destination record query (INQ SHP) is available
in the ES-S transaction drop down screen or through the ES-S FRD screen. The entire shipment
destination record loaded at a particular Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) is displayed.
The ES-S User’s Manual contains more information on this capability.
4.18.6. I&SG Data. ES-S includes the capability to query and view interchangeable and
substitute (I&SG) data from the D043 catalog system (through the Air Force Data Services
(AFDS). ES-S periodically receives I&SG data from the AFDS (that originated from the D043
catalog system) and the user is able to query this data by Individual, Subgroup, or Master stock
number. The ES-S User’s Manual contains more information on the Query I&SG capability.
4.18.7. ES-S Audit Trail. All transactions processed through ES-S are recorded in the Audit
Trail Component (ATC). The ATC is used to record and therefore augments the SBSS and SCS
legacy system transaction histories. It is important to note that transactions are only initiated in
ES-S, that is, ES-S does not actually process any transactions so the transaction histories on the
legacy systems are needed to make up the entire audit trail of a transaction. ES-S records both
the input (request) and the response from the appropriate legacy system. ATC records are
periodically migrated to the Air Force Data Service (AFDS), however ATC queries will retrieve
records from the ES-S ATC database and AFDS simultaneously and merge the results for
presentation to the user. The ES-S User’s Manual provides more information on the Query
Audit Trail capability in ES-S.
4.19. Paging of SBSS INQ and CTH Inquiries. ES-S also supports the automatic paging of
the output response for both SBSS INQ and CTH inquiries. The SBSS response can then be
printed in whole or in part using standard browser print functions. See the ES-S user’s manual
for more information on transaction processing and printing responses from within ES-S.
4.20. Inquiry Input Formats.
4.20.1. Purpose. To provide file information on records loaded to the SBSS computer system.
4.20.2. Input Restrictions. RPS/Pseudo or any SBSS user authorized for inquiry input.
4.20.3. Output. See Para. 4.21., Para. 4.22., and Para. 4.23.

Notes:
1. The user will always use TRIC INQ (positions 1-3) when processing an inquiry. If an
automatic inquiry is made by another application program interfacing with program D270,
Inquiry Analysis, and a program other than D211A/B, End-of-Transaction Online/Batch, is
called when the inquiry is processed, the programmer will use TRIC Allowance Item Quantity
(AIQ).
2. The type inquiry field is a multi-purpose field used as follows:
a. For item record inquiries, enter SN.
b. For detail record inquiries via the document number, enter DN.
c. For part number inquiries, enter PN.
3. This field is used to determine the specific record(s) to be queried:
a. Item record inquiries: Enter the stock number. If the Federal Stock Class (FSC) (positions 6-

Notes:
1. The group safety levels field contains four whole numbers followed by three decimal
numbers.
2. If an economic retention quantity is authorized for retention (according to the guidelines in
AFI 23-101, Sec. 2B, Stockage Policy), the excess quantity may be determined by manually
subtracting the group economic retention quantity from the serviceable excess quantity.
3. This 8-position field contains a decimal point between the fourth and fifth positions and is
zero suppressed to the decimal.
4. This 12-position field contains a decimal point between the fourth and fifth positions and is
zero suppressed to the decimal.
5. This 11-position field contains a decimal point between the third and fourth positions and is
zero suppressed to the decimal.
6. This field reflects the SCHEME authorized quantity when the base SRAN is 3101.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                          27

7. This field reflects the SCHEME on-hand balance when the base SRAN is 3101. This field
reflects the total of all supply point and mission support kit detail record balances. This field
reflects the SCHEME authorized quantity when the base SRAN is non-3101.
8. This field reflects information from the routing identifier record (007). The information is
used in the formulas for computing demand levels.
9. This field reflects the demand level which is used to update the item record (101) during the
next releveling/file status cycle.

4.23.5. Requirements Computation Inquiry - Glossary of Terms.

Table 4.17. Requirements Computation Inquiry - Glossary of Terms.

 Terms           Definitions
 SV BAL          Serviceable balance on the item record.
 US BAL          Combined total of all unserviceable detail record balances.
 DI BAL          Combined total of all due-in detail record balances. Due-ins which have
                 cancellation requests submitted are excluded from this total.
 DIFM            Combined total of all DIFM detail record balances.
 SUP PT          Combined total of all supply point and mission support kit detail record
                 balances. This field reflects the SCHEME authorized quantity when base
                 SRAN is non-3101.
 FIRM DUO        Combined total of all due-out detail record balances.
 RQ OBJ          Computed requisitioning objective.
 RQN QTY         Quantity to be requisitioned during the next releveling session.
 TOT RQMT        Sum of FIRM DUO and RQ OBJ (due-outs and stock level).
 GP ERQ          Group Economic Retention Level Quantity. For EOQ items this is the
                 DDR multiplied by 730 days.
 SAFETY LV       Computed safety level quantity.
 ROP             Reorder point.
 DDR             Daily Demand Rate.
 SHP STA         Combined due-in total which has shipment status detail records loaded.
 DOH             Days on Hand. This is the number of days of supply support on the
                 current serviceable balance and the daily demand rate. This total is
                 determined by dividing the SV BAL by the DDR.
 DSHT            Days Short. The opposite of Days on Hand. Total is determined by
                 subtracting the SV BAL from the RQ OBJ and then dividing the result by
                 the DDR.
 DDI             Days Due-in.
 SPC GP          Stockage Priority Subgroup Code.
 EOQ             Computer Economic Order Quantity. This is taken directly from the
                 routing identifier record EOQ field.
 VOD             Variance of Demands.
 O&ST            Order & Ship Time. This is taken directly from the routing identifier
                 record for the source of supply RID loaded to the item record.
 VO&ST           Variance of order & ship time. This is taken directly from the RID for the
28                                   AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014


               source of supply loaded to the item record.
 DMD LV        Demand Level. Based on the requirements data computed for this
               inquiry. This represents what the new demand level would be if
               releveling were actually completed on the item at this time.
 CST STK       Cost to Stock and Cost Not to Stock. Only used when the current demand
               level is zero. The economic stock level range model (PGM NGV710A)
               computes what it would cost to begin stocking this item versus not
               stocking it (setting a demand level). If the result of the computation is
               that the CST STK is greater than the CSTNSTK, then the demand level is
               left at zero. If the CSTNSTK is greater, a demand level is computed.
 COMP XCS      Computed Excess Quantity. This is the assets balance which exceeds the
               authorized base retention level for the item. Only the excess quantity
               above the retention level is reported. The retention level is determined by
               adding the RQ OBJ and the GP ERQ.
 RPT XCS       Reported Excess. This is the quantity which has an excess report detail
               record loaded.
 DXOH          Days Excess On-Hand.
 XCS DI        Excess Due-in.
 DI XCS        Due-in Excess.
 DI CAN        Due-in Cancellation. The total quantity due-in for which a request for
               cancellation (AC1) was submitted. The status detail contains status code
               ZC or ZD.

5.3. Scheduling of Reports and Listings.

5.3.1. Purpose of SBSS Scheduling. The use of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) is
regulated through production control methods. These methods are implemented to ensure that
computer processing time precisely meets the operational needs for supply support of the
mission. Supervisors must closely monitor the training and work of personnel as well as the
operation of the automated data system.
5.3.2. Production Methods. Computer Operations is responsible for scheduling reports and
listings as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2. At a minimum, one of the following
production methods will be used in developing the computer production schedule:
5.3.2.1. All computer requirements must be supported by one of the following:
5.3.2.1.1. A specific requirement in AFMAN 23-122.
5.3.2.1.2. An approved supplement.
5.3.2.1.3. An AF Form 2011, Base Supply ADPE Work Request or electronic substitute.
5.3.2.2. The computer production schedule may be annotated to show the following:
5.3.2.2.1. One-time additions for priority requirements.
5.3.2.2.2. One-time changes of a minor nature.
5.3.2.2.3. Changes which delete or decrease products.

supported by an approved AF Form 2011.
5.3.3.2.3.1. Permanent changes. Any permanent changes, such as an increase in production
frequency or the number of copies, will be submitted on an AF Form 2011.
5.3.3.2.3.2. Recurring changes. If the requested requirement is anticipated to recur, establish
one of the following at LRS/Materiel Management Activity: a central file of recurring AF
Forms 2011, an OPR-maintained file of recurring AF Forms 2011, or local supplements. The AF
Form 2011 may be submitted and identified as recurring. Units will use an electronic AF Form
2011 located at the prescribed AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations website. Distribution for
recurring AF Forms 2011 is as follows:
5.3.3.2.3.2.1. Copies 1 and 2 will be sent to Computer Operations for scheduling. Computer
Operations will maintain a copy in the program jacket file, schedule the requirement, and send a
copy to the requesting activity to advise them of the scheduled processing date.
5.3.3.2.3.2.2. If the option to publish a supplement is taken, a copy will be retained by the
Operations Compliance pending publication of a supplement. When selecting the option to
maintain a central file or OPR-maintained file of recurring AF Forms 2011, copy 3 will be
forwarded to the office which will maintain the file.
5.3.3.2.3.3. Nonrecurring changes. Submit at least two copies of AF Form 2011 for
nonrecurring requirements.
5.3.3.2.3.3.1. Copies will be sent to Computer Operations for scheduling.

(@START) of the ECL runstreams created by NGV801A. NGV801A and NGV801B are used
to handle all inputs through the RPS/main site batch reader during inline and end-of-day
processing.
5.28.2.3. Validates the source of the start command (@START) to ensure that batch jobs are
started only by an authorized user-ID (as loaded by NGV068A). All users requiring the ability
to start batch jobs must have their user-ID loaded in the BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) record.
The BASE-CONSTANTS-2 record must contain the following: System Designator = 01,
Function Number = (user specified), PID Number = 99980, Site ID = (user's user-ID). See AFH
23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 6.
5.28.2.4. Edits the validity of the report select records to ensure that the correct program is being
run. If there is an error, the record is rejected with an R705 MGT notice followed by a 501 REJ.
5.28.2.5. Controls the sequence of report processing to ensure that all required reports are run
before end-of-night (EON). If reports are out of sequence or if mandatory reports have not been
processed, an R705 MGT notice followed by a 502 REJ is output to the RPS console.
5.28.2.6. Passes DIC/TRICs processed inline to NGV221B, Pseudo Reader, which passes the
transactions to NGV209A, Inline Driver. Program NGV209A calls the appropriate application
program.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                         67

5.28.2.7. Assigns a restart number for each runstream that is input. The restart number displays
on the RPS/main site console in an R714 MGT notice (see the R714 format in Ch 7). The
RPS/main site console operator retains this output to use if a restart of the run is necessary.
5.28.3. Restart Procedures. To restart a run that has aborted, do the following:
5.28.3.1. Create a runstream (see Para. 5.30. for sample runstream) with the input RESTART
XXX inserted after the command @XQT NGV801A and before the command @FIN. In the
input RESTART XXX, XXX is the restart number assigned to the original runstream.
5.28.3.2. Continue reports processing when the run restarts until all report selects within the run
are successfully completed.
5.28.4. Cancel Option.
5.28.4.1. Use the cancel option 1) when the 1100/60 operating system or the SBSS ADS is
downed and a job was active or 2) when a job abnormally terminates (other than a 799 REJ). A
job may terminate abnormally because of an SBSS ADS program problem or RPS operator's
manual intervention. The RPS operator may wish to restart a terminated job or to proceed to
another job in the same database gang.
5.28.4.2. To use the cancel option, create a runstream with CANCEL (positions 1-6) inserted
after the command @XQT NGV801A and before the command @FIN. See Para. 5.30. for a
sample runstream.
5.28.4.3. The runstream with the cancel command resets the master BPS file database gang
activity flag for the database gang for which the cancel was run.
5.28.4.4. Processing CANCEL outputs an S702 management notice (CANCEL HAS
SUCCESSFULLY PROCESSED) to the RPS console.

Note: The RPS operator must be sure that cancel is not processed for the gang number where an
active job is running. Program NGV801A generates an R701 REJ if cancel is processed against
the gang number where a job is running.

5.28.5. Suspend Option.
5.28.5.1. Use the suspend option to interrupt or stop a multiple job batch runstream. Normally,
the DPC initiates the request for interruption. The request would include, but not be limited to,
hardware failure, environmental (weather, air conditioning, etc.) and system software failure.
5.28.5.2. To use the suspend option, create a runstream with SUSPEND (positions 1-7) and the
BPS restart number (positions 8-10) inserted after the command @XQT NGV801A and before
the command @FIN.
5.28.5.3. When the suspend option is invoked, all active jobs run to completion, but no other
batch runs are activated.
5.28.5.4. To reactivate the multiple batch job, follow the restart procedures.
5.28.6. Errors. RPS operators receive an R706 MGT or R707 REJ when there is a program
select record error. They may correct the program select record or abort the job.
5.28.6.1. If research is necessary before corrective action(s) can be taken, the RPS operator
types ABORT on PAGE 1 (TIP) of the RPS/main site console. See reject/management notices
R700 through R731in, Ch 7 for possible error conditions.
5.28.6.2. If the program select does not pass the required edits, NGV801A produces the
following reject/management notices as applicable (see Ch 7 for an explanation of the notices):
5.28.6.2.1. REJ FOLLOWING PROGRAMS HAVE NOT BEEN PROCESSED - LGSPC

5.28.6.3. Programs NGV819/Q04, NGV871/Q05, and NGV815/S01 are run if the quarterly,
semiannual, or annual update options are processed. The following processing sequence must be
followed and the programs listed must be processed on the same day: Quarterly D28 -
NGV292B - NGV819/Q04 - NGV815/S01.
5.28.6.3.1. Programs NGV819/Q04 and NGV871/Q05 each have four time frames in the year;
program NGV815/S01 has two time frames in the year. Each time frame is controlled by a date
in the reports sequence control record which is compared to the current Julian date. The
following chart shows the only valid dates that may be in the reports sequence control record
(520-Q04-QTLY-OPTION-DATE, 520-Q05-QTLY-OPTION-DATE, and 520-S01-SEMI-
ANNUAL-DATE fields) and the allowable run dates.
5.28.6.3.2. Run dates for programs NGV819/Q04 and NGV871/Q05:

5.28.7. BPS and ECL Files. BPS files use four files to schedule and control Supply batch
processing. Following are the files and their definitions:
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                      69

5.28.7.1. Master BPS, 0GV00000*GV801CUD001. The master BPS file is an indexed
sequential file and cannot be read or altered by the Text Editor (ED) or Conversational Time
Sharing (CTS) processors. The file is created and maintained by NGV801C. The elements in
this file are created, maintained, and released by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity. It is accessed and updated by the NGV801/NGV898 series programs. See Para.
5.31.and Para. 5.32. for format of records contained in this file.
5.28.7.2. Local BPS, gGV0yyyynn*GV801AUD001. (where g = primary gang number, yyyy =
ALN and nn = restart number). The local BPS file is an indexed sequential file and cannot be
read or altered by the ED or CTS processors. The file is created by NGV801A and is accessed
and updated by the NGV801/NGV898 series programs. See Para. 5.33. and Para. 5.34. for
format of records contained in this file.
5.28.7.3. Master ECL, GV$$0000*GVECLUD001. The master ECL file contains skeletal ECL
elements for all SBSS batch programs. The elements in this file are created, maintained, and
released by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. Never make alterations to
elements in this file without the approval and guidance of AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity. These elements are used by NGV801A to create the gang dependent local
run time ECL.
5.28.7.4. Local ECL, gGV0yyyynn*GVECLUD001. (where g = primary gang number, yyyy =
ALN and nn = restart number). The local ECL file contains gang dependent run time ECL
elements created by NGV801A.
5.28.8. Input. See this chapter and Ch 6; and DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for program select record
formats. Program select records begin with positions 1-3 equal to RPT (reports mode), 1XT
(twilight mode), 1RC (twilight or reports mode), or UTL (utility, twilight, or reports mode).
5.28.9. Program Logic, NGV801C, Production File Update. Program NGV801C builds and
maintains the master BPS file (0GV00000*GV801CUD001.). It is used to query the status of
jobs executed under the control of NGV801A and NGV801B. NGV801C is always run in
DEMAND mode from an RPS terminal.
5.28.9.1. To start program NGV801C, key in the following statement:
         @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV801C

5.28.9.2. When NGV801C has started, it will ask which BPS file is to be accessed. The RPS
operator should key in the name of the BPS file in the following form:
        gBPSrrr*GV801AUD001.
Note: g = primary database gang number and rrr = the restart number assigned by NGV801A.
Press XMIT to access the master BPS file.

5.28.9.3. When NGV801C asks if the file to be accessed is new or old, enter OLD; then, enter
the program function code. The program function codes and their purposes are listed below:

Note: The program functions identified for AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
use can only be performed under the direction of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity and are not procedurally defined in this paragraph. RPS operations personnel are
allowed to change the 'Maximum Runs' field of the master BPS zero record. Password to
access/change this field is LGSPC.

5.28.9.4. To list records from the BPS file, key in INQ. NGV801C will then ask for the
runstream identifier (ID) of the runstream whose record the list is to begin. To start at the
beginning of the BPS file, depress XMIT.
5.28.9.4.1. The runstream IDs for the master BPS file are in the following form:
        GVnnnR (nnn = program ID number)
5.28.9.4.2. The runstream IDs for a local BPS file are in the following form:
        GVnnn (nnn = the number of the run in the batch)
5.28.9.4.3. NGV801C lists 20 records from the file starting with the record selected or the
beginning of the BPS file. To continue the inquiry process with the next record, key in NEXT.

5.29. Batch Processing Common Subroutines

5.29.1. Purpose. To describe the purpose and functions of the common batch processing
subroutines.
5.29.2. Program Logic, NGV898A, Update Handler. The first and last program of each batch
runstream is the NGV898A, Update Handler. NGV898A does the following:
5.29.2.1. Updates the run time by program select, rounded up to the nearest minute, in the
reports processing data record (record code 628).
5.29.2.2. Updates the reports sequence control record (record code 520).
5.29.2.3. Prints the start and stop time (recorded in the local BPS file) and termination notice.
5.29.3. Program Logic, NGV898B, Message Handler. Batch application programs call
NGV898B to send management/reject notices and other messages to the RPS console. A batch
program describes the message to be transmitted.
5.29.3.1. Management/Reject Notices. If a batch application program calls NGV898B with a
standard reject code, NGV898B will search the reject notices record (record code 006) for the
clear text phrase. NGV898B then transmits the message (output) to the RPS console. Following
is an example of a typical message:
RUNID: GV001 J-DAY: 3/086 TIME: 09:15:27 PROG: NGV999/851201
REJECT: 000 HEADER CARD GANG = 2 PROG. NO. = NGV999 QUAL = 2BPS051
ALTFILE = GV999UD001 BATCH 01 END CARD COUNT = 000123
    AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                          71

    5.29.3.1.1. The first line is generated by NGV898B. It provides the RUNID, Julian date, time,
    program number/program absolute version date and for standard management/reject phrases, the
    reject number of the message that follows.
    5.29.3.1.2. The second line is the standard phrase contained in the reject notices record or, as in
    the example above, the first of up to four clear text messages supplied by the applicable batch
    program.
    5.29.3.1.3. Subsequent lines contain the remainder of the text messages. In the example above,
    the batch program is providing the name of a data file which it has created.
    5.29.3.2. Other Messages. Other messages output by NGV898B require RPS/main site console
    operator response before the batch application program can continue its process. If a batch
    program requires a console operator response, the message displayed is followed by a
    RESPONSE REQUIRED line, and the console operator is prompted for a response, as shown by
    the following example:

    Figure 5.1. Response Required Line.
     RUNID: GV001 J-DAY:3/086 TIME:08:56:08 PROG:NGV999/851231

    5.29.3.2.1. In this example, the batch program detected an error in its report select image; that is,
    a required parameter is missing. The program select is printed under the 503 reject phrase and is
    followed by a line indicating the positions(s) in error. In this example, the individual keyed-in or
    entered the P option in position 17 rather than position 16.
    5.29.3.2.2. Next, the RESPONSE REQUIRED line is displayed. The following two lines are
    displayed on the RPS console but are not printed on the RPS console teleprinter. The cursor is
    placed on the first character of the PROMPT line. In this example, the cursor is placed over the
    R of the program select to be corrected.
    5.29.3.3. RPS Operator Response. At this point, the RPS console operator may do either of the
    following:
    5.29.3.3.1. Abort the run by hitting the ERASE TO EOL key on the UTS-40 keyboard and then
    keying-in ABORT and hitting the XMIT key; or,
    5.29.3.3.2. Respond with the information requested--in this example, the corrected program
    select--by using the arrow keys to position the cursor at the correct position in the PROMPT line,
    keying-in the correct option--P in position 16, blank in position 17 of the example--and hitting
    the XMIT key. After the RPS console operator keys-in the response just below the RPS nn line
    and hits the XMIT key, NGV898D takes over.
    Note: The console operator's response must be keyed-in on the line just below the RPS nn
    (where nn is the identifier) line or the response will not be returned to the applicable batch
72                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

program. If no response is returned within 5 minutes, NGV898B will terminate wait time for the
response and abort the job. If this occurs, the RPS console operator will be notified by
NGV898B.

5.29.4. Program Logic, NGV898C, Report End-of-Night (RPTEON). NGV898C reads and
edits the reports sequence control record (record code 520) to ensure that all mandatory daily,
required monthly, and quarterly reports have been processed. This program reads the special
control record (record code 002) and updates the input count record. It also sets 002-FLG-I on
the special control record to allow beginning-of-day processing to begin. NGV898C performs
the following functions:
5.29.4.1. End-of-Night (RPTEON) Program Select. Ensures that all mandatory daily, required
monthly, and quarterly reports have been successfully processed. The last function of NGV898C
is to clear the reports sequence control record. RPTEON cannot be processed in the twilight
mode. Following is the end-of-night input format:

Table 5.8. Report Select Format.

Notes:
1. This is the last image input before starting beginning-of-day processing for the next
processing day inline.
2. Single space between each word in the title.

5.29.4.2. Report Run (RPTRUN) Program Select. When this program select is used, it allows
reports to be processed in any run sequence desired. However, use extreme caution to ensure
that reports which build data for subsequent reports are maintained in mandatory reports
sequence. Processing of this program select eliminates SBSS ADS internal sequence control and
permits a program to be processed which may alter or blank data required for subsequent
programs.
Note: Processing of this program select will have no impact on the transaction history records.
See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, for procedures governing concurrent processing (primary and
secondary database). Following is the report run input format:

Table 5.9. Report Select Format.

80       1AN      Database IRU Dump Option                             * (Asterisk) or Blank/Note

Note: The * (asterisk) in position 80 bypasses downloading the SBSS database to tape via
Integrated Recovery Utility (IRU) backup when concurrent processing is initiated and bypasses
the tape backup of the primary CTH areas. A B in position 79 bypasses the tape backup of the
primary CTH areas. When position 80 is blank and position 79 contains a B, the SBSS database
is downloaded to tape. Do not use a B in position 79 and/or an * (asterisk) in position 80 without
first receiving approval from the host MAJCOM or ILS-S Help Desk. Be extremely cautious
about putting an * (asterisk) in position 80 because the recovery point will be the previous IRU
backup. NGV898C generates an S743 management notice (RPS OPERATOR ELECTED TO
OMIT THE STANDARD DATA BASE DUMP) and an S747 management notice (RPS
OPERATOR ELECTED TO OMIT PRIMARY CTH AREA TAPE DUMP) when an * (asterisk)
is used in position 80. NGV898C generates an S747 management notice when position 79
contains a B.

5.29.5. Program Logic, NGV898D, RPS Message Receiver. NGV898D acts as the RPS
message receiver (TIP) which passes a console operator response back to NGV898B.
5.29.5.1. NGV898D performs the following functions:
5.29.5.1.1. Reads responses from the console . This program reads the response and echoes it
on the RPS console to indicate message transmission. The response displays on the RPS console
where it is printed:

Figure 5.2. Response Display.

 RPS INPUT IMAGE ECHO FOR IDENTIFIER 01
 RPT999 OPTIONS P




5.29.5.1.2. Places responses in TIP file 46 for NGV898B to read. NGV898B in turn passes it to
the applicable batch program. The batch program processes the response, and if it is still
incorrect, once again calls NGV898B to display the incorrect program select and request a
response.
5.29.5.2. If there are other batch programs running at the same time as the batch program
requesting the response, it is possible that one of the other batch programs may display messages
after the response request. These other messages may cause the RPS nn line and the PROMPT
line to scroll off the top of the RPS console.
5.29.5.2.1. To recover all lost response PROMPTS, the RPS operator should key in RPS INQ.
The RPS nn TRIC and the response line for all outstanding response requests will redisplay and
the operator can respond.
5.29.5.2.2. To recover a single response PROMPT, the RPS operator should key in RPS INQ nn
where nn is the identifier of the lost response PROMPT. The corresponding lines will redisplay
for response.
    74                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

    5.29.5.2.3. If there is no outstanding response request for identifier nn, the program will display
    a message stating the same.
    5.29.5.3. Any batch programs which require an RPS console operator input but which do not
    adequately describe the response desired, that is, a 503 reject notice without any indication of
    which positions are in error, should result in the RPS console operator reporting the problem to
    AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. The RPS operator should send AFMC SCM-
    R Information Technology Activity a copy of the RPS console printout for transmittal, showing
    the particulars of the problem.

5.37. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group-Maintenance (CSAG-M) Daily Report
(RPTD02/NGV794)

5.37.1. Purpose. To provide required CSAG-M information to for Depot Maintenance
Accounting & Production System organizations.
5.37.2. Program Logic.
5.37.2.1. This program will be processed daily against ALC bases to include Hill, Robins,
Tinker, and Kadena (SD A1). Program will scan 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY records and
select all records where the 518-FUND-CODE equals '6M', '6L', OR '6Z'. Selected records will
be grouped into 3 separate data files and be sent to DMAPS via Supply Interface System (SIFS).
The contents, file name, and purpose of data contained within the specified files are as follows:
5.37.2.1.1. File XGV0<ALN>*GV794UD801. (where 'X' = GANG NBR) contains ISU, DOC,
DOR, IRF, and TIN for CSAG-M orgs that have been cancelled or had reversal action taken.
5.37.2.1.2. File XGV0<ALN>*GV794UD802. (where 'X' = GANG NBR) contains ISU, DOR,
DUO, and TIN as a response to customer's orders for CSAG-M organizations.
5.37.2.1.3. File XGV0<ALN>*GV794UD803. (where 'X' = GANG NBR) contains FIC, FID,
FCU, LPS, LPA and FIL that will be used to update cataloging data for assets used by MS
organizations.
Note: Each file will be copied automatically to files XGV0<ALN>*D02801., 802, and 803
respectively for ADRSS registration. Once SIFS has successfully copied these files, the original
files will be deleted from the system. The CTH Scan option will recover the daily CSAG-M
information from the consolidated transaction history records. Additionally, each SBSS will
coordinate with the local MS to ensure the correct address is used to transmit files.

5.37.3. Special Instructions.
5.37.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Mandatory daily on the Secondary database.
5.37.3.2. Restart Procedures. If program does not complete successfully, do an @DELETE on
each file (i.e., @DELETE XGV0<ALN>*GV794UD801., 802, and 803). Then, start the
program again. If you do not accomplish this action, the program will have a fatal error. The
fatal error will inform you which file is cataloged. At that point, delete the file(s) and restart the
program.

5.38. Daily Document Register (D04/NGV804)

5.38.1. Purpose.
5.38.1.1. To produce DCC images for use in controlling auditable transactions through the
computer and to provide LRS/Materiel Management Activity and supported customers with a
comprehensive daily means to review normal customer transactions.
5.38.1.2. To provide customers with a product which reflects the LRS/Materiel Management
Activity action resulting from their inputs. The daily listing is designed for distribution down to
shop level. It provides a ready reference for reconciling questions regarding LRS/Materiel
Management Activity responses to customer requirements. Also, a funds summary provides
information to determine possible materiel management IT system abuses within the
organization.
5.38.1.3. To provide information required at all levels of management for personnel within the
LRS / Materiel Management Activity complex.
5.38.1.4. To provide a data file of print images for download to a personal computer.
5.38.1.5. To prepare a five-part listing as follows:
5.38.1.5.1. Part 1: Provides a management product to the customer with data required to
manage materiel management transactions and fund expenditures. Reflects all transactions
processed for assigned organizations and internal LRS/Materiel Management Activity functions.
Type account codes B, E, and P will be combined. Part 1 produces document control center
(DCC) data images based on the transaction history flag to assist in controlling accountable
transactions. When 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED is set to a 1, the production of DCC images is
eliminated. DCC images are replaced by document control records (DCR) generated during the
processing of the consolidated transaction history record merge (RPTD37).
5.38.1.5.2. Part 2: Provides a list of all activity code Y transactions which can be used by
various sections within the LRS/Materiel Management Activity and must be distributed by the
transaction identification code (TRIC).
5.38.1.5.3. Part 3: Provides a list of all type account code P transactions.
5.38.1.5.4. AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3: Provides a list of all A&F transactions with activity code
Z and organization code 099.

5.38.1.5.5. Part 5: Provides a listing of all NOR transactions. The output listing is in four
sections: 1) cause code, 2) delete code, 3) cannibalization, and 4) MRSP withdrawal headings.
5.38.2. Program logic.
5.38.2.1. Processes transaction histories and sorts selected records. A listing/data file is
produced as follows upon completion of scan:
5.38.2.1.1. Part 1 is sorted in system designator, Project Funds Management Record (PFMR),
and document number sequence with page eject on change of organization shop code,
organization code, and PFMR. When printing the transaction phrases for budget code 9 or alpha,
the 009-TRANSACTION-PHRASE-RECORD is used.
5.38.2.1.1.1. If budget code is 8, the following transaction phrases apply:

5.38.2.2.1. Accumulation of totals (Part 1). Totals are accumulated for all budget codes 8, 9,
and Z issues, due-outs, turn-ins, refuels, defuels, reverse-post, due-out release, and due-out
cancellations. The canceled dollar value of local purchase status transactions with a type
transaction phrase code of 2B will be reflected in the obligated due-out amount of the
organization cost center record fund status totals. The totals for budget code 8 will be calculated
based upon the 1PU transactions, except DUOs and DOCs. 1PUs which are created as a result of
a FUP will be totaled in the Issue/Refuel column. 1PUs which are created as a result of an LVL
will be totaled in the DUO Release column. Totals are accumulated by shop code, organization
code, PFMR, and Financial Inventory Accounting (FIA) codes 33X and 44X. Totals are printed
by shop code, organization code, and PFMR. The Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC)
code will be printed with the "Total Organization" totals. Current fund status, target, obligated
due-out, net issues, and available balance dollar values will be printed from the organization cost
center record and the project funds management record. These totals will be displayed for the
current, prior, second prior, third prior, and successor M fiscal years. A disclaimer statement
will be printed prior to PFMR totals to state only A&F transactions that correct PFMR balance
are not printed; that is, ADJ, PRJ, and 1PF. The average daily expenditure rate is computed and
printed at PFMR level. If the available balance is negative, the sum of the net issues and
obligated due-outs is printed instead of the computation. The days of dollar support remaining is
also computed and printed at PFMR level. When the available balance is negative or zero, the
computation is not done and asterisks (*) are printed.
Note: When the average daily expenditure is zero, the results of the days of dollar support
remaining are unpredictable.

5.38.2.2.2. Accumulation of totals (Part 1). Upon change in organization code, totals are
accumulated for the following transactions with a demand code of C, R, or T: issues, due-outs,
due-out not authorized stock, due-out release on time, due-out release delayed, and due-out

5.39. End-Of-Day IMR and GLAC Update (D07/NGV980).

5.39.1. Purpose. The End-of-Day Inventory Management Records (IMR) and General Ledger
Account Code (GLAC) Update selects and edits “TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901)” records to
update the following record: SF-INV-MGMT (312) records.
5.39.1.1. The program produces two output listings used by the “Business Funds Branch” to
ensure that the above financial records have been updated properly. A third output listing is
produced to show the “FOREIGN-CURRENCY (316)” records maintained in the database.
5.39.1.2. This program builds transaction images that are used by program NGV982/D12 to
produce output transactions.
5.39.1.3. This program builds an interface file of “General Funds”, “Materiel Support Business
Activity” and “General Support Business Activity” transactions to interface to “SMAS” for
general ledger update.
5.39.1.4. Updates the “A-F-SEQUENCE-CONTROL (309)” record for the “309-980-D07-
DATE” field. (see DFAS-DE 7077.10-M).

5.40.1. Purpose. To provide the SMAG manager with a report of the stock fund MACR,
showing the status of actual obligations versus the approved obligation authority. The report
lists monetary values accumulated during processing of daily transactions for each MACR (by
system designator within each budget code).

5.41.1. Purpose. To provide mandatory end-of-day program daily interface transactions which
serve as a basis for materiel cost accounting in the Work Information Management System
(WIMS) (formerly BEAMS) ADS (system code WI). During end-of-day, the D10 program
creates 80-column transaction images and daily control images. It then prints control listings.
5.41.2. Program Logic. The program then does the following:
5.41.2.1. Reads all TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901) records and selects issue, turn-in, and
due-out transactions containing a type organization code of B (from the second position of 901-
FILLER-2). If the Fuels Automated Management System (FAMS) is active for a particular
system designator, 001-LOG-EXPAND-2(SD) = Y, then fuels transactions will not be selected.
5.41.2.2. Sorts the information from the TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901) records. From
major to minor, the records are sorted by type-SD, actual-SD, CIC, control center, type
transaction, work order, and activity.
5.41.2.3. Creates the detail (CWM) and summary (CW*) transactions and prints a list of the
transactions created from each selected TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901) record. The CWM
transactions are listed for each system designator. The CW* transaction provides the sequence
number to show the number of times CWM transactions have been output during the current
year. It also provides the total dollar amount and the transaction count for each system
designator.
5.41.3. Special Instructions.
5.41.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.41.3.2. Satellite: Output is not produced at the satellite.
5.41.3.3. Audit Requirements: None.

0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV981UD801. The D10 also creates a backup file
0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV981UD870.
5.41.6.1. General Output Handling: WIMS uses FTP (file transfer protocol) to retrieve the
output data file. WIMS checks to see if the number of detail records passed to it matches the
count on the summary transaction. If it does not match, the CE people use the hard-copy listing
to manually identify missing or duplicate transactions.

5.41.6.2. Backup File Handling: The 870 backup file is not sent through FTP. The contents of
this file are identical to that of the 801 primary output file. The backup file is used to re-create
the primary output file when necessary. The backup file is a cycled (+1) file, so there should be
up to 32 resident cycles or approximately one month’s worth of backups.

Notes:
1. This indicates the number of times CWM transactions were output during the current year.
The sequence control number and SRAN are entered to enable a cross-reference to detail CWM
transactions. The CW* summary transaction provides the SRAN of only those system
designators with CWM transactions.
2. All SRANs are four characters long, starting in the left-most positions. There may be up to
nine SRANs in this field.
5.41.10. Distribution Instructions. The Civil Engineering Work Information Management
System (WIMS) retrieves the output data file for further processing. A copy of the print listings
is then sent to the organization concerned.

5.42. Daily PFMR/OCCR Update And Reconciliation (D11/NGV969).

5.42.1. Purpose. To produce a reconciliation list of PFMR and related OCCR records
comparing targets, net sales, and due-out dollar fields. Differences are computed and printed.
An audit list of transactions is printed when a difference is noted. The program also builds detail
billing images in the database record area (DBRA) which are used by program D12/NGV982.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                        97

5.42.2. Program Logic. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for initiation procedures, program logic,
input requirements, output, and use of system output.
5.42.3. Special Instructions.
5.42.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.42.3.2. Satellite: Output is produced at the applicable satellite.
5.42.4. Distribution Instructions.
5.42.4.1. Copies to A&F, Resource Manager/Funds Management, and Budget Office

5.43. A&F End-Of-Day, End-Of-Month Punch-out (D12/NGV982).

5.43.1. Purpose.
5.43.1.1. To provide interface products for the end-of-month non-PFMR billing process.
5.43.1.2. To update stock and general fund records maintained on the computer's general A&F
(BQ) system and produce daily products for reentry to the computer's Standard Base Supply
System (SBSS) database. At end-of-day, the program creates daily transaction images, daily
control images, and prints daily control lists showing detail transactions and related management
notices.
5.43.2. Program Logic. The program does the following:
5.43.2.1. Reads detail transactions passed from programs D07/NGV980 and D11/NGV969.
5.43.2.2. Sorts images into report sequence.
5.43.2.3. Prints control listings and creates sorted detail and control transactions by TRIC.
(Control transactions are produced for TRICs SZR, SZS, and DB1 through DB6.)
5.43.2.4. Updates the A-F-SEQUENCE-CONTROL (309) RECORD for the 309-982-D12-
DATE field.
5.43.3. Special Instructions.
5.43.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.43.3.2. Satellite: Output is not produced at the satellite.
5.43.4. Frequency. Program D12/NGV982 is a mandatory end-of-day program.
5.43.5. Input. The D12 reads detail transactions passed from programs D07/NGV980 and
D11/NGV969. The DB1 through DB6 transactions are stored in file gGV$*GV980UD001. and
the BK1, BK2, N, SZR, SZS, and WTC transactions are stored in file gGV$*GV969UD001.
(where g = gang number). The selection logic for building these transactions is documented in
DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.
5.43.6. Output. The D12 prints seven lists and produces six types of output transactions. The
Business Funds Branch reviews the lists and output transactions to ensure receipt of all output
transactions.
5.43.6.1. Output Transactions:
5.43.6.1.1. File GV982UD801 contains Receipt from Local Vendor (BK1/BK2) Transactions
(see Table 5.34.). The BK1 transaction is produced when base supply processes a local purchase
receipt (REC) or adjustment (LPA) transaction. The BK2 transaction is produced when a
reverse-post of a local purchase receipt (REC) is accomplished. See Table 5.35. and Table 5.36.
for format of header and trailer records for the output file.
5.43.6.1.2. Materiel Reimbursable Sales and Creditable Sales Return (SZS/SZR) Transactions.
These transactions (Table 5.37.) may be classified in two categories:
5.43.6.1.2.1. Issues and turn-ins of investment materiel to organizations with type organization
code S.
98                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

5.43.6.1.2.2. Reimbursable shipments to and receipts from non-PFMR customers for SMAG and
investment materiel.
5.43.6.1.2.3. Stock Fund Detail Billing (DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5/DB6) Transactions. These
transactions represent issues and turn-ins affecting PROJECT-FUNDS-MGMT (311) records
with detail output flag C or D and ORG records with a TYPE-ORG-CODE = ‘D’(DIFMS
System). See Table 5.39. for output format.
5.43.6.1.2.4. Daily Control Transactions (DB* and SZ*). These transactions contain the number
of detail DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5/DB6 and SZS/SZR transactions produced by the D12. See
Table 5.40. for output format.
5.43.6.1.3. File GV982UD812 contains Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Materiel Issue and Turn-
In (N) Transactions. These transactions (formerly referred to as BK7 and BK8 transactions)
represent shipments or returns of SMAG and investment materiel. The shipment or return results
from AFMC-directed transactions (redistribution orders) in support of FMS cases. See Table
5.41. for output format.
5.43.6.1.4. File GV982UD813 contains WRM Nonreimbursable Requisition (WTC)
Transactions. WTC transactions are produced when a MILSTRIP status transaction is processed
with a status code BN and project code 3AA from DLA. The status transaction notifies the
requisitioning base that a SMAG requisition for prepositioned WRM stock has been converted
by DLA to a free issue. A WTC transaction is output for each requisition changed from funded
to free issue. See Table 5.42. for output format.
5.43.6.2. Files *GV982UD801, *GV982UD812, and *GV982UD813 all have an ICL (interface
control ledger) text trailer record at the end (see Table 5.42). This is used by the ICL system to
send the file through ADRSS to its destination. It is not used as an actual transaction by the
receiving ADS.
5.43.6.3. The M33 uses the DB* (410) and SZ* (411) records created by the D12 as input for
the M33. These 410 and 411 records are deleted by the M33 during the EOM run.
5.43.6.4. JOCAS Files. They contain only those DB images needed by JOCAS. There will not
be a DB total line. A CSI (Cost System Indicator) in the DB image, with a value of A-Z or 1-9
(but not 0), will identify the transaction to be selected by JOCAS. There will be a separate
JOCAS file for each CSI. All DB images with the same CSI will append to the same JOCAS
file. The filename for these files is *GV982UD82x, where x is the CSI value from the DB
image. The JOCAS files are appended indefinitely by the D12, so the files will continue to grow
unless they are periodically deleted after use. The JOCAS files will not have ICL trailers, nor
will they have backup files.
5.43.6.5. Files *GV982UD801, *GV982UD812, and *GV982UD813 are all data files with
exactly one file cycle. The D12 creates backup files for them. These backup files are cycled
(+1), have identical ICL trailers as the primary files, and are also under the same qualifier
(0GV0XXXXSRAN). They will be used to re-create the primary files if there is a system
problem while ADRSS or ICL moves the primary files to the receiving ADS. They are named as
follows:

Table 5.32. D12 Backup Files.

Primary            Backup                 Transaction           Internal         Filenames

Note: When the program is run, the primary output files must have already been moved to the
receiving ADS and deleted. If any of the primary output files (except the *GV982UD82x file)
still exist on the system at run time, it will cause an error condition.

5.43.6.6. Printed Reports:
5.43.6.6.1. Daily Vendor Receipt/Return List. This product lists the BK1 and BK2 transactions

5.43.7.5. Stock Fund Reimbursable Transaction List. This list is used to ensure receipt of
applicable transactions. The Business Funds Branch personnel re-create missing or damaged
transactions from this product and also check to see if a BILLED-OFFICE (328) record is loaded
for each valid SZR/SZS transaction. They prepare a 1BQ transaction for any valid DODAAC
for which no BILLED-OFFICE (328) record exists.
5.43.7.6. Program NGV980/982 Reconciliation Control List of Daily Record Transactions. If
this list is printed, the Business Funds Branch must contact the computer operations personnel in
the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to determine if system processing problems occurred. If
the problems cannot be resolved locally, call the SBSS Control Center for assistance.
5.43.7.7. Daily DB(X) Punch-Out Control List. The Business Funds Branch uses this list to
verify receipt of DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5/DB6 transactions. Since this product does not list the
individual transactions, missing or damaged transactions must be re-created using the Daily
Document Register (D04/NGV804) and the FIA Code Listing (D32/NGV949).
5.43.8. Output File Usage.
5.43.8.1. Receipt from Local Vendor (BK1/BK2) Transactions:
5.43.8.1.1. Each BK1 transaction notifies the Business Funds Branch that:
5.43.8.1.1.1. A local purchase item (other than one previously paid for) was received from a
local vendor, that payment is required, and that a RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL
(213) record was created.
5.43.8.1.1.2. The program processed a local purchase adjustment (LPA) which changed the
RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record extended price.
5.43.8.1.1.3. The RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record extended price was
updated as a result of a foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation update (program NGV935).
5.43.8.1.2. Each BK2 transaction notifies the Business Funds Branch that the previously
processed local purchase receipt was reverse-posted.
5.43.8.1.3. Upon receipt of the transaction and control listing produced by program
D12/NGV982, the Business Funds Branch:
5.43.8.1.3.1. Compares transaction count to D12 totals to ensure receipt of all transactions.
(Compares transactions to purchase order or BPA call document for BPA calls and files in order
folder if invoice is not received.) Stamps or writes the Julian date in positions 62-64 of the BK1
transaction on the order or BPA call document. If complete, only mark once. For partial
deliveries, marks individual line items.
5.43.8.1.3.2. Obtains any missing purchase orders.
5.43.8.1.3.3. Matches BK2 transactions with BK1 transactions on file. Destroys the matching
transactions.
5.43.8.1.3.4. Files unmatched BK1 and BK2 transactions pending receipt of invoices from
vendors. Replaces existing BK1 transactions with the replacement BK1 transactions identified
with REPLACE in positions 74-80. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for BKA/BKB transactions and
the payment process.
5.43.8.1.4. TRIC BK1/BK2 transactions are output to a data file,
0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD801. The R009 management notice is output at the RPS of the
SBSS (see Ch 7). The RPS personnel will perform one of the following depending on the status
of the Materiel Accounts Payable System (MAPS) at their base:
5.43.8.2. FMS Materiel Issue and Turn-In (N) Transactions. These transactions are output to a
data file, 0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD812. The Business Funds Branch sends these
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        101

transactions to the Accounts Control SMA (ACA) for entering the other required information
needed to report foreign military sales.
5.43.8.3. Nonreimbursable Requisition (WTC) Transactions. These transactions are output to
data file 0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD813. The Business Funds Branch maintains these
transactions in document number sequence. At the end of each month, the Business Funds
Branch prepares a GLA transaction for input to the Standard Materiel Accounting System (BJ).
The GLA transaction records transportation liability against the SMAG for unbilled items (debit
GLSA 54001, credit GLSA 20001). The Business Funds Branch also reverses the previous
month's entry.
5.43.8.3.1. DLA bills the SMAG for transportation of these items at a charge of 3 percent of the
extended price of each requisition. Upon receipt of the SF 1080 (Voucher for Transfer Between
Appropriations and or Funds) bill from DLA, pull the applicable WTC transaction from the file
and destroy. If a requisition number appears on a bill and there is no transaction on file, process
a document number inquiry to determine if there is a detail record for this requisition.
5.43.8.3.1.1. If a funded due-in exists, request that base supply process a status transaction
(coded BN and project code 3AA) to change the due-in to unfunded and produce a WTC record.
5.43.8.3.1.2. If a RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record exists, process a 1DR
input with TEX code D to delete the RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record.
Payment of the transportation charge without a WTC record in this situation is proper.
5.43.8.3.2. The payment for this transportation charge can be processed in the SBSS by input of
a 1BF transaction. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for preparation of the 1BF transaction.)
5.43.8.4. Materiel Reimbursable Sales and Creditable Sales Return (SZS/SZR) Transactions.
These transactions will be output to data file 0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD811. Transactions
in the data file will be used for several purposes.
5.43.8.4.1. The Business Funds Branch verifies that these transactions are in fact reimbursable
charges. Use the D07/NGV980 decision logic tables and the FIA Code Listing (D32) to identify
the original input transaction. Coordinate with the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to
determine the transaction's validity and specific billing information.
5.43.8.4.2. These transactions are held until EOM and are reinput into the SBSS. Reinput of
these transactions to program M33/NGV973 results in production of mechanized SF 1080
billings, detail billing lists, and SMAG accounts receivable and general ledger transactions. (See
DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for detailed processing instructions.)
5.43.8.4.3. After receipt and verification of the transactions, the Business Funds Branch checks
the Billed Office Record List (M33) to ensure that a BILLED-OFFICE (328) record exists for
the bill to DODAAC. If necessary, process a 1BQ transaction prior to end of month. (See
DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.)
5.43.8.5. Stock Fund Detail Billing (DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5/DB6) Transactions. These
transactions serve several purposes:
5.43.8.5.1. They are used to create a detail billing list to support SF 1080 billings for non-Air
Force-funded customers requiring detailed billing information. The DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5
and DB6 transactions are held until EOM and are reinput to SBSS program M33/NGV973. (See
DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for detailed processing instructions.)
5.43.8.5.2. They may also be used to identify materiel costs (at cost center and job order level)
in the Job Order Cost Accounting System (JOCAS).
5.43.8.5.3. Daily Control Transactions (DB* and SZ*). These transactions are held until EOM
and are reinput to the SBSS with the DB1/DB2/DB3/DB4/DB5/DB6 and SZS/SZR transactions.

Program M33/NGV973 compares the transaction count in the control transactions to the actual
number of detail transactions by Julian date and prints any differences. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-
M for detailed processing instructions.)
5.43.8.6. Disposition instructions for the above output products are stated in DFAS-DE 7077.10-
M.
5.43.9. Distribution Instructions. The DFAS field site Business Funds Branch receives two
copies of all program D12/NGV982 output listings and all output transactions. The DFAS field
site Business Funds Branch retains all listings and transactions except as follows:
5.43.9.1. IAPS (Integrated Accounts Payable System) will receive BK1/BK2 transactions via
ADRSS.
5.43.9.2. One copy of the FMS Materiel Transaction List and supporting N transactions is
forwarded to the accounts control SMA at the DFAS field site via ADRSS.

5.46.1. Purpose. To provide daily, line item reconciliation of equipment records to the Air
Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS).
5.46.2. Program Logic.
5.46.2.1. Scans the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY area for transactions where the transaction
identification code (TRIC) equals XJE and the edit code equals ‘OR’ (located in the 901-ISSUE-
PRIORITY). If the criteria are met, the program selects the organization account code (located
in the 901-RID) and the reporting SRAN (located in the 901-SUP-ADDRESS) from the XJE
transaction and completes the following action:
5.46.2.1.1. Scans the organization cost center records for the organization account code loaded
on the XJE and formats organization record reports (XGL). Provides capability to reconcile the
organization identification code, parent major command code, and reporting SRAN.
5.46.2.1.2. The program identifies organization cost center records with a 518-FREEZE-
DELETE-FLAG equal to P or D and creates a Data Request Record (XJE) with an edit code of
NL.
5.46.2.1.3. Scans the item record area and selects all item records with type stock record account
code E. The program reads the authorized/in-use and item detail areas (101-ITEM-RECORD)
and formats an in-use detail overlay record (XGJ) for all authorized/in-use details where the 201-
DOCUMENT-NBR begins with “E” and all registered equipment management vehicles only
detail records (214 Records). The program accumulates balances as the records are being read.
At the end of the records, it creates an item balance overlay record (XGG).
5.46.2.1.4. The item balance overlay record (XGG), positions 21-24, will contain the authorized
quantity from the adjusted level detail record when the type level flag equals D; otherwise, it will
be zero.
5.46.2.2. Provides repair and return asset records (XSB) for all authorized/in-use equipment
shipped to a contractor or repair facility using repair and return (RAR) procedures.
5.46.2.3. Provides a complete file of firm due-outs and status using the XSD (due-in, due-out
notification for budget codes 9 and Z) and XSK (supply/ship status information record) format
for stock numbers with EMC 1, 2, or 3.
5.46.2.4. Provides a complete file of centrally-procured warehouse balances by condition code
for stock numbers with EMC 4 or 5.
5.46.2.5. Provides a complete file of memo due-outs using XSA (due-out notification for budget
code 9 and Z) format for stock numbers with equipment management code (EMC) 1, 2, or 3.
5.46.2.6. Scans the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY area for transactions when the transaction
identification code (TRIC) equals FCD, Budget Code equals 9 or Z, ERRCD ND or NF, and
equipment management code (EMC) 1, 2, or 3. If the criteria are met, then the program creates
an item balance overlay record (XGG).
5.46.2.7. Scans the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY area for transactions when the transaction
identification code (TRIC) equals LCC or LPA, Budget Code equals 9 or Z, ERRCD ND or NF,
and EMC 1, 2, or 3. If the criteria are met, then the program creates a Due-In and Due-Out
Notification (XSD).
5.46.2.8. Scans the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY area for transactions when the transaction
identification code (TRIC) equals LPS, Budget Code equals 9 or Z, ERRCD ND or NF, and
EMC 1, 2, or 3. If the criteria are met, then the program creates Supply/Ship Status Information
(XSK).

processing (NGVU02/NGVU03). These 301 rejects do not contain user’s initials because
security common bank is being initialized during the security process. Enterprise Solution –
Supply (ES-S) sessions also will produce 301 rejects due to their persistent connection. These
ES-S 301 rejects can be identified by looking up the function number within the Base Constants
Processor (NGV068A) to determine if they came from ES-S. If they came from ES-S, these 301
rejects can be disregarded because TRIC security is controlled within the ES-S application and
not in SBSS.

5.48. Vehicle Integrated Management System (VIMS) (D22/NGV985).
5.48.1. Purpose. To provide interface products for a non-SBSS cost accounting system On-Line
Vehicle Integrated Management System (OLVIMS). The D22 run creates detail transactions
(VIM) and prints detail control lists.
5.48.2. Program Logic. The program does the following:
5.48.2.1. Selects TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901) records containing data for either ground
fuels or other than ground fuels issues. For ground fuels, the record will contain a shop code of
VV. For materiel transactions other than ground fuels, the record will contain a type
organization code (second position of 901-FILLER-2) of V, or T. If the type organization code
is T, the work order number (first 5 positions of the 901-SUPP-ADDRESS) must be L9999 or
the record is invalid. The 901 records include: nonfuel issues to Vehicle Management activities,
ground fuel issues to base-assigned or transient AF vehicles, credit card/AF Form 15, United
States Air Force Invoice, purchases of ground fuel for Air Force vehicles. The ground fuel can
come from non-Air Force DoD and commercial sources. Credit card/AF Form 15 purchases of
ground fuel can be identified on the transaction list by dispensing unit (issuing station code) of
0Z.
5.48.2.2. Excludes certain TRANSACTION-HISTORY (901) records. Turn-in transactions are
not selected because the OLVIMS allows for cost of reparable items at 50 percent of unit cost at
the time of issue. If the FAMS is active for a particular system designator, 001-LOG-EXPAND-
2(SD) = Y, fuels transactions will not be selected.
5.48.2.3. Outputs data files containing VIMS fuels and nonfuels costs (VIM).
5.48.2.4. Sorts the information from the transaction-history (901) records. From major to minor,
the records are sorted by system designator, organization, report type, and document number.
5.48.2.5. Prints the daily VIMS Materiel Transaction List. Transactions are listed by
organization within system designator. Transactions and dollar totals are provided for each
organization. Separate lists are provided for fuels and nonfuels transactions.

5.49.1.2. Only one XGG record will be created for each national stock number. This data are
required to provide AFMC item managers with worldwide visibility of tracked equipment assets
and assist in the computation of equipment requirements.
5.49.1.2.1. To create SBSS organization/shop change (XS2) when it detects a 7Z TTPC with
901 document identifier code of XTV.
5.49.2. Program Logic.
5.49.2.1. Scans the transaction history area and selects equipment transactions with equipment
management codes (EMC) 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or transaction histories that have an equipment
management exception flag (EMEF) R and 201-ITEM-CODE not equal to D. Sorts selected
transaction histories in system designator/transaction serial number sequence. No records of any
type will be reported if the SRAN equals 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014,
2015, or the system designator is other than 01 and the major command code is equal to 88.
5.49.2.2. Scans the transaction history area for transactions when the transaction identification
code (TRIC) equals FCD, Budget Code equals 9 or Z, ERRCD ND or NF, and equipment
management code (EMC 1, 2 or 3). If the criteria are met, then the program creates an item
balance overlay record (XGG). Individual equipment items are not reported.
5.49.2.3. Produces the item balance records: Records are produced for each stock number
assigned an EMC code 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 that had a transaction which changed the asset position.

5.50.9. Distribution Instructions. Notify the applicable Resource Manager that data images are
available for download to the microcomputer.
5.51. Daily Recoverable Assembly Management Process System (RAMPS) Report
(D28/NGV868)
5.51.1. Purpose. To print and create a SIFS interface file for transmission of transaction, asset,
daily demand rate (DDR), and percent of base repair (PBR) reports from the daily transaction
histories when a change occurs in the asset or level position.
5.51.2. Program Logic.
5.51.2.1. Scans the transaction history and selects histories with the following criteria:
5.51.2.1.1. A transaction serial number greater than 026-D28-RCD-COUNTER(6,10), and;
5.51.2.1.2. Report codes 0-8, or blank report codes with a RID equal to F*Z or F##, C or Q
series, and ERRCD code XB/XF/XD.
5.51.2.1.3. Transaction history records are sorted by the following categories: (1) recoverable
(report codes 6 or 7), (2) EOQ (report codes 0 or 5), or (3) blank report code in system
designator/type stock record account code/stock number sequence.
5.51.2.2. Reports are printed and output for each transaction history with reporting codes 0, 5, 6,
7, or blank (criteria mentioned above). Reverse-post transactions are identified by a dash (-) in
position 25 (first of the quantity field).
5.51.2.3. Reports are printed and output for EOQ and recoverable items upon change of system
designator, stock number, or type account code, except reporting code 8. A separate report is
produced for each transaction history for reporting code asterisk (*). Reports for EOQ items,
reporting codes 0 or 5, will have the quantities summarized. The quantities for reverse-post
transactions are decreased from the summarized quantity. If the summarized quantity becomes
negative, the negative quantity is reported in the quantity fields. Negative quantities are

identified by a dash (-) in the first position of the applicable field. The MMAC is eliminated
from all applicable stock numbers prior to printing and punching.
5.51.2.4. DDR/PBR are printed and output for each TRIC LVL, TTPC 4G and TRIC FID, TTPC
4I transaction history of an AFMC-managed ERRCD XB3, XF3, XD2 and XD3 stock number.
Excluded items will be stock numbers in SRAN 2373, 2374, 2375, 2376, and 2377.
5.51.2.5. System designator, stock number, unit of issue, and reporting code changes are
processed against data before any reports are produced. Reports are produced for transaction
histories created prior to the selection of a reporting code; however, reports are not produced
when the reporting code is blank on the item record (Exception to the blank reporting -- See
logic above). Transaction histories created before the addition of a reporting code or blank
report code that requires reporting are disregarded. All date fields in the output contain the
requisition date.
5.51.2.6. An option is provided to add in transit time to the repair cycle time reported in the
DAC for repairs performed at AMC primary supply points (see note 2 below).
5.51.2.7. Transaction histories are not selected for the following SRANs: FB2008, 2009, 2010,
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and 2311.
5.51.2.8. Reads the item record and detail record set. On-hand and authorized balances are
accumulated for preparation of the reports. The repair cycle record is read, and the RTS,
condemned, and NRTS data are printed for each recoverable type item (report codes 6 and 7).
Each item record is handled as a single item.

3. Report (From) Routing Identifier is determined from the 106-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR
record.
4. The following information applies:
a. Required for reporting codes 0, 5, 6, and 7. The requisition objective (RO) as reported on the
7LF is the sum of the bases' peacetime operating stock (POS) requirement plus authorized
additive requirements minus 235-AUTH-QTY. The POS portion of the RO is either the RBL
(216 detail with type level F) authorized quantity or if no RBL exists, then it is the item record
demand level (as modified by the maximum, minimum, or fixed level detail quantity). The
authorized additive portion of the RO is the sum of the authorized quantities from the Special
Spares (233), High Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK)/Contingency High Priority Mission
Support Kit (CHPMSK) (CHPMSK is identified by 234-FILLER-2 = C), (234), Non-Airborne
MRSP (237), Airborne MRSP (239), WRM IRSP (240) and WRM WCDO Spares (241) details.
b. The supply point authorized quantity is added to the requisition objective when the stock
record account number (SRAN) is 2373 or 2374.
5. An N is entered in this field if the reporting code is 6 or 7, and the freeze code is unequal to
C.
6. If the first position of the system designator is equal to an alpha B or C a G will be entered in
the type stock record code field.
7. This balance includes the (101) Item Record serviceable balance, (218) Supply Point quantity
on-hand, (232) Mission Support Kit (MSK) quantity on-hand, and (232) MSK deployed quantity.
8. This quantity is the sum of DIFM unserviceable detail record balances. DIFM unserviceable
detail records with condition code J or Q are excluded from the balance, because they are
included in the suspended in-stock balance.
9. This quantity is the sum of DIFM unserviceable detail record balances with supply condition
code J and Q.
10. SPRAM deployed quantity is only applicable to type SPRAM flag A, D, or T.

6. This field contains the last three positions of the demand level minus 235-AUTH-QTY. For
items with an RBL loaded (216 detail with type level F) this field will also reflect the RBL
authorized quantity because the RBL quantity overwrites the 101-demand-level. For AMMES,
this field is blank.
7. If the system designator is alpha (B or C series)--type stock record account code is not K--a G
is entered in the type stock record account code field. If the type stock record account code is K,

Special SPARES (233), HPMSK/CHPMSK (CHPMSK is identified by the 234-FILLER-2 = C)
(234), Non-Airborne MRSP (237), Airborne MRSP (239), and WRM IRSP (240) details.
10. Positions 64-66 will contain the supply point detail record on-hand quantity with type
authorization code C, P, Q or when the supply point detail organization code off base flag is a Y
and the deployed quantity of the MSK (232) record.
11. Positions 67-70 will contain the firm DIFM (DIFM status flag 0, 3, or 4) detail record

all the following conditions are met: DIFM-STATUS-FLAG = 0, 3, or 4, the DIFM status is
equal to either CEH, MWI, TCG, and the type organization code is not equal to “H” for HPMSK
details or “W” for MRSP/WRM details.
5.51.23. HPMSK/ CHPMSK Asset Status Image (9QN) - Output. To provide the current asset
and level position for items controlled under HPMSK/CHPMSK concept. Items that meet all of
the following criteria (ERRCD coded XB/XF, budget code eight (8), RID equal to Fxx; or
(ERRCD coded XB/XF, budget code ‘S’, RID equals F##) will also generate a 9QN transaction
when the asset posture changes or when queried by the DZE report code 8 process. Under these
conditions the 9QN will be generated regardless if there is a HPMSK or CHPMSK loaded or not.
The reason for the report when no HPMSK or CHPMSK exist is—the 7LK, 9QK, and 9QN
transactions are one set. Meaning, there could be activity on a stock number that caused the
asset or levels posture to change which would result in a 7LF and 9QK. Also, the 9QN will be
generated and it will contain all zeros. Report output images are produced for all reportable
items that are identified as HPMSK/CHPMSK.
Note: The CHPMSK is identified by the 234-FILLER-2 = “C”.

Notes:
1. Routing Identifier Code. Report (To) Routing Identifier Code (RIC) is determined from the
RIC on the item record.
2. Percent of Base Repair. Assume a decimal point between positions 37 and 38.
3. Daily Demand Rate. The DDR is defined as the number of recurring demands divided by a
period of time. If the period of time is less than 180, 180 days is used. The field has an implied
decimal place after the second position (xx.xxxx). The assumed decimal point is between
positions 41 and 42.
4. Average Repair Cycle Time. Computed during releveling, by adding 102-Net-Repair-Cycle
Days from the current quarter to those from the previous four quarters divided by the total
number of 102-REPR-GENR-RTS. This is the average repair cycle time (RCT) without floors
and ceilings.
5. Order and Shipping Time. The O&ST is assigned based on the logic described in the O&ST
Occurrence Logic Diagram.

Figure 5.6. O&ST Occurrence Logic Diagram.




6. Demand Arrival Rate. The Demand Arrival Rate, also called the item Daily Demand
Frequency Rate, and represents the average number of customer demands per day. To compute
the Demand Arrival Rate, sum the 101-NBR-DMDS-CURRENT + 101-NBR-DMDS-PAST-6-
MONTHS + 101-NBR-DMDS-PAST-7-12-MOS; then divide the sum by the number of days
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      151

since the DOFD. Note if the number of days since the DOFD is less than 180, then 180 days are
used as the denominator. The field has an implied decimal place after the second position
(xx.xxxx).
7. Delete Indicator Code. FID transactions will generate a “D” in this field.
8. If ERRCD is XB3, then the field will contain zeros.
9. NRTS/Condemned Time (NCT). This field represents the NRTS Condemned Time in number
of days.
a. If the repair cycle record contains all zeros (that is, no NRTS occurrences), then the NCT
cannot be computed. For those cases, the demand leveling process uses an NCT value of 4 days.
b. If the computed NCT is greater than zero but less than one, then an NCT value of 1 is used in
demand level calculations.
c. If the computed NCT is greater than 6 days, it is capped at 6 for demand level calculations
when the NRTS/condemned quantity for the current and the previous three quarters is 4 or less.
d. If the computed NCT is greater than 10 days, it is capped at 10 for demand level calculations.
This 10-day ceiling precludes the use of extreme NCT values in demand level computations.
e. When computing a demand level for an item in an I&SG, the demand level calculation uses
the highest computed (or capped) NCT from among all master and interchangeable items in the
I&S group.
10. Lot Size Quantity. The Lot Size Quantity is the average quantity of a customer demand.
The Lot Size Quantity is computed as the 101-CUMLTV-RECURRING-DEMANDS divided by
the sum of customer demands (101-NBR-DMDS-CURRENT + 101-NBR-DMDS-PAST-6-
MONTHS + 101-NBR-DMDS-PAST-7-12-MOS). The assumed decimal point is between
positions 72 and 73 (xxxxxx.xx).
11. Additive Authorization Quantity. This field represents the additive authorization quantity
from the following detail records: Special Spares (233) details, High Priority Mission Support
Kit (HPMSK) (234) details, Non-Airborne Mobility Readiness Spares Package (237) details,
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) (239) details, In-Place Readiness Spares Package
(IRSP) (240) details, and WRM/WCDO Spares (241) details.
12. This is the actual computed demand level.
13. The Number of Demands field represents the sum of the number of demand fields on the
item record (101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-CURRENT + 101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-PAST-6-
MONTHS + 101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-PAST-7-12 MONTHS). The total is capped at 9. If the
sum is greater than 9, then 9 will be recorded in this field.
14. Required for XCB “Delete” response. Note Pos. 60 = “D”
5.51.27. Format, Asset Reporting Image (7WS) - Output. To provide quarterly base reporting
that serves as a reconciliation for alleviating the loss of daily asset and usage reports for
contractor managed assets that have a source of supply equal to F(nn) or FZZ, and the first
position of ERRCD equal to ‘X’. The budget code is no longer part of the business logic. Note,
(nn) is numeric.
5.51.28. Output. 7WS images are output from the quarterly D28 option. These images are
packaged into one file and forwarded via the DLA Transaction Service (DLATS) to the
contractor managed ICPs.

2. This balance includes the (101) Item Record serviceable balance, (218) Supply Point quantity
on-hand, (232) Mission Support Kit (MSK) quantity on-hand, and (232) MSK deployed quantity.
The (203) quantity due-in from maintenance is included if all of the following criteria are met:
the current DIFM status code equals CEH, MWI, or TCG; the DIFM status flag equals 0, 3, or 4;
and the type organization code field on the detail is not equal to W or H.
3. Firm DIFM details only (i.e., the DIFM status flag equals 0, 3, or 4). DIFM details with
DIFM status codes CEH, MWI, or TCG are excluded from this balance because DIFM detail
records with these status codes are included in the serviceable balance. DIFM details with a type
organization code equal to W or H are also excluded because these details are included in the
WRM balance on the 9QK transaction or the HPMSK balance on the 9QN, as applicable.
4. Positions 47-52 contain the due-out to maintenance quantity (DOTM). These items have a
DIFM status flag two (2).
5. This quantity is the sum of DIFM unserviceable detail record balances. DIFM unserviceable
detail records with condition code J or Q are excluded from the balance, because they are
included in the suspended in-stock balance.
6. Positions 46-50 contain the sum of the following: the on-hand quantities from the Special
Spares (233), Non-Airborne MRSP (237), Airborne MRSP (239), WRM IRSP (240) and WRM
WCDO Spares (241) detail records; and the deployed quantities from these details; and the on-

hand quantity from firm DIFM detail records (DIFM-STATUS-FLAG = 0, 3, or 4) with a W in
the type organization code field.
7. Positions 41-46 contain the sum of the record authorized quantities from the Special Spares
(233), Non-Airborne MRSP (237), Airborne MRSP (239), WRM IRSP (240), and WRM WCDO
Spares (241), details.
8. This field contains the last three positions of the demand level for reporting codes 6, 7, F, 5, 0,
G, or blank. For contract Inventory Control Points (ICP), this field is blank.
9. Required for reporting codes 0, 5, 6, and 7. The requisition objective (RO) as reported on the
7LF is the sum of the bases' peacetime operating stock (POS) requirement plus authorized
additive requirements minus 235-AUTH-QTY. The POS portion of the RO is either the RBL
(216 detail with type level F) authorized quantity or if no RBL exists, then it is the item record
demand level (as modified by the maximum, minimum, or fixed level detail quantity). The
authorized additive portion of the RO is the sum of the authorized quantities from the Special
Spares (233), HPMSK (234), Non-Airborne MRSP (237), Airborne MRSP (239), and WRM
IRSP (240) and WRM WCDO Spares (241) details.
10. The HPMSK balance is the quantity on-hand plus deployed quantity from the (234) HPMSK
detail plus the DIFM balance marked for HPMSK.
11. The HPMSK level is the authorized quantity from the (234) HPMSK detail record.
12. This quantity is the sum of DIFM unserviceable detail record balances with supply condition
codes J and Q.
13. This field represents the total number of units repaired this station (RTS). This data comes
from the repair cycle record’s current quarter ‘RTS’.
a. For Primary Supply Point (PSP) Accounts: This field represents the current quarter ‘RTS’
plus (+) the fifth quarter ‘RTS’.
14. This field represents the total number of units not repaired this station (NRTS). This data
comes from the repair cycle record’s current quarter ‘NRTS’.
a. For PSP Accounts: This field represents the current quarter ‘NRTS’ plus (+) the fifth quarter
‘NRTS’.
b. For Forward Supply Liaison (FSL) Accounts: This field represents the current quarter
‘NRTS’ plus (+) the fifth quarter ‘NRTS’ minus (-) the 102-NBR-OF-UNITS-TURNED-IN
occurrence number three (3). Occurrence number 3 is the alpha units turned-in NRTS ‘D’.
15. This field represents the total number of units condemned this station (CONDEMN). This
data comes from the repair cycle record’s current quarter ‘CONDEMN’.
a. For PSP Accounts: This field represents the current quarter ‘CONDEMN’ plus (+) the fifth
quarter ‘CONDEMN’.
16. ERRC is a one position field not to be confused with ERRCD. Reference AFH 23-123, Vol
1, Ch 2.
5.51.28.1. The contractor managed inventory control points (ICP) uses the base consumption
and asset data from base-generated 7WS transactions as the basis to forecast new requirements
and make buy/repair decisions. In the past, 7WS file transmissions have been lost or incomplete.
Unfortunately, during the attempt to recover lost or incomplete 7WS data, the 7WS files often
are discarded. Furthermore, some of the data required to populate the 7WS images are no longer
available (i.e., the Q04 repair cycle data - RTS, NRTS, Condemned qty’s), because that data
have been shifted to the previous quarter. To prevent this problem in the future, each SRAN
should retain an electronic copy of the quarterly 7WS file until the next quarterly 7WS file is
154                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

generated. Retention of the current quarterly 7WS file will ensure that any 7WS data recovery
required in support of the contractor managed ICP’s can be easily and quickly supported.
5.51.28.2. The quarterly D28 run automatically copies the 7WS images into the following
system backup file:
         1GV0(ALN)*GV868UD7WS.
5.51.28.3. All SRANs shall maintain this backup file until the next quarterly D28 run. If the
contractor managed ICP(s) request retransmission of the 7WS during the quarter, and the backup
file is correctly catalogued on your system, contact your SIFS Monitor and have them follow
normal SIFS procedures for retransmitting the 7WS images. If the file has been inadvertently
deleted, do not rerun the D28. Rather, contact AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity to
initiate 7WS file retrieval procedures, and then retransmit the 7WS images.
5.52. Local Purchase and MILSTRIP Payment Detail And Summary List (D29/NGV958).
5.52.1. Purpose. To provide detail and summary total listings for local purchase and MILSTRIP
payment transaction histories written by the payment programs.
5.52.2. Reference. See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for initiation procedures, program logic, input
requirements, output, and use of system output.
5.52.3. Special Instructions.
5.52.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.52.3.2. Satellite: Output is not produced at the satellite.
5.52.4. Distribution Instructions. Send all output to A&F.
5.53. Two-Level Maintenance Metrics (D31/NGV842).
5.53.1. Purpose. To provide management data on Two-Level Maintenance (2LM) and Agile
Logistics (AL) assets with a level of maintenance code assigned. The report produces four
different listings: Issue/Stockage Effectiveness (ISE), Repair Cycle Management (RCM) Data,
Customer Backorder Wait Time, and the Turn-In Transaction listing.
5.53.2. Program Logic. The report provides both daily and monthly management data. Daily
data will be printed and stored in on the metrics database records 628/METRICS-ISE-DATA,
629/METRICS-RCM-DTA, AND 630/METRICS-CWT-DATA. The data stored on these
records will be printed when the inquiry or monthly option of the report is processed. When the
end-of-month option is processed, the report will accumulate the current day's data, print it, and
then produce the monthly data listings. After all updates and printing actions are accomplished,
the monthly run will then zero out the cumulative data stored on the metrics database.
5.53.3. Selection Criteria. The selection criteria for each portion of the report is identified in the
applicable section. A brief description for each management listing follows:
5.53.3.1. Issue/Stockage Effectiveness by Weapon System. Totals are accumulated daily for
issue/due-out transactions with a SRD equal to an SRD loaded on the 628/METRICS-ISE-
DATA. The monthly run will print all SRDs loaded to this record. This portion of the report is
further categorized by the type of level (readiness based or base computed) within routing
identifier. Two additional lines reflect the total number of assets identified as budget code 8 or
other than budget code 8. These lines will reflect all items, including those items, from other
than Air Force Logistics Centers, reflected above.
5.53.3.2. Repair Cycle by Organization. Totals are accumulated for turn-in transactions with an
organization (org) code equal to an org code loaded the 629/METRICS-RCM-DATA record in
the Index Sequential Access Method (ISAM) file. Organizations not loaded on the 629 record
will be collected in the ALL OTHER org group.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        155

5.53.3.2.1. A total of 15 different groups of repair organizations can be loaded for each system
designator, and up to 15 support organizations may be loaded within each group.
5.53.3.2.2. Selected transactions are totaled by condition, that is, RTS, NRTS, and condemned.
The repair cycle data will be obtained from turn-in transactions. A separate transaction listing is
produced identifying those transactions used to compute the repair cycle management listing
totals.
5.53.3.2.3. The daily run of the report will reflect only those org group(s) which transactions
have processed against. The monthly run will print all org groups loaded on the 629 record.
5.53.3.3. Customer Wait Time. Totals are accumulated for due-out release transactions. The
customer backorder (DOR) wait time record is established for each system designator when the
initial load option is processed. DOR transactions will be accumulated daily and zeroed by the
end-of-month option.
5.53.3.4. Transaction Listing. The transaction listing will reflect those turn-in transactions used
to accumulate data for the repair cycle management listing. This listing can be used to validate
the totals on the Repair Cycle Management List. This listing will contain the stock number,
maintenance action taken code, delayed before repair, repair time, and delayed after repair times.
In addition, the organization group, document and serial number will be printed. This data is not
accumulated or stored. The following definitions are critical to interpret the D31:
5.53.3.4.1. Repair Cycle time is considered as the total repair time minus AWP days, i.e., the
difference between TIN date and ISU/DOR date minus AWP. This value is stored in positions
2-4 of the 901-FILLER-4.Repair time is considered as the repair cycle time minus delayed days.
This value is computed by the program.
5.53.3.4.2. Delayed days are computed by the repair cycle transactions based upon the DIFM
status codes. These values are stored by the TIN transaction in the following transaction history
data items:
5.53.3.4.2.1. Delayed before repair - 901-MARK-FOR (positions 7-9)
5.53.3.4.2.2. Delayed after repair - 901-FILLER-2 (positions 1-3)
5.53.4. Update Logic.
5.53.4.1. Issue/Stockage Effectiveness. Transactions used to accumulate the issue/stockage
effectiveness must meet the following conditions:
5.53.4.1.1. Stock Number: Must have a Level of Maintenance code assigned (this code is stored
in the first position of the 901-FILLER-4).
5.53.4.1.2. ERRCD: First two positions must equal XD.
5.53.4.1.3. Activity Code: Must be equal to J, R, or X.
5.53.4.1.4. TRICs: The following TRIC codes are selected.
5.53.4.1.4.1. ISU with TTPCs equal to 1A, 3O, 3P, and 3Q.
5.53.4.1.4.2. DUO with TTPCs equal to 2D and 4W.
5.53.4.1.4.3. MSI with TTPCs equal to 1A, 1C, 1E, 1G, 1I, 1O, 1Q, 2I, 2K, 3Q, 5A, 5C, 5E, 5G,
5I, 5K, 6C, 6E, 6R, and 6T.
5.53.4.1.5. Type Account Code/Demand Code: Type account code must equal B and the
demand code must equal R, C, or T.
5.53.4.2. Other Weapon Systems. Totals are accumulated for weapon systems other than those
specifically loaded on the 628 record. This provides the visibility for all weapon systems.
Criteria is the same as identified above.
5.53.4.3. Categories:
156                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

5.53.4.3.1. Routing Identifier: Totals are accumulated for the applicable Air Logistics Center.
The routing identifier is stored in the 17th through the 19th position of the 901-
NOMENCLATURE.
5.53.4.3.2. Readiness Based Level: Totals are accumulated for all transactions where the 901-
D028-LEVEL-FLAG equals 1.
5.53.4.3.3. Base Computed Level. Totals are accumulated for transactions other than readiness
based levels.
5.53.4.4. Budget Code Totals. These totals reflect the type of budget code assigned to the
processed transactions already identified within each routing identifier.
5.53.4.4.1. RSD - Budget Code 8. Totals are accumulated for transactions processed with a
budget code of 8.
5.53.4.4.2. OTHER - Totals are accumulated for transactions processed with a budget code other
than 8.
5.53.4.5. Computations:
5.53.4.5.1. Line Items Requested. These totals are considered a workload factor and are not
used to compute issue/stockage effectiveness. Totals are accumulated for all transactions
(including TTPC 3O, killed requests).
Exception: Reinput of a previously killed request (TEX M) is not counted. See Note 1. Partial
issues (TTPC 3P) that result in more than one transaction will be counted as one request. See
Note 2.
5.53.4.5.2. Units Requested. Same as line items requested except that the quantity is added to
the accumulator. If there is more than one transaction (TTPC 3P and 2D) against the same
document number, the quantity for both is counted. See Note 2.
5.53.4.5.3. Line Items Issued. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with type transaction
phrase code (TTPC) equal to 1A, 1C, 1E, 1G, 1I, 1O, 1Q, 2I, 2K, 3P, 3Q, 5A, 5C, 5E, 5G, 6C,
6E, 6R, or 6T. If the TTPC equals 3P and the document number is equal to the previous
document number, totals are not updated. See Note 2.
5.53.4.5.4. Units Issued. Same as line items issued except that the action quantity is added to
the accumulator, including all transactions with TTPC 3P. See Note 2.
5.53.4.5.5. Line Items Backordered. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with TTPCs 2D
and 4W.
5.53.4.5.6. Units Backordered. Same as line items backordered except that the action quantity is
added to the accumulator.
5.53.4.5.7. Issue Effectiveness (Line Items). Percentages are computed by dividing line items
issued, plus line items backordered, into line items issued.
5.53.4.5.8. Issue Effectiveness (Units). Same as issue effectiveness (line items) except that unit
totals are used for the computation.
5.53.4.5.9. Line Items Backordered 4W. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with TTPC
4W.
5.53.4.5.10. Units Backordered 4W. Same as line items backordered 4W except that the action
quantity is added to the accumulator.
5.53.4.5.11. Stockage Effectiveness (Line Items). Percentages are computed by dividing line
items issued, plus line items backordered, minus line items backordered 4W into line items
issued.
5.53.4.5.12. Stockage Effectiveness (Units). Same as stockage effectiveness (line items) except
that the action quantity is used for computation.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       157


Notes:
1. Result of a reinput of a killed request.
a. Line items/units requested may be greater or less than the sum of line items/units issued plus
line items/units backordered, due to an item being killed and not backordered, or an item being
backordered on a new transaction date without a new document number.
b. A reinput of a killed request with the same document number will not be counted within line
items/units requested. It will be counted within line items/units B/O.
2. Examples of a partial issue/backorder: A transaction for a quantity of 20 is requested. Ten
will issue under one stock number and 10 will issue under a substitute, or will be backordered.
Two transactions are created with the same document number. This will result in adding one to
line items requested and adding 20 to units requested.
5.53.5. Repair Cycle Management. Transactions used to accumulate the repair cycle
management listing must meet the following edits:
5.53.5.1. TRIC TIN with TTPC 2M, 2O, or 2U. ERRCD equals XD, and activity code (first
position of the 901-DOCUMENT-NBR) unequal to E, U, or W, and fourth position of the 901-
CAGE unequal to C (contract maintenance), and 901-TEX code is unequal to a + (plus), and
action taken code (901-DEMAND) is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, D, F, G, K, L, or Z.
5.53.5.2. Reparable This Station (RTS). Totals are accumulated for transactions with action
taken codes A, B, F, G, K, L, and Z.
5.53.5.3. Not Reparable This Station (NRTS). Totals are accumulated for transactions with
action taken codes 1 through 8 and code D.
5.53.5.4. Condemned. Totals are accumulated for transactions with action taken code 9.
5.53.5.5. Computations:
5.53.5.5.1. Total Repair Cycle Time. Computed by adding together the delayed before repair,
delayed after repair, and repair time.
5.53.5.5.2. Average Repair Cycle Time. Total RCT divided by the total units.
5.53.5.5.3. Total Units RTS/NRTS/COND Percentages. These percentages are computed by
dividing the overall total of repair cycle units into each respective condition
RTS/NRTS/CONDEMNED.
5.53.6. The Customer Backorder (DOR) Wait Time Record. This record is established for each
system designator on the initial run of the load option. Selected DOR transactions will be
accumulated daily and zeroed by the end-of-month option.
5.53.6.1. Selection and Computations.
5.53.6.1.1. Number of requests. Organization code equals 002 or greater than 099; activity code
equals J, R, or X; TTPC is 1A; stock number is unequal to K in the fifth position.
5.53.6.1.2. Wait Time (Line Items). Wait time is computed as the difference between the
document number date and the current ordinal date.
5.53.6.1.3. Number of Units. Same as number of requests, except the units are computed.
5.53.6.1.4. Wait Time (Units). Same as wait time for line items, except the number of units are
used.
5.53.6.1.5. Averages. Both requests and units averages are computed by dividing the wait time
by the number of requests or units, respectively.
5.53.6.2. Categories:
5.53.6.2.1. Operational Organizations. Type organization code is equal to 3, 7, 8, 9, G, or I.

Notes:
1. This option is used to inquire the cumulative data stored on the Metrics database records.
Enter a dash (-) in position 30 to inquire selected categories. The program will not scan the
transaction history or update the database records when this option is selected. This option must
be used in conjunction with positions 31 through 33.
2. This option must be used only with the inquiry option (position 30). Enter a dash (-) in
positions 31-33 to print selected categories of the D31. Only those categories selected will be
printed. Enter a dash (-) in the following positions for the desired category:

3. This option is used for the initial load or when loading/deleting SRD(s). Enter a dash (-) in
position 40 to load/delete SRD(s) and enter the level of the maintenance code in position 42.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      159

When this option is taken, an ISE parameter image must be input or a 212 reject will occur. This
option can be used in conjunction with the organization load/delete option (position 41). Process
this option on the primary database prior to RPTRUN.
4. This option is used for the initial load or when loading/deleting organizations. When this
option is taken, an RCM parameter image must be input or a 212 reject will occur. This option
can be used in conjunction with the SRD load/delete option (position 40). Process this option on
the primary prior to RPTRUN.
5. This field is mandatory when processing the load or delete option. Each ORG/SRD must be
loaded for a specific level of maintenance code. ORGs/SRDs may be loaded for more than one
level of maintenance code.
6. This is a stand-alone option; positions 30 through 64 must be left blank. Enter a dash (-) in
position 65 to zero the 2LM issue/stockage effectiveness, repair cycle management, and
customer wait time portions of the report. This option should be processed during normal end-
of-month reports processing. If this option is used at other than end-of-month, all data
accumulated will be zeroed out.
5.53.8. 2LM Issue/Stockage Effectiveness Data Parameter. This parameter must be used in
conjunction with the SRD load/delete option of the report select image. The ISE parameter
establishes the 628/METRICS-ISE-DATA record for which data will be collected. Four ISE
parameters may be input for each system designator. Use this parameter only on the initial load
or when loading/deleting an SRD. A default (ALL OTHER SRD) record will be established on
the initial load for each system designator. This allows for accumulation of data for SRDs that
are not specifically loaded. This parameter may be used in conjunction with the RCM
parameter.

5.53.9. 2LM Repair Cycle Management (RCM) Data Parameter. This parameter must be used
in conjunction with the organization load/delete option of the report select image. The RCM
parameter establishes the organization(s) 629/METRICS-RCM-DATA record for which data
will be collected. Fifteen RCM parameters (groups) may be input for each system designator. In
addition, 15 support organizations may be input for each group. Use this parameter on the initial
load or when loading/deleting an organization or group. When loading a group of organizations,
the first organization (positions 8-10) must be the repair organization. A default (All Other
Organizations) record will be established on the initial load for each system designator in the
base constants record. This allows for accumulation of data for orgs that are not specifically
loaded. This parameter may be used in conjunction with the ISE parameter.

Information System (SBSS/DSS/MIS) Interface (D36/NGV879).
5.55.1. Purpose. To provide DLA with information on the performance of receipts (REC);
vendor-owned container receipts (1VR); turn-ins (TIN); issues (ISU); due-out releases (DOR);
warehouse location changes (FCS); inventory adjustments (CIC, Inventory Recount (IRC),
Sample Inventory (1RS)) processed on the SBSS at the ALCs. This management report will pass
data to the Distribution Standard System/Management Information System (DSS/MIS). The data
produced by this report will be used to ensure adequate customer support is maintained and
deficiencies are pinpointed and corrected in a timely manner. In addition, the DSS/MIS will use
this data to provide production data to the accounting and finance database management system
(DBMS) in support of the fee-for-service initiative.
5.55.2. Program Logic. Scans the daily transaction history area selecting all records where the
TRIC equals REC or TIN and the TTPC equals 1B; or the TRIC equals 1VR and the TTPC
equals 2E; or the TRIC equals ISU or DOR and the TTPC equals 1A, 3P, or 3Q; or the TRIC
equals IRC and the TTPC equals 1A or 1B. Also all transactions must have the 101-DLA-
STORAGE-FLAG = Y.
5.55.2.1. When the TRIC equals REC, TIN, or 1VR, a corresponding output image will be
created and written to file (g)GV0<ALN>*GV879UD801.
5.55.2.2. When the TRIC equals FCS, an output image will be created and written to file
(g)GV0<ALN>*GV879UD802.
5.55.2.3. When the TRIC equals IRC, an output image will be created and written to file
(g)GV0*<ALN>*GV879UD803.
5.55.2.4. When the TRIC is equal to ISU or MSI, an output image will be created and written to
file (g)GV0<ALN>*GV879UD804.
5.55.2.5. Program will read input file (g)GV0*<ALN>*GV879INPUT. containing CIC, IRC, or
1RS images. The images contained in this file are generated by the inline inventory programs.
Each time an inventory transaction is processed that does not change the item record balance, an
image will be created and written to this file. When RPTRUN is processed, a new file is created

using the secondary gang number, the primary gang file is copied to the secondary gang file, and
the primary gang file is erased and prepared for the next processing day.
5.55.2.5.1. For each image read from file (g)GV0<ALN>*GV879INPUT., an output image will
be created and written to file (g)GV0<ALN>*GV879UD803.
5.55.2.5.2. When the end-of-month option is processed, the program will read the 618-
AVERAGE-INVENTORY-INVESTMENT record to obtain the total dollar value of assets on
hand and the 622-ITEM-RECORD-DATA record to obtain the total number of item records with
an on-hand balance greater than zero. For each of these totals, an output image will be created in
file (g)GV0<ALN>*GV879UD803.

5.56. Consolidated History Record Merge (D37/NGV778).
5.56.1. Purpose. To select printable transaction history records for merging daily into the
consolidated transaction (CTH) history record area, to create document control records (DCR).
5.56.2. Program Logic. Program NGV778, CTH Merge, does the following:
5.56.2.1. Selects all daily transaction history records with a 4-bit or 1-bit set in the PRINT-
PUNCH-FLG for merging into the CTH file. Writes all selected records to the CTH file placing
the 002-ORDINAL-DATE in the 704-TRANSACTION-DATE field. If no records are found, a
management notice displays and processing ends.
5.56.2.2. Stores and sorts selected transaction history records based on the following: system
designator--major sort; stock number--minor sort. Merges the sorted records storing them as
704-CT-HISTORY records. Next, the program performs a second scan of the records to check if
the 1-bit is set in the PRINT-PUNCH-FLG. For each record found, the program then stores a
707-DOCUMENT-CONTROL record. The only exception is Base Service Store (activity code
K) transactions which are destroyable. The program will not store a 707-DOCUMENT-

5.57.1.4. To provide the Materiel Management Flight with labels for equipment, retail sales, and
SPRAM type items.
5.57.2. Program Logic.
5.57.2.1. The D38 will process a file containing all type labels that are produced by transaction
interface processing (TIP) each processing day. The file #GV0*GV837UD700. (# = second
gang number) will be created at the beginning of day (BOD) and will be crossed over to the
secondary system. The previous day's file will be deleted each BOD before a new file is created.
This program will print only single label forms.
5.57.2.2. The D38 will edit the report select format for the label size requested, and then it will
process as follows:
5.57.2.2.1. If warehouse bin labels are requested, the program reads the applicable item records.
The selected records are sorted in warehouse location sequence.
5.57.2.2.2. If WRM spares bin labels are requested, the program reads the applicable WRM
detail records. The selected records (type W) are sorted in warehouse location sequence.
5.57.2.2.3. If supply point bin labels are requested, the program reads the applicable supply
point detail records. The selected records are sorted in document number sequence.
5.57.2.2.4. If SPRAM bin labels are requested, the program reads the applicable SPRAM detail
records (activity code D). The selected records are sorted in document number sequence.
5.57.2.2.5. If MRSP/MSK bin labels are requested, the program reads the applicable MRSP-
MSK detail records (activity codes U/M). The selected records are sorted in document number
sequence.
5.57.2.2.6. If equipment labels are requested, the program reads the applicable authorized in-use
detail records (activity code E). The selected records are sorted in document number sequence.
The number of labels produced for each detail is based on the quantity in positions 43-47 of the
input warehouse location change (WLC) image.
5.57.2.2.7. If bench stock labels are requested, the program reads the applicable master bench
stock detail record (activity code B). The selected records are sorted in document number
sequence.
5.57.2.3. The D38 will produce bar coded labels for Logistics Applications of Automated
Marking and Reading Symbols (LOGMARS) processing. These labels will be produced only for
warehouse and bench stock bin labels.
5.57.3. Special Instructions.
5.57.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary. All output files will be SYM’ED to the applicable
dummy queue and must be requeued by the RPS operator to the active mainline printer or
LOGMARS printer.

Note: The above SIFS filename will be created for each satellite supported. The file name for
the host (system designator 01) is already hard-coded and in the SIFS Routing File Data (CUD)
file. The host CSB SIFS manager will load a SIFS CUD file entry for each satellite supported.
5.58.7.2. Initial Implementation Instructions. A quick way to load the SIFS CUD file entry for
each one of the system designators is as follows:
5.58.7.2.1. Enter SIFS UTIL Menu. >@ADD 0GV00000*GVSSGUD001.UTIL
5.58.7.2.2. Take Option 9 to view CUD file. >9
5.58.7.2.3. Zoom on D40 CUD entry for file 1GV0*GV813DUD8XX.
5.58.7.2.4. Change XX in filename, lookup ID, and system designator to the satellite’s system
designator.
5.58.7.2.5. Change YYYY on the reports control symbol to satellite’s SRAN. Example -
SBSSAFTOCYYYY change to SBSSAFTOC6281 where 6281 is satellite’s SRAN.
5.58.7.2.6. Enter option A to add record.
5.58.7.2.7. Repeat for each system designator that host base supports.

5.62.7. SIFS Files.
5.62.7.1. #GV0(ALN)*GV256UD901. Where # = PRIMARY GANG Number, ALN = Base
ALN Number.
Note: The term Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working
Capital Working Fund (DWCF), however, the term DBOF will be shown until it is
programmatically updated in the SBSS.

5.63. Stock Fund On-Order, In-Transit, And Payable List (M01/NGV972).
5.63.1. Purpose. To provide the current position of the SMAG on-order and in-transit
inventories and liabilities at any given time. During end-of-month, this program analyzes the
SMAG detail records and updates and accumulators in the appropriate A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR
(307) records for all divisions of the Air Force SMAG. Program M12/NGV982 creates ZTR
images from these accumulators, showing the net changes for the current month for input into the
accounting and finance system (BQ ADS) for base SMAG general ledger reporting.
5.63.2. Program Logic. The Computer Operations personnel run program M01/NGV972 by
processing report select transaction RPTM01. Depending on the report option selected, the
program does the following:
5.63.2.1. Selects the following detail records with fund codes 6C and 64:
5.63.2.1.1. DUE-IN-DETAIL (202) record.
5.63.2.1.2. STATUS-FLP-MILSTRIP-DETAIL (208) record.
5.63.2.1.3. STATUS-BNR-DETAIL (209) record.
5.63.2.1.4. STATUS-LOCAL-PURCHASE-DETAIL (210) record.
5.63.2.1.5. STATUS-SHIP-DETAIL (211) record.
5.63.2.1.6. RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record.
5.63.2.1.7. SHIPPED-NOT-CREDITED-DETAIL (215) record.
5.63.2.1.8. CLAIMS-RECEIVABLE-DETAIL (221) record.
5.63.2.1.9. TRANSPORTATION-PAYABLE-DETAIL (229) record.
5.63.2.2. Computes the standard extended price (quantity times ITEM-RECORD (101) record
unit price if not included in the detail records). Updates the current period field of the A-F-GEN-
LEDGER-ZTR (307) records with the total computed dollar values. Table 5.113. contains the
update logic (options 1 and 2).
5.63.2.3. Sorts details, summarizes, and prints output based upon the option indicated in the
report select transaction.
5.63.2.4. Updates the A-F-SEQUENCE-CONTROL (309) record for the 309-972-M01-DATE
field.
5.63.3. Special Instructions.
5.63.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.63.3.2. Satellite: Output is not produced at the satellite.
5.63.4. Distribution Instructions. The DFAS field site Business Funds Branch and the funds
manager each receive one copy of the M01 listings.
5.63.5. Frequency. Option 1 of program M01/NGV972 is a mandatory end-of-month program.
Options 2, 3, or 4 may be run more frequently. The processing sequence of this program is in
section 5A.
5.63.6. Input. The M01 reads database records as input. These records are:
186                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

5.63.6.1. ITEM-RECORD (101) record (for the quantity).
5.63.6.2. DUE-IN-DETAIL (202) record.
5.63.6.3. STATUS-FLP-MILSTRIP-DETAIL (208) record.
5.63.6.4. STATUS-BNR-DETAIL (209) record.
5.63.6.5. STATUS-LOCAL-PURCHASE-DETAIL (210) record.
5.63.6.6. STATUS-SHIP-DETAIL (211) record.
5.63.6.7. RECEIVED-BUT-NOT-BILLED-DETAIL (213) record.
5.63.6.8. SHIPPED-NOT-CREDITED-DETAIL (215) record.
5.63.6.9. CLAIMS-RECEIVABLE-DETAIL (221) record.
5.63.6.10. TRANSPORTATION-PAYABLE-DETAIL (229) record.
5.63.7. Output. Program M01/NGV972 produces one Paper view data file, depending upon the
option in the report select transaction, and prints three types of lists:
5.63.7.1. PACAF Paper view File. Output data file 0GV0<ALN>SRAN*GV972UD881. is a
reformatted ON-ORDER-INTRANSIT PAYABLE LIST (Table 5.114. and Table 5.115.) to
allow base-level and command-level access to detail and consolidated accounting records by
viewing, versus printing, the entire listing. It may be used as input to the maintaining, preparing
and processing executive reports (MAPPER) system to produce specialized reports for PACAF.
5.63.7.2. Keystone output file. Output data file 0GV0<ALN>SRAN*GV972UD801 (Table
5.116. and Table 5.117). Detail GLA images are used by Keystone to compute accounts
payable information. Back up file 0GV0<ALN><SRAN>*GV972UD870 is created for recovery
if needed.
5.63.7.3. On Order, In transit, Payable List. Table 5.113. lists the detail records cited in
paragraph above. The detail records are listed by system designator within Supply Management
Business Activity (General Support Business Activity and Materiel Support Business Activity).
The detail records are grouped under the following subtitles with summary dollar totals provided
for each: (The Business Funds Branch has no audit requirements.).
5.63.7.3.1. In transit - Paid - BNR Details.
5.63.7.3.2. Shipped - Credit Not Received - SNC Details.
5.63.7.3.3. In transit - Unpaid - Shipped Status.
5.63.7.3.4. Received - Unpaid - RNB Details.
5.63.7.3.5. On Order from Procurement (Reimb).
5.63.7.3.6. On Order from Procurement (Non-Reimb).
5.63.7.3.7. LP Due-In - No LP Status (This report includes.
5.63.7.3.8. LP Status Details where the Purchase Order Number begins with A or F and the
Type Procurement Code is K or L.
5.63.7.3.9. On Order, Intra-Stock Fund Division - Due-In.
5.63.7.3.10. On Order-Overseas Excess Interservices - Due-In.
5.63.7.3.11. Claims Receivable Details.
5.63.7.3.12. Claims Payable Details.
5.63.7.3.13. Excess Transportation Payable Details.
5.63.7.4. On Order, In transit, Payable Summary (by system designator). This product displays
the summarized general ledger totals by system designator, based upon the logic. The Business
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      187

Funds Branch reviews this list for unusual or abnormal amounts which may then be associated to
specific detail records.
5.63.7.5. On Order, In transit, Payable Summary. This product provides a summarized total of
all general ledger totals for all system designators. The Business Funds Branch reviews this list
for unusual or abnormal amounts which may then be associated to specific detail records within
a specific system designator.
5.63.8. Output Print Product Usage.
5.63.8.1. On Order, In transit, Payable Detail List. The Business Funds Branch uses this product
as a tool for researching rejected payment and deletion transactions. It also fulfills the
requirements in DFAS-DERI 170-9 as supporting data for unliquidated obligations of the
applicable division of the Defense Business Operation Fund.
5.63.8.2. On Order, In transit, Payable Summary List (by system designator). This product is
used primarily by the supply SMAG manager. The SMAG manager uses the M01 checklist to
validate the on order, in transit, payable summary list (DFAS-DE 7077.10-M).
5.63.8.3. On Order, In transit, Payable Summary List. The Business Funds Branch uses this list
to reconcile selected GLSAs on the AF Stock Fund Trial Balance Report (SH069CC3B). See
DFAS-DE 7077.4-M. Balances on the trial balance report should agree with this list. Valid
differences such as uncleared payment rejects must be documented on a journal voucher.
5.63.8.4. Disposition instructions for the above output products are stated in DFAS-DE 7077.10-
M.

provides the same update and output as option 1, except the On Order, In transit, Payable Detail
List.
c. Option 3 (position 65 = dash; position 70 = blank). This option provides the same printed
output of option 1 but does not update the A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR (307) records. Its use is
optional.
d. Option 4 (position 65 = dash; position 70 = S). This option provides the same printed output
of option 2 but does not update the A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR (307) records. Its use is optional.

For an SBSS Host account (example: FB4479 (McChord): positions 6-11 would show host
SRAN 4479. For an autonomous satellite account: positions 6-11 would show autonomous
SRAN (FB2857) and positions 12-17 would show autonomous SRAN (2857). For a non-
autonomous satellite account (example: FB6372 - Kingsley Field): positions 6-11 would show
host SRAN (FB4479) and positions 12-17 would show non-autonomous SRAN (FB6372).

5.65. Inventory Reconciliation (M02/NGV891).
5.65.1. Purpose.
5.65.1.1. Summary End-of-Period Report: Information in this report is used by the SMAS to
classify SBSS end-of-period inventories into the correct general ledger accounts, compute dollar
balances for these accounts, and compare those totals to the balances of the corresponding
general ledger balances in SMAS.
5.65.1.2. Detail Periodic Report: This report is used by A&F personnel to verify daily updates
being made in SMAS from SBSS transactions and to research causes of any out-of-balance
conditions.
5.65.2. Program Logic.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                      207

5.65.2.1. Summary End-of-Period Report:
5.65.2.1.1. General. Selects item records with a budget code equal to 8, 9 or alpha. The alpha
budget codes selected are those where the ERRCD equals Xxx. For the remainder of this
narrative, the alpha budget code will be used to indicate alpha budget code where ERRCD equals
Xxx. This program provides two options that may be used when an out-of-balance condition
exists between SMAS and the SBSS. They are the stock record account select option and the
single stock number select option. These options limit the amount of records selected, thus
providing a smaller amount of records to research. The SRAN select option may be processed
with up to five SRANs. The stock number select option provides the capability to select records
for a single item record. These options may only be processed with the as-required option (an R
in position 27) of the report select format.
5.65.2.1.2. Specific. There are six separate inventory groupings within the summary end-of
period report. Each grouping has a different type inventory code. A data file is created with a
summary end-of-period control image followed by summary end-of-period (1RI) images. See
section B, section C, and section F. Dollar totals are summarized, and a new 1RI image is
created when a change occurs in the budget code, type inventory code, routing identifier (RID),
managers designator code (MDC), SRAN, fund code, project code, signal code, database record
number, or DIFM Status flag. Selection criteria for each type inventory grouping are as follows:
5.65.2.1.2.1. POS (Peacetime Operating Stock) for Sale (Type Inventory Code A). Selects and
computes the dollar value (extended cost) for each of the following SBSS records by multiplying
the quantity on hand (to include deployed quantity for authorized details) by the 022-FILLER-2
(MAC cost) for budget codes 8, 9 and alpha.
5.65.2.1.2.1.1. ITEM-RECORD (101).
5.65.2.1.2.1.2. AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAILS (201). Selects budget code 9 records with
the allowance source code AFMC Uniform Office 987 and an item code unequal to ‘D’ and the
equipment code unequal to ‘R”. Extended cost is computed for these records by multiplying the
quantity on hand (to include deployed quantity) by the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost) for budget
code 9.
Note: If an 022-COST-RECORD does not exist the 101-UNIT-PRICE is used.
5.65.2.1.2.1.3. DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE-DETAIL (203). For budget code 9, the 203-
REPAIR-RETURN-FLAG must not equal “R.” Computes the extended cost by multiplying the
quantity due-in by the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost) when the DIFM status flag equals a “0”, “3”,
or “4” and the budget code equals 8 or alpha. If the first two characters of the ERRCD is other
than XD, then the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost) dollar amount will be used. If the budget code is
9, then the ITEM-RECORD 101-UNIT-PRICE or 022-FILLER-2 (MAC), if present, will be
used.
5.65.2.1.2.1.4. DIFM-UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL (204) when the materiel condition code
equals "A, B, C, or D". For budget code 8, 9 and alpha, computes extended cost by multiplying
unserviceable quantity by the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost), if present, or 101-UNIT-PRICE.
5.65.2.1.2.1.5. SUPPLY-POINT-DETAIL (218).
5.65.2.1.2.2. POS for Future Sale (Type Inventory Code B). Selects DIFM-
UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL (204) records with a Materiel Condition Code of “E, J, K, L, N.”
For budget code 8, 9, and alpha, computes extended cost by multiplying unserviceable quantity
by 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost), if present, or 101-UNIT-PRICE. For budget code 8, ERRCD
“XDx” an Extended Cost 2 is computed by multiplying the unserviceable quantity by the 022-
LRC.
208                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

5.65.2.1.2.3. POS for Repair (Type Inventory Code C). Selects DIFM-UNSERVICEABLE-
DETAIL (204) records with a Materiel Condition Code of “F, G, M, Q, or R”. For budget code
8, 9, and alpha computes extended cost by multiplying unserviceable quantity by 022-FILLER-2
(MAC cost), if present, or 101-UNIT -PRICE. For budget code 8, ERRCD “XDx” an Extended
Cost 2 is computed by multiplying the unserviceable quantity by the 022-LRC.
5.65.2.1.2.4. Obsolete, unserviceable, etc. (Type Inventory Code D). Selects DIFM-
UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL (204) records with a Materiel Condition Code of “H, P, or S”.
For budget code 8, 9, and alpha computes extended cost by multiplying unserviceable quantity
by the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost), if present, or 101-UNIT-PRICE.
5.65.2.1.2.5. WRM (Type Inventory Code E). Selects and computes the dollar values (extended
cost) for each of the following SBSS records by multiplying the quantity on hand (to include
deployed quantity for authorized in use and WRM details) by the 022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost), if
present, or 101-UNIT-PRICE for budget code 8, 9, and alpha.
5.65.2.1.2.5.1. AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAIL (201) records where the use code is D and the
item code is not equal to D. For budget code 9, the 201-UNSERVICEABLE-QTY-CALIB AND
THE 201-UNSERVICEABLE-QTY-MAINT are included in the total quantity reported
5.65.2.1.2.5.2. SPECIAL-SPARES-DETAIL (233).
5.65.2.1.2.5.3. WRM-WCDO-SPARES (241).
5.65.2.1.2.6. Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) (Type Inventory Code F). Selects and computes
the dollar value (extended cost) for each of the following SBSS records by multiplying the
quantity on hand (to include deployed quantity for authorized in-use and WRM details) by the
022-FILLER-2 (MAC cost), if present, or 101-UNIT-PRICE for budget codes 8, 9, and alpha.

on EOM. The program checks this field to store the EOM indicator in the Summary End-Of-
Period report control image. See Table 5.113.
b. Enter an R in position 27 if the report is being processed other than EOM.
3. Enter a dash (-) in position 29 to produce the detail periodic report and is mandatory for the
EOM report. This option may be processed in conjunction with position 27.
4. Enter the appropriate budget code(s) in positions 31-33. At least one budget code must be
selected or the program will produce a 503 reject for an invalid select card. For the end-of-
month report enter 89A. The A selects all alpha budget codes where the ERRCD equals Xxx.
5. Enter up to five SRANs for specific selection. All SRANs are selected when this field is
blank. Leave blank when the EOM option is requested.
6. Enter the system designator of the stock number that was entered in positions 66-80. This
option is used to select data based on a specific system designator and stock number. This is a
stand-alone option and must be processed with positions 66-80. Leave blank when the EOM
option is requested.
7. Enter the stock number of the item you wish to select. When this option is requested the
system designator is MANDATORY in positions 64-65. A 519 management notice is output on
the remote processing station (RPS) console if the stock number is not loaded. Leave blank
when the EOM option is requested.
8. A 503 reject notice is output on the RPS console if this option is requested in conjunction
with the EOM option.

5.67.2.9.2. The DOFD is greater than 90 days, the revised level is zero, and the MRA is not
equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, A, or B.
5.67.2.10. Recomputes the cumulative recurring demands and updates the DOFD to the current
requisition date minus 365 when the master bench stock detail DOFD is greater than 544 days
old. Cumulative recurring demands will equal the DDR multiplied by 365 rounded.
5.67.2.11. Builds sort records for each bench stock detail recommended for deletion.
5.67.2.12. Computes recommended changes using the following criteria:
5.67.2.12.1. The new master bench stock levels are computed as specified in AFH 23-123, Vol
2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
5.67.2.12.2. For low demand items, the quantity will be two when the computed quantity equals
one, the unit cost is $25 or less, the unit of issue is each, and MRA does not apply.
5.67.2.12.3. Bench stock levels of one will be limited to MRA or low demand items with a unit
cost over $25, or the unit of issue is other than each.
5.67.2.13. Builds sort records for each changed detail, based upon the option taken in the report
select image.
5.67.2.14. Updates the master bench stock detail automatically with the recommended change
quantity if requested in the report select image.
5.67.2.15. Sorts the selected records by type action (recommended changes, recommended
deletes, recommended adds and EOQ deletes), organization/shop and stock number. If the
optional sort option is requested in the report select image, the item number is sorted in place of
the stock number.
5.67.2.16. Totals for dollar value and line items are provided in the Recommended Addition
Listing for budget codes 9 and others as well as an overall total as provided in the Recommended
Addition Listing. Totals are printed on change of organization/shop code.

additions. Master bench stock record delete (2BS) images for recommended deletes are also
produced if requested in the report select image.
5.67.2.18. Creates a part 5 when any bench stock detail exceeds the locally determined bench
stock threshold. The FOR input loads, changes or deletes the locally determined bench stock
dollar threshold on the 518 record. The 2BS input checks the 518-Expansion field when loading
or changing a Master Bench Stock detail 217).

EOQ detail records are in the computer, their cumulative recurring demands are added to the
input. The EOQ consumption detail records will then be deleted.
2. Master bench stock detail cannot be loaded to adjunct stock numbers (dash numbers other
than -1 numbers).
3. Enter applicable system designator.
4. Enter authorized bench stock quantity. This field must be numeric greater than zero. (This is
the quantity that will be used by the 1BS input as the quantity of issue.) Do not decrease
authorizations to generate multiple issues.
5. Enter the three-digit numeric organization code of the customer (see AFH 123-23, Vol 1, Ch
2). If a consolidated organization code is loaded on the OCCR for the input organization, the
retail supply system will alter the input organization code.
6. Enter two-position alpha/numeric shop code of the customer (see AFH 123-23, Vol 1, Ch 2).
7. Enter four zeros. If an EOQ consumption detail record is in the database with the same

AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        219

system. Otherwise the current Julian date will be assigned.
8. Enter an unused item number. (Field is edited for numeric greater than zero). An item
number beginning with 0001 for each shop code will be assigned externally for all items as they
are established. When an item is deleted from bench stock, the appropriate Organization Bench
Stock Listing will be adjusted accordingly. When an item is added to an established bench stock,
the Organization Bench Stock Listing will be checked, and the first sequential item number will
be used whenever possible.
9. Enter storage location or leave blank. This entry shows the actual storage location of the item
in the bench stock area and is not edited for any particular format. This field may identify any
location system desired. For example, A10 could refer to level A in the horizontal bin row and
10 in vertical bin row. A maximum of six positions will be printed on the BSU output.
10. Enter cost data or work order number in the format outlined below if the type organization
code is A, B, D, or V; otherwise leave blank.

Table 5.127. Input Based on Organization Type.

                                        under the OLVIMS

11. Enter the applicable code. Authorized entries are 1, 2, 3, 4, A, B, C, D, or blank. If blank,
an EOQ consumption detail with at least three demands must be on file with the input
organizational shop code.
12. Enter MRA/MAQ quantities or leave blank. Edits are as follows:
a. If position 51 is C or D, positions 52-54 must be blank (when MRA is assigned, the current
detail record MRA/MAQ quantity will be blanked under by the retail supply system).
b. If position 51 is 1, 3, or A, positions 52-54 must be numeric greater than zero (the master
bench stock detail record MRA/MAQ quantity must be equal to or less than the detail authorized
quantity).
c. If position 51 is 2, 4, or B, positions 52-54 must be numeric greater than zero (the master
bench stock detail record MRA/MAQ quantity must be equal to or greater than the detail
authorized quantity).
13. Normally blank on new loads. If left blank, the current Julian date will be assigned. If not
blank, a valid Julian date must be entered.
14. Enter I for automatic interface, O to override the dollar threshold, B to do both, or blank to
ignore.
15. Must be 5 or blank. TEX code 5 is used to override reasonable quantity and extended cost
edits.
16. If the type organization code which appears in the OCCR is equal to G, I, V, 7, 8, or 9, then
a valid SRD contained in the standard equate designator record must be entered in this field. If

system designator/type account code.
5.70.2.1.4. After the provisions are completed for all system designators/type account codes, the
adjustment records are re-read. A sort file is built for adjustments containing a controlled item
code other than U or blank. Suspected theft item records transaction exception code (TEX) S are
sorted and printed regardless of the controlled item code assigned. Adjustment records are
blanked at this time. Adjustment records are sorted in system designator, type account code (B/E
consolidated), controlled item code group, and stock number sequence. The Controlled Item
Inventory Adjustment List is then produced. No serial numbers are involved in this part of the
report.
5.70.2.1.5. The final phase of the report edits the date of inventory in the sample inventory
accuracy suspense records. If a sample inventory is in progress with a date of inventory over 30
days, a message is printed on the console typeout indicating the number of inventories in
progress. No serial numbers are involved in this part of the report.
Note: Sample inventory messages are printed only at the host base. Satellites are forwarded a
copy of this page, if applicable, or advised of the condition as locally determined.
5.70.2.2. Stratifies IEX E and K adjustments within the applicable certifying/approving official.
For SPRAM adjustments, stratification is by type SPRAM flag within the applicable
certifying/approval official.
5.70.2.3. Adds automatic adjustments (errors less than $100) to the total errors when computing
the pass/fail criteria for sample inventory. The total errors and the total allowed are then
compared to determine the pass/fail for the sample inventory.
5.70.3. Special Instructions.
5.70.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Both (end-of-month option: primary). If an R12 must be
processed during EOM processing, it must be processed after the M10 end-of-month option.
R12s processed before the M10 end-of-month option will cause a discrepancy between M10 and
M32 inventory accuracy data.

5.71.1. Purpose.
5.71.1.1. Summary End-of-Period Report: Information in this report is used by the SMAS to
update statistical general ledger accounts which reflect the status of customer requirements.
5.71.1.2. Detail Periodic Report: Images from this report are used by Accounting and Finance
personnel to validate general ledger updates in SMAS and to research causes of any out-of-
balance condition that exists between SMAS and the SBSS.
5.71.2. Program Logic.
5.71.2.1. Detail Periodic Report:
5.71.2.1.1. Reads and edits the program select image. Records are selected based on the
program select options. There are three options that may be used when an out-of-balance
condition exists between SMAS and the SBSS. They are the SRAN select option, budget code
select option, and the stock number select option. These options limit the amount of records
selected, thus providing a smaller amount of records to research. The SRAN select option may
be processed with up to five SRANs. The budget code select option provides the capability to
select by a single budget code. Budget code selection is limited to budget codes 8, or 9 only.
The stock number select option provides the capability to select records for a single item record.
These options may only be processed with the as-required option (an R in position 25) of the
report select format.
5.71.2.1.2. Scans the due-out detail records selecting details with item record budget code 8, or
9, organization code greater than 99, activity code not equal to U or M, 205-TEX not equal to R,
and the second position of the due-out document number must be numeric. Due-out details are
excluded if the item record routing identifier (RID) is JBD or JBE and not linked to a due-in or if
the due-out detail is linked to a due-in with RID JBD or JBE. Due-out details with a blank fiscal
year of obligation are selected for the unobligated/not requisitioned category and do not need to
use the prioritizing/matching process to be selected for the proper category. All other due-outs
use the prioritizing/matching process logic. After this process is complete, due-out details are
selected for one of three categories. The criteria for each category is as follows:
5.71.2.1.2.1. UNOBLIGATED/NOT REQUISITIONED (requirement status A, GLA 911):
Due-out details are selected for this category if the fiscal year of obligation is equal to spaces.
Computes the extended cost by multiplying the due-out quantity times the due-out unit price.
5.71.2.1.2.2. REQUISITIONED/NOT RECEIVED (requirement status B, GLA 91003): Due-
out details are selected for this category if the fiscal year of obligation is numeric and the due-out
requirement was filled by a nonlocal purchase due-in or a local purchase due-in that was linked
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        225

to a local purchase status detail during the prioritizing/matching process. Computes the extended
cost by multiplying the quantity filled times the due-out unit price.
5.71.2.1.2.3. REQUISTIONED/NOT CONTRACTED (requirement status C, GLA 91002):
Due-out details are selected for this category if the fiscal year of obligation is numeric and the
due-out requirement was filled by a local purchase due-in during the prioritizing/matching
process. The due-in must not be linked to a corresponding local purchase status detail.
Computes the extended cost by multiplying the quantity filled times the due-out unit price.
5.71.2.1.2.4. OBLIGATED/NOT REQUISITIONED (requirement status D, GLA 91001): Due-
out details are selected for this category if the fiscal year of obligation is numeric and the
requirement did not get filled during the prioritizing/matching process. Computes the extended
cost by multiplying the due-out quantity times the due-out unit price.
5.71.2.1.3. Prioritizing/Matching Process: The due-out detail data are written to an (ISAM) file
if the fiscal year of obligation is numeric. The ISAM file allows the program to simulate due-out
release (DOR) criteria. Due-outs are prioritized using the urgency justification code (UJC),
fiscal year of obligation, and document date. The due-in details are read and details with item
record budget code 8 or 9 are selected one at a time to fill due-out requirements in priority
sequence. The exception to this is if the due-in is linked to a local purchase due-out, the due-out
is filled using the linked due-in only.
5.71.2.1.4. Creates a SIFS and data file . This file contains a periodic report control image
followed by periodic detail report (2RO) images. A minimum of one 2RO image is created for
each due-out detail selected. Multiple 2RO images are created if more than one due-in is used to
fill a due-out requirement. The formula used to compute the extended cost field of the 2RO
image is explained under each category/requirement status code.
5.71.2.2. Summary End-of Period Report: For due-outs where the type organization code on the
OCCR equals 3, the M11 shall be modified to summarize 2RO images by category/requirement
status code, routing identifier, manager designator code, SRAN, fund code, sales code, and type
organization code. Dollar totals are summarized and a new 1RO image is created when a change
occurs in the above listed fields. For due-outs where the type organization code on the OCCR
does not equal 3, the M11 shall be modified to summarize 2RO images from the Detail Periodic
Report by category/requirement status code, routing identifier, manager designator code, SRAN,
fund code, and sales code. A SIFS file or flat file (if requested in the program select image) is
created containing a summary end-of-period control image followed by summary end-of-period
(1RO) images. Dollar totals are summarized, and a new 1RO image is created when a change
occurs in any of the fields mentioned above.

5.72. A&F End-Of-Day, End-Of-Month Punch-out (M12/NGV982).
5.72.1. Purpose. Program M12/NGV982 provides monthly interface transactions for updating
stock fund and general fund ledger records in the Standard Materiel Accounting System (BJ) and
the General Accounting and Finance System (BQ). It also produces summary images, monthly
control images, and prints control listings.
5.72.2. Program Logic. The Computer Operations personnel in LRS/Materiel Management
Activity run the M12 by processing report select transaction RPTM12 (Table 5.137.). The
program does the following:
5.72.2.1. Reads the 307 records which have been previously updated by program M01/NGV972:
5.72.2.2. Prints four types of listings and creates six types of interface transactions.
5.72.2.3. Moves the current period dollar values in the A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR (307) records
to the prior period field. Moves zeros to the current period field of the A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR
(307) records.
5.72.2.4. Reads the A-F-SCRATCH-PAD (331) record. Extracts the DB* and SZ* transaction
counts and then zeros these fields in the record.
5.72.2.5. Updates the A-F-SEQUENCE-CONTROL (309) record for the 309-982-M12-DATE
field.
5.72.3. Special Instructions.
5.72.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary.
5.72.3.2. Satellite: Output is not produced at the satellite.
5.72.4. Frequency. Program M12/NGV982 is a mandatory end-of-month program.
5.72.5. Input. M12/NGV982 reads the following records which have been previously updated
by program M01/NGV972: A-F-GEN-LEDGER-ZTR (307) record
5.72.6. Output. Program M12/NGV982 produces a file of GLA (ZTR) images that interfaces
with SMAS (Standard Materiel Accounting System) to update ACCOUNTS Payable information
from the SBSS. Program also produces a listing of these GLA images.
5.72.6.1. Output Transactions:
5.72.6.1.1. Stock Fund General Ledger Summary (GLA) Transactions. These transactions are
produced for every total line on the Current Month Stock Funds General Ledger Summary.
Transactions can be related to the specific listing by source identification code ZTR.
5.72.6.1.2. Stock Fund General Ledger Monthly Control (GL*) Transactions. These
transactions (Table 5.139.) are produced showing the SGLA transaction count for source
identification code ZTR.
5.72.6.1.3. Materiel Reimbursable Sales and Creditable Sales Return Monthly Control (SZ*)
Transaction. This transaction (Table 5.140.) reflects the monthly transaction count of SZS and
SZR transactions previously produced by program D12/NGV982.
5.72.6.1.4. Stock Fund Detail Billing Monthly Control (DB*) Transaction. This transaction
(Table 5.141.) reflects the monthly transaction count of DB1, DB2, DB3, DB4, DB5, and DB6
transactions previously produced by program D12/NGV982.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                       231

5.72.6.1.5. Files GV982UD892 and GV982UD893 both have an ICL (Interface Control Ledger)
text trailer record at the end. This is used by the ICL system to send the file through ADRSS to
its destination. It is not used as an actual transaction by the receiving ADS.
5.72.6.1.6. Files GV982UD892 and GV982UD893 are data files with exactly one file cycle.
The M12 creates backup files for them. These backup files are cycled (+1), have identical ICL
trailers as the primary files, and are also under the same qualifier (0GV0XXXXSRAN). They
will be used to re-create the primary files if there is a system problem while ADRSS or ICL
moves the primary files to the receiving ADS. They are named as follows:

Table 5.137. M12 Backup Files.
Primary Filename         ICL Backup Filename
GV982UD893               GV982UD876

Note: When the program is run, the primary output files must have been already moved to the
receiving ADS and deleted. If any of the primary output files still exist on the system at run
time, it will cause an error condition will occur.

5.72.6.2. Printed Reports:
5.72.6.2.1. Current Month (ZTR) Stock Fund General Ledger Summary. This product (Table
5.139.) lists the GLA (ZTR) transactions in general ledger account code sequence. The minus (-)
sign beside a dollar amount indicates an abnormal balance or update for that particular account.
For example, SGLA 93101001 is a normal debit balance account, a minus (-) sign beside the
dollar amount indicates the reverse, and the SGLA image will debit SGLA 57604002 and credit
SGLA 93101001.
5.72.7. Print Product Usage.
5.72.7.1. Current Month (ZGL/ZBL/ZTR) Stock Fund General Ledger Summary. This list
serves as a record of output transactions for interface to the Standard Materiel Accounting
System (BJ). The Business Funds Branch uses these lists to re-create SGLA (ZGL/ZBL/ZTR)
and GL* transactions that were if lost or damaged.
5.72.7.2. Stock Fund General Ledger Summary (GLA) and Monthly Control (GL*)
Transactions. These transactions are output to file 0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD893. The
Supply System Interface System (SIFS) passes this data file to ADRSS for automated interface
of transactions into the Standard Materiel Accounting System (SMAS).
5.72.7.3. Output Products Disposition. See disposition instructions in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for
the output products are stated in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.
5.72.7.4. Output Transaction Interface Through SIFS and ADRSS. The materiel accounting
SMA personnel need to coordinate with the SIFS and ADRSS monitors when to updating
SIFS/ADRSS tables with the following required information.
5.72.7.4.1. Stock Fund General Ledger Summary (GLA) and Monthly Control (GL*)
Transactions. These transactions are output to data file 0GV0XXXXSRAN*GV982UD893. for
interface with SMAS (BJ). See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M, for SIFS/ADRSS interface information.
5.72.7.5. Interface Control Ledger (ICL) Trailer Record. The ICLTEXTR record will be used
by the receiving ADS application program to trigger a separate transaction to ICL. The
ICLTEXTR will be included as the last record for each file created.
5.72.8. Distribution. The DFAS field site Business Funds Branch receives two copies of the
above M12 listings.

5.73.8.1. Original: Forward a copy to Document Control (keep for 1 year), LGLOC, and
Customer Support Liaison Element (LGRMC)
5.74. Consolidated Transaction Register (RPTM19/NGV777).
5.74.1. Purpose. To provide a program which produces a consolidated register of transaction
histories for the period indicated in the heading. The primary purpose of the register is to replace
the daily transaction registers for the period included in the consolidated register. This register,
hard copy, then becomes an auditable document. The other use of the register is as a history of
transactions for research purposes.
5.74.2. Program Logic.
5.74.2.1. Reads and edits the parameter input to ensure the data in the parameter input are valid
and certain constants of data are saved for header line and message notice printout. If the
parameter input contains invalid data, a R027 reject notice is printed.
5.74.2.2. Reads the transactions on programs NGV793 and NGV041 output tape(s) into the
work file until the end-of-tape is encountered. Upon completion of the tape input, all data are
processed from the work area, and printed output is provided in the transaction register format.
5.74.2.3. Prints only TOTAL TRANSACTIONS THIS ACCOUNT CODE (B/E totals are
consolidated) when the account code changes or when end-of-job is reached. Also prints
TOTAL TRANSACTION THIS PERIOD at end-of-job.
5.74.2.4. Produces rejects/management notices R027, R034, 503, 798, and 799.

5.75. Stock Fund Stratification Program (M20/NGV827).
5.75.1. Purpose.
5.75.1.1. To produce a list that categorizes by their purpose all SMAG items that are held in
stock. This information is needed to budget and manage activity levels, which are determined by
the retention of local excess.
5.75.1.2. To provide a gross measurement of a base's logistics requirements at a point in time by
measuring asset availability against known requirements.
5.75.1.3. To provide a capability for compatible reporting of SMAG assets and transactions as a
basis for preparation of realistic SMAG operating programs. The data provided by this report
may be used by managers at all levels to monitor the current fiscal position for the Air Force
SMAG.
5.75.2. Program Logic.
5.75.2.1. After the select input edit is completed, item records are read, sort keys are built and
then written to the sort file. A sort key is built for local unit of issue items (-1) with a unit price
greater than the basic.
5.75.2.2. As sorted records are read, the corresponding item, repair cycle, detail, and support
records are read. These records are used to establish a separate total record for each materiel
category/source of supply code, for budget code 9 on system designators 01 and A1-9. If the
daily demand rate of items with supplemental adjunct records (-9) is greater than 9999.9999,
then five whole/three decimal positions are used.
5.75.2.3. When all sorted records have been processed, the total records are read and printed
(see Para. 5.74. follows:
5.75.2.3.1. Total records are printed for host account (system designator 01) with consolidated
totals for each budget code. A Resource Management System (RMS) output file is not produced.
5.75.2.3.2. All satellite total records are printed in sequence. If the satellite is operating as a
separate entity (the Supply and Equipment (B&E) account autonomy flag contains a Y in the
A&F variable data record), the total records are printed and an RMS output file is produced. If
the satellite is not operated as a separate entity (the B&E account autonomy flag contains an N in
the A&F variable data record), the total records are obtained and added to the host total records.
An RMS output file is not produced.
5.75.2.3.3. When all satellite accounts have been processed, a consolidated report is printed for
the host account and all satellite accounts that did not have separate financial records. An RMS
output file is produced for consolidated totals.
5.75.2.3.4. If requested, inquiry images are sent to the pseudo queue or flat file for external
review. These inquiry images are for base use only. Inquiries may be produced for excesses
and/or stock due-out deficits. For excesses, the dollar value used is the total of the serviceable,
unserviceable, DIFM, and due-in (whole dollars). Field size limitation will allow up to
$99,999.99. For stock due-out, an INQ TRIC is produced if a deficit value other than zero is
computed for line 4.A.1, column C6.
5.75.2.3.5. This program stratifies issue exception code (IEX) K the same as IEX 3, and IEX E
the same as IEX 6.

5.75.2.3.6. Memo due-outs with transaction exception code (TEX) H for supplies
(expendability, recoverability, reparability cost designator (ERRCD) XB- and XF-) will not be
stratified during requirement stratification.
5.75.2.3.7. In addition to overall listings produced for each system designator, budget code, and
source category, a separate equipment summary list and RMS images are produced for each
autonomous system designator and consolidated listing.
5.75.3. Special Instructions.
5.75.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program M20/NGV827 is a mandatory monthly report and must
be processed on the secondary database.

5.75.8. Distribution Instructions. Send copies 1 and 2 to Materiel Management Flight.
5.76. Redistribution Order (RDO Metrics) (M22/NGV885).
5.76.1. Purpose. To compute the total number of RDOs received, reverse-posted, denied,
partially denied, shipped, partially shipped, and in suspense. Also provides averages for the
number of days it took to ship the asset off-base, the number of days in the LRS/Transportation
Activity, and the number of days in the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Totals will be
computed for a 30-day period or based on the number of days requested in the program select
image.
5.76.2. Program Logic.
5.76.2.1. The program scans the CTH area (704). Program selects TRICS A2(x) and A4(x)
where the 704-ORIG-TRIC is not equal to an A0(x) TIN or REC and the 704-TRANSACTION-
DATE is within 30 days of the 002-JULIAN-DATE. If RDO totals are to be computed for more
than 30 days the beginning/ending dates are specified in the program select image. Once
selected, totals are accumulated for distribution code 1, distribution code 2, distribution code 3,
“F” series Routing Identifiers (RID), all others, and a totals page in the following categories.
Note: The distribution code is stored in the first position of the 704-MARK-FOR field. When
computing Total Number of RDO’s in Suspense the program will scan the 220 details rather than
the 704 CTH area.
5.76.2.1.1. Compute Total Number of RDO(s) Received (TTPC(s): 1A, 1C, 1E, 3S, 1G, 1I, 3P,
and 5J). Break totals out by ERRCD: (XB, XF, XD, ND, and NF).
5.76.2.1.2. Compute Total Number of RDO(s) Reverse-posted.(TTPC(s): AA, AC, AE, CS,
AG, and AI).
5.76.2.1.3. Compute Total Number of RDO(s) Denied (TTPC: 5J).
5.76.2.1.4. Compute Total Number of RDO(s) Partially Denied (TTPC: 5I).
5.76.2.1.4.1. Break out the Total Number of RDO’s Denied and Partially Denied for TTPC 5J
and 5I by denial code 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, A, C, D, E, F, G, J, L, T, I, W, X, or other. The denial code is
located in the 704-REASON-WHY-CODE field on the consolidated transaction history area
record.
Note: The glossary gives a brief explanation of each denial code.
5.76.2.1.5. Compute Total Number of RDO’s Shipped (TTPC(s): 1A, 1C, 1E, 3S, 1G, and 1I).
5.76.2.1.6. Compute Total Number of RDO’s Partially Shipped (TTPC: 3P).
5.76.2.1.7. Compute Total Number of RDO’s in Suspense.
Note: All 220 document numbers and reject numbers(first 4 positions of the 220-FILLER-1
field) are printed for distribution code 1 (A2x TRIC with an “H” series RID), distribution code 2
(A4x TRIC with an “S” series RID), “F” series RID (A2x or A4x TRIC with an “F” series RID),
250                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

or all others (A2x or A4x TRIC). All 220 document numbers will be printed regardless of the
date criteria.
5.76.2.2. Program will also scan the Shipment Suspense detail(224) and Shipped Not Credited
detail(215) to compute the following totals: Average Number of Days to Ship Asset Off Base,
Average Number of Days in Transportation, and Average Number of Days in Supply. Program
selects 215/224-ORIGINAL-TRIC A2(x) and A4(x) when the date shipped is within 30 days of
the 002-JULIAN-DATE. If RDO totals are to be computed for more than 30 days, the
beginning/ending dates are specified in the program select image.
5.76.2.2.1. Subtract the RDO processing date, located in position 4-8 of the 215-TRANS-
DATE/224-TRANS-DATA, from the date shipped for each record selected. Sum up the results
and divide the total difference by the total number of 215/224 details where the date shipped is
not equal to spaces and is within 30 days of the 002-JULIAN-DATE to compute the Average
Number of Days to Ship Asset Off Base. If RDO totals are to be computed for more than 30
days the beginning/ending dates will be specified in the program select image. Break totals out
by number of days using ranges 0-2, 3-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-30, and > 30, and within priority group
using 1, 2, or 3. Priority group 1 is for those items with a priority code from 1-3, priority group 2
is for those items with a priority code from 4-8 and priority group 3 is for those items with a
priority code from 9-15.
5.76.2.2.2. Select Shipment Suspense details and Shipped Not Credited details where the date
shipped is not equal to spaces and within 30 days of the 002-JULIAN-DATE. If RDO totals are
to be computed for more than 30 days the beginning/ending dates will be specified in the
program select image. Subtract the in checker date from the date shipped, sum up the results,
and divide the total difference by the total number of 215/224 details to compute the Average
Number of Days in Transportation. Break totals out by the number of days using the same range
as paragraph above.
5.76.2.2.3. Select Shipment Suspense details and Shipped Not Credited details where the date
shipped is not equal to spaces and within 30 days of the 002-JULIAN-DATE. If RDO totals are
to be computed for more than 30 days the beginning/ending dates will be specified in the
program select image. Subtract the 215-TRANS-DATE/224-TRANS-DATA (located in position
4-8) from the in checker date, sum up the results, and divide the total difference by the total
number of 215/224 details to compute the Average Number of Days in Supply. Break totals out
by the number of days using the same range as paragraph above.

5.77. Organization Effectiveness Report (M24/NGV863).
5.77.1. Purpose.
5.77.1.1. To produce the organization effectiveness report, and print indicative data from the
organization records as required. The supply effectiveness option provides management with a
means to monitor the issue and bench stock support effectiveness for each organization
supported.
5.77.1.2. To produce the Delivery Destination Record Review List. The Records Maintenance
Section uses this list when reviewing and validating all delivery destination records loaded on the
SBSS database.
Note: AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity can use a locally developed Script for this
review.
5.77.2. Program Logic.
5.77.2.1. Program M24/NGV863 reads the program select card and produces the following
listings based upon the selected options.
5.77.2.1.1. EOM option, a dash (-) in position 65, zeros the counters on the organization record
and updates the Base Supply Management Data Record. This option will automatically produce
the Supply Effectiveness Report.
5.77.2.1.2. MRSP/IRSP option, a dash (-) in position 66, produces a list of all MRSP/IRSP
Serial Number (024) and MRSP/IRSP Control (025) records. This listing is sorted in 024 serial
number/025 org code sequence.
5.77.2.1.3. Supply effectiveness option, a dash (-) in position 67, produces a list for supply
effectiveness. Supply effectiveness includes issue/support effectiveness, bench stock/support
252                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

effectiveness and bench stock/support effectiveness/less items with minimum reserve
authorization (MRA) 1 or A. A Zero Totals list will be produced for organization codes where
the 518-ISSUES, 518-DUO, 518-DOR-ON-TIME, 518-DOR-DELAYED, 518-DUO-NOT-
AUTHRIZD-STOCK, 518-DUO-CANCELED, and 518-BENCH-STOCK-LI-ATHRIZD equal
zero; otherwise, issue/support effectiveness will be computed and printed.
5.77.2.1.3.1. Issue/support effectiveness is computed using accumulators stored on the
organization record by report D04/NGV804. Issue effectiveness is divided into three categories
and computed as follows:
5.77.2.1.3.1.1. Issue effectiveness:
518-ISSUES/(518-ISSUES + 518-DUO)
5.77.2.1.3.1.2. Customer support effectiveness:
518-DOR-ON-TIME/(518-DOR-ON-TIME + 518-DOR-DELAYED)
5.77.2.1.3.1.3. Stockage effectiveness:
518-ISSUES/(518-ISSUES + 518-DUO - 518-DUO-NOT-AUTHRIZD-STOCK)
5.77.2.1.3.2. The information needed to compute bench stock effectiveness is obtained by
scanning the detail record area and selecting all bench stock due-out details and master bench
stock details. Bench stock effectiveness is computed as follows:
5.77.2.1.3.2.1. Bench stock backorder rate is computed by dividing due-outs by line items
authorized bench stock.
5.77.2.1.3.2.2. Delayed due-out rate is computed by dividing delayed due-outs by total line
items due-out.
5.77.2.1.4. Delivery destination option, a dash (-) in position 68, produces a list of all delivery
destination records in org/shop sequence. This option will create and load TRIC code 1DE
inputs to the pseudo reader to delete delivery destination records with a date of last transaction
greater than 365 days. A separate list will be output to show the deleted records.
5.77.2.1.5. Indicative data option (org sequence), a dash (-) in position 69 produces the
indicative data list in org sequence. A separate listing is produced for organization codes 001-
099 for system designator 01 only. A listing is also produced for org codes 100-999 for system
designators 01 and A1-9. The satellite indicative data listing is output to the applicable satellite.
This portion may be eliminated by entering a dash (-) in position 71 of the select image.
5.77.2.1.6. Satellite bypass option, a dash (-) in position 71 will exclude the satellite indicative
data list. This option may be used only with the indicative data option, a dash (-) in position 69.
5.77.2.1.7. Indicative data option (organization identification sequence), a dash (-) in position
72. This option will produce an indicative data listing in organization identification sequence
regardless of system designator.
5.77.2.1.8. Indicative data option (MAJCOM sequence), a dash (-) in position 73. This option
will produce an indicative data listing in MAJCOM/org sequence regardless of system
designator.
5.77.3. Special Instructions. This program must be processed with a dash (-) in position 65 of
the select input during end-of-month processing to blank the counters on the organization record
and update the Management Data Records.
5.77.3.1. Primary/Secondary. Program M24/NGV863 is a mandatory monthly report and must

5.78. Monthly Base Supply Management Report M32/NGV808.
5.78.1. Purpose.
5.78.1.1. To provide a standard, comprehensive, and detailed management product to serve the
needs of all SBSS managers for all accounts, both host and satellite.
5.78.1.2. To provide data for analysis of the SBSS overall operational effectiveness, potential
problem area detection, and statistical data in support of system modifications/refinements.
5.78.1.3. To provide the selective inquiry of management data categories. The selective inquiry
capability allows managers at all levels to selectively analyze potential problem areas and gather
statistical data in support of system requirements.
5.78.1.4. To provide the reporting media for the Base Supply Management Data to the
Consolidated Management Data Bank (MDB), Air Force Management Data Bank, and the Major
Command Supply Management Data Bank System.
5.78.1.5. To update the monthly and cumulative inventory accuracy stratification records.
5.78.2. Program Logic. Program M32/NGV808 functions as specified below:
5.78.2.1. Specific categories of the M32 may be inquired or all categories may be inquired.
Enter a dash (-) in positions 35-56 of the correspondence category desired (see page 404). When
positions 65-67 are blank the selected categories of data for all system designators (01, A1-9)
contained on the 001/base constants record will be printed. If a specific system designator is in
positions 65-66, then selected categories for that system designator are printed.
5.78.2.2. To process the End-of-Month option, enter a dash (-) in position 67 of the report select
image. This stand-alone option will accomplish the following.
5.78.2.2.1. Reads the 500 series inventory accuracy records and subtracts the 624/fiscal year
inventory accuracy stratification data record (this contains prior months, inventory totals).
Writes the difference to the 623/Monthly Inventory Accuracy Stratification data record. Then, it
writes the 500 series inventory accuracy information to the 624/fiscal year inventory accuracy
data record so the monthly totals can be accumulated during the next end-of-month.
5.78.2.2.2. Creates a Base Supply Management Data Report (XVX) file. File identification
equals (g)GV0<ALN>*GV808UD801. where g equals gang number. (If 001-SATELLITE-
REHOMED-LOSS = 1 (REHOME FLG) XVX images for that system designator are bypassed).
5.78.2.2.3. Blanks/zeros all M32 records monthly, except as indicated.
5.78.2.2.4. Prints an index page.
5.78.2.3. When program NGV807, Daily Base Supply Management Report (D14), is processed,
it calls NGV808 to print the selected daily management data.
5.78.3. Special Instructions.
5.78.3.1. Primary/Secondary. Process on secondary database. Process all end-of-month
programs which update the M32 before processing the M32 end-of-month option (a dash in
position 67 of select format).

5.78.3.2. Restart Procedures. See Para. 5.28.
5.78.3.3. Satellite.
5.78.3.3.1. If system designators A1 through A9 are authorized an output function, output is
directed automatically to the remote location.
5.78.3.3.2. If the output function is inoperative, the output will be produced at the computer
support base.
5.78.3.3.3. Satellite B-series and C-series system designators are accumulated in the host
account (system designator 01) totals.
5.78.3.4. Host account will coordinate with the Data Processing Center to ensure the
management data was successfully transmitted to Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex.

budget code of 8. These transactions are included within each ALC.
5.78.10.5. Computations:
5.78.10.5.1. Line Items Requested. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with the
following exceptions: Issues initially processed with TEX code M are not counted; partial issues
(TTPC 3P) resulting in more than one transaction are counted as one request; and a reinput of
previously killed request that results in a backorder (TTPC 2D or 4W) is not counted. Line Item
Requested may be greater or less than the sum of Line Items Issued plus Line Items Backordered
due to an item being killed (TTPC 3O) and not backordered or an item being backordered on a
new transaction date.
5.78.10.5.2. Units Requested. Same as line items requested except the quantity is added to the
accumulator. If there is more than one transaction (TTPC 3P and 2D) against the same
document number, the quantity for both are counted (see note).

5.78.10.5.3. Line Items Issued. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with type transaction
phrase code (TTPC) equal to 1A, 1C, 1E, 1G, 1I, 1O, 1Q, 2I, 2K, 3P, 3Q, 5A, 5C, 5E, 5G, 6C,
6E, 6J, 6L, 6N, 6P, 6R, or 6T. If the TTPC = '3P' and the document number are equal to the
previous transaction, totals are not updated (see note).
5.78.10.5.4. Units Issued. Same as line items issued except that the action quantity is added to
the accumulator, including all transactions with TTPC 3P (see note).
5.78.10.5.5. Line Items Backordered. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with TTPC
code 2D and 4W.
5.78.10.5.6. Units Backordered. Same as line items backordered except that the action quantity
is added to the accumulator.
5.78.10.5.7. Issue Effectiveness (Line Items). Percentages are computed by dividing line items
issued plus (+) line items backordered into line items issued.
5.78.10.5.8. Issue Effectiveness (Units). Same as issue effectiveness (line items) except that
unit totals are used for the computation.
5.78.10.5.9. Line Items Backordered 4W. Totals are accumulated for all transactions with
TTPC 4W.
5.78.10.5.10. Units Backordered 4W. Same as line items backordered 4W except that the action
quantity is added to the accumulator.
5.78.10.5.11. Stockage Effectiveness (Line Items). Percentages are computed by dividing line
items issued plus (+) line items backordered minus (-) line items backordered 4W into line items
issued.
5.78.10.5.12. Stockage Effectiveness (Units). Same as stockage effectiveness (line items)
except that the action quantity is used for computation.
Note: Examples of a partial issue/backorder: A transaction for a quantity of 20 is requested.
Ten will issue under one stock number and 10 will issue under a substitute or will be
backordered. Two transactions are created with the same document number. This will result in
adding 1 to line items requested and adding 20 to units requested. The result will be the same for
line items/units issued and backordered. This will also result in issues plus (+) backorders not
being equal to request. However, it will not affect issue or stockage effectiveness.
5.78.11. Gross and Net Availability. Transaction history records are selected by the Daily Base
Supply Management Report (D14). Totals are accumulated on the 604 record and zeroed
monthly by the M32 end of month option. Totals are stratified within operational and support
organization categories. These categories are further subdivided into repair cycle and economic
order quantity (EOQ).
5.78.11.1. Update Logic: The transactions are selected using the below selection criteria. All
areas can be verified using QLP.

5.78.24.3.11. Item Record with Special Level DOLD > 365: Totals are accumulated for Item
Records with a Special Level Detail Record, except LJC O or T and the Item Record DOLD is
over 365 days old.
5.78.24.3.12. With Special Level Detail Record and Zero Demands (W/SPEC LVL ZERO
DMDS): Totals are accumulated for item records with special level detail record and zero
demands.
5.78.25. Average Inventory Investment. Records are selected by program Q15/NGV881, Stock
Status Scan. Totals are stored on the 618/AVERAGE-INVENTORY-INVESTMENT database
record. The totals are never blanked/zeroed, but are overlaid each time the Q15 is processed.
The Julian date on which the report is processed will be stored on the management control
record.
5.78.25.1. Update Logic: The Q15 scans all item records for type account code B. The
interchangeable and substitute group records, master and interchangeable, are accumulated
together. Substitute item records are treated as single items. The following detail records
quantities are used to compute the extended dollar values.
5.78.25.1.1. Unserviceable detail record (204).
5.78.25.1.2. Supply Point detail record (218).
5.78.25.1.3. DIFM (Firm) detail record (203).
5.78.25.1.4. WRM detail record (240).
5.78.25.1.5. WCDO detail record (241).
5.78.25.1.6. MRSP detail records (233-239).
5.78.25.1.7. MSK detail record (232).
5.78.25.1.8. Due-In detail record (202).
5.78.25.1.9. Due-Out detail record (205).
5.78.25.1.10. Special Level detail record (216).
5.78.25.1.11. SPRAM detail record (225).
5.78.25.2. Categories: Totals are accumulated for repair cycle (XD/XF) and EOQ (XB3).
Totals are stratified within Reason For Stockage Category.
5.78.25.3. Computations:
5.78.25.3.1. Dollar Value of On-Hand Assets: Totals are accumulated by multiplying the Latest
Acquisition Cost (022-LAC) times total assets (serviceable, supply point, firm DIFM, WRM,
WCDO, MRSP, and MSK) and the Carcass cost (022-FILLER-1) times the unserviceable.
Deployed quantities are included.
5.78.25.3.2. Dollar Value of Due-Ins: Totals are accumulated by multiplying the master or item
record unit price times the due-in detail record quantity.
5.78.25.3.3. Dollar Value of Due-Outs: Totals are accumulated by multiplying the detail unit
price times the due-out detail record quantity.
5.78.25.3.4. Dollar Value - Reason for Stockage Category (RSC): The RSC, level and on-hand,
is accumulated based upon the controlling level (demand level or special level); where multiple
special levels exist, values are accumulated for the RSC with the largest quantity. If all RSC
quantities are equal, the order of precedence is SP, SI, SN, NK. The level is computed by
multiplying the controlling level (RO) times the master or single item unit price. The on-hand
dollar values are computed as stated above.
5.78.25.3.4.1. Stocked Demand (SD). The controlling level and on-hand dollar values are
accumulated for Readiness Based (type level F) and demand levels.

5.78.25.3.4.2. Stocked Insurance (SI). The special level quantity dollar value is accumulated for
positive RO items with a (LJC) of 1.
5.78.25.3.4.3. Stocked Numeric (SN). The special level quantity dollar value is accumulated for
positive RO items with a level justification code (LJC) of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, D, E, G, H, K, L,
M, N, P, R, or S.
5.78.25.3.4.4. Stocked Provisioning (SP). The special level quantity dollar value is accumulated
for positive RO items with a level justification code (LJC) of A, C, or T.
5.78.25.3.4.5. Stocked WRM (SW).
5.78.25.3.4.5.1. The WRM/MRSP authorized quantity is considered a level and will always be
accumulated. The special level quantity, for positive RO items with a level justification code of
V, is compared to the demand level and the greater of the two is accumulated.
5.78.25.3.4.5.2. The on-hand dollar values are accumulated for all WRM and MRSP detail
records.
5.78.25.3.4.6. Not Stocked (NS). The on-hand dollar value is accumulated for items that have a
zero requisitioning objective.
5.78.25.3.4.7. Other (NK): The on-hand dollar value is accumulated for items that are not
identifiable to a specific reason for stockage category.
5.78.26. Excess Stratification. This records totals are obtained by the releveling/file-status
program. Totals are added by program NGV807/D14 to this record daily from the 111/online
MGMT record. Totals are blanked quarterly.

which the report is processed will be moved to the Base Supply Management Control Record
each time the Q15 is processed. Data fields are overlaid with new data each time the program is
processed. Totals are accumulated for Supplies/Equipment Item Records. For OCCR records,
the totals will be updated for supplies only. Accumulation of data is self-explanatory.
5.78.29. Item Record Data. Item records are counted and totals are updated and stored on the
ITEM-RECORD-DATA record by program (Q15/NGV881). The Julian date on which the
report is processed will be moved to the Base Supply Management Control Record each time the
Q15 is processed. Data fields are overlaid with new data each time the program is processed.
Totals are accumulated for Supplies/Equipment Item Records. Accumulation of data is self-
explanatory with the exception of the following.
5.78.29.1. Frozen Inv: Freeze code equals C or I.
5.78.29.2. Frozen Other: Freeze code unequal to C or I.

5.78.30. Inventory Accuracy Stratification. The cumulative inventory accuracy records (501,
502, 503, 504) are read and the monthly/FY cumulative (623/624) are computed and stored by
the Monthly Base Supply Management Report (M32/NGV808). During end-of-year processing,
the fiscal and monthly totals are zeroed when the A02 is processed. Inventory accuracy
stratification (fiscal/monthly) totals are computed using the 500-series records as follows.
5.78.30.1. The monthly stratification (623 record) totals are computed by subtracting the
previous month (624 record) fiscal year totals from the present cumulative (500 series) fiscal
year totals. For example, current 501 complete record (EOQ) minus 624 complete (EOQ) would
equal the 623 complete (EOQ).
5.78.30.2. The cumulative (500 series) inventory accuracy records are then moved, to the 624
record. This enables NGV808/M32 to compute the next month's monthly totals.
5.78.30.3. The monthly and fiscal inventory accuracy are then printed from the 623 and 624
record.
5.78.30.4. The fiscal year totals listed by program NGV808/M32 may not match fiscal year
totals listed by program NGV836/M10 due to the following example: Crossover is processed
and the primary records are copied to the secondary database. After an inventory (R12, Q13,..)
is processed on the primary. The number of line items/units frozen and dollar values are added
to the 500-series records. The M10 is processed on the primary database, and the totals from the
inventory are reflected. However, the M32 is processed against the secondary database. The
M32 does not have the information from the inventory which processed on the primary, due to
the inventory being processed after crossover. To eliminate the possibility of confusion, do not
process inventories during end-of month (EOM) or process the inventory after the M10 is
processed.
5.78.30.5. The fiscal year totals listed by program NGV808/M32 may be less than the previous
month's fiscal year totals due to the following: An inventory is processed prior to EOM, and the
500-series records are updated. The EOM M32 is processed, and the listing reflects the totals
from the inventory. A decision is made (sometime after EOM) to back out the inventory, and the
500-series records are reduced. The result is the fiscal year totals are smaller during the next
EOM. However, fiscal totals are still accurate.
5.78.30.6. Percentages are rounded and printed in whole percents. For exact percentages see
report NGV836/M10.
Note: The monthly inventory stratification and fiscal year cumulative stratification will be the
same during EOM October.
5.78.31. Requisition/MOV Summary. Data are read by (M32/NGV808), Monthly Base Supply
Management Report. Current ROUTING IDENTIFIER RECORD (007) is read and totals stored
for print output.
5.78.32. Workload Factors. Transaction History Records are selected by the Daily Base Supply
Management Report (D14/NGV807). Totals are accumulated and stored on the applicable
Management Control Records for each system designator. During end-of-month processing, the
Management Control Records are read and specific occurrences are used to obtain the workload
factors. The Management Control Records are zeroed during End-of-Month processing.
5.78.32.1. Total Transactions: This value is an accumulation of all transactions which meet the
specified criteria outlined in the transaction summary section of the report and matches that total.
5.78.32.2. Printable Transactions: Reflects the same information as above, except printable

5.84. C-Factor Assignment (Q01/NGV873).
5.84.1. Purpose.
5.84.1.1. To provide the assignment of C-Factors greater than 3 as standard deviations for
increased support effectiveness based on HQ USAF approval as directed by the MAJCOM. This
program also provides for the assignment of the standard deviation of one when the increased C-
Factor authorization is withdrawn.
5.84.1.2. To identify the requested records assigned C-Factor.
5.84.1.3. To provide stratification of C-Factor assignment by the source of supply,
expendability, recoverability, reparability cost designator (ERRCD), and overall dollar value of
items assigned a C-Factor which are requested by the budget code of the account.
5.84.2. Program Logic.
5.84.2.1. Reads the select and parameter inputs and builds sort keys for the input standard
reporting designator (SRD). This program also sorts keys and stores sorted SRD keys in a sort
file.
5.84.2.2. Reads the SRD consumption records, and compares the SRD/system designator on this
record against the stored parameter input(s). When a match is found, the SRD consumption
record is written to a work file.
5.84.2.3. Lists item records with a standard deviation of 0, 2, 3, or all if the report select format
contains a 0, 2, 3, or A in position 41. When this option is selected, a parameter input and stop
input are not required because position 43 and 44 are reserved for the system designator
selection. When position 43 and 44 are left blank, the program produces a list of item records
based on the list option for all system designators. The glossary of header terms option is the
only option that will process together with the list option.
5.84.2.4. Edits selected records for assignment of C-Factor requested in the select input as
follows:
5.84.2.4.1. C-Factor of 0 or 1: Selected records are used to locate the item record and a C-
Factor of zero or one is assigned.
5.84.2.4.2. C-Factor of 2 or 3: Selected records are used to locate the item record, and a C-
Factor is assigned as follows:
5.84.2.4.2.1. Initial edits are performed against all items. If an item meets any of the following
conditions, a C-Factor is not assigned:
5.84.2.4.2.1.1. Issue exception code (IEX) 3, 5, 6, E, G, or K.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        321

5.84.2.4.2.1.2. Numeric parts preference code.
5.84.2.4.2.1.3. General Services Administration (GSA) source of supply.
5.84.2.4.2.1.4. Time compliance technical order (TCTO) kits.
5.84.2.4.2.1.5. Local purchase/manufacture (except JZ(x) items).
5.84.2.4.2.1.6. Adjunct records (-1, -2, or -9).
5.84.2.4.2.2. Items which do not meet any of the above criteria are further screened as follow:
5.84.2.4.2.2.1. Remaining XD(x) and XF3 items are selected for C-Factor assignment.
5.84.2.4.2.2.2. An XB3 item is considered if the item is on bench stock, war reserve materiel
(WRM), mobility readiness spares package (MRSP)/in-place readiness spares package
(IRSP)/mission support kit, supply point, mission change data collection, or if the item contains a
materiel management code.
5.84.2.4.2.2.3. XB3 items which meet any of the above criteria are selected for C-Factor
assignment unless they fall into one of the federal stock group (FSG)/federal stock class (FSC)
exclusion numbers: 1800-2200, 3200-3438, 3441-3990, 4400-4600, 5100-5200, 5400-5600,
6310-6330, 6500, 6650, 6710-6730, 6760-7430, 7450-9130, 9160-9310, 9350-9505, 9610-9999.
5.84.2.4.3. A summary listing stratifies selected records by source of supply, ERRCD. The
listing also provides the dollar value totals of demand levels and safety level within budget codes
and overall totals. These totals represent only those items which have a C-Factor unequal to 1
added during this report processing.
5.84.3. Special Instructions. If multiple SRDs employ a single line item, that item record should
be assigned the highest C-Factor authorized for the SRDs involved. When the option to reduce a
C-Factor to 0 or 1 is used (a dash (-) is entered in positions 33 or 34), all item records with the
input SRD are assigned the lowest C-Factor.
CAUTION: Make sure that other higher C-Factor authorizing SRDs do not exist. When higher
C-Factor authorizing SRDs do not exist, program Q01/NGV873 must be reprocessed with the
specific SRD(s) to reinstate the higher C-Factor. That is, leave positions 33, 34 and 68 blank,
and enter a dash (-) in position 67 to assign a C-Factor of 2; or, leave positions 33, 34 and 67
blank, and enter a dash (-) in position 68 to reinstate a C-Factor of 3. All higher C-Factor
authorizing SRDs must be reprocessed in ascending C-Factor sequence.
5.84.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program Q01/NGV873 must be processed on the primary
database except when the list option (0, 2, 3, or A in position 41 of the select format) is
processed. The list option may be processed on the primary or secondary database.

5.86.1.1. To provide the maintenance activities with a product that shows reparable returns with
the action taken codes for each repair cycle item. These data are used to review the base in-
house repair capability program. This list also provides the Record Maintenance with a listing of
repair cycle records; indicative codes are contained in each record for file and records
maintenance.
5.86.1.2. To realign repair cycle and stock control data at the end of each calendar quarter.
5.86.1.3. To complement the DIFM Listing for scheduling of repair cycle assets, determining
base in-house repair capability, and enhancing DIFM control of critical items.
5.86.1.4. To be used by the maintenance scheduler for the movement of DIFM assets. The
number of units repaired, not reparable this station (NRTS), and condemned for the past year,
together with the current quarter turn-ins by maintenance action taken codes, are used to
determine the flow of reparable items. Potential problem areas can be identified based on trends
revealed by this listing.

5.86.1.5. To determine the establishment of the in-house repair capability by the maintenance
action taken code used for each repair cycle item during the past year.
5.86.1.6. To improve DIFM control by screening the stock number against the DIFM list and
against the Repair Cycle Data Listing to determine previous maintenance action taken, and to
schedule repair or evacuation of the asset as required.
5.86.1.7. To be used by Records Maintenance to complete repair cycle record data elements.
The Reparable Processing Center (RPC) is responsible for repair, specialized repair activity, etc.
Materiel Control and Flight Service Center use this report to establish the base repair capability
and to process and schedule DIFM assets.
Note: AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity can use a locally developed Script for this
review.
5.86.1.8. To be used by Stock Control to review repair cycle records that contain exception
repair cycle days.
Note: AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity can use a locally developed Script for this
review.
5.86.2. Program Logic.
5.86.2.1. The program select format is edited for validity and then printed on the remote
processing station (RPS)/main console. Options requested are set internally to edit the input
records. Sort keys are built from the selected repair cycle records and matching item records.
These keys are then used to re-read the repair cycle records. After each repair cycle record is
read, the current quarter net repair cycle days is divided by the current quarter repaired field
(excluding nonrecurring). The result is the average repair cycle days for the current quarter. The
net repair cycle days for all quarters is divided by the repaired field for all quarters (excluding
nonrecurring). The result is the average repair cycle days for all quarters.
5.86.2.2. The program produces a pseudo file containing DZE images to ensure records have the
appropriate RAMPS report code assigned. DZE assigning a code of 6 are prepared for item
records matching the following criteria:
5.86.2.2.1. Type account code is B.
5.86.2.2.2. ERRCD of XD(X).
5.86.2.2.3. RAMPS WRM report code not equal to 6 or 7.
5.86.2.2.4. Fifth position of the stock number is numeric, or
5.86.2.2.5. The fifth and sixth positions equal to NC.
5.86.2.2.6. RID of F(XX).
5.86.2.3. The total number of active records will be printed at the end of the indicative date list.
All other options will print the number of active records and the number of units turned in by
action taken code.
5.86.3. Program Logic Specific.
5.86.3.1. Repair Cycle Data List. This report lists the repair cycle information for each stock
number that has a corresponding 102-REPAIR-CYCLE-RECORD. There are four different
types of this listing available:
5.86.3.1.1. Type 1 produces a listing of all repair cycle records except those records with zeros
in all accumulator fields. This option is the default option of the report. It is produced when the
select card contains RPTQ04 in positions 1-6, and the report title in positions 7-28. All other
positions may be blank.
5.86.3.1.2. Type 2 contains an additional edit to eliminate records with ERRCD XF3. This
listing is produced by adding a dash (-) in position 67 of the program select card.

5.86.3.1.3. Type 3 contains an additional edit to the type 1 program to eliminate records that are
coded NRTS 1 and records that have zeros in the 102-REPR-GENR-NRTS field (all quarters).
This listing is produced by adding a dash (-) in position 69 of the program select card.
5.86.3.1.4. Type 4 combines types 1-3. This listing is produced by adding dashes (-) to
positions 67 and 69 of the program select card.
5.86.3.1.5. The part number print, organization sequence, percent of base repair, average AWP
days, and glossary options can all be used with the repair cycle data list (Types 1-4). Specific
instructions on these options can be found in the notes following the program select card.
5.86.3.2. Indicative Repair Cycle Data List. This report gives the user item record data that does
not appear on the Repair Cycle Data List. This listing is produced by entering a dash (-) in
position 33 of the program select card. Repair cycle records with all zeros in the accumulator
fields are eliminated from this report. The average AWP days, organization/shop code, part
number print, and glossary options can all be used with the Indicative Data List. Specific
instructions on these options can be found in the notes following the program select card.
5.86.3.3. Exception RCR Day List. This report lists all repair cycle records that contain
exception repair cycle days. The only options available with this report are the part number print
option and the glossary option.
5.86.3.4. Quarterly Update Option. The Quarterly Update Option is a mandatory option that
must be processed quarterly on the primary database. This option is produced by entering a dash
(-) in position 34 of the select card. This option provides the Repair Cycle Data List (Type 1)
and the Exception RCR List plus accomplish the following:
5.86.3.4.1. Zeros the 102-NBR-OF-UNITS-TURNED-IN (for all maintenance action codes) on
the repair cycle record.
5.86.3.4.2. Shifts the quarter data (repaired, condemned, NRTS, and repair cycle days) to the
next quarter; that is, third quarter data are moved to fourth quarter, second to third, etc., on the
repair cycle record.
5.86.3.4.3. Zeros all current quarter data on the repair cycle record.
5.86.3.4.4. Updates the stock control data on the repair cycle record. Reparable generations
(excluding nonrecurring) are accumulated from the repair cycle record; these data are then stored
in the test record cumulative recurring demands.
5.86.3.4.5. Updates the DOFD and the DOLD as follows:
5.86.3.4.5.1. If reparable generations equal zero, it blanks the date of first demand.
5.86.3.4.5.2. If reparable generations are greater than zero and DOFD is blank, it updates the
DOFD to equal the first day of the oldest quarter that reflects reparable generations. If the
DOLD is blank, it updates the DOLD to equal the last day of the most recent quarter that reflects
reparable generations.
5.86.3.4.6. Stores the sum of the third and fourth quarters reparable generations (maximum of 9)
in the number of demands second past-six-month-period field.
5.86.3.4.7. Stores the sum of the first and second past quarters reparable generations (maximum
of 9) in the number of demands first past-six-month period field.
5.86.3.4.8. Stores a zero in the number of demands current reporting field.
5.86.3.4.9. If the DOFD is older than 365 days, updates the DOFD to equal the current
requisition original date minus 365 days.
5.86.3.4.9.1. The quarterly option also updates the cumulative demand quantity (CDQ) and the
date of first demand (DOFD) on the item record. If the DOFD is more than 1 year old, it updates
the CDQ and DOFD as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      327

        Old CDQ/(DOFD - Requisition Date) = Daily Demand Rate (DDR)
        New CDQ = DDR X 365
        DOFD = Current Requisition Date Minus 365
When computing the new CDQ if the item record unit price is greater than $750, use rounding
factor of 0.5. If the item record unit price is less than $750, use 0.9.
5.86.3.4.9.2. Stores the 002-CALENDAR-DATE in the 520-QTLY-OPTION-DATE. QLP can
be used to check this date to determine when the last Quarterly Update Option was processed.
5.86.4. Special Instructions.
5.86.4.1. Primary/Secondary:

5.87. Routing Identifier Listing (Q05/NGV871).
5.87.1. Purpose.
5.87.1.1. To provide management data, by priority group, on requisitions submitted, follow-ups
submitted, status received, and depot/base cancellations. To compute new average order and
shipping time (O&ST) days by priority group. To provide an option to update O&ST standard
with the new average O&ST days for each priority group which has 100 or more receipts.
5.87.1.2. To analyze the following:
5.87.1.2.1. The depot response to requisitions submitted by the reporting activity.
5.87.1.2.2. The receipts by days within priority group.
5.87.1.2.3. The effectiveness of the use of the base-initiated cancellation (receipt (REC)
transaction exception code (TEX) E/ZC) program.
5.87.1.2.4. The type depot rejects being received for initiation of required local research and
requisitioning preventive actions.
5.87.1.3. To determine which routing identifier records should be deleted after the end-of-year
processing due to lack of use. See Ch 8.
5.87.2. Program Logic.
5.87.2.1. Reads the routing identifier records and sorts them into routing identifier code
sequence, by system designator and source of supply. Then checks the area code (001-OST-O)
to determine the UMMIPS standard for sources of supply other than DLA and AF wholesale
(RID = F**), Truncation Point (DLA Depots), and Truncation Point for AF wholesale (RID =
F**) for that region. The program computes new average O&ST days priority group and updates
the routing identifier record if the update option is being processed. Also, the priority group 3
average O&ST days for all routing identifiers are stored on the system designator record when
the update option is processed. The program prints a summary line for each routing identifier
code for each system designator. When requested, the program prints data for each routing
identifier code with subtotals for each source of supply and overall totals for each system
designator, or it prints data for selected routing identifier codes. See Para. 5.84. The balance
fields on the routing identifier records are cumulative data for the current fiscal year. For a
detailed explanation of update criteria, see Ch 8. Program will error fin if (001-OST-O) field is
blank for host or satellite account, for which a new O&ST average is being computed.
5.87.2.2. Defines data fields as follows:
5.87.2.2.1. Command Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): This field provides an option to allow
MAJCOMs to override the number of days used to compute EOQ demand levels. See AFMAN
23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure.
5.87.2.2.2. Variance of O&ST: This field is computed for all routing identifiers and placed on
the routing identifier record for use in computing the safety level. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B,
Stockage Procedure.
330                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

5.87.2.2.3. Priority (PRI) Group (GRP) (X) Order and Shipping (O&S) Standard (STND):
These fields are loaded under program control at the time a routing identifier record is
established. These data fields are then used to compute demand levels, and they are updated
quarterly by program Q05/NGV871 with the actual averages computed provided the bypass
update flag is not loaded. Quarterly program NGV871 only computes a new O&ST standard if
the routing identifier record has 100 or more receipts by priority group. This is a cumulative
total and does not zero out until the annual option is processed. If the bypass flag is entered on
the routing identifier record, it will be printed immediately after the applicable PRI GRP 0&S
STND. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure.
5.87.2.2.4. Requisitions submitted: All computer prepared requisitions including special
requisitions.
5.87.2.2.5. Follow-ups submitted (With (W)/Status): All follow-ups submitted against due-ins
that have a status detail.
5.87.2.2.6. Follow-ups submitted (Without (W/O)/Status): All follow-ups submitted against
due-ins that do not have a status detail.
5.87.2.2.7. Order and Shipping Time Days: This field is updated by those receipts which fall
within 175 percent of the Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS)
standard or within the truncation point for DLA depots (S9x or SMS) and AF Wholesale sources
of supply (RID = Fxx), excluding Airlift Investment items (see AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B,
Stockage Procedure).
5.87.2.2.8. New Average O&ST Days: This field is computed by dividing the number of
receipts that were received within 175 percent of the UMMIPS standard or TRUNCATION
POINT (S9x, SMS and Fxx depots) by the O&ST days for the applicable priority group. The
new average O&ST days are loaded as the new O&ST STND when program Q05/NGV871 is
run with the Quarterly Update option, and 100 or more receipts have been processed for the
applicable priority group. The O&ST STND is not updated if the bypass flag is ON. For DLA
depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply, the Q05 will only compute two O&ST STND’s.
One for those receipts with an RDD (PRI GRP 1 & 2 combined) and one for NON-RDD (PRI
GRP 3). The median will be used if it is greater than the standard for DLA depots and AF
Wholesale sources of supply. Definition of the median is: At the end of the fiscal year the
median is computed for DLA depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply; it represents the
middle value of distribution or the 50th percentile of all receipts.
5.87.2.2.9. Frequency of Receipts (By Days): These fields are updated by the number of
receipts by days within priority groups.
5.87.2.2.10. Actual O&ST DAYS: The total requisitioning days for all receipts received
regardless of the standard or truncation point.
5.87.2.2.11. Total Receipts: The total number of receipts received.
5.87.2.2.12. Receipts Within O&ST Standard: The number of receipts received for which the
number of O&ST days were less than or equal to the UMMIPS standard or truncation point for
DLA depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply (excluding Airlift Investment items).
5.87.2.2.13. Receipts Exceeding O&ST Standard: The number of receipts received for which
the number of O&ST days were greater than the standard but by less than 175% of the UMMIPS
standard, or greater than the truncation for DLA depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply
(excluding Airlift Investment items).
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        331

5.87.2.2.14. Receipts Excluded (over 175 percent of standard): The number of receipts received
for which the number of O&ST days were greater than 175 percent of the standard. Not used for
DLA depots and AF Wholesale sources of supply (excluding Airlift Investment items).
5.87.2.2.15. Truncation Point: The maximum O&ST days for DLA depots (S9x or SMS) and
AF Wholesale sources of supply (Fxx) (excluding Airlift Investment items).
5.87.2.2.16. Base Reconciliation Totals AFMC: Self-explanatory.
5.87.2.2.16.1. On-time Status: This total is updated if the status for the due-in detail is received
within the Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) time frame standard
for each priority group.
5.87.2.2.16.2. Delayed Status: This total is updated if the status for the due-in detail record is
not received within the MILSTRIP time frame standard for each priority group.
5.87.2.2.16.3. Base Initiated Cancellation: This total is updated by a cancellation request
initiated by a means other than the requirements computation program.
5.87.2.2.16.4. Requirements Initiated Cancellation: This total is updated when a cancellation
request is prepared by the requirements computation program.
5.87.2.2.16.5. Depot Cancellation (Requested): Self-explanatory. See Ch 8.
5.87.2.2.16.6. Depot Cancellation (Confirmed): Self-explanatory. See Ch 8.
5.87.2.2.16.7. Status Exception Summary: Selective codes are updated by program control. At
end-of-year, the data collected on these codes can be zeroed out by placing a B in position 80
along with the yearly report options (positions 34 and 36). Any other time, a TRIC FRI must be
used to zero these codes. See Ch 8.

Notes:
1. Enter a dash (-) in position 30 to suppress all print output.
2. Enter a dash (-) in position 32 to produce an output file containing routing identifier report
data for each routing identifier code loaded.
3. Any of the above options may be used in a given select input. Either or both of the options
described in notes 2 and 4 may be used. To produce a file that contains only the output for
summary totals plus overall totals for the base, leave position 32 blank, and enter a dash (-) in
position 33.
4. Enter a dash (-) in position 33 to produce an output file containing routing identifier report
data with totals by source only (for example, DLA, GSA, etc., and overall totals for the base).
5. Enter a dash (-) in position 34 to blank all balance fields on the routing identifier records.
This option should be used only at the end of year since record balances must remain cumulative
during the reporting year. When this option is selected, this program must be run on the primary
database. This option, when used in conjunction with positions 36 and 80, will also zero out the
Status Code Exception Summary totals.
6. During end-of-year processing, the Q05 select input must be processed with a dash (-) entered
in positions 34 and 36. When this option is selected, program Q05/NGV871 must be run on the
primary database. To zero out the Status Exception Code Summary totals with the end-of-year
options, enter a B in position 80.
7. If the MAJCOM chooses this option, enter the month code equal to the current month (begin
with A for January, and letter consecutively through L for December).
8. Enter a dash (-) in position 36 to produce an update of O&ST standard days with new average
O&ST days for each priority group which has 30 or more receipts. The O&ST standard values
are only updated if the priority group update flags are blank. When this option is selected,
program Q05/NGV871 must be run on the primary database.
9. The update option must be processed quarterly between the following days:

Table 5.226. Update Option Processing.

10. Enter a dash (-) in position 58 to produce a print summary line for each routing identifier
record (Part I). When the computed O&ST exceeds the O&ST standard for a particular priority
group, the routing identifier is flagged on the output list. This option is produced when the print
output is not specified and position 30 does not contain a dash (-).
11. Only one print option may be requested each time this program is processed.
12. Enter a dash (-) in position 59 to produce a print output (Part 2) for those routing identifier

      When the truncation point isn’t the outer edge of an occurrence use the following logic to
      determine the number of values (receipts) used in computing the new O&ST average.
      5.87.11.5.1.1. Determine which occurrence the truncation point is resident.
      5.87.11.5.1.2. Subtract the Inner Edge (IE) of an occurrence from the Outer Edge (OE) and add
      one: OE - IE + 1. This will give you the total number of values in the occurrence.
      5.87.11.5.1.3. Subtract the Inner Edge from the Truncation Point (TP) and add 1: TP - IE + 1.
      This will give you the number of values that are equal to or less than the truncation point.
      5.87.11.5.1.4. Divide the number of values equal to or less than the truncation point by the total
      number of values in the occurrence.

      Figure 5.10. Equation.




      5.87.11.5.1.4.1. This will give you the percentage of values from this occurrence that will be
      added to the sum of the values from all occurrences preceding the occurrence used in this
      computation.

5.87.11.5.2. Now we want to find the number of receipts that fall within the truncation point.
Using the formulas outlined above,
5.87.11.5.2.1. Determine which occurrence the truncation point is resident:
In this example, the Alaska Truncation Point for Priority Groups 1 & 2 is 23. This clearly falls
within occurrence 4, where the range is 19-24.
5.87.11.5.2.2. Subtract the Inner Edge (IE) of an occurrence from the Outer Edge (OE) and add
one: OE - IE + 1, 24 - 19 + 1. The total number of values in the occurrence is 6.
5.87.11.5.2.3. Subtract the Inner Edge from the Truncation Point (TP) and add 1: TP - IE + 1,
23 - 19 + 1. The number of values that are equal to or less than the truncation point is 3.
5.87.11.5.2.4. Divide the number of values equal to or less than the truncation point by the total
number of values in the occurrence. So 3 divided by 6 is (.5), or 50%. As such, multiple (.5) by
the number of receipts for occurrence 6. If there are 100 values for occurrence 6, then (.5) x 100
= 50; the number 50 would be added to the sum of the values from all occurrences less than 4. If
the sum of the values for occurrences 1-5 is 500, simply add 50 to 500 for the total number of
values. In turn, the resultant number will be divided into the total O&ST days to compute the
O&ST average.

5.87.13. Procedures for Computing Annual Truncation Point for DLA and AF Wholesale
Sources of Supply.
5.87.13.1. The procedures below show the logic used to compute the truncation point. All
values shown below are what’s used for DLA. For AF wholesale sources of supply (RIDs =
Fxx), the logic is the same except the values are different for the following parts of the equation:
Frequency Distribution Table, default Truncation Points, Percentage Factors by Area Code
(Today DLA uses 83% and it’s called the threshold).
5.87.13.2. At the end of each year, the truncation point corresponding to the DLA off-the-shelf
issue effectiveness rate needs to be computed for each of the areas, for each priority group. This
year, the LMA computed the truncation points based on the DLA reported issue effectiveness
rate (83%). Unless we’re instructed otherwise, we’ll use 83% as the threshold for computing the
truncation values. To do this,
5.87.13.2.1. For Priority Groups 1 & 2,
5.87.13.2.1.1. If RID is S**, and If Count of all receipts for Priority Group 1 & 2 ≥ 100 then,
5.87.13.2.1.1.1. Multiply the count by (.83) (this will tell you how many receipts you
will use to determine where the new truncation point is)
5.87.13.2.1.1.2. Determine what Occurrence represents the cut-off point for 83% of the lowest
values for receipts.
5.87.13.2.1.1.3. If the 83rd percentile falls in the last Occurrence, then use “Modified Procedure
for Computing the Truncation Point” and store this value in the “TRUNCATION-POINT-ONE”
field of the 007 record.
5.87.13.2.1.1.4. Otherwise follow the “Procedures for Computing the Truncation Point” and
store this value in the “TRUNCATION-POINT-ONE” field of the 007 record
5.87.13.2.2. For Priority Group 3,
5.87.13.2.2.1. If Rid is S**, and If Count of all receipts for Priority Group 3 ≥ 100 total Only the
receipts for Priority Group 3.
5.87.13.2.2.1.1. Multiply the count by (.83) (this will tell you how many receipts you will use to
determine where the new truncation point is)
5.87.13.2.2.1.2. Determine what Occurrence represents the cut-off point for 83% of the lowest
values for receipts
5.87.13.2.2.1.3. If the 83rd percentile falls in the last Occurrence, then use “Modified Procedure

field of the 007 record
5.87.13.2.2.1.4. Otherwise follow “Procedures for Computing the Truncation Point” AND store
this value in the “TRUNCATION-POINT-TWO” field of the 007 record.
5.87.13.2.3. Procedures for Computing the Truncation Point.
5.87.13.2.3.1. The truncation point represents the 83rd percentile of the receipt distribution for a
given routing identifier. The determine what this point is, you will have to:
5.87.13.2.3.1.1. Count the total number of receipts.
5.87.13.2.3.1.2. Multiply the number of receipts by .83.

5.87.13.2.4. Example 1:
5.87.13.2.4.1. 83rd Percentile is not the Last Occurrence of a Priority Group.
In the following table, the Priority Group 1 & 2 receipts have been added and there are a total of
261. Continuing to follow the rules outlined above, we compute how many receipts we will have
to account for to find the 83rd percentile. In this instance, we multiply the total number of
receipts by .83, and we need to determine the relative age of the 217th receipt.

5.87.13.2.4.1.1. Count the total number of receipts. We found that there was a total of 261
receipts.
5.87.13.2.4.1.2. Multiply the number of receipts by (.83). We multiplied 261 by (.83) and
computed the value to be 216.63, or 217.
5.87.13.2.4.1.3. Determine what occurrence the 83rd percentile receipt occurs. We determined
that the 217th receipt must be in occurrence 8, as 217 is ≥ 201 and is ≤ 232.
5.87.13.2.4.1.4. Interpolate the truncation point. Since the 83rd percentile does not include all of
the values in occurrence 8, we must determine the approximate age of the 217th receipt. For this
calculation we will calculate a “best guess” of the age of the 217th receipt. To do this, we use the
mathematical principle of interpolation.

5.87.13.2.5. Example 2. Modified Procedures for Computing the Truncation Point.
5.87.13.2.5.1. In this example, the truncation point is computed to be 38.
As noted in our logic, if the 83rd percentile falls in the last Occurrence, then use “Modified

5.87.13.2.6. Example 3. Computing the Truncation Point for when the 83rd percentile is in the
last occurrence. Though improbable, it is possible for the O&ST support from a given source of
supply to change so drastically from one year to the next that the 83rd percentile will be a value
in the last occurrence. If this should happen, apply the following logic when computing the
truncation point.
5.87.13.2.6.1. Suppose the number of receipts from a given source of supply are as follows, such
that the 83rd percentile receipt is in the last occurrence of Q05 receipt distribution:

5.87.13.2.6.2. Following the 4-step process,
5.87.13.2.6.2.1. Count the total number of receipts. In this example, the total is 1891.
5.87.13.2.6.2.2. Multiply the number of receipts by (.83). The computed 83rd percentile receipt
is (1569.5), or the 1570th receipt.
5.87.13.2.6.2.3. Determine what occurrence the 83rd percentile receipt falls in. As we can see
from the cumulative totals, this receipt falls in the last occurrence.
5.87.13.2.6.2.4. Interpolate the truncation point. Values in the last occurrence of a priority
group are those which are greater than or exceed a specified value, i.e., “≥127” (for USAFE
Priority Group 3). When this situation occurs, it signifies that a significant change has occurred
in transportation or supply support--relative to the LMA derived truncation points. However, of
an even greater concern, we are unable to calculate the 83rd percentile receipt, as we have no
outer bound for this pipeline segment/occurrence. As such, we will use the following rule to
establish the new truncation point.
Note: When the 83rd percentile receipt is in the last occurrence of a priority group, then use the
OUTER EDGE of the preceding occurrence as the new truncation point.
5.87.13.2.6.3. The OUTER EDGE of the second-to-last occurrence of each Priority Group, by
Area, are listed below:

Table 5.249. Example 4 for Computing Truncation Point.

                          (Outer Edge of     Second-to-Last
                          Second-to-Last      Occurrence)
                           Occurrence)
Area 0 (CONUS)                   48                 84
Area 1 (Alaska)                  48                 84
Area 2 (USAFE)                   56                126
Area 3 (PACAF)                   64                126
Area 4 (Hardlift, etc.)          72                140

5.87.13.2.6.3.1. To complete this example, if the 83rd percentile receipt for Priority Group 3,
Area 4 is in the 15th occurrence, then the truncation point for the following year would be 140.
The same rule would be applied if the 83rd percentile receipt were to fall in the last occurrence of
the Priority Group 1 & 2 scheme—simply take the OUTER EDGE of the SECOND-to-LAST
occurrence and use it as the truncation point for the following year.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        345

5.87.13.2.6.3.2. In each of these examples, the new truncation points will be used for the entire
year as benchmarks to determine what values are used in the O&ST computations. Note that
these values may vary by SRAN, by Priority Group to reflect the level of support each receives
from varying sources of supply. Last, these values will be stored on the 007 record in the
“TRUNCATION-POINT-ONE” (for Priority Group 1 & 2 truncation points) and
“TRUNCATION-POINT-TWO” (for Priority Group 3 truncation points) fields.

items excludes Airlift Investment item receipts (which constitute the majority of all receipts) and
2) the truncation points for both AFMC- and DLA-managed items are erroneously implemented,
thus excluding many receipts that should contribute to the calculation of OST average values.
These flaws in OST computation logic have caused base reported OST to increase erroneously
by almost two days. Analysis has shown that the one-time cost of filling two days of inventory
pipeline requirement for AFMC-managed reparable items is approximately $43M. Therefore it is
vital to the Air Force logistics community that base O&ST be computed and reported accurately.
5.87.16. SURGE Program Overview. The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity
developed and fielded a SURGE program entitled GVOST in Sep 2004 to addresses these
systematic shortcomings for AFMC and DLA-managed items. The SURGE was subsequently
updated and re-released in July 2005 to compute OST for additional items, including Forward
Supply Location (FSL) and Contractor ICP-managed items. The SURGE was also modified to
utilize LOUIS II query technology to quickly and efficiently retrieve base transaction history
data used to compute OST values. The purpose of the LOUIS II/SURGE GVOST is to correct
base computed OST to ensure the most accurate OST possible is reported to AF spares
requirements systems. Note GVOST also captures and applies demand data for selected budget
code 9 MSI transactions that are not currently recorded due to a program error. The program
selects budget code 9 NSN’s that have 232, 234, 237, 239, 240, or 241 details. The CTH area is
scanned using those NSN’s and recurring MSI transactions are selected that should have updated
the item record demand fields. Demand data is rolled up for each NSN and a FCL1 is formatted
to update the item record.
5.87.17. SURGE Program Logic.
5.87.17.1. For all items with RIDs equal to F*Z or S**:
5.87.17.1.1. For all REC transactions with (TRANSACTION DATE < 365 days ago and TTPC
= 1B and Type Account Code = ‘B’)
5.87.17.1.2. Calculate ‘Receipt days’ as (704-REQUISITION-DATE – date from 704-
DOCUMENT-NBR).
5.87.17.1.3. For items with RIDs equal to (F*Z) or (S** and a Fast Transportation Denial Flag
equal to F):
5.87.17.1.3.1. If there are less than 30 receipts for the RID:
5.87.17.1.3.1.1. Generate an FCL3 input to set the 007 PG2 AVG OST (median) to 000.
5.87.17.1.3.1.2. For CONUS bases, if the current value of the PG 1 007-AVG-OST is greater
than 24, generate an FCL3 input to set the PG 1 007-AVG-OST to 24. Otherwise do not change
the PG 1 007-AVG-OST.

    5.87.17.1.3.1.3. For OCONUS bases, if the current value of the PG1 007-AVG-OST is greater
    than 52, set the PG1 007-AVG-OST to 52. Otherwise do not change the PG1 007-AVG-OST.
    5.87.17.1.3.2. If there are 30 or more receipts for a RID:
    5.87.17.1.3.2.1. For F*Z RIDs, apply truncation values such that receipts exceeding the
    applicable (by area code) exclusion percentile are purged from the receipt records:

    Table 5.250. F*Z RID Truncation Values.
             Area Code       Percentile
                  0              67
                  1              69
                  2              76
                  3              69
                  4              69

    5.87.17.1.3.2.2. For S** RIDs, apply truncation values such that receipts exceeding the 83rd
    percentile are purged from the receipt records.
    5.87.17.1.3.3. Use the remaining receipts to calculate the average receipt days by RID.
    5.87.17.1.3.3.1. For CONUS bases, if the calculated average receipt days is greater than 24 days,
    generate an FCL3 input to set the PG1 007-AVG-OST to 24, and the PG2 007-AVG-OST
    (median) to 000.
    5.87.17.1.3.3.2. For OCONUS bases, if the calculated average receipt days is greater than 52,
    generate an FCL3 input to set the PG1 007-AVG-OST to 52 and the PG2 007-AVG-OST
    (median) to 000.
    5.87.17.1.3.4. Otherwise, generate an FCL3 input for the RID to:
    5.87.17.1.3.4.1. Set the PG1 Average OST [positions 20-22 in the FCL3 input] (which updates
    the 007-O&ST-STANDARD (occurrence one)) equal to the calculated average receipt days.
    5.87.17.1.3.4.2. Set the PG 2 Average OST [positions 17-19 in the FCL input] (which updates
    the 007-O&ST-STANDARD (occurrence two) (median)) to “000”.
    5.87.17.1.3.4.3. Set the Airlift Investment PG3 Average OST [positions 11-13 in the FCL3
    input] (which updates the 007-O&ST-STANDARD (occurrence four)) equal to the calculated
    average receipt days.
    5.87.17.1.3.4.4. Set the FCL3 Bypass Update Flag/Priority Group 1 [position 26 in the FCL3
    input], the Bypass Update Flag/Priority Group 2 [position 25 in the FCL3 input], and, the Bypass
    Update Flag/Priority Group 3 [position 25 in the FCL3 input] to ‘X’.

    5.87.17.1.4.1. If there are less than 30 receipts for the RID:
    5.87.17.1.4.1.1. Generate an FCL3 input to set the 007 PG2 AVG OST (median) to 000.
    5.87.17.1.4.1.2. For CONUS bases, if the current value of the PG 3 007-AVG-OST is greater

    5.87.17.1.4.2. If there are 30 or more receipts for a RID:
    5.87.17.1.4.2.1. Apply truncation values such that receipts exceeding the 83rd percentile are
    purged from the receipt records.
    5.87.17.1.4.2.2. Use the remaining receipts to calculate the average receipt days for the RID.
    5.87.17.1.4.2.3. For CONUS bases, if the calculated average receipt days is greater than 24 days,
    generate an FCL3 input to set the PG3 007-AVG-OST to 24, and the PG2 007-AVG-OST
    (median) to 000.
    5.87.17.1.4.2.4. For OCONUS bases, if the calculated average receipt days is greater than 52,

    5.87.17.1.4.4. MSI Transaction Selection. MSI transactions for the previous quarter are selected
    that should have updated the item record demand fields. Demand data is rolled up for each NSN
    and the following fields are updated using a FCL1 transaction.
    5.87.17.1.4.4.1. 101- DATE-OF-FIRST-DEMAND. If the DOFD is after the MSI transaction
    date, this field is updated to reflect the MSI transaction.
    5.87.17.1.4.4.2. 101-DATE-OF-LAST-DEMAND. If the DOLT is before the MSI transaction
    date, than this field is updated to reflect the MSI transaction as the last transaction.

5.87.17.1.4.4.3. 101-CUMLTV-RECURRING-DEMANDS (CRD). The action quantity for
each MSI transaction is added to the current CRD and applied to the 101-CUMLTV-
RECURRING-DEMANDS.
5.87.17.1.4.4.4. 101-NBR-OF-DMDS-CURRENT. Each MSI transaction is added to this field.
5.87.17.2. For items with RIDs not equal to F*Z or S**. For all receipts with RIDs starting with
A, B, G, J, or N; and for (FSL) receipts (from Primary Supply Point (PSPs)) with RIDs equal to
DBY, DJN, DZK, DJ5, DKY, DP6, DL3, DQ4, DP9, or DP7; and for all receipts (from
contractor ICPs) with RIDs equal to F(n)(n).
5.87.17.2.1. Calculate PG I/II OST averages. If 30 or more PG I/II receipts exist for the
SRAN/RID combination, calculate the average OST for each unique SRAN/RID combination
using receipt transactions from the previous 12 months for PG I/II receipts (priority 01 – 08).
5.87.17.2.1.1. Use the receipts to calculate the total number of days from requisition (in the
requisition Julian date) to the receipt date.
5.87.17.2.1.2. Order the receipts from smallest to largest based on the calculated total number of
days and purge the largest 20 percent of the receipts from further consideration.
5.87.17.2.1.3. Use the remaining receipts to calculate the average PG I/II OST for the
SRAN/RID combination.
5.87.17.2.2. Calculate PG III OST averages. Calculate the average PG III OST for each unique
SRAN/RID combination using priority 09 – 15 receipt transactions from the previous 12 months.
5.87.17.2.3. Assign default OST values when less than 30 receipts exist. If less than 30 receipts
exist for a SRAN/RID/PG combination, assign default average OST values as follows:
5.87.17.2.3.1. Non-PSP RIDs. Where the receipt RID begins with A, B, G, J, or N, or F(n)(n),
assign default PG I/II and/or PG III OST average values as follow based upon the area (001-
OST-O) of the SRAN whenever the current PGI/II and/or PG III value exceeds the default value.
Consider the following example. A qualifying RID at a CONUS base (Area 0) has less than 30
receipts in a year, the current PG I/II OST is 9 and the current PG III OST is 15. For this
example, the PG I/II OST is not changed (since it is less than the default value of 11), and the PG
III OST value is assigned a value of 11 (since the current value exceeds the default value).

Note: The default value was calculated as the average OST for receipts in the lowest 80
percentile for PG III receipts. However, we are using the default values for PG I/II and PG III
average OSTs to accommodate those rare occasions where items have less than 30 receipts and
the item Fast-Trans-Denial-Flag is equal to “F”.

5.87.17.2.3.2. PSP RIDs. Where the receipt RID equal to DBY, DJN, DZK, DJ5, DKY, DP6,
DL3, DQ4, DP9, or DP7assign default PG I/II and/or PG III OST average values as follow based
upon the area (001-OST-O) of the SRAN whenever the current PGI/II and/or PG III value
exceeds the default value. Consider the following example. A qualifying RID at a CONUS base
(Area 0) has less than 30 receipts in a year, the current PG I/II OST is 6 and the current PG III
OST is 12. For this example, the PG I/II OST is not changed (since it is less than the default
value of 8), and the PG III OST value is assigned a value of 8 (since the current value exceeds
the default value).

5.87.18. SURGE Processing. GVOST should be processes on the primary system during
EOM/EOQ processing after the Q05 (quarterly option) is processed.
5.87.19. SURGE Output. GVOST will create an output file (#GV0*GVOSTUD700 where # =
GANG number). Process the file through PSEUDO immediately after coming inline after
EOM/EOQ reports processing is complete on the primary system and prior to processing file
status. The file must be processed prior to processing file status for budget code 8 stock
numbers.
5.88. WRM/Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Requirements (Q07/NGV848).
5.88.1. Purpose.
5.88.1.1. To accumulate the dollar value of WRM/RSP (including use code D auth/in-use
details) CSAG-S (budget code 8), and General Support Division (GSD) (budget code 9) of the
SMAG.
5.88.1.2. To provide major commands (MAJCOM) with the data needed to determine
WRM/RSP requirements for GSD stock-funded items.
5.88.2. Program Logic. Program Q07/NGV848 is designed for use by bases to determine and
identify WRM/RSP shortages. All records associated with the particular stock number are read
and assets identified as being tied to WRM/RSP requirements are accumulated. After all records
have been scanned and accumulated, the totals required are compared to the authorized
quantities; a listing (Part 1) is created for all items that are in short supply for budget codes 8,
and 9. On Part 2 (Supportability Code F Details only) the same program logic applies, except
that only those stock numbers which have details with a supportability code of “F” are printed.
Each stock number that has the same end item is sorted and printed by type spares code and
budget code. Subtotal dollar values are accumulated and printed for type WRM/RSP and budget

codes. After each group of stock numbers with the same end items is printed and subtotal dollar
values are accumulated, a total summary page is printed. The total summary page prints the total
dollar value by type spares code and budget code. A final summary lists the total dollar value by
RSP Total, WRM Total, and Final Total.
Note: For RSP Totals (type spares codes A, B, C, D, F, J, and K) and WRM Totals (type spares
codes H and W) information, see Table 5.253. (which gives an explanation of each type
spares code). A 1WR (80-position) data image file is created ONLY for budget code 9
shortages that have a supportability code of “F”. A 1WR image is created for each stock number
listed on Part 2 which has a budget code 9; however, if two or more stock numbers have the
same end item and type spares code, then only one 1WR output image is created for that item.
This 1WR output image has the accumulated dollar value for those stock numbers in the
extended cost field of the 1WR output image.

5.89. Allowance Source Code Listing (Q09/NGV901).
5.89.1. Purpose.
5.89.1.1. To provide Equipment Management with the capabilities to do the following:
5.89.1.1.1. Ensure that equipment authorizations are maintained within required allowances.
5.89.1.1.2. Ensure that sections are requesting authorization of the minimum quantities of
equipment required.
5.89.1.1.3. Ensure that the allowance source code AFMC Uniform Office indicated is applicable
to the using activity.
5.89.1.2. To provide commanders and managers with information on the equipping status of
their organization(s).
5.89.1.3. To identify excess equipment under ASC 000 and ASC 000A, and to speed up turn-in
or justification for retention.
5.89.1.4. To detect in-use excesses not being accounted for as ASC 000.
5.89.2. Program Logic.
5.89.2.1. Allowance Source Code Listing: Scans the authorized/in-use area selecting detail
records with an ASC equal to the ASC contained in the report select format. A sort record is
built for each detail selected. The selected records are then sorted into system designator, ASC,
prime stock number, organization code, and shop code sequence. Next, an output listing is
produced with a page eject on change in system designator and/or ASC. Substitution items are
printed following the prime item. The total number of M and P details are then printed upon
change in system designator.
5.89.2.2. Equipment Management Data Listing: Sorts all authorized/in use detail records in
system designator, use code, and organization code sequence. The program produces an output
listing with a page eject on change of organization code and/or system designator. Total number
of details, quantity authorized, dollar value authorized, quantity in-use, dollar value in-use, and
percent equipped are furnished by organization with overall totals by system designator for use
codes A, B, C, D, and E. ASC 000 (excess) totals are not included in individual or overall totals
for these use codes.
5.89.2.2.1. Dollar value of authorized and in-use quantities are computed at the item code P
(preferred) item unit price.
5.89.2.2.2. The Equipment Management Data List will show number of details, quantity on
hand, and dollar value on hand for item code M and N detail records. The equipment
management data totals for item codes M and N will be listed on a separate totals page following
the overall totals of the equipment management data list. The equipment management data totals
are updated to show in-use quantities equal to the quantity authorized for the P detail record. If
the quantity in-use (less M or N items) is less than the quantity authorized, the actual quantity in-
use is included.
5.89.2.2.3. If an item record does not exist for item code P detail records, the dollar value of
quantities authorized and in-use for these detail records is not included in the report; under this
condition, a 746 management notice is produced.
5.89.2.2.4. If substitute detail records exist without a corresponding preferred (item code P)
detail record, a 526 management notice is produced. The Equipment Management Data List
does not reflect balances included in these records.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       353

5.89.2.2.5. When in-use detail records do not have use codes assigned, only balances in the
overall use code totals are updated. This update makes the sum of individual use code totals
disagree with the overall totals.
5.89.2.3. Equipment Hidden Excess Listing: Scans the authorized in-use record area and selects
all prime (item code P) detail records with an ASC other than 000. The total authorized and the
total in-use are computed for each document number. The item is then printed only if an excess
condition exists. The listing is output in system designator, document number, item code, and
stock number sequence. Page eject occurs on change in system designator. Substitute in-use
details are printed following each prime item. The total authorized and total in-use are printed
following each document number. The number of prime items excess, in-use units excess, and
dollar value of units excess are printed upon change in system designator.

and with no blanks between FSGs. For example, if balancing is desired for two FSGs, enter the
FSGs in positions 35-38, and leave positions 39-54 blank, etc. If position 69 is left blank, all
FSGs are selected. Position 67 must be blank if the option in position 69 is used.
2. Enter a dash (-) in position 67, and leave position 69 blank for FSG range selection. Enter
low/high FSG in positions 35-36/37-38. The FSG in positions 37-38 must be greater than the
FSG in positions 35-36, or the input will reject. No check is performed on positions 39-54. For
example, if positions 35-38 equal 2362, the selection would be for FSGs 23-62. If position 67 is
blank, all FSGs are selected.
3. Enter a dash (-) in position 68 to provide a sort of stock number within organization/shop

5.91. Reconciliation Follow-up (Q12/NGV598).
5.91.1. Purpose. To reconcile supply source when items which exceed the age criteria are
outstanding in the requisitioning activities database and for which reconciliation request inputs
have not been received. This program must be run 30 days after the depot cutoff date for each
reconciliation cycle. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5B, Order & Requisitioning for reconciliation
procedures.
5.91.2. Program Logic. Scans the ITM-DTL-AREA of the computer database for due-in detail
records that have been reconciled and turns off the reconciliation flag (208-
RECONCILIATION-FLAG). For due-ins that met the reconciliation time criteria but were not
reconciled, the program will produce an AEx or ATx--depending on the age of the due-in. For
due-in details under 119 days old an AT(x) will be produced and sent to the source of supply via
SIFS. For due-in details greater than 119 days old an AE(x) BF cancellation file will be created
and may be reviewed by Stock Control then processed through pseudo. AE(x) BF cancellations
will automatically re-requisition requirements. A listing will be created for those sources of
supply (FxZ, GSx, SMS and S9x) for which no reconciliation inputs (ANx) were received.

5.92. Supply Point Listing (Q13/NGV875).
5.92.1. Purpose.
5.92.1.1. To provide Flight Service Center (FSC) with a means to reconcile supply point details
and identify excesses and shortages within each supply point.
5.92.1.2. To automatically handle shortages by creating a data file containing ISU images for
type account code B items when the sum of the on-hand plus the total quantity due-out is less
than the authorized quantity.
5.92.1.3. To provide FSC and Inventory with the information needed to inventory and account
for items stored in each supply point location.
5.92.1.4. To provide personnel with a list that will quickly identify a supply point stock number
from a part number.
5.92.2. Program Logic.
5.92.2.1. Reads and selects supply point details based upon the options in the program select
image. The item record is read and a sort record built containing data from the supply point
detail and the item record. Applicable due-out details are located using the supply point
document number and written to the sort file. Due-in and status details are located using the due-

in document number from the due-out detail and written to the sort file when the type
authorization code is D and the type account code is B. The sort file is sorted based upon the
sort option taken in the program select image. The sorted records are then read and printed
followed by associated part number data, if requested.
5.92.2.2. NWRM Inventory Option (position 27):
5.92.2.2.1. Enter a dash (-) to select NWRM item records (NWRM Indicator ‘Q’).
5.92.2.2.2. This option will pull data from item record to select assets with a NWRM Indicator
of Q loaded and the applicable serialized control details that are loaded against a Supply Point
asset.
5.92.2.2.3. This option will not work with the Inventory option. It is only used with the other
options available and will list only NWRM items loaded against a Supply Point asset. You may
use any other option available to inventory your assets but 531 and 532 inventory records will
never be created with this program for these assets.
5.92.2.3. Provides the following summary totals for each supply point when position 30 of the
program select image contains a dash (-).
5.92.2.3.1. Total line items authorized.
5.92.2.3.2. Total line items on-hand.
5.92.2.3.3. Total units authorized.
5.92.2.3.4. Number of units on-hand, not exceeding authorization.
5.92.2.3.5. Dollar value of units authorized.
5.92.2.3.6. Dollar value of units in short supply (computed at authorized item unit price).
Shortage is computed as the difference between authorized and on-hand plus due-out, excluding
excess.
5.92.2.3.7. Dollar value of units excess (on-hand and/or due-out) at authorized item unit price.
5.92.2.3.8. Total number of CIC-INVENTORY (532) records written to the database. This total
is only printed when position 67 of the program select image contains a dash (-).
5.92.2.4. Builds a data file containing issue request (ISU) images for type account code B items
when the sum of the on-hand plus the total quantity due-out is less than the authorized quantity.
This will only be accomplished when position 30 of the program select image contains a dash (-).
5.92.2.5. Builds a data file containing CIC-INVENTORY (532) records for downloading. This
will only be accomplished when positions 30, 67, and 69 contain a dash (-).
5.92.2.6. Prints a custody issue and authorization certificate for each supply point with
munitions items when position 30 or 32 contains a dash (-).
5.92.2.7. Updates the inventory accuracy record and builds CIC-1RS-EIC-Header and CIC-1RS-
EIC-Inventory records when position 67 contains a dash (-).
5.92.2.8. Prints a due-out certificate for supply points that contain due-out detail records when
position 30 or 32 and position 68 contain a dash (-). This certificate will be printed after the last
line for each supply point selected.
5.92.2.9. Produces a part number to stock number cross-reference list when position 33 of the
program select image contains a dash (-).
5.92.3. Special Instructions.

5.92.7.4.2. 532-CIC-1RS-EIC-INVENTORY.
5.92.8. Distribution Instructions. Inventory will receive one copy of this listing when the
inventory (CIC) option is processed; otherwise, FSC will receive all output.
5.93. Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) Due-Out Summary (Q14/NGV878).
5.93.1. Purpose. To provide management at all levels with the option to select due-out
analytical data pertaining to each weapon system assigned.
5.93.1.1. No comprehensive formula involving multiple factors--such as fill rate, AWP, repair
cycle time (RCT), or MICAP rates--exists to determine true support capability or problem
identification. Program Q14/NGV878 portrays due-out days by weapon system (expressing
nonsupport), which should receive management attention. This technique prevents hiding the
nonsupport, which is built into the MICAP system (only reportable MICAP are included in the
MICAP rate).
5.93.1.2. Stratifying due-out data by routing identifier code, cause code, and budget code may
allow managers to detect adverse trends affecting logistics support to a specific weapon system,
particularly if these data are compared among bases over a period of time. A detailed analysis
can then be accomplished with such programs as the Due-out Analysis (R31/NGV851) and
Priority Monitor Report (D18/NGV820).
5.93.1.3. This program reflects a true logistics support capability when used together with
weapon system MICAP rates over a period of time.
5.93.1.4. This program selects and prints the due-out data for any or all SRDs applicable to the
base.
5.93.2. Program Logic.
5.93.2.1. Scans the record areas and selects all due-out detail and item records matching the
criteria specified in the report select and parameter select formats.
5.93.2.2. Inputs a maximum of 55 SRD selections (eight parameters). All fields must be used
before using additional parameter images. A STOP image must follow the last parameter image.
5.93.2.3. Edits due-out detail records for cause code A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, R, or Z, and
activity codes other than E and P. Force activity designator (FAD) code zone bits are stripped,
and the priority group is determined. Also, the due-out days are computed and saved in the sort
key. When the due-out document number date is greater than the current Julian date, zeros are
used for the day's due-out.
5.93.2.4. Sort key data and sequence are as follows:
5.93.2.4.1. System designator (SD).
5.93.2.4.2. Standard reporting designator (SRD).
5.93.2.4.3. Routing identifier code (RIC).
5.93.2.4.4. Cause code (CC).
5.93.2.4.5. Budget code (BC).
5.93.2.5. Reviews each SRD individually, and computes the average due-outs and days due-out
(per SRD). These computations are identified for the following categories:
5.93.2.5.1. Budget code: Investment, system support, and general support.
5.93.2.5.2. Routing identifier code: FGZ, FHZ, FLZ, DLA, other.

Notes:
1. The following example may assist: If the SRD for the weapon system F111A is FZA and the
number of F111s at your base is 20, then positions 4-6 = FZA, positions 7-9 = 020, and positions
10-14 = F111A.

5.94. Stock Status Scan (Q15/NGV881).
5.94.1. Purpose. This program updates selected data records within the SBSS management
support record area. The data accumulated are used for production of the Monthly Base Supply
Management Report and become a permanent, integral part of the Air Force Consolidated
Management Data Bank. Elements of data obtained through this program are used by HQ
USAF, major commands, and base-level managers to analyze the SBSS and provide statistics for
system changes and/or modifications.
5.94.2. Program Logic. The Stock Status Scan program uses all B and C-series system
designator records in the accumulation of the 01 account data. The following categories of data
are updated:
5.94.2.1. Inventory Control Data. Accumulated within the Nonstock Fund, General Support
Division, and CSAG-S. These categories are further subdivided into repair cycle, economic
order quantity (EOQ), and equipment in stock except for non-SMAG items which portray
Readiness Based levels, base computed levels, and equipment in stock. Items with relationship
code I and -2 or -9 records are treated as family items in the computation of inventory control
data. Inventory control data fields are updated as follows:
5.94.2.1.1. Number of Item Records - Totals are accumulated for item records with a
relationship code unequal to I and positions 14 and 15 of the stock number unequal to -2/-9.
5.94.2.1.2. Dollar Value of On-Hand Balance - Totals are accumulated by multiplying the latest
acquisition cost (200-LAC) times the total serviceable assets (serviceable balance + WRM + firm
DIFM + supply point + MRSP + MSK + WCDO) and the CARCASS cost (022-FILLER-1)
times the unserviceable.
5.94.2.1.3. Item Records With Zero Demand Level - Totals are accumulated for item records
with a zero demand level less relationship code I and -2/-9 records.
5.94.2.1.4. Item Records With Demand Level - Totals are accumulated for item records with a
demand level greater than zero less relationship code I and -2/-9 records.
5.94.2.1.5. Dollar Value of Demand Levels - Totals are accumulated by multiplying the item
record unit price times the demand level.
5.94.2.1.6. Item Records With Requisition Objectives - Totals are accumulated for item records
with a level (demand level as modified by special levels) greater than zero less relationship code
I and -2/-9 records.
5.94.2.1.7. Dollar Value of Requisition Objective - Totals are accumulated by multiplying the
requisition objective times the master/single item record unit price.
5.94.2.1.8. Item Records With Requisition Objective And Zero Accessible Assets - Totals are
accumulated for item records with a requisition objective greater than zero and total assets less
deployed MSK are equal to zero, excluding item records with stockage priority code 5 and E.
5.94.2.1.9. Item Records With A Special Level - Totals are accumulated for item records with a
special level flag A, B, C, D, or E.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                      365

5.94.2.1.9.1. Item Records With A Special Level And Date of Last Demand (DOLD) Greater
Than 365 Days - Totals are accumulated for item records with a special level detail record,
except level justification code equal to 0 or T and the item record DOLD is over 365 days old.
5.94.2.1.9.2. Item Records With A Special Level And Zero Demands - Totals are accumulated

5.95. Leveling Data Update (S01/NGV815).
5.95.1. Purpose. To update nonrepair cycle record demand data and blank file status quarter
code. The options available in this program allow management to initiate in-line file status
against selected categories of items more frequently than once each quarter. This option is the
only mandatory run requirement.
5.95.1.1. Options. Local management has the capability to initiate file status and associated
releveling against item records selected on combination of the data elements below.
5.95.1.1.1. System designator.
5.95.1.1.2. Routing identifier code.
5.95.1.1.3. Budget code.
5.95.1.1.4. Repair cycle or nonrepair cycle flag.
5.95.1.1.5. Type stock record account code.
5.95.1.1.6. Initial Spares Support List (ISSL) flag.
5.95.1.1.7. Application code. When the MAJCOM directs or a base determines that file status
will be run more frequently than quarterly, the appropriate changes to the DAY input format (see
part 4) are made after the prior days S01 processing.
5.95.1.2. Semiannual Demand Update: On the last day of March and September, this program is
run to shift the number of demand fields on all nonrepair cycle item records. The number of
demands is recorded in three 6-month fields and shifted semiannually as part of the soothing
techniques employed during releveling. The ISSL Data Collection Flag option is the only option
that can be run with the Semiannual Demand Update option, all other options are bypassed.
5.95.2. Program Logic. Reads all item records and blanks file status quarter code. When the
ISSL Data Collection Flag option is used, the 101-MISSION-CHANGE-ISSL is set to a zero (0).
When the semiannual requirement option is used, program S01/NGV815 only does the following
actions:
5.95.2.1. Shifts current 6 months and first past months number of demands to first past and
second past number of demands, respectively.
5.95.2.2. Blanks current 6 months number of demands fields.

5.95.2.3. Updates item record cumulative recurring demands (CRD) if the date of first demand
is greater than 1 year old. The program uses the following formula:
5.95.2.3.1. Old CRD = Daily Demand Date (DDR). Current Date = Date of First Demand
(DOFD).
5.95.2.3.2. DDR X 365 = New CRD. DOFD is then adjusted to be 1 year old.
5.95.2.4. Zeros out cumulative recurring demand field when number of demands current, past 6
months, and past 7-12 months are all zeros.
5.95.3. Special Instructions.
5.95.3.1. Primary/Secondary:
5.95.3.1.1. Process on primary after daily, monthly, and quarterly reports. The following
processing sequence must be followed and the programs listed must be processed on the same
day: Quarterly D28 - NGV292B - NGV819/Q04 - and NGV815/S01.
5.95.3.1.2. A DMS FREE is accomplished after the update of every 100 records. If the program
aborts after receipt of the recovery message, follow the appropriate instruction above.
5.95.3.2. Restart Procedures: If recovery is necessary, reload the crossover tape backup. Start
S01/NGV815 from beginning. You must also rerun any other programs processed after the
crossover that updates the primary database.

5.97.2. Program Logic.
5.97.2.1. Selection Criteria:
5.97.2.1.1. The serial number in the program select input is checked and matched with the
applicable MRSP-IRSP serial number record (024), and the applicable RSP details are selected
for processing based upon the ERRC option in the select record.
5.97.2.2. The detail's owner item record is read to determine if the item is in an ISG. When an
item is in a group, the ISG record and associated item records are read to obtain the AFMC
master stock number which is subsequently used in the reconciliation process.
5.97.2.2.1. Records are sorted into NIIN, SRD, Unit Type Code (UTC), and item code sequence.
5.97.2.2.2. The sorted records are read, and the authorized and on-hand quantities are
consolidated by NIIN, SRD, and UTC.
5.97.2.2.3. The consolidated records are then sorted and consolidated by SRD, UTC, and NIIN.
5.97.2.2.4. The RSP base authorization file is read into a work file, sorted in NIIN/SRD/UTC
sequence, and matched to the consolidated detail records NIIN, SRD, and UTC.
5.97.2.2.5. Any variance in authorized quantities will be identified and listed in stock number
SRD/UTC sequence with all RSP details for that item number.
5.97.2.2.6. All non-matching authorizations/details will be listed in parts 2 and 3, respectively.
5.97.2.3. MRSP/IRSP Reconciliation Listing will be printed in SRD/UTC/stock number
sequence. The listing is in four parts:
5.97.2.3.1. Part 1--Quantity Variance. This list contains matching authorizations and detail
records when there is a difference in the authorized quantity.
5.97.2.3.2. Part 2--Input No Matching Detail. This list contains RSP authorizations that do not
have a RSP detail loaded in the database.
5.97.2.3.3. Part 3--Detail No Matching Input. This list contains RSP records that do not have a
matching RSP base authorization.
5.97.2.3.4. Part 4--Note Code Variance (1-3-4). This list contains RSP details with a note code
of 1, 3, or 4.
5.97.2.4. An indicative data change is created (if applicable), if one of the following data
elements: percent of application, quantity per application, alternate storage location, planned
operating base, work unit code, maintenance repair concept, mission capable code, IRSP wartime
quantity, reporting MAJCOM, allowance source code, or using MAJCOM code is different than
the detail record on the database. Then the applicable TRIC image change format(s).
5.97.2.5. The RSP base authorizations reports are sorted by record number and rewritten to the
RSP base authorization file. If the authorized quantity matches the consolidated detail
authorized quantity, the RSP base authorization record is flagged to indicate to program
NGV914 that no additional processing is required.
5.97.3. Special Instructions.
5.97.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary. Must be processed after crossover and processing the

2. If the item record IEX is 3, the shop code must be either SS for janitorial supplies or TI for
hand tools. If the item record TEX is 6, the shop code must be IE. Only organization and
activity codes L010 (L041 through L049 for satellites) may be used.
3. The shop code is always blank when the computer prepares the input. The serial number
should be blank when prepared by a local program. When output by program 008, S06/NGV882
will contain a serial number. When the serial number is blank on input, the complete document
number appears in the transaction register only.
4. Positions 45 through 50 are normally blank. When positions 45-50 contains the word
EXCESS, processing of this input will cause excess reporting. Skeleton BIR outputs containing
EXCESS are produced during the quarterly file status scan when excesses are detected.
5. Outputs internally produced as a result of attempting a unit of issue or unit price change
contain the following data.
position 46-50 = blank or decimal locator and conversion factor
position 52 = blank or decimal locator and conversion factor
position 52 = P
positions 58-59 = new unit of issue
positions 61-68 = new unit price.
6. Transaction exception codes 8, 9, L, W, and Z are authorized. TEX codes L, W and Z will
not result in a new BIN label unless a transaction history is written (balance change). If no
transaction history is written and a location change is desired, an FCS must be processed. The
effect of processing is as follows.
TEX 8: Does not release due-outs.
TEX 9: Does not update demand data.
TEX L: Bypasses DOLT edit.
TEX W: Changes warehouse location (if a transaction results).
TEX Z: Does not update demand data and change warehouse location (if a transaction results).
7. D in position 52 deletes freeze code D from the item record.
8. Use reject override flag of 5 to override reject 331. Use the flag only after receiving a 331
reject.

5.98.8. Distribution Instructions. Send all output to Inventory.
5.99. RSP Authorization Processor (S07/NGV914).
5.99.1. Purpose. To provide an automated means to process RSP authorizations adds and
changes, (XTJ/XVF).
5.99.2. Overview. These paragraphs explain base processing of the WRM authorizations. The
major command provides the WRM authorizations to the applicable base.
5.99.3. Steps Before Processing.
5.99.3.1. Computer Operations. The computer, through the SIFS, will produce a notice that it
has received a WRM authorization file. Computer operations personnel will process the
XJT/XVF using electronic file transfer to SBSS mainframe. Computer Operations should advise
War Readiness the WRM authorization file is ready for processing.
5.99.3.2. War Readiness. War Readiness personnel must make sure they have received the
entire WRM authorization file. To do this, they should check the header/trailer data submitted
with the authorization file.
5.99.4. Processing The WRM Authorizations.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        377

5.99.4.1. The WRM Base Authorization Processor (S07/NGV914) is an automated way to
process the serial number/control record and MRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/PMSK/WCDO/WRM
Equipment/Special Spares authorization adds and changes.
Note: Process WRM deletions externally, because turn-ins and/or due-out cancellations may be
necessary before the WRM detail record can be deleted.
5.99.4.2. S07 Processing. When Computer Operations notifies War Readiness that they have
received a WRM authorization, War Readiness personnel initiate the S07 process. CAUTION:
Before initiating the S07 process, make sure that you have the entire WRM authorization. If you
do not have the whole document, you may need to get another complete WRM authorization
from the major command before you can begin.
5.99.4.3. Contingency S05 Processing. For RSPs transferred to the AOR, in accordance with
established milestones, MAJCOM RSP managers will develop, create and provide the WRM
authorization files (XTJ/XVF images) annually to the base RSP section and/or the AFMC
Supply Chain Management Review (SCM-R) Contingency Operations Activity. These images
will be provided via email in text format. In order to meet required milestones, complete all
actions detailed in this section within 30 days after receipt of the master authorization files for
each type of RSP (MRSP/IRSP/HPMSK). Extensions must be requested in writing via message
or letter to MAJCOM RSP managers. A complete explanation and expected completion date
must accompany extension request.
5.99.4.4. S07 Input List. If the option to create WRM authorization input list is taken, the
computer will output a WRM base authorization input list to help War Readiness. This list helps
in loading or changing WRM serial number/control record(s), segments the XVF authorizations,
and assigns the shop codes and item numbers. The computer outputs the S07 list in the
following sequence.
5.99.4.4.1. XTJ - Major command WRM serial number authorization input record by
SRD/UTC.
5.99.4.4.2. XVF - WRM base authorization input record by national stock number/ SRD/UTC.
5.99.4.5. Initiating S07. After completing the actions required on the WRM base authorization
input list, initiate the S07 process to add and/or change the applicable WRM details. The
computer will enter the add/change images of the applicable WRM detail load/change in the
pseudo reader to process or create a disk file for review prior to processing.
5.99.4.6. S07 Scan Option. After completing all adds, changes, or deletes, War Readiness
should process the S07 scan option to make sure all the WRM authorization input records have
been processed completely. If any WRM authorization input records have not been completely
processed, the computer will produce a WRM base authorization input list. Then War Readiness
must complete processing for those XVF authorizations which appear on the S07 list.
5.100. SRD File Update (A01/NGV849).
5.100.1. Purpose.
5.100.1.1. To provide the capability to change or delete SRD records (107).
5.100.1.2. To provide the capability to update SRD records:
5.100.1.2.1. Updates the DOFD and computes a new demand quantity for records that have a
current demand quantity which is out of balance with the item record cumulative recurring
demands. This will be done without regard to the age of the SRD record DOFD.
5.100.1.2.2. Updates the DOFD and computes a new demand quantity for records that have a
DOFD greater than 365 days old.
5.100.1.3. To provide the capability to consolidate SRD data for MRSP/IRSP reviews.
378                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP            29 JANUARY 2014

5.100.1.4. To provide the capability to produce stock control data delete images (FCD), for
reinput to delete the mission change ISSL flag on the item record.
5.100.2. Program Logic.
5.100.2.1. Reads and edits the report select image to determine the action that is to be
performed.
5.100.2.2. Reads and edits the parameter images if records are to be changed or deleted.
5.100.2.3. Reads and processes the master SRD demand data file based on the options requested.
5.100.2.3.1. Processes more than one option at a time.
5.100.2.3.2. Creates and stores an SRD consumption record for SRD ZZZ NSN 9999 00 999
9999. DOFD for this record will be updated whenever the A01 update option is processed. The
R37/NGV853 and R54/NGV911 reports will edit this record, and if the DOFD is greater than
365 days, these reports will not be processed until the A01 is processed. The quantity field of
this record will contain the ordinal date of the last time the D13/NGV833 was processed.
5.100.2.3.3. Updates the DOFD and computes a new demand quantity when the SRD demands
are out of balance with the item record cumulative recurring demands. This edit applies across
all system designators and is done regardless of SRD DOFD age. For example:
5.100.2.3.3.1. An item record daily demand rate is computed: Item Record DDR = cumulative
recurring demands divided by the difference between current date and date of first demand.
5.100.2.3.3.2. An SRD record daily demand rate is computed: SRD record DDR = SRD
quantity divided by the difference between current date and SRD date of first demand.
5.100.2.3.3.3. Two intermediate quantities are computed. If the item record date of first demand
is 365 days old or greater:
5.100.2.3.3.3.1. Temp SRD quantity = SRD record DDR multiplied by 365.
5.100.2.3.3.3.2. Temp CRD quantity = item record DDR multiplied by 365.
If the item record date of first demand is less than 365 days old:
5.100.2.3.3.3.3. Temp SRD quantity = SRD record DDR multiplied by the difference between
current date and item record date of first demand.
5.100.2.3.3.3.4. Temp recurring demands = item record DDR multiplied by the difference
between current date and item record date of first demand.
5.100.2.3.3.4. The two intermediate quantities are compared and if not equal, the SRD record
quantity is replaced with the Temp recurring demands. If there are multiple SRD records for a
stock number, then the Temp recurring demands are compared against the combined total of
SRD record quantities, and the updated quantity for each member will be based on a percentage
of the total.
5.100.2.3.3.5. The SRD date of first demand is updated. If the item record date of first demand
is 365 days old or greater:
5.100.2.3.3.5.1. SRD date of first demand = 365 days prior to the current date.
If the item record date of first demand is less than 365 days old:
5.100.2.3.3.5.2. SRD date of first demand = Item Record date of first demand.
5.100.2.3.4. Updates the date of first demand (DOFD) if SRD records are greater than 365 days.
This edit applies across all system designators. If the DOFD is updated, a new demand quantity
will be computed. For example:
5.100.2.3.4.1. An item record daily demand rate is computed. Item Record DDR = cumulative
recurring demands divided by the difference between current date and date of first demand.

Notes:
1. Update Option (position 61). Enter a U in position 61 to update the DOFD and compute a
new demand quantity for records over 365 days old. Additionally, this option will adjust
demand quantities which are out of balance with item record cumulative recurring demands. A
scan of all item records is performed and an FCD image is prepared if there are no SRD records
on file for that NSN and system designator (SD). The FCD images will be prepared even when
position 62 of the select image does not contain an F. This option must be processed at least
annually to allow processing of the R37/NGV853 and R54/NGV911.
2. FCD Delete Option (position 62). Enter an F in position 62 to generate FCD outputs for re-
input to delete the mission change/ISSL indicator from the ITEM RECORD OTHER ASSET
field and to eliminate accumulation of mission change data. This field applies only to update
option (position 61), delete option (position 64), or change option (position 65).
Note: An FCD will be prepared only if there are no other SRD records with the deleted NSN
and SD.
3. Delete Option (position 64). Enter a D in position 64 if specific SRD records are to be
deleted from the SRD master file. This option requires the input of 1SB parameter images.
Records can be deleted by NSN, SD, and SRD or any combination thereof. If records are deleted
by 1) SD, 2) SRD, or 3) SD and SRD, then a maximum of 100 parameter images are allowed.
Input images that contain a stock number are not applied to the 100 parameter images limitation.
4. Change Option (position 65). Enter a C in position 65 if SRD records are to be changed.
This option requires the input of 1SE parameter images. Each SRD can be broken out into three
new SRDs, and a percentage of the quantity can be applied to each of the new SRDs not to

5.101. Prep Inventory Accuracy Records (A02/NGV838).
5.101.1. Purpose. To provide the capability for initial preparation of designated areas on the
computer database to accommodate inventory accuracy collection. Options are provided to
selectively blank data by system designator and/or type stock record account code or to prep
without altering other data on the record. The end-of-year option blanks all system
designator/type stock record account code accuracy record data, and resets appropriate report
serial numbers and the primary force record alteration (FIX) counter to 0 and the secondary FIX
counter to 5000.
5.101.2. Program Logic.
5.101.2.1. Program A02/NGV838 reads inventory accuracy records and, based on the select
option chosen, processes as follows:
5.101.2.1.1. Prep in system designator. Leave other data unchanged.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     383

5.101.2.1.2. Prep in system designator. Blank other data elements for system designator and/or
type account code.
5.101.2.1.3. End-of-fiscal-year option. Prep in system designator. Blank data elements for all
inventory accuracy records, zero all numbers in the inventory adjustment control record. All
records that meet select criteria are printed in before and after formats.
5.101.2.2. There are seven inventory accuracy records for each system designator for 01 and
A1-9. All B and C system designators are included in 01. Each system designator group is
divided into type account code and inventory categories. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 5.
The seven records are as follow:
5.101.2.2.1. Inventory Accuracy Record Account B/E Complete.
5.101.2.2.2. Inventory Accuracy Record Account B/E Special.
5.101.2.2.3. Inventory Accuracy Record Account B/E Identity Changes.

6.11. Detail Major MAJCOM Change (NGV427).
6.11.1. Purpose. To provide a batch program used to change the MAJCOM codes on the
following detail records:
        DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE, 203-MAJCOM-ID
        SPECIAL-LEVEL, 216-MAJCOM-ID
        SPECIAL-SPARES, 233-REPORTING-MAJCOM and 233-USING-MAJCOM
        WRM-WCDO-SPARES, 241-REPORTING-MAJCOM-ID
These records are changed based on options indicated in the program input parameter and
MAJCOM codes loaded on the organization records. The MAJCOM code stored on the
applicable 516 and 518 organization records must be updated using an online transaction before
processing program NGV427. MAJCOM codes can be changed on the selected detail records
for an entire system designator or by organization code and system designator.
6.11.2. Program Logic. Program NGV427 reads and modifies the MAJCOM codes on the
details using the MAJCOM code stored previously on the 516-ORGANIZATION-COST-
CENTER-000-099 (001-041 through 069) or 518-ORGANIZATION-COST-CENTER-100-999
records. The 516 and 518 MAJCOM codes must be updated using online transactions before
processing program NGV427. The MAJCOM code must be entered in the parameter card to
update the 216-SPECIAL-LEVEL-DETAIL record.
6.11.3. Special Instructions.
6.11.3.1. MAJCOM Codes. MAJCOM Codes are stored on other detail records that are changed
using different processes. The MAJCOM codes stored on the organization records are used by
NGV427 to update the detail records identified in paragraph 6.11.1. The following programs
must be processed before processing NGV427 to update the MAJCOM code on basic
organization records:
6.11.3.1.1. Program NGV068 must be run to update the BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record (001)
and A&F variable data record (310).
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014                                   395

6.11.3.1.2. Identify the 516-ORGANIZATION-COST-CENTER-000-099 (001, 041 through
069) that requires owning and/or using MAJCOM code changes. If any records require
changing, process a FORBAS on-line transaction (see , Ch 8) prior to processing NGV427.
These records are used to assign the owning and using MAJCOM code to the detail records.
Note: For detail records containing organization code 002 (WRM-WCDO spare) or 216 (special
level details), the MAJCOM code from the 001 and 041 through 069 (516 record) is used based
on the detail system designator.
6.11.3.1.3. Identify the 518-ORGANIZATION-COST-CENTER-100-999 that requires owning
and/or using MAJCOM code changes. If any records require changing, process an XSE (that is
provided by AFEMS) prior to processing NGV427.
6.11.3.1.4. Program NGV469 is processed if a change to the MAJCOM codes on the
MRSP/IRSP serial number (024) record which, in turn, re-links 025 MRSP/IRSP-CONTROL
and associated WRM spares detail is necessary.
6.11.3.2. Primary/Secondary: Primary database, after the END input and a file backup of the
primary database and before the first RPT input.
6.11.3.3. Restart Procedures: Recover backup taken before processing NGV427 and start the
job from the beginning.
6.11.3.4. Satellite Procedures: Program must be processed from the host base RPS. Satellite
accounts schedule processing with the RPS Scheduler.

Notes:
1. You can change the MAJCOM codes on DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE (203),
SPECIAL-LEVEL (216), SPECIAL-SPARES (233), and WRM-WCDO-SPARES (241) detail
records for a specific organization code entered in positions 1-3 or on all organization codes for a
specific system designator by entering "ALL" in positions 1-3, based on the MAJCOM
information previously loaded by online programs.
2. Enter the specific system designator for the organization code to be updated.
3. Multiple parameters are allowed either by organization code and system designator or all
organizations for a specific system designator. The last parameter must be followed by a STOP
input.
4. To update the ISSL Special Level detail, NGV427 must be processed separately or a 519
reject will occur.
5. Mandatory input for Special Level Detail change. MAJCOM code and ISSL serial number
must be entered.
6.11.5.3. RPS/Main System:
6.11.5.3.1. Source: Program select image and parameter inputs with a STOP image following
parameter images.
6.11.5.3.2. Load Sequence: Twilight Mode: Following the END image. Then, process a file
backup prior to processing NGV427 for recovery purposes. Reload backup if NGV427
abnormally terminates for any reason, correct the problem, and reprocess NGV427.
6.11.6. Output.
6.11.6.1. Print: As determined locally.
6.11.7. Distribution Instructions. As determined locally.
6.12. Weapon (M-16) Modification (NGV441).
6.12.1. Purpose. To produce the necessary transactions required to re-identify authorized-in-
use-details and corresponding serialized-control-records for weapon stock numbers resulting
from a weapon (M-16) modification.
6.12.2. Program Logic. Program NGV441 will scan the input AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-
DETAIL (201) and move it, along with all corresponding IN-USE-SERIALIZED-CONTROL
records (250), from the original (change-from) stock number to the modified (change-to) stock
number on the input format.
6.12.2.1. Multiple detail selection is by specific stock number, organization and shop code
(ORG/SHOP), and detail number. This allows all items under input ORG/SHOP and detail
number with the "change-from" stock number to be changed to the input "change-to" stock
number. All associated 250 details will be changed, along with the 201 detail selected.
6.12.2.2. A DIC DSA is produced for each in-use-serialized-control-record selected and
transmitted through SIFS to AFEMS.
6.12.2.3. A transaction history is built on both input stock numbers using TTPC 3V for the
"change-to" stock number and 3Y for the "change-from" stock number. The TRIC for changes
made as a result of this program will be listed as FIC under the transaction history record.
6.12.2.4. If any details associated with selected ORG/SHOP detail are deployed, then program
will not modify that detail and will print a notice on the output listing that there are deployed
assets for that detail and external review is required. NGV441 will then continue to the next
input detail number.
6.12.3. Special Instructions.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        397

6.12.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV441 must be processed on the primary database in
twilight mode. An IRU backup must be taken prior to processing.
6.12.3.2. Input Restrictions: Only one system designator may be processed for each run. One
organization and shop code and up to five (5) detail numbers may be input. Each stock number
must have a serialized report code (SRC) of "A" loaded prior to input processing.
6.12.3.3. Restart Procedures: If the program abnormally terminates for any reason, reload the
IRU backup taken prior to processing and start the program from the beginning.
6.12.3.4. Satellite: N/A.
6.12.3.5. Prior to processing NGV441, the requester must run NGV874 (R46). After the R46 is
printed, and any error conditions are corrected, NGV441 can be processed with little or no error
conditions that have to be corrected. After NGV441 is processed, we strongly suggest that
another R46 be processed to ensure all balances are correct.
6.12.4. SA/LW Reidentification. When it is necessary to re-identify SA/LWs (for example, M-
16 modification), use program NGV441 (1XT441). The 1XT441 input must be processed in
twilight mode on the primary gang. One organization and shop code and up to five different
authorized in-use detail (201 record) numbers can be selected for re-identification with a single
1XT441 input. Both stock numbers must have a serialized report code of "A" assigned. The
Federal Supply Class (FSC) of both stock numbers must be 1005, 1010, 1015, or 1095. If any
one item under a selected detail is deployed, that detail will not be modified and a statement will
be printed on the output listing notifying requester there is external review required for that
detail. If the total number of in-use serialized control (250 records) do not equal the on-hand
quantity of the authorized in-use detail (201 record), the program will only modify the number of
existing 250 details, not to exceed the authorized quantity. The program will print a statement on
the output listing notifying the requester of the total number of details modified, number of
details not modified, and if external review is required. At this point NGV441 will continue on
to the next input detail number or go to end of job. DIC DSA is produced for those records
selected and forwarded via SIFS to AFEMS.

6.14. Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Transfer Upload Program (NGV466).
6.14.1. Purpose. To upload ITEM-RECORDS, COST-RECORDS, REPAIR-CYCLE records,
PART-NBR-DETAIL records, MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL and detail records, and IN-USE-
SERIALIZED-CONTROL details previously selected by NGV471 to establish accountability at
the gaining SBSS database. The record count loaded and any rejects will print on the console
type out.
6.14.2. Program Logic.
6.14.2.1. Uses the two files created by NGV471 at losing base.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        401

6.14.2.1.1. Prior to processing NGV466, catalog 0GV0*466-DATA. Each transferred file must
be individually copied into data file 0GV0*466-DATA. The program will compare the system
designator contained in the file against the system designator in the select image, then prompt the
user with the system designator comparison displayed on the console to ensure they are correct.
If correct, user responds with YES and the program continues. If system designator comparison
is not correct, user responds NO and the program ends. Research system designator information
and restart the program from the beginning.
6.14.2.1.2. The file containing item, cost, part number, and repair cycle records must be copied
and processed first. Load the records by using the format in the OUTPUT instructions. There
will be no transaction histories built for these inputs. If an item record currently exists, no
actions/rejects will occur. For JCS coded kit segments and POS levels the transfer program will
not overwrite any pre-existing project codes. However, the transfer program, when processed at
the gaining base, will create new item record loads, if required, and apply the JCS project code
logic. A status line showing number and type of records loaded will print on the console. If
there are no records loaded, then the status line will not print. For all new item record loads, a
BDFA image will be created. The recommended method for transferring the file created by
NGV471 is to use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
6.14.2.1.3. After successful load of all records from the first run, copy into data file 0GV0*466-
DATA. the transferred file containing the detail images. The gaining organization code must be
loaded prior to this run or inputs will result in a 165 reject. The second file will contain the IN-
USE-SERIALIZED-CONTROL and MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL and detail records. NGV466 will
sequentially establish all IN-USE-SERIALIZED-CONTROL and MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL and
detail records. If a record does not exist a management notice “NGV466-REJECT/MGT
MISSING 250 DETAIL” will be displayed on the console type-out identifying the missing stock
and document numbers. The program will continue processing instead of aborting. After
processing the kit upload the RPS operator will notify the RSP manager in the Aircraft Parts
Store of the missing stock and document numbers so they research and add to the kit.
6.14.2.2. Creates for each detail loaded one transaction history that is done according to the
TRIC used to load the detail. TTPCs will be assigned to reflect an add/increase detail. Prior to
IN-USE-SERIALIZED-CONTROL detail transaction histories being written, NGV466 will call
NGV463 to create a DSM/XHA for reporting asset status.
6.14.3. Special Instructions.
6.14.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV466 must be processed on the primary database in
the twilight mode. An IRU backup must be taken prior to processing. A message requiring an
RPS operator's response is displayed upon the RPS console. If the message is answered NO, or
is allowed to time out, the program will go directly to an end-of-job without update. If answered
YES, the program will process as requested by the select image and data images read from the
data file. Ensure that there are enough unused daily computer-generated requisition numbers
available to accommodate the transfer of details or a 771 reject notice will occur.
6.14.3.2. Input Restrictions: Only one transferred file can be processed at a time. If processing
on dual gang systems, coordinate between gangs prior to running NGV466 to eliminate conflict
when using NGV466 upload data file.
6.14.3.3. Restart Procedures: If the program abnormally terminates or produce rejects for any
reason after the operator responds YES to the message generated in the SPECIAL
INSTRUCTIONS above, reload the IRU backup taken prior to processing. Then restart the
program from the beginning.

6.15.2.2. Performs edits on input parameters.
6.15.2.3. Changes/relinks all records 024/025/details based on input images.
6.15.2.4. Produces a listing which depicts the following:
6.15.2.4.1. Input edit errors (001 type).
6.15.2.4.2. Other type rejects (erroneous file conditions).
6.15.2.4.3. Summary totals on what records were changed to and what records were changed
from.
6.15.3. Special Instructions. A backup must be taken of the primary database prior to processing
NGV469.
6.15.3.1. Primary/Secondary: This program must be processed on the primary database, and it
must be processed after the END and prior to the RPTRUN on the primary database. The
program will create transaction histories that will result in the command CSMS database being
updated. Process NGV469 runstream and parameters. Failure to follow this sequence can cause
transactions to be reported to the command system under the wrong serial/control numbers
and/or reported out of sequence.
6.15.3.2. Restart Procedures: Should program NGV469 terminate prior to an end of job or
should hardware failures be encountered, you must reload the backup taken prior to starting. If
you do not reload the backup, you will have part of the records changed to the new set and some
under the old set causing errors. Additionally, when you rerun NGV469 with the same
parameters, you could duplicate records.

6.16. WRM Detail Record Deployment/Return (NGV470).
6.16.1. Purpose. To produce the necessary transactions, record updates and documentation to
support the deployment and/or return from deployment of MRSP/IRSP/MSK detail records as
specified in the input select and parameter images. Due-out detail records associated with the
applicable MRSP/IRSP/MSK may also be updated.
6.16.1.1. Deployment (Group): Program processing with an action code of DEP updates the
selected detail records with an asset status flag of D. The on-hand quantity is moved to the
quantity-deployed and the on-hand quantity is zeroed. The deployed routing identifier is stored
in the deployed routing identifier field on the selected records. The deployed routing identifier is
also stored in the due-out delivery destination code field if the due-out option is selected. The
option to deploy associated due-out details causes a D to be stored in the 205-Deployed-Flag
field on the due-out detail.
6.16.1.2. Deployment (Single): Program processing with an action code of DEP updates only
the selected detail record with an asset status flag of D or P depending upon the quantity being
deployed. If selection is by specific document number and stock number (partial), an asset status
flag of P is stored on the record, and the input quantity is moved to the deployed quantity. If

selection is by document number only, all detail records with the input document number will
have the asset status flag changed to a D and the complete on-hand quantity moved to the
deployed-quantity. The deployed routing identifier entered in the select image will be stored in
the deployed routing identifier field on the applicable detail record. If selection is by the
complete document number, you may also deploy the associated due-out details and store a
deployed routing identifier on the due-outs. When deploying serialized reporting assets, single
or partial, you must process a DSR or XHB (see AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 10B, Management of
Controlled Material).
6.16.1.3. Return: Program processing with an action code of RET blanks the asset status flag,
adds the deployed quantity to the on-hand quantity, and blanks the deployed routing identifiers
and 205-DEPLOYED-FLAG on the due-out detail.
6.16.2. Program Logic. Program NGV470 can deploy or return from deployment those WRM
detail records specified by the input select and parameter images. Records are selected by one of
three methods:
6.16.2.1. Single item selection for a specific stock number, document number and quantity.
When this option is used, due-out detail records are not updated.
6.16.2.2. Single item selection by specific document number. This causes all stock numbers
associated with a particular document number to be updated as specified. Due-out detail records
are updated with this option.
6.16.2.3. Group selection by either the MRSP/IRSP serial number or the MRSP/IRSP control
record (consisting of the UTC, SRD, organization and shop code). Selection of a particular
WRM increment number may be used in conjunction with either the MRSP/IRSP serial number
or the MRSP/IRSP control record. MSK deployments only require the organization and shop
code since control and serial number records are not used by MSK details.
6.16.3. Special Instructions.
6.16.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV470 must be run on the primary database in
twilight mode. An IRU backup must be taken prior to processing. A message requiring an RPS
operator's response is displayed on the RPS console. If the message is answered YES, the
program processes. If answered NO, or allowed to time out, the program goes directly to end-of-
job without updates.
6.16.3.2. Input Restrictions: Only one system designator may be processed for each run.
Multiple parameters may be processed.
6.16.3.3. Restart Procedures: Reload the IRU backup taken prior to processing and start the
program from the beginning if the program abnormally terminates for any reason after the
operator responds YES to the message.

6.17. WRM Detail Record Transfer (NGV471).
6.17.1. Purpose. To delete accountability of spares details and provide the necessary inputs to
account for the transferred details at the gaining base. To produce the necessary transactions,
record updates, and files for NGV466 to upload at the gaining activity, and documentation to
support the transfer of MRSP/IRSP/MSK detail records as specified in the input select and
parameter images. Due-out detail records associated with the applicable MRSP/IRSP/MSK may
be updated as requested.
6.17.2. Program Logic. Program NGV471 transfers those WRM detail records specified by the
input. Therefore careful attention must be taken when transferring a JCS tasked kits (and the
corresponding item record data) that contains JCS project flags and codes to a forward location
that are not authorized the assignment of a JCS project code. Records are selected by one of two
methods:
6.17.2.1. Single item selection by specific document number. This causes all stock numbers
associated with a particular document number to be updated. Due-out detail records may be
updated with this option. If the temporary/permanent transfer option is not taken, a DOC image
is produced for all applicable due-out details for inline input. A listing is produced along with
the necessary inputs to load the transferred assets at the gaining activity. The inputs are stored in
individual files, structured as follows:

6.17.2.2. Group selection by either the MRSP/IRSP serial number or the MRSP/IRSP control
record. Selection of a particular WRM increment number may be used in conjunction with either
the MRSP/IRSP serial number or the MRSP/IRSP control record. The same detail processing
actions apply to group selection as for the single document number selection.
6.17.3. Special Instructions.
6.17.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV471 must be processed on the primary database in
the twilight mode. An IRU backup must be taken prior to processing. A message requiring an
RPS operator's response is displayed upon the RPS console. If the message is answered NO, or
is allowed to time out, the program will go directly to an end-of-job without update. If answered
YES, the program will process as requested by the select and parameter images. Ensure there are
sufficient unused daily computer-generated requisition numbers available to accommodate the
transfer of details or a 771 reject notice will occur.
6.17.3.2. Input Restrictions: Only one system designator may be processed for each run,
however multiple parameters may be processed.
6.17.3.3. Restart Procedures: If the program abnormally terminates for any reason after the
operator responds YES to the message generated above, reload the IRU backup taken prior to
processing, and start the program from the beginning.

6.20.1. Purpose.
6.20.1.1. To change organization and/or shop codes in the detail records listed below. A single
transaction history, TRIC XTV and TTPC 7Z, is written for each input parameter to record the
change in organization and/or shop codes. A list of all affected detail records will be printed.
The applicable detail records are as follows:
6.20.1.1.1. Authorized/in-use details.
6.20.1.1.2. REM vehicles only details.
6.20.1.1.3. EOQ consumption details.
6.20.1.1.4. Master bench stock details.
6.20.1.1.5. Due-out details.
6.20.1.1.6. Due-in details.
6.20.1.1.7. Supply point details.
6.20.1.1.8. SPRAM details.

6.20.1.1.18. WRM/IRSP spares details.
6.20.1.1.19. In-use Serialized/Serialized Control details.
6.20.1.2. To change the DIFM document number in due-out detail records.
6.20.1.3. To provide an option for deleting memo due-outs in the database, except for the
following:
6.20.1.3.1. Obligated memo due-outs.
6.20.1.3.2. Memo due-outs related to a DIFM detail record when the organization/shop codes in
memo due-out detail records match the change-from parameters.
6.20.2. Program Logic.
6.20.2.1. Scans the ITMDTL-AREA for due-out, due-in, special level, DIFM, authorized/in use,
REM vehicles only, Special Spares, HPMSK, NAMRSP, AMRSP, WRM/IRSP spares, MSK,
SPRAM, EOQ consumption, master bench stock, unused organization owned assets, in-use
serialized/serialized control or supply point.
6.20.2.2. Checks the program select option to determine if memo due-outs are to be canceled. If
so, the program verifies that the memo due-out is not obligated and/or does not have a related
DIFM detail record. It then changes or bypasses the organization/shop code if the document
number corresponds to the parameter input.
6.20.2.3. Deletes the MRSP/IRSP control and MRSP/IRSP serial number records that no longer
have active details linked prior to end of job.

6.20.3. Special Instructions.
6.20.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV544 must be run on the primary database. This
program is to be run after all database key/set errors have been corrected and prior to mandatory
end-of-day programs.
6.20.3.2. IRU Backup: The RPS operator may take a complete IRU backup. This will be
necessary in the event of unrecoverable errors.
6.20.3.3. First Fail Safe Run: Run Fail Safe BEFORE NGV544 processing. This will be
necessary for checking against the Fail Safe run AFTER NGV544 as a way of ensuring a correct
update. All detail counts should remain the same, except when the X in position 67 option is
used.
6.20.3.4. Program NGV544: Execute NGV544 according to the following guidelines:
6.20.3.4.1. Parameters, not to exceed 25, must follow the program select format.
6.20.3.4.2. A STOP image must follow the parameter image.
6.20.3.4.3. If any of the parameter formats are in error, correct erroneous parameters and restart
from the beginning.
6.20.3.4.4. For restart procedures, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2.
6.20.3.5. Second Fail Safe Run: Run Fail Safe AFTER NGV544 processing.
6.20.3.6. Mandatory EOD Reports: Process mandatory end-of-day (EOD) reports.
6.20.3.7. M36/NGV977 A&F Stock Fund Due-Out Reports:
6.20.3.7.1. Needed to update the due-out field of the changed-from/to organizations.
6.20.3.7.2. Normal distribution.
6.20.3.8. M03/NGV977B Organization Cost Center Report:
6.20.3.8.1. Needed to validate the OCCR and PFMR obligated due-outs.
6.20.3.8.2. Normal distribution.
6.20.3.9. R14/NGV902 CA/CRL Listings (Option):
6.20.3.9.1. Can be used to check changed authorized/in-use detail records.
6.20.3.9.2. Normal distribution.
6.20.3.10. FOR Images: These must be processed inline before running program NGV544 to
establish the changed-to OCCRs.
6.20.3.11. OCCR and PFMR Records: These must be adjusted to reflect increased or decreased
authorizations resulting from the organization code shredout(s).
Note: Make certain the funds availability in the PFMRs affected is sufficient to avoid 907 reject
notices of inline transactions following the organization code shredout processing.
6.20.3.12. Need for Coordination: Use of program NGV544 requires close coordination
between LRS/Materiel Management Activity and A&F for the following reasons:
6.20.3.12.1. Changes to organization codes directly affect the accounting system (BQ) for
operations.
6.20.3.12.2. Each organization code relates to a specific responsibility center or cost center code
which provides obligation and expense reporting data to MAJCOMs, DFAS, and DoD.
6.20.3.12.3. Changes to establish uniform organization and/or shop code structures within a
command, or to establish a numerical sequence of codes, are not feasible except for the first day
of the new fiscal year.
6.20.3.12.4. When the organization/shop code option is used and that particular
organization/shop code has MRSP/IRSP detail records loaded against it, a 1EB input must be
processed to load the MRSP/IRSP control record for the change-to organization/shop code prior
422                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP            29 JANUARY 2014

to processing program NGV544. If this is not done, an S006 management notice is produced and
the applicable MRSP/IRSP detail records are not changed.
6.20.3.13. Risk of Invalid Changes: To avoid invalid changes to obligations, follow the
examples below.
6.20.3.13.1. If the organization/shop code, option is used in the parameter image and
MRSP/IRSP detail records exist for that code, MRSP/IRSP control records must be loaded prior
to processing program NGV544 or an S006 management notice occurs. Process program
R30/NGV895, after successful completion of NGV544 to update the supportable authorized and
on-hand quantities on the new MRSP/IRSP control record(s).
6.20.3.13.2. The E images produced by program M03/NGV977B must be processed according
to DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.
6.20.3.14. Restriction on Changes:
6.20.3.14.1. Parameter images are limited to 25 per run. If more than 25 organization codes are
being changed, additional runs of NGV544 will be necessary.
6.20.3.14.2. A system designator must be entered in the select image. All parameter images in
the run must be for organization codes loaded for the system designator in the select image.
6.20.3.14.3. If supply point details are being changed (organization code 005), you must ensure
that a delivery destination record is loaded for the change-to organization and shop code.
6.20.3.15. Correction of Parameters: All parameters must be corrected before the program will
process any of the images.
6.20.3.16. Check for Duplicate Due-Outs: Review the output from program D18/NGV820 to
see if duplicate due-outs were found. If duplicates are found, cancel the duplicate and
reestablish.
6.20.3.17. Update of Repair Cycle Record: Review program Q04/NGV819 and process FRRs to
update necessary designated base repair activity on the repair cycle record, which may have
changed as a result of processing program NGV544.
6.20.3.18. Update of Delivery Records: Review program NGV544 output listing to determine
which delivery destination records need to be updated. 1DE inputs should be processed to delete
the change from delivery destination records as applicable. New delivery destination records
need to be loaded for the change to organization/shop codes. Any 3-position delivery destination
records applicable to the change from/to organizations should also be reviewed. The loading of
these records should be accomplished as soon as possible to ensure that property is delivered to
the new address.

6.21.1. Purpose. To produce the necessary transactions and documents required to deploy or
transfer selected authorized/in-use detail records. When specified by the program select input,
program NGV580 produces the inputs necessary for receipt of the transfer at the gaining base.
6.21.2. Program Logic. NGV580 first edits the FME input for erroneous conditions. If errors
are found, the program places an X under the erroneous position(s) and prints a 001 reject on the
RPS/main console. Further processing will depend on which of the following options are
selected:
6.21.2.1. Short-Term Deployment Processing: During short-term deployment processing (E or
C in position 80 of the FME input), scans the Authorized-In-Use- Detail Records Area
(ATHINU-AREA), selecting those records equal to the FME group selection input parameters.
The quantity deployed is transferred to/from the deployed quantity field as applicable. The
program sets the deployment flag all selected on-hand details and writes a record. A deployed
listing will be produced in document number sequence.
6.21.2.2. Transfer Processing: During transfer processing (T in position 80 of the FME input),
the program scans the ATHINU-AREA, selecting those records equal to the FME group
selection input parameters. After the necessary transactions have been prepared, the program
deletes the selected detail if the on-hand and authorized quantities were reduced to zero.
FIL/FEDs are produced (if requested). The printed output will consist of either a shipping
document or a custody receipt transfer document in document number sequence. If a use code D
asset is deployed and the EAID location code is not blank, FCS images are produced for
processing at the gaining location.
6.21.3. Special Instructions.
6.21.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Program NGV580 must be run on the primary database.
6.21.3.2. Restart Procedures: The method of restart for interrupted processing will depend on
the type of input and output, as explained below.
6.21.3.2.1. Short-Term Deployments: Reinput the original program select input and destroy all
printed and data file output.
6.21.3.2.2. Transfers: Any transaction(s) that appears on the page being printed will be restored.
6.21.3.2.2.1. Destroy the outputs and listing for the restored transactions after the condition that
caused the interruption has been corrected.
6.21.3.2.2.2. Reinput the original program select input and continue processing. Note the
following:
6.21.3.2.2.2.1. The program reselects any details remaining; it does not restart from the point of
interruption.
6.21.3.2.2.2.2. When processing is restarted, the totals will include only those transactions that
occurred after the interruption.
6.21.3.2.2.2.3. Stock number sequence listings and/or due-out listings will include only those
stock numbers processed after the interruption. If the interruption occurs during printing of the
stock number sequence or due-out listing, there is no method of restarting the program to obtain
these products.

twice monthly. Used by accounts not managing Late Inbound Shipments in ES-S.
6.26.2. Program Logic.
6.26.2.1. Identifies ship status details having a TCN or a GBL and an overdue shipped date. The
time criteria for overdue shipments are as follows:
6.26.2.1.1. Priority 1-8 requisition assigned a RDD of 999,N--, or E--, follow-up between 7 and
14 days on CONUS shipment and between 14 and 21 days for overseas shipments.
6.26.2.1.2. Priority 1-8 requisition assigned a RDD of 555 or 777, and priority 1-15 requisition
with assigned RDD 444, follow-up between 20 and 30 days on CONUS shipments and 30 and 40
days for overseas shipments.
6.26.2.1.3. Priority 1-15 requisition with a blank in the RDD field, follow-up between 30 and 60
days on CONUS shipment and between 60 and 90 days for overseas shipments.
6.26.2.2. Sort sequence will be system designator, transportation control number, document
number, suffix, and stock number.
6.26.2.3. Allows for the option to automatically create a TAR with an asterisk (*) in position 7
(short ship receipt) for items with an extended cost under $100.00. The images will be moved to
the pseudo for inline processing.
6.26.2.4. Updates the transportation tracer flag field for shipment status details that have
exceeded the above priority group time frames.
6.26.2.5. Provides listings based on the TTF field of the shipment status detail. The listings are
as follows:

6.26.2.5.5. Receipt Acknowledged Error List (TTF A).
6.26.2.5.6. Supplementary Address Transportation Tracer List (Stock Control - Host Base).
These are items requisitioned by the host base for direct delivery to the supplementary address.
The host base Stock Control must contact the supplementary address to determine if the
shipment was received. If not, Stock Control should advise the supplementary address to initiate
transportation follow-up action.
6.26.2.5.7. Ship Status Header Error Listing - This portion of the listing is for information only.
This listing will only be created when there are no 211-Status-Ship-Detail records linked to a
030-Ship-Status-Header record. Program NGV597 will delete the header record and print the
information for research action, if required.

6.28. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuation Update (NGV935).
6.28.1. Purpose. To update, in twilight mode, the following four records: 1) foreign currency
records (FCR), 2) local purchase status detail records, 3) RNB detail records, and 4) item records
applicable to a foreign currency which has fluctuated. Program NGV935 also provides for inline
load/delete of the foreign currency and daily exchange rate records.
6.28.2. Program Logic. This program is processed based on input TRIC and option. NGV935
first edits the input data for validity. If the data are incorrect, the program prints a 001 reject
notice and terminates. If the data are valid, the following will apply:
6.28.2.1. Foreign Currency Record Update (1XT935): This option is processed only during
twilight mode (after END has processed--FLAG A = 01).
6.28.2.1.1. Updates the foreign currency records applicable to the input currency identifiers.
6.28.2.1.2. Scans the item record area for those records having a flag which identifies
relationships to detail records (local purchase status and received-not-billed) with a currency
identifier code. The program then scans the detail set of these item records and performs the
following:
6.28.2.1.2.1. Updates received-not-billed and local purchase status detail records and writes a
transaction history record for each updated detail record.
6.28.2.1.2.2. Updates the MACR for each updated budget code Z detail record.
6.28.2.1.2.3. Accumulates the quantity of due-in details when the item record budget code is 9.
6.28.2.1.2.4. Performs the following if an item record is updated:
6.28.2.1.2.4.1. Writes a TTPC 4A transaction history for that record and for each due-out in the
set.
6.28.2.1.2.4.2. Updates the dash nine (-9) item record and writes a transaction history record.
6.28.2.1.2.4.3. Prints an 083 management notice if a dash one (-1) item record is in the
computer.
6.28.2.1.2.4.4. Accumulates the net change-to on order (due-in quantity times item record price
change).
6.28.2.1.2.5. Completes the following functions after the item records and corresponding detail
records have been processed:
6.28.2.1.2.5.1. Interfaces with program NGV950 to update MACR net orders placed.
6.28.2.1.2.6. Deletes all foreign currency records flagged for deletion if there are no received-
not-billed or local purchase status detail records with corresponding currency identifiers.
6.28.2.1.2.7. Interfaces with program NGV980 to produce a foreign currency record printout.
6.28.2.2. Foreign Currency Record Load (1XRL) and Delete (1XRD): These two 1XR
transactions are processed inline. Note that elsewhere that these inputs are referred to as options
L (1XRL) and D (1XRD).

6.29.2.5. Accounting and Finance Variable Data Record: NGV946 increases the FY flag
(current fiscal year field) by 1.
6.29.2.6. Billing Appropriation (408) and Expense Appropriation (409) Records :There are four
obligation categories: “1PFY”, “2PFY”, “3PFY”, and “SUCC M”. Beginning with the “1PFY”
category, program NGV946 will programmatically move obligations from its present category to
the next oldest category resulting in the obligation becoming “aged” 1 “FY”. For example,
obligations which were the first prior year obligations prior to running the NGV946 program
become reclassified as “2PFY” and obligations which were in the “2PFY” category prior to
conversion become reclassified as “3PFY”. The “SBSS” is limited to four obligation categories.
Prior to yearend conversion, “AFO” personnel must load “1B1/1B2” transactions only for each
“OCCR/PFMR” current year obligations which have new appropriation/expense data elements.

6.30.1. Purpose. To process MILSTRIP billings and local purchase payment transactions for
materiel obtained from DLA, GSA, OSSF, and local vendors and financed through the SMAG or
major appropriations. Billing transactions are input to the computer through the RPS/main
system or A&F and are processed by NGV956 each day in batch groups or as individual inputs
in standard inline mode. Program NGV956 is designed to accomplish eleven basic purposes:
6.30.1.1. Edit each input for validity.
6.30.1.2. Scan the ITMDTL-AREA and locate due-in, RNB, BNR, and local purchase status
detail records having a related document number equal to the input.
6.30.1.3. Verify compatibility of data in inputs with data in corresponding details.
6.30.1.4. Delete and add details.
6.30.1.5. Write payment transaction history records.
6.30.1.6. Write add and delete detail transaction history records.
6.30.1.7. Write SMR adjustment transaction history records.
6.30.1.8. Update the DOLT in item and local purchase status detail records.
6.30.1.9. Reject invalid transactions.
6.30.1.10. Output reject and management notices.
6.30.1.11. Write reject transaction history (TTPC 9Y) for each rejected input.
6.30.2. Program Logic.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       443

6.30.2.1. SBSS inline driver program NGV209A identifies each TRIC and calls program
NGV956A to begin processing of billing inputs. This will occur when billing images are input
to the computer.
6.30.2.2. Program NGV956 begins by reading each input TRIC and converting the MILSTRIP
billing DIC into TRIC FK1 and TRIC FK2. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for MILSTRIP TRIC
conversion chart.)
6.30.2.3. Program NGV956 edits each image. The edits are made during the reading and TRIC
conversion process to ensure the validity of those data required for subsequent updates of
internal records. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for specific edit conditions.) If an input contains
invalid data, the program discontinues processing that input and prints an appropriate reject
notice (phrases A001 through A013).
6.30.2.4. Programs NGV956J-R begin the main billing image processing after the initial edit is
completed. NGV956J-R create and/or update common records for each input processed as
follows:
6.30.2.4.1. Writes standard payment transaction history records with TTPC 9Z (except inputs
with TRIC IDB, IDC, IDR).
6.30.2.4.2. Assigns MACR Update Card (MUC) codes to non-SMAG payment (fund codes 17,
29, and 8C transaction histories) and interfaces with program NGV950 for non-SMAG MACR
update. (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M for MUC code assignment logic.)
6.30.2.4.3. Outputs A057 management notice when the non-SMAG transactions are identified
by program NGV950 as lapsed appropriation (no MACR update).
6.30.2.4.4. Stores management notice numerical phrases in transaction history records (positions
7-8 of nomenclature field).
6.30.2.4.5. For inputs with details, compares the fund code in the input for compatibility with
the fund code in corresponding details. If the fund code is unequal, the program stores the detail
fund code in transaction histories and outputs management notice A050.
6.30.2.4.6. Updates the item record DOLT field for transactions with TRICs BKA, BKB, FK1,
FK2, and 1BA.
6.30.2.5. Programs NGV956J-R identify each reject or management notice condition during
processing of individual inputs and print the reject or management notice data (except for
phrases A052, A058, and A059). 6.30.2.5.1. For each management notice condition, programs
NGV956J-R print the following:
6.30.2.5.1.1. Phrase code and phrase description (first line).
6.30.2.5.1.2. Input image (second line).
6.30.2.5.1.3. Document number and transaction serial number (third line).
6.30.2.5.1.4. Details affected by the input (fourth line).
6.30.2.5.1.5. Item record data (stock number, system designator, unit of issue, unit price, SPC,
phrases A053 and A054 only).
6.30.2.5.1.6. Computed amount of difference in extended cost between FK1 input and the
RNB(s) detail (phrases A053 and A054 only).
6.30.2.5.2. For each reject condition, programs NGV956J-R assign reject code (A0xx series)
and interface with program NGV215, Reject/Restore, for standard reject processing.
6.30.2.5.2.1. Program NGV215 identifies all rejects originated within programs NGV956J-R
with reject phrase code 956 and phrase description REJ MILSTRIP/LOCAL PURCHASE
BILL/CARD HAS ERROR AS INDICATED.
444                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

6.30.2.5.2.2. Program NGV215 prints reject data in a standard reject format. The specific reject
code (AOxx series) is shown on the fourth line of the reject notice.
6.30.2.5.3. In addition to standard reject data printed by program NGV215, programs NGV956J-
R process a standard inquiry and a printout of all details corresponding to the document number
of the rejected input. These data include the following:
6.30.2.5.3.1. First print line:
6.30.2.5.3.1.1. Identification: INQ.
6.30.2.5.3.1.2. Activity: A&F.
6.30.2.5.3.1.3. Input document number.
6.30.2.5.3.1.4. Julian date and transaction number.
6.30.2.5.3.1.5. Identification of specific reject code: BIL A0xx.
6.30.2.5.3.2. Second and succeeding print lines:
6.30.2.5.3.2.1. Detail record.
6.30.2.5.3.2.2. Binary quantity, when applicable (printed in decimal configuration).
6.30.2.6. Program NGV956J-R writes a transaction history (TTPC 9Y) during reject actions for
each individual reject condition with phrases A002 through A039 and phrase A295. Program
NGV958, Local Purchase and MILSTRIP Payment Detail and Summary List (D29), will use
these histories to produce the Rejected Billing List (see DFAS-DE 7077.10-M) during end-of-
day processing. In addition, NGV956J-R punches out substitute billings for each billing input it
rejected with the above phrases. The following explains the substitute format and data transfer
logic:
6.30.2.6.1. Common format and data transfer logic for all substitute input formats:
6.30.2.6.1.1. Positions 1-73: Input image of rejected positions 1-73.
6.30.2.6.1.2. Position 74: Blank.

6.34. SBSS/IMDS SRD Reconciliation (NGV567).
6.34.1. Purpose. To provide a reconciliation of SRD records between the SBSS and IMDS
/G081.
6.34.2. Program Logic.
6.34.2.1. IMDS program NFS840 creates an indexed file containing SRD record data from the
REMIS SRD table. This file contains all the valid SRD’s in the Air Force. IMDS will process
Maintenance Code Reports screen #126. They will click on create Standard Reporting
Designator Reconciliation File For Use By SBSS Filename 0GV00000*AFS84D. Once
complete this will show that the Disk file has been created for Supply reconciliation and the
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       451

number of SRD records that were written to the file. The NGV567R ECL reads input file
0GV00000*AFS84D.
6.34.2.2. Program NGV567 reads the 008-SRD-RECORD and then accesses the IMDS file
directly to locate a matching SRD entry. Local SRDs (those with an L or Z in the first position
of the SRD) are not selected. 1SR delete images are formatted and written to a disk file when the
following conditions are met:
6.34.2.2.1. No matching entry is found in the IMDS file.
6.34.2.2.2. A matching entry is found in the IMDS file and the SRD-STOP-DATE field on the
IMDS file entry is less than, or equal to, the current 002-ORDINAL-DATE.
6.34.2.3. The data file of 1SR delete images is automatically loaded to Pseudo at end-of-job.
The 1SR images will delete excess and expired SRD records from the SBSS.
6.34.3. Special Instructions.
6.34.3.1. Primary/Secondary: This program may be processed in any mode (inline, twilight, or
reports) on either the primary or secondary gang. Pseudo will start automatically at end-of-job if
processed inline. The pseudo must be started after returning inline from twilight or reports mode
to process the 1SR delete images. If running on the secondary gang, the primary gang must be
inline before processing this program.
6.34.3.2. Input Data File: The input data file containing the SRD data from IMDS must be
created before processing NGV567.
6.34.3.2.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity personnel requesting the reconciliation must
insure that the IMDS file 0GV00000*AFS84D is on the system and is current. If the file is not
present on the SBSS or is outdated, then contact the IMDS host Database Manager and request
that the disk option of NGS840 be processed. DISA OKC will send file 0GV00000*AFS84D
out via ADRSS to all Supply platforms.6.34.3.2.2. Program NGV567 will assign file
0GV00000*AFS84D to the run for processing of the SRD reconciliation. If the file is not
cataloged, the program will not process.

6.39. ORG Record/Detail Cleanup List (NGV340/UTL340).
6.39.1. Purpose. To identify organization records that are pending deletion and display any
details that still may be loaded on the database prior to deleting the organization record. If no
records are found for organizations on subject list, then the 518-FREEZE-DELETE-FLAG will
be changed from a “P” to a “D”.
6.39.2. Program Logic.
6.39.2.1. The program scans all ORG-COST-CENTER-100-999 records and selects any that
have a 518-FREEZE-DELETE-FLAG = “P”. If any records have a “P”, then the program scans
the database for 032, 201, 203, 204, 205, 207, 214, 216, 217, 218, 219, 223, 225, 228, 230, 232,
233, 234, 235, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 249, 250, 409, 417 and 543 records that still may be
loaded. If there are any records loaded, they will be displayed on a listing for further external
review by personnel. If there are no details selected, then the program will change the “P” to a
“D”. If there are no organizations selected, then a management notice stating this will be
displayed on the console.
6.39.2.2. Users will have the option to run by specific system designator or leave this field blank
to select all system designators.

6.40. GSD Due-Out Surcharge Conversion (NGV417).
6.40.1. Purpose. To format LPA and FCU images to be processed for budget code 9 due-outs
carried over at end of year.
6.40.2. Program Logic.
6.40.2.1. Program scans the item record area selecting those item records (101-record) with
budget code equal to '9'.
6.40.2.2. Program selects those item records where the 1st position of the routing identifier
(101-RID) equals ‘J'. If RID equals 'J’, the program determines if any 210-STATUS-LOCAL-
PURCHASE records exist in the ITMDTL area. The program selects those Local Purchase
records that have 210-DATE-OF-LAST-TRANSACTION less than 1 October of the current
year. An LPA transaction image is formatted and written to disk file GV417UD101, for each
detail selected.
6.40.2.2.1. One cent is added to the 210-EXTENDED-COST to make up the extended price in
the LPA image.
6.40.2.2.2. The requisition number in the LPA image is constructed using the 210-
DOCUMENT-NBR and the SRAN.
6.40.2.3. If the 1st position of the routing identifier (101-RID) is other than 'J', the program
determines if any due-out detail (205-record) exists for the selected item record.
6.40.2.3.1. For those details selected the 101-UNIT-PRICE is multiplied by the 001-GSD-
SURCHARGE. The result is compared to the 205-UNIT-PRICE, if unequal an FCU image is
created. These FCU will contain an 'S' in position 4.
6.40.2.3.2. An FCU transaction image is formatted and written to a data file GV417UD101 for
each detail selected.
6.40.2.4. This program does not update any records. The data file must be processed to make
necessary updates.
6.40.3. Processing Instructions.
6.40.3.1. Program NGV417 must be processed on the primary database in twilight mode.
6.40.3.2. Process an IRU backup of the primary database before processing program NGV417.

processing and after the local purchase surcharge for the new fiscal year has been loaded to the
base constants record.
6.41. Interchangeable And Substitute Listing (R02/NGV866).
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        457

6.41.1. Purpose.
6.41.1.1. To provide a listing of indicative data for each stock number loaded within an ISG
record.
6.41.1.2. To assist Record Maintenance in adding and deleting items in family groups.
6.41.1.3. To determine interchangeable and substitute items when making post-post issues.
6.41.1.4. To provide a cross-reference for the ISG number on the item record (see the Stock
Number Directory) to the stock numbers within the ISG.
6.41.1.5. To provide an automated means for interrogation (first follow-up) and to identify items
which require manual interrogation follow-up action (second follow-up). Interrogation follow-
up will be accomplished see Ch 8.
6.41.2. Program Logic. The program select image is read and edited to ensure that all selected
options are valid. If the program select image does not pass edits, a 503 reject notice will be
printed on the RPS console. The different types of output are as follows:
6.41.2.1. If a total ISG Listing is required (a dash (-) in position 65), the ISG records are read
sequentially and each stock number in the group is located.
6.41.2.1.1. Totals are accumulated and printed as follows:
6.41.2.1.1.1. Total number of ISG records.
6.41.2.1.1.2. Total number of substitutes (S).
6.41.2.1.1.3. Total number of items coded as next higher assembly (H).
6.41.2.1.1.4. Total number of items coded as repair kits (K).
6.41.2.1.1.5. Total number of items coded as component part (C).
6.41.2.2. If position 66 contains an I, only interrogation follow-up will occur. If position 66
contains a dash (-), interrogation follow-up action occurs, a notice (Interrogation Follow-up
Completed) is produced, and edits are made on the remaining options of the select format. If the
select format passes edits, the select options requested will be processed. A 503 reject notice
will occur if the select format does not pass edits.
Note: If a 503 reject notice occurs when position 66 contains a dash (-), the notice (Interrogation
Follow-up Completed) remains valid. When correcting the select format for the 503 reject
notice, position 66 should be left blank.
6.41.3. Special Instructions.
6.41.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Both primary and secondary.
Note: When the interrogation option (position 66) is used, the program must be processed on the
primary database.
6.41.3.2. This program should be processed after program NGV403 to ensure the ISG records
are accurate and up to date.
6.41.3.3. Restart Procedures: See Ch 5.
6.41.3.4. Satellite: Output is produced at the applicable satellite.

6.43. Fund Requirement Update/Analysis (R04/NGV857).
6.43.1. Purpose. This utility program provides Stock Fund personnel with a current file of fund
requirement inputs and a listing of dollar requirements by budget code and system designator.
This program also allows for selective purchasing to ensure maximum use of available dollars.
In addition, the program updates the requirements computation flag on the item record for budget
codes 1, 4, 8, and/or 9.
6.43.1.1. Description of the Fund Requirement Analysis Report. The Fund Requirement
Analysis Report is the most comprehensive management tool available to personnel responsible
for the allocation of SMAG resources at base level. It is used when the MACR Factor Analysis,
program R45/NGV862, indicates necessary inline requisition suppression cannot be met by
applying numeric MACR factors. Fund requirement inputs are the result of management using
urgency of need flag (UNFF), maximum automatic obligation, and alphabetic MACR factor
requisition suppression techniques. The R04 summarizes and portrays the resulting exception
data in order to help personnel make due-out and stock replenishment buy decisions.
6.43.1.1.1. The R04 lists selection options by budget code, stockage priority code, subgroup
code, and application code. Then the selected dollar data are arranged by priority and projected
level of support.
6.43.1.1.2. Management is provided with a comprehensive analytical tool that determines what
will be requisitioned and reviews established MACR parameters. Management can then use
these data to determine if the volume of exception data is adequate and what the relationship is
between the orders placed and the sales figures given in the R45.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       461

6.43.1.2. Specific Features of Fund Requirement Update/Analysis Program. The selection
options available and the logic used for each option are documented below. Management should
also note the following features of the program output:
6.43.1.2.1. The differences between option 1 and option 4 follow:
6.43.1.2.1.1. Option 1 will provide a REPLACEMENT fund requirement (FRC) output file for
those FRCs input as a parameter file. The input will immediately produce a due-out FRC file
and set the requirements computation flag for the generation of stock replenishment FRCs during
inline processing.
6.43.1.2.1.2. Option 4, based upon the input select image, flags all or specified item records for
requirements computation. After processing Option 4, initiate requirements computation.
Requirements computation produces the FRC images for stock replenishment. If the resulted
processing exceeds the limits of LVL-File, initiate requirements computation by DAY RR
instead of the DAY F RR input.
6.43.1.2.2. The use of options 2 and 5 follows:
6.43.1.2.2.1. Option 5 provides for the display of dollar requirements for the number of days
stockage indicated on the parameter input. These figures--which take into account existing due-
outs, due-ins, and on-hand balances--represent an additive cost to achieve the number of days
support selected. The fund requirement outputs are not modified except for due-out FRC, but
they are printed as they were input and with matching item record indicative data. After the days
buy criteria are established, the FRCs may be modified with option 2 for subsequent inline
processing. A matrix is provided for both options 2 and 5.
6.43.1.2.2.2. Option 5 also displays the MACR data applicable to the selected system designator
and the budget code before printing summary dollar data. Frequently review the portion of the
R04 with the orders and sales data reflected in the R45 to determine possible modifications that
could be made to the MACR parameters. In this way, the number of FRCs routinely reviewed
and reprocessed could be reduced, if the current inventory sales and turnover ratios are
satisfactory.
6.43.2. Program Logic. The five selection options are described below:
6.43.2.1. Option 1, FRC File Update. This option will produce a file of validated requirements
based upon input of an FRC file only.
6.43.2.1.1. If the FRC is for a due-out, it is processed as follows:
6.43.2.1.1.1. The due-out detail record is located. The due-out must be memo, memo due-out
designator 1.
6.43.2.1.1.2. The FRC is updated with the due-out detail quantity and the adjusted extended
cost.
6.43.2.1.1.3. The new FRC output file for due-outs is produced.
6.43.2.1.2. If the FRC is for stock replenishment, it is processed as follows:
6.43.2.1.2.1. The item record is located.
6.43.2.1.2.2. The releveling flag is set on the item record.
6.43.2.1.2.3. Inline releveling the following day will produce a new updated FRC file.

6.43.2.2.1. If the same number of days is to be used for all FRC inputs regardless of type
(budget code, SPC, and subgroup code), enter the day criteria in positions 35-37. Then each
FRC is processed as follows:
6.43.2.2.1.1. The due-out FRC input file is processed as follows:
6.43.2.2.1.1.1. The due-out detail record is located. The due-out must be memo, memo due-out
designator 1.
6.43.2.2.1.1.2. The FRC is updated with the due-out detail quantity and adjusted extended cost.
6.43.2.2.1.2. The stock replenishment FRC input is processed as follows:
6.43.2.2.1.2.1. The item record is located.
6.43.2.2.1.2.2. If the due-out detail or item record cannot be located, the FRC input is bypassed.
6.43.2.2.1.3. The sort keys are built in the FRC format and then sorted in system designator,
budget code, Stockage Priority Code (SPC) subgroup code, SPC code, and stock number
sequence.
6.43.2.2.1.4. After the sort, a FRC output is produced as follows:
6.43.2.2.1.4.1. The due-out FRC output file is produced for the due-out quantity.
6.43.2.2.1.4.2. The stock replenishment FRC output file is updated by computing the following:

Figure 6.2. Stock Replenishment FRC Output File.
                               (O&ST + SL)
                                   +
                         (DDR x VARIABLE DAYS)
                                   +
                          DUE-OUT - (Ser and D/I)


WHERE: O&ST = order and shipping time quantity. SL = safety level quantity. DDR = daily
demand rate. SER = serviceable. D/I = due-in.
Note: The quantity is adjusted by shelf life and quantity unit pack.
6.43.2.2.1.5. The new FRC output file is created and individually listed.
6.43.2.2.1.5.1. A matrix list is also provided. It contains 1) dollar values accumulated for each
budget code, SPC, subgroup code, and applicable code; or 2) a 30, 45, 90, and 180 days
(standard) requirement; or 3) variable day as indicated on the parameter input.
6.43.2.2.1.5.2. Separate total pages are provided for the due-out dollar value and stock
replenishment dollar value.
6.43.2.2.1.5.3. On a change of budget code, the totals accumulated are printed.
6.43.2.2.1.5.4. On a change of system designator, final totals are printed.
6.43.2.2.2. If the same number of days IS NOT to be used (positions 35-37 are blank), a
parameter input (PARAM in positions 1-5) is read. The number of days to be used is specified
by type (budget code, SPC subgroup, SPC and/or application code) in the parameter input. The
FRC input file is processed as follows:
6.43.2.2.2.1. All FRC inputs are edited against the input parameter input selection criteria.
6.43.2.2.2.2. Any FRC inputs which do not meet the selection criteria are processed.
6.43.2.3. Option 3, Memo Due-Out. Due-out detail records are scanned for all memo due-
outs/selected memo due-outs. An FRC input file is not required or used. The due-out detail
records are scanned, and a new due-out fund requirement file is produced for all memo due-outs
or selectively by budget code and/or system designator.

6.43.8. Distribution Instructions. As determined locally.
6.44. Trades Asset Management Report (R05/NGV825).
6.44.1. Purpose. To produce files of required data to build the TRADES model. The TRADES
model in turn will prevent delays in repair and shipment of critical avionics assets to
maintenance organizations supported by TRADES.
6.44.2. Program Logic. Reads and edits the report select image and parameter (if requested). A
501 or 558 reject is printed on the RPS console if all edits are not passed. This program is stock
number driven. Stock numbers may be read in from a data file or they may be selected by
application code. Records are created only for the stock numbers in the data file or for the stock
numbers that match the application code in the select image. It is important to understand this
concept, especially when processing the AWP option. This option creates AWP record E images
for the selected stock numbers. If the selected stock number is an end item, the program does not
locate the bits and pieces for that stock number. The specific logic for each option is listed
below:
6.44.2.1. Due-out Detail Option: Scans the due-out detail records sequentially and creates a disk
file containing due-out record F images. This stand-alone option should only be processed at the
Intermediate Level Maintenance (ILM) bases.
6.44.2.2. Application Code Option: Scans the item records sequentially selecting all records that
contain the same system designator and application code(s) as requested in the report select
image. If the item record is in an ISG, then all stock numbers (masters, interchangeables, and
substitutes) in the group are selected and the applicable records created. Once selected, the
program then scans the item detail set selecting the necessary details and creating asset record A,
asset record B, and intransit record C images. These images are written to the SIFS file. There
are three other records that may be created by the program. These records are the factor record
(record code D), the AWP record (record code E), and the DIFM record (record code G). These
records are only created when requested in the program select image.
6.44.2.3. Stock Number Option: When this option is requested, a 1SN parameter and a data file
are mandatory. Application codes are not used for selection when this option is requested. The
item record is located using the report select system designator and stock number. All records
within the ISG are selected and the applicable records are created. A listing is created containing
stock numbers that are not loaded for the requested system designator.
6.44.2.4. NRTS Rate/Nbr Dmd Option: Creates a factor record D image when the selected item
record has a repair cycle record. These records are only created when requested in the program
select image. These images are written to the SIFS file.
6.44.2.5. AWP Option: Creates an AWP record E image for all due-out details with an UJC of
AR or BR. These records are created for the stock numbers in the data file or for stock numbers
with an application code that matches the application code in the program select image. These
records are written to the SIFS file.
6.44.2.6. DIFM RRC Option: Creates a DIFM record(s) G image when the selected item record
has DIFM details loaded. These records are written to the SIFS file.

6.45. OMB A-76 Cost Comparison (R06/NGV877).
6.45.1. Purpose. To provide data as a tool to develop source of supply materiel mark-up cost
comparison factors required by the Office Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB will use
this data to compare in-house support to contracted support.
6.45.2. Program Logic.
6.45.2.1. The program source scans the item record area selecting records with a system
designator equal to the one entered in the report select image and a budget code equal to 1, 8, or
9. The total dollar value of recurring demands is computed by multiplying the recurring

demands by the unit price. If the item is a repair cycle (ERRCD equal to XD or XF), the dollar
value is discounted by the percent of base repair.
6.45.2.2. The following data will be stratified:
6.45.2.2.1. Element of expense/investment code (EEIC) 600: Budget code equal to 9 and

6.49. Monetary Impact (R11/NGV886).
6.49.1. Purpose. To provide Air Force managers a product that computes and portrays the
potential monetary impact before actual application. This allows comparison against available
SMAG ordering authority. MSSL developed by MAJCOMs can also be tailored to an individual
SBSS database and reinput to determine SMAG impact.
6.49.2. Program Logic. Based upon the option requested in the report select and the action code
in the XCH input image, one of the following procedures will be performed:
6.49.2.1. ISSL Initial/Add Requirement Action Code. The ISSL data file is input as follows:
6.49.2.1.1. If the item record is not loaded, the input quantity will be multiplied by the input unit
price and the result will be added to applicable accumulators.
6.49.2.1.2. If the item record is loaded, the input quantity will be compared to the computed
requisition objective. Based on the comparison, the following actions are accomplished:
6.49.2.1.2.1. If the present level is equal to or greater than the input quantity, the input will not
be considered when computing the monetary impact.
6.49.2.1.2.2. If the requisition objective is less than the input quantity, the difference will be
multiplied by the item record unit price, and the result added to applicable accumulators.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                         485

6.49.2.2. ISSL Change Requirement Action Code. The ISSL data file is input as follows:
6.49.2.2.1. If a matching special level detail record is not loaded, the input will be printed with a
phrase DETAIL NOT LOADED, and the input quantity and unit price will be multiplied and the
result added to the applicable accumulators.
6.49.2.2.2. If a matching special level detail record is loaded, the input quantity will be
compared to the detail record quantity, and the following actions will be accomplished:
6.49.2.2.2.1. If the input quantity and the detail quantity are equal, the input will not be printed
or used to compute monetary impact.
6.49.2.2.2.2. If the input quantity is less than the detail record quantity, the difference is
multiplied by the item record unit price, and the result is subtracted from applicable
accumulators.
6.49.2.2.2.3. If the input quantity is greater than the detail record quantity, the difference is
multiplied by the item record unit price, and the result is added to applicable accumulators.
6.49.2.3. ISSL Delete Requirement Action Code. The ISSL data file is input as follows:
6.49.2.3.1. If a matching special level detail record is not loaded, the input is bypassed.
6.49.2.3.2. If a matching special level detail record is loaded, the detail quantity and unit price
will be multiplied and the result subtracted from the applicable accumulators.
6.49.2.4. MAJCOM MSSL Option.
6.49.2.4.1. The MAJCOM MSSL data field is read and edited. The ERRCD is edited, and a flag
is set to identify the input as EOQ or repair cycle (RCR).
6.49.2.4.1.1. The input images are further screened against the item and detail record area, and if
the item record is a bachelor item or is not loaded, the input image is saved for further
processing.
6.49.2.4.1.2. For those inputs related in an ISG with relationship code M or I, the master stock
number from the ISG overlays the stock number in the input image. Then the modified input
image with the ISG number is saved for further processing.
6.49.2.4.2. The saved records are sorted in ERRCD, ISG, and stock number sequence. The
sorted records are then read and the following actions accomplished:
6.49.2.4.2.1. Records with the same stock number and/or ISG are consolidated.
6.49.2.4.2.2. During the consolidation phase, RCR MSSL item data images (tailored to the
individual SBSS database) are produced for all repair cycle items.

6.50.2. Program Logic.
6.50.2.1. Selects item records within the parameters specified in the report parameter format,
with the exception of those records containing issue exception codes 3, 6, E, or K.
6.50.2.2. Builds a sort record for each record showing a serviceable balance. The program
writes these records to a sort file, and the item record is frozen with a C freeze code( unless a
freeze code of C, Q, L, or an I is already assigned, then a (“I”) 469 reject, or a (“C”,”Q”,”L”) 540
reject would apply). The program adds the quantity on hand to the serviceable balance if a
WRM balance is positive and a storage location is not present on the detail for any related
WRM/WCDO or IRSP details.
6.50.2.3. Sorts selected records in warehouse location sequence.
6.50.2.4. Prints the Inventory Count Listing and builds the CIC-1RS-EIC-INVENTORY records
on the database.

6.50.7.3. Hand-Held Terminal Data File: A data file containing CIC-INVENTORY (532)
records is created when requested. The following console message is displayed on the RPS
console and the last page of the R12. See Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.6. RPS Console Message.
FILE #GV0<ALN>!!*GV831UI7%%. WAS CREATED WITH XXXXXXX RECORDS FOR
DOWNLOAD.
             # equals your gang.
             <ALN> equals ALN for ALN bases and DPC for non-ALN bases.
             !! equals the system designator.
             %% equals the file number (01 through 99).

6.50.7.3.1. The maximum number of files that can be catalogued per system designator is 99.
When the maximum number of files is reached, a message is output on the RPS console
informing the operator that it is necessary to delete some of the older files. The report will not
process until a sufficient number of files are deleted.
6.50.7.3.2. XXXXXXX equals the number of records in the data file.
6.50.8. Distribution Instructions. As determined locally.
6.51. Weapon System Mission Change/Deactivation Program (R13/NGV890).
6.51.1. Purpose. To create a SIFS interface file and report demand data (based on the
percentage of the weapon systems remaining active) to the Defense Logistics Agency when
weapon system deactivation or transfer actions are implemented.
6.51.2. Program Logic.
6.51.2.1. Reads and edits the program select image to ensure that a system designator was
entered. If not, it produces a 503 reject notice and prints a clear text message on the RPS console
to inform the requester that a system designator is mandatory. Once the program select image
passes edits, it checks for the parameter image(s) and writes the SRDs from the parameter
images into a table for later comparison.
6.51.2.2. Reads the BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record and locates the appropriate SRAN for the
system designator in the program select image. This SRAN is written to the output image
created by this report. It produces an R002 reject notice if a SRAN does not exist for the input
system designator.
6.51.2.3. Selects item records with routing identifier S(XX) and a 101-CMLTV-RECURRING-
DEMANDS field greater than zero.
6.51.2.4. Checks for an SRD-CONSUMPTION record (107). If no SRD consumption records
exist, it creates an output XG1 image. Uses the total of the 101-NBR-OF-DEMANDS-
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014                                     489

CURRENT, 101-NBR-OF-DMDS-PAST-6 MONTHS, and 101-NBR-OF-DMDS-PAST-7-12-
MOS in the number of demands field of the XG1 image. Uses the 101-CMLTV-RECURRING-
DEMANDS in the cumulative recurring demands field of the XG1 image.
6.51.2.4.1. If SRD-CONSUMPTION records exist, it compares the SRDs to the SRD table
created earlier from the parameter image. Creates an XG1 image for each item record with one
or more SRDs that are contained in the SRD table. Uses the formula for computing the adjusted
number of demands in the number of demands field of the XG1 image. Uses the formula for
discounting SRDs in the cumulative recurring demands field of the XG1 image.
6.51.2.5. FORMULA FOR DISCOUNTING SRDs:
6.51.2.5.1. SRD-DDR - SRD Daily Demand Rate
6.51.2.5.2. IR-DMDDAYS - Item Record Demand Days
6.51.2.5.3. SRD-NBRDMDS - SRD Number of Demands
6.51.2.5.4. %WSRA - Percent Weapon System Remaining Active (From Parameter Card)
6.51.2.5.5. NDRA - Number of Demands Remaining Active
6.51.2.5.6. DMDS-REPORTED - Number of Demands Reported to DLA
6.51.2.5.7. 107-QTY / (002-ORDINAL-DATE - 107-DOFD) = SRD-DDR
6.51.2.5.8. 002-ORDINAL-DATE - 101-DATE-OF-FIRST-DEMAND = IR-DMDDAYS
6.51.2.5.9. SRD-DDR * IR-DMDDAYS = SRD-NBRDMDS
6.51.2.5.10. SRD-NBRDMDS * %WSRA (FROM PARA) = NDRA
6.51.2.5.11. 101-CMLTV-RECURRING-DEMANDS - NDRA = DMDS-REPORTED
6.51.2.6. FORMULA FOR ADJUSTED NUMBER OF DEMANDS:
6.51.2.6.1. AUR - Average Units Requested
6.51.2.6.2. ANDR - Adjusted Number of Demands Reported

6.52. Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (R14/NGV902).
6.52.1. Purpose.
6.52.1.1. To aid in control of in-use equipment by providing the necessary data to maintain
surveillance.
6.52.1.2. To serve as a custody receipt when signed by the custodian and to identify quantities
authorized and on-hand within specific organizations and shops.
6.52.1.3. To facilitate reconciliation of record balances with quantities in possession of the
custodians.
6.52.1.4. To create TRIC EIC images and a data file of CIC-INVENTORY (532) records.
6.52.1.5. To identify out-of-balance conditions which require corrective action by providing
appropriate error messages.
6.52.1.6. To identify dollar requirements of specific organizations/shops and to identify mission-
essential equipment for procurement programs when funds are limited.
6.52.1.7. To provide the custodian document register used in identifying excesses within
specific organizations/shops for redistribution, turn-in action, realignment to fill shortages,
and/or authorization adjustments when applicable.
6.52.2. Program Logic.
6.52.2.1. Reads the authorized/in-use and item/detail areas and builds sort records for
authorized/in-use and REM vehicles only detail records. To compile necessary data for the
output products, the program also reads organization cost center records, item records, and due-
out detail records.
6.52.2.2. Sorts the selected records by system designator, organization/shop code, document
serial number, vehicle registration number, and prime/sub indicator. When the stock number sort
option is requested, the records are sorted by system designator, organization/shop code, prime
stock number, substitute stock number, and prime/sub indicator.
6.52.2.3. Produces an EIC image for each detail record selected when the EIC option is
requested. Also creates a data file of CIC-INVENTORY (532) records to allow direct load to
HHTs. The program updates the line items counted, record balance, and dollar value record
balance of the inventory accuracy record for each EIC image produced.
6.52.2.4. Prints the error messages when the CA/CRL balancing option is requested for out-of-
balance detail records. The program prints the statement OUT OF BALANCE followed by the
appropriate error message:
6.52.2.4.1. EXCESS.
6.52.2.4.2. EXCESS + D/O.
6.52.2.4.3. QTY O/H LESS THAN AUTH.

6.52.2.5. Prints the totals based upon the option(s) chosen in the report select input. If substitute
in-use detail records exist for which there are no preferred in-use detail records, then asterisks (*)
will be printed in the total fields. Multiple component items (item code M) will cause asterisks
(*) to be printed in the unit/dollar value short field only. The program will print the following
totals for each shop code:
6.52.2.5.1. Total units authorized, in-use, short, and excess.
6.52.2.5.2. Total dollar value authorized, in-use, short, and excess.
6.52.2.5.3. Total TRIC EIC images stored.
6.52.2.5.4. Total number of item code P detail records. (This is printed following each CA/CRL
Document Register.)
6.52.2.5.5. Appropriate certification statements for custodian signatures.
6.52.2.6. NWRM Listing Option (position 16):
6.52.2.6.1. Enter a dash (-) to select NWRM item records (NWRM Indicator ‘Q’).
6.52.2.6.2. This option will pull data from item record to select assets with a NWRM Indicator
of Q loaded and the applicable serialized control details that are loaded as in-use equipment.
6.52.2.6.3. This option will not work with the Inventory option. It is only used with the other
options available and will list only NWRM items loaded against an in-use equipment detail. You
may use any other option available to inventory your assets but 531 and 532 inventory records
will never be created with this program for these assets.
6.52.3. Special Instructions.
6.52.3.1. Primary/Secondary: If positions 30 or 31 of the report select input contains Y, then the
report must be processed on the primary database. Otherwise, it must be processed on the
secondary database.
6.52.3.2. Restart Procedures: See Ch 5.
6.52.3.3. Satellite: If system designators A1 through A9 have an authorized output queue, the
output will be directed automatically to the remote location. If no queue is loaded, the output
will be produced at the CSB.

6.54.1. Purpose.
6.54.1.1. To aid in the physical count of property by providing an output file.
6.54.1.2. To facilitate control of the inventory by providing a listing. The inventory listing
should be used only by the inventory supervisors for control and information and only when
further research is required.
6.54.2. Program Logic.
6.54.2.1. Selects all item records within the warehouse location and system designator specified
in the report select format. Inventory may use sample inventory procedures, if the item record
issue exception code is not E, K, 3, or 6 or the type SRAN is not equal to E or the controlled item
code is equal to U or 7, the record will be considered for sample inventory. The number of
records selected must be greater than 151 but must not exceed 3,200.
6.54.2.2. Selects a predetermined number of records to perform the physical count. The
program writes these records to a sort file. If the record is selected for the physical count, the
item record is frozen with a C freeze code. If the record is not selected for the physical count,
the item record date of last inventory is updated with the current date. All records included in
this sample, whether selected for physical inventory or not, will have the item record Sample
Inventory Lot Flag updated with the applicable sample inventory code.
6.54.2.3. Adds the quantity on hand to the serviceable balance before the record is written to the
sort file if a storage location is not present on the detail for any related WRM WCDO or IRSP
details.
6.54.2.4. Updates the line items counted, recorded balance, and dollar value of recorded balance
on the inventory accuracy account BE complete record. Updates the total items all lots, total
items sampled, recorded balance, and dollar value of recorded balance on the inventory accuracy
account BE sample record. Updates the system designator, warehouse location from, warehouse
location to, repair cycle (RC) with a location, EOQ with a location, total records with a location,
RC 1RS inputs produced, EOQ 1RS inputs produced, total 1RS inputs produced, total errors

6.54.7.3.1. The maximum number of files that can be catalogued per system designator is 99.
When the maximum number of files is reached, a message is output on the RPS console
informing the operator that it is necessary to delete some of the older files. The report will not
process until a sufficient number of files are deleted.
6.54.7.3.2. XXXXXXX equals the number of records in the data file.
6.54.8. Distribution Instructions. As determined locally.
6.54.9. Sample Inventory Physical Count Selection Criteria. The following are the lot and
sample sizes used for the R17 Sample Inventory program.
Note: Sample Inventories are no longer used. Information retained for references purposes
only.

Table 6.93. Lot and Sample Size.
Lot Size     Sample
             Size
151-280      32
281-500      50
501-1200     80
1201-3200    125


6.54.9.1. Lot Size: If the lot size is less than 151 or greater than 3200, the program will reject
the input image.
6.54.9.2. Sample Size: The sample size may vary by one more or one less depending on the
actual lot size selected. The program uses rounding in the computation for each class which will
in some cases increase or decrease the total by one.
6.54.10. Sample Computation By Class. Under the new ABC analysis theory, the lot size will
be broken down into three classes to place more emphasis on high cost/high demand and high
mission impact items. The following shows the percentage and formula for each class in the
sample computation using a minimum lot size of 151.

Table 6.94. Sample Computation By Class.
Class     Percentage            Lot Size                    # Items
 A           20%             X   151                    =   30.2 ROUNDED 30
 B           30%             X   151                    =   45.3 ROUNDED 45
 C           50%             X   151                    =   75.5 ROUNDED 76


To establish the order for placing the items in the proper class, the item's unit price is multiplied
by the total annual demands. The classes are then filled starting with the highest dollar value
placed in class A and the lowest in class C. With the lot size being 151, we now select 32 of
these records for the physical inventory. The following shows the percentage and formula for
each class in the sample computation using a sample size of 32.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      501


Table 6.95. Sample Computation By Class.
Class     Percentage            Lot Size                 # Items
 A           50%             X    32                 =   16
 B           30%             X    32                 =   9.6 ROUNDED 10
 C           20%             X    32                 =   6.4 ROUNDED 6


Within class A, some weight is given to high mission essentiality items. The following shows
the percentage and formula for class A to determine how many SPC 1 and 2 items will be
selected as a minimum. If there are not enough SPC 1 and 2 items in class A, the program will
include what there is and then default to the next criteria.

Table 6.96. Sample Computation By Class.
Class         Percentage           Class Size                  # Items
SPC 1 & 2       20%             X    16                    =   3.2 ROUNDED 3
HIGH            80%             X    16                    =   12.8 ROUNDED 13

6.55. SBSS/DCAPES Interface Report (R18/NGV806).
6.55.1. Purpose.
6.55.1.1. To provide Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments
(DCAPES)an output data file with current consumables, equipment, and vehicle data for the
purpose of producing capability and asset posture reports.
Note: In accordance with AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program the LRS CC/AO
will run the R18 report for each Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) on Friday of each week.
The Oklahoma City Mega center send all R18 raw data to Gunter AFB where some pre-
processing steps will take place. After the data has been pre-processed, Gunter will then FTP the
data to Langley AFB. Depending on the contingency situation, the MAJCOM may request the
R18 report to be run daily.
6.55.1.2. To assist in performing WCDO, WRM equipment, and vehicle asset reconciliation and
to identify WCDO/WRM equipment and vehicle shortages and excesses.
6.55.2. Program Logic.
6.55.2.1. The program will be executed by input of the R18 report select record An input
parameter is required on certain options when adding or deleting FSC in the selection criteria.
6.55.2.2. This program will produce four (4) different output record formats. The record
formats are titled:
6.55.2.2.1. WCDO/POS Record
6.55.2.2.2. WRM Equipment Record
6.55.2.2.3. REM Record
6.55.2.2.4. ORG-ID Record
6.55.2.3. WCDO/POS Record: Creates a WCDO/POS record using the following criteria:
6.55.2.3.1. Selects all prime WCDO detail records, builds a WCDO/POS, and accumulates the
authorized and on-hand quantities. In addition, it includes all substitute WCDO on-hand
quantities for those details having the same document number. The program then accumulates

the quantities for the item record (101) in positions 44-48, Unserviceable DIFM (204) in
positions 69-73, Supply Point (216) in positions 74-78, and Special Purpose Asset (SPRAM 225)
having a 225-TYPE-SPRAM-CODE of D for the prime WCDO stock numbers ISG in positions
79-83.
6.55.2.3.2. The program also creates a WCDO/POS record for all prime SPRAM details having
a 225-TYPE-SPRAM-CODE of D that are not within a prime WCDO detail ISG. In addition, it
includes all substitute SPRAM on-hand quantities for those details having the same document
number. The SPRAM on-hand quantities for this record are reflected in positions 44-48, and
positions 79-83 will contain zeros (see the following note). The program also accumulates the
item record, unserviceable DIFM, and supply point quantities for the prime SPRAM details stock
numbers ISG.
Note: This record will place all applicable SPRAM detail information within the fields identified
as WCDO. All fields not applicable will contain blanks or zeros.
6.55.2.4. WRM EQUIPMENT Record. Selects all 201 records that meet the following selection
criteria. If the 201-USE-CODE equals a B and matches the following federal supply
classifications (see below), a record is created. If the 201-USE-CODE equals a C or D and the
201-TYPE-EQUIP-CODE does not equal a V, a record is created. If the 201-USE-CODE is not
equal to an A and the 201-TYPE-EQUIP-CODE does not equal a V, a record is also created.
MAJCOM reporting ID data is pulled from the 518 record.
Note: If the 1st position of the 201-DOCUMENT-NBR = “P”, this record will not be selected.

An FSC parameter card will be required to add or delete federal supply classes.
6.55.2.5. REM Record. Selects all 201 records with corresponding 214 records that meet the
following criteria. If the 201-USE-CODE equals a C or D and 201-TYPE-EQUIP-CODE equals
a V or P, a record is created. If the 201-USE-CODE does not equal an A and 201-TYPE-
EQUIP-CODE equals a V and the 201-ITEM-CODE = P, a record is also created. Corresponding
214 record data is used to build the REM record.
Note: If the 1st position of the 201-DOCUMENT-NBR = “P” this document number will not be
selected.
6.55.2.6. ORG-ID Record. Selects 518 organization code data from the organization code used
from the 241 and 201 documents numbers. This record does not have a stand-alone option. All
options will have ORG-ID (record number 4) data included regardless of whatever option was

6.56. Readiness Spares Package (RSP) Availability Report (R20/NGV900).
6.56.1. Purpose.
6.56.1.1. To provide commanders a means of reporting RSP availability to their major
commands, a means of assessing readiness after Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) has been
distributed, and a means of assisting in the M-rating process.
6.56.1.2. To identify for base level managers any shortages of airborne/non-airborne mobility
readiness spares packages (AMRSP/NAMRSP), base In-Place Readiness Spares Package
(IRSP), High Priority Mission Support Kits (HPMSK), or special spares (Bare Base, Harvest
Eagle, Southwest Asia, station sets, and housekeeping sets).
6.56.2. Program Logic.
6.56.2.1. Reads the MRSP/IRSP-Control records and builds a
AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Special Spares priority table consisting of the organization
code, the shop code, the system designator, and the assigned priority.
6.56.2.2. Checks for any input parameters. The program verifies the organization code of each
parameter input against the priority table. When the program fails to find a parameter
organization code in the priority table, it will reject the parameter.
6.56.2.3. Scans through the item/detail area of the database for IRSP, AMRSP/NAMRSP,
Special Spares, and HPMSK prime details. For each prime detail found, the program verifies the
organization code against the AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Special Spares priority table.
The program excludes details for the following conditions:
6.56.2.3.1. If the detail's organization code does not match any on the priority table, the whole
detail is considered unauthorized and is bypassed.
6.56.2.3.2. If 1AH or 1AJ parameters are present, the program checks to see if the detail is to be
excluded from the processing run.
6.56.2.4. Builds a partial sort key for the selected prime
AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Spares detail. The program compares the detail's authorized
quantity (wartime requirement quantity (WTR) for IRSP detail) to the on-hand quantity and
performs the following actions:
6.56.2.4.1. If the quantities are equal, processing is transferred to the Interchangeable and
Substitute Group (ISG) search.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                         507

6.56.2.4.2. If the quantities are unequal, the program initiates a search for substitute details with
the same document number.
6.56.2.5. Adds its on-hand quantity to an accumulator as each matching substitute detail is
located. At the end of the chain, the program adds the prime detail's on-hand quantity to the
accumulator, and it compares the combined total to the prime's authorized (WTR for IRSP)
quantity. If the total is still unequal, the program marks the sort key as a shortage and stores the
authorized quantity, minus the accumulator quantity, on the sort key as a shortage.
6.56.2.6. Locates the item records of each of the prime detail's stock number in the ISG search.
The program then checks each item record for the ISG number. If the number is present, the
program writes the ISG number, relationship code, and the ISG master stock number to the sort
key record. If the ISG number field is blank, then the program writes the item record's stock
number to the sort key record as the ISG master stock number. The program then writes the sort
key to the sort file.
6.56.2.7. Sorts the sort key records into system designator, stock number, and
AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Special Spares priority sequence.
6.56.2.8. Accumulates POS assets based on the stock number in the sort file. POS assets are the
item record's serviceable balance, supply point on-hand, MSK on-hand, and DIFM assets. The
program determines the POS DIFM quantity by multiplying the total available DIFM assets by
the percent of base repair. Note that the program does not accumulate DIFM assets under the
following conditions:
6.56.2.8.1. If the DIFM flag does not equal zero or the DIFM status code is equal to AWP, all
DIFM assets are ignored.
6.56.2.8.2. If the repair cycle record contains NRTS code 1 data or 102-NRTS-1-IND contains
the character A, DIFM assets for that stock number are ignored.
6.56.2.9. Stores item record data of the detail's stock number on the sort key. If a shortage
exists, the program distributes POS assets in item record balance, on-hand supply point, MSK
on-hand sequence. The shortage is recomputed again. Any quantity remaining becomes the
SHORT WITHOUT DIFM quantity on the sort key record. If a shortage still exists, DIFM
assets, if applicable, are applied. The program then recomputes the shortage again, and any
remaining quantity becomes the SHORT WITH DIFM quantity on the sort key record. Finally,
the program writes the short key record to the sort file, regardless of the short or no-short
condition.
6.56.2.10. Sorts the sort key records a second time in system designator,
AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Special Spares priority, sort flag, shortage quantity, and
document number sequence.
6.56.2.11. Prints details and the associated POS asset distribution based upon the select input
format threshold quantity. But regardless of the print control, the program accumulates totals for
all details. These totals are printed when the shop code,
AMRSP/NAMRSP/IRSP/HPMSK/Special Spares priority, or system designator changes. Each
total line contains the percentage of on-hand assets divided by the authorized computed. If 1AG
parameters were utilized, the program tallies totals for the specified organization/shop codes in a
separate accumulator. The program prints the 1AG parameter(s) and the grand total of the
accumulator prior to the system designator grand totals.
6.56.3. Special Instructions.
6.56.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Primary and secondary. If processed on the primary database,
can be in the twilight or reports mode.

6.58.1.1. To list all item records and their related repair cycle and detail records.
6.58.1.2. To use as a historical document of the computer database status immediately following
conversion to the computer and as a related audit to verify conversion actions.
6.58.2. Program Logic.
6.58.2.1. Reads and sorts item records in sequence by type stock record account code, stock
number, and system designator. The program uses the function DMS CALC with the stock
number to locate related repair cycle records and proper detail records in the item detail area.
6.58.2.2. Edits the records for duplicate item or repair cycle records and detail records related to
the wrong item record. The program records all detected errors for the listing on the RPS
console.
6.58.2.3. Prints a listing of all item records, their related repair cycle and detail records, and
detected errors. The last entry on the listing shows the total number of records by type stock
record account code.
6.58.2.4. Outputs a 519 reject notice if there were no records to select based on the parameter
input. When the part number record stock number does not match the item record stock number,
a 746 reject will be printed on the console typeout. To indicate an error when the record name
does not match the detail, three asterisks (***) will appear in positions 127-129 of the output
listing.

6.60. Special Level Analysis (R24/NGV805).
6.60.1. Purpose. To provide SMAG managers with data to review and determine the impact of
assigned special levels of inventory investment and the dollar value of minimum levels.
6.60.2. Program Logic.
6.60.2.1. Scans and selects applicable special level details. The program selects item records
from the item/detail record area which have a type level code of A, B, C, E, or F. There are two
options in the parameter input which can restrict the selection of item records:
6.60.2.1.1. If positions 19-28 contain specific excess exception codes or if positions 29-38
contain specific application codes, the program will select only those item records which have
the specified codes. If positions 19-38 are left blank, the program will select records regardless
of their excess exception or application codes.
6.60.2.1.2. If position 1 contains C and a subsequent data input file contains specific stock
numbers, the program will select only those item records which have the specified stock
numbers. If position 1 is left blank, the program will select records regardless of their stock
numbers.

6.60.2.2. Lists the special level items. The program performs the actions listed below when the
following conditions apply:
6.60.2.2.1. If more than one special level detail is located for the same stock number and system
designator, the program combines and prints the quantities as one entry.
6.60.2.2.2. If program factor details are found, the program prints one of the following codes to
identify the type of detail: G--Gain; H--Loss; or * (asterisk)--Gain and Loss.
6.60.2.3. Lists ISG data for master items which meet the selection criteria. The program
computes the number of demands, cumulative recurring demands, date of first demand, and date
of last demand based on the ISG within a specific system designator. When a master item does
not meet selection criteria, interchangeable items are printed with singular data.
6.60.2.4. Accumulates and prints totals of the minimum level only, the minimum level greater
than demand level, and the overall demand level for each of the following:
6.60.2.4.1. Repair cycle and economic order quantity.

6.61. SPRAM System (R25/NGV893).
6.61.1. Purpose.
6.61.1.1. To validate authorization and provide asset accountability/visibility of the following:
expendable depot level repair (XD)/expendable field isolation spares, shop standard spares,
training spares, stand-alone spares, test station spares, -21 Technical Order (TO)/alternate
mission equipment spares, other SPRAM spares, and other type spares.

6.61.1.2. To list all on-hand and due-out authorized items, as well as summary data, relative to
shortages and excesses.
6.61.1.3. To facilitate reconciliation of record balances by providing a listing of quantities in the
possession of the custodian.
6.61.1.4. To aid the inventory of SPRAM assets by providing the capability to produce a TRIC
EIC image. When this option is used, the inventory accuracy record will be updated with the
line items counted, record balance, and dollar value record balance for each EIC image
produced.
6.61.2. Program Logic.
6.61.2.1. Edits the select input for validity and requested options.
6.61.2.2. Scans the item/detail area, and selects SPRAM detail records and related due-out detail
records based upon the options in the report select input. The program locates the appropriate
item record to provide additional data, and it builds sort keys. The program then sorts keys in
system designator, organization, shop code, and item number (last four positions of the document
number) sequence.
6.61.2.3. Outputs a reject if no detail records are found meeting the criteria of the report select
input.
6.61.2.4. Reads sorted detail records one at a time. For each item number, the program prints
the preferred detail first, followed by any substitutes on hand, and then, related due-out detail
records. Page eject occurs upon change of organization and/or shop identification.
6.61.2.5. Prints a summary by item number. Whenever the on-hand plus due-out quantity
exceeds the authorized quantity, the program prints a notice of quantity excess on the listing.
The program also identifies and prints quantities short.
6.61.2.6. Prints summaries by shop code and prints an overall summary upon change of the
organization code and system designator. If the item record dollar values of the particular item
are not included in the dollar totals (as indicated by a blank unit price on the listing), then unit
totals are included. The program accumulates dollar totals and prints them using the unit price of
the prime item only. Summary totals are accumulated and printed by the type SPRAM flag as
follows:
6.61.2.6.1. Total number of line items authorized in this shop.
6.61.2.6.2. Number of authorized line items with on-hand balance.
6.61.2.6.3. Total number of line items short.
6.61.2.6.4. Total number of units excess.
6.61.2.6.5. Dollar value of authorized units.
6.61.2.6.6. Dollar value of line items with on-hand balance.
6.61.2.6.7. Dollar value of units excess.
6.61.2.6.8. Dollar value of unit short.
6.61.2.6.9. EIC images.
Note: If an item record could not be located on a substitute item, the phrase I/R NOT
LOCATED will appear under the nomenclature field. Totals will not be included for this item.
6.61.2.7. NWRM Listing Option (position 20):
6.61.2.7.1. Enter a dash (-) to select NWRM item records (NWRM Indicator ‘Q’).
6.61.2.7.2. This option will pull data from item record to select assets with a NWRM Indicator
of Q loaded and the applicable serialized control details that are loaded against a SPRAM asset.
6.61.2.7.3. This option will not work with the Inventory option. It is only used with the other
options available and will list only NWRM items loaded against a Supply Point asset. You may

use any other option available to Inventory your assets but 531 and 532 inventory records will
never be created with this program for these assets.
6.61.3. Special Instructions.
6.61.3.1. Primary/Secondary: The program must be processed according to the select input as
follows:
6.61.3.1.1. If positions 32 or 80 contain a dash (-), the program must be processed in the reports
mode on the primary database.
6.61.3.1.2. If position 32 contains a blank, the program must be processed on the secondary
database.

    6.61.7.3. Hand-Held Terminal Data File: A data file containing EIC-INVENTORY (232)
    images is created when requested. The following console message is displayed on the RPS
    console and the last page of the R25 listing. See Figure 6.10.

    Figure 6.10. RPS Console Image.
1   FILE #GV0<ALN>!!*GV893UI7%%. WAS CREATED WITH XXXXXXX RECORDS FOR
2   DOWNLOAD.
3                 . # equals your gang.
4                  <ALN> equals ALN for ALN bases and DPC for non-ALN bases.

    6.61.7.3.1. The maximum number of files that can be catalogued per system designator is 99.
    When the maximum number of files is reached, a message is output on the RPS console
    informing the operator that it is necessary to delete some of the older files. The report will not
    process until a sufficient number of files are deleted.
    6.61.7.3.2. XXXXXXX equal the number of records in the data file.
    6.61.8. Distribution Instructions. Forward a copy to the requester.
    6.62. Personal Computer-Aircraft Sustainability Model (R26/NGV776).
    6.62.1. Purpose. To provide available stock levels in the SBSS for upload to the Personal
    Computer-Aircraft Sustainability Model (PC-ASM). PC-ASM will allow assessment of the
    sortie generation capability of a MRSP, IRSP, or NARSP. It also will allow units to build a
    database of components that affect peacetime sortie generation. With this database, units can
    predict the ability of base level stocks to support the monthly flying hours program.
    6.62.2. Program Logic. This program has four main options for selecting records, wartime
    retrieval, wartime data file retrieval, POS retrieval, and data retrieval. These retrieval options
    will be explained in detail as follows:
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        529

6.62.2.1. Wartime Retrieval. This option scans the 025-MRSP/IRSP-CONTROL records
sequentially and compares the organization/shop code stored in the 025-CALC-KEY with the
organization/shop code(s) in the program parameter image(s). When the organization/shop
code(s) are equal, the records in the set are read to ensure that they are 239-AIRBORNE-MRSP,
240-WRM-IRSP-SPARES or 237-NON-AIRBORNE-MRSP. The item record is located to
obtain the ITEM-DTLS set. This set is read to obtain all details needed to build a W type record
for this stock number. If the same stock number is selected again at a later time for a different
document number it will be ignored because a W type record has already been built for this stock
number. There will only be one W type record for each stock number in the output file. When a
system designator is specified in the program select image, POS data will only be accumulated
for that system designator; otherwise, POS data for all system designators will be combined into
one P type record. When the item record has an ISG number a P type record for each stock
number within the ISG that passes the least acceptable flag compare will be created. Only one P
type record will be built for each stock number. A W type record will only be built for stock
numbers that have a 237, 239 or 240 detail record loaded.
6.62.2.2. Wartime Data File Retrieval: This option allows the user to select MRSP/IRSP data
for specific stock numbers using a stock number file provided by the user. Once the item record
is located, all applicable 237-NON-AIRBORNE-MRSP, 239-AIRBORNE-MRSP, and 240-
WRM-IRSP-SPARES details are read and an F type record is created for this stock number.
There will be only one F type record for each stock number in the output file. If the item record
is not located, the stock number will be bypassed and an F type record will not be created for this
stock number. When a system designator is specified in the program select image, POS data will
only be accumulated for that system designator, otherwise POS data for all system designators:
will be combined into one P type record. When the item record has an ISG number, a P type
record for each stock number within the ISG that passes the least acceptable flag compare is
created. Only one P type record will be built for each stock number.
6.62.2.3. POS Retrieval. The POS retrieval provides the user with an option to select POS data
for specific stock numbers in addition to the wartime retrieval option or as a stand-alone option.
If the wartime data file retrieval option is requested, POS data will be provided. When a system
designator is specified in the program select image, POS data will only be accumulated for that
system designator; otherwise, POS data for all system designators will be combined into one P
type record. When the item record has an ISG number, a P type record for each stock number
within the ISG that passes the least acceptable flag compare is created. If a P type record has
already been created for a stock number, it will be ignored.
6.62.2.4. Data Retrieval. This option is used when specific item record, repair cycle record, and
routing identifier record data is desired as specified in the D type record format. This option uses
the same stock number file as the wartime data file and/or POS retrieval options when requested.
This option may also be used as a stand-alone option. When the program select image contains a
system designator, only data for that system designator will be retrieved; otherwise, data for all
system designators will be combined into one D type record. When the item record has an ISG
number, a D type record will be built for each stock number within the ISG. If a D type record
has already been created for a stock number, it will be ignored.
6.62.2.5. IMPORTANT. POS data will only be accumulated for stock numbers where the 101-
SOURCE-CODE has an equal or greater value than the least acceptable flag from the
prime/authorized kit detail record (237/239/240). When the prime/authorized kit detail record
least acceptable flag is blank, the 101-SOURCE-CODE from the owner stock number will be
530                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

used as the least acceptable flag for accumulating POS data within an ISG. Additionally, the
wartime data file retrieval option will use the 101-SOURCE-CODE of the data file stock number
as the least acceptable flag when accumulating POS data within an ISG.
6.62.3. Special Instructions.

Notes:
1. Enter the system designator for a specific selection or leave blank for all system designators.
2. Enter the mission design series (MDS) of the type of aircraft that is supported. A minimum
of three alpha/numeric characters must be used. Left justify your entry. This entry is mandatory.
3. Enter a W if the wartime retrieval option is desired. When this option is processed, a 1WP
parameter must be used. This option may not be requested in conjunction with the wartime data
file retrieval option.
4. Enter a P if the POS retrieval option is desired. When this option is requested, a 1SN
parameter must be used.
5. Enter a D if the data retrieval option is desired. When this option is requested without the P
option, you must have a 1SN parameter. If the D, P and F options are used together, the same
1SN parameter and stock number file will be used. Only one 1SN parameter can be used per
run.
6. Enter an F if the wartime data file retrieval option is desired. When this option is requested,
you must have a 1SN parameter. This option may not be used in conjunction with the wartime
retrieval option. The data retrieval option is the only option that may be requested with this
option, as the POS retrieval option is assumed.

Notes:
1. This field is used to tell the program which organization codes are to be combined. The
group selector must be numeric from 1 to 6. There can be as many of each number as you like;
however, they must be in order from 1 to 6. Totals for group selector 1, regardless of whether it
is MRSP or IRSP, will appear in the WRM authorized/on-hand/deployed quantity columns for
MRSP/IRSP GROUP 1. Group selector 2 will appear in columns for MRSP/IRSP GROUP 2,
etc. Remember, a maximum of six group selectors is all that can be used per run. The following
example may offer some assistance in understanding the use of this parameter.

In this example, stock from shop codes SC, SD, SE, and SF from organization code 100 will be
totaled with shop codes SC, SD, SE, and SF from organization code 150. The sum will appear
under field MRSP/IRSP GROUP 1 of the W type record. Stock for organization code 540 will
be totaled with shop codes FA, FB, FC, and FD from organization code 760. The sum will
appear under field MRSP/IRSP GROUP 2 of the W type record.
2. Enter the desired organization code. Only one organization code can be used in each
parameter image.
3. Enter the desired shop code(s) or leave blank for all. A maximum of 36 shop codes can be
used in each parameter image.

code, and use code. Note that the program allows only ten ASC codes; however, ASC 414 will
be provided automatically.
6.63.2.3. Computes total dollar values by using the preferred item cost. The computations are
based on individual authorizations. Note that an unfunded requirement for an organization code
and an overall total could be on the listing if the applicable due-outs and on-hand are greater than
the dollar value authorized. In this case, applicable assets should be reviewed for redistribution
and/or cancellation of the due-outs, and the dollar values should be adjusted accordingly.
6.63.2.4. Prints total dollar values of the following:
6.63.2.4.1. Dollar value firm due-outs, initial and replacement EAID.
6.63.2.4.2. Dollar value memo due-outs, initial and replacement EAID.
6.63.2.4.3. Dollar value firm due-outs, initial and replacement non-EAID.

Notes:
1. Single space between each word in the title.
2. To select records with a specific system designator, enter the system designator in positions
35-36. To select records for all system designators, leave positions 35-36 blank. The program
will prepare data file outputs and listings for each system designator loaded. Due to the length of
the report and the required processing time, this option should be used only when absolutely
necessary.
3. To produce due-out data by FSG within command code, enter a dash in position 65 . If this
option is chosen, type image code A data file output will be produced for each FSG, and type
image code B data file output will be output for total dollar value within system designator.
4. To produce due-out data by ASC within organization code, enter a dash (-) in position 66 .
Up to ten ASCs may be selected by using a parameter input. If no parameter input is used, all
ASCs will be selected. ASC 414 will be provided automatically. If data file output is selected
(position 69), type image code C data file outputs will be produced for each ASC and a total data
file image by system designator with blank ASC field. The system designator total data file
image should be removed prior to forwarding output to MAJCOM.
5. To produce due-out data by use code within an organization, enter a dash (-) in position 67. If
data file output is selected (position 69), type image code D data file output will be produced for
each use code. A total data file image by system designator with a blank use code field will also
be produced. The system designator total data file image should be removed prior to forwarding
output to MAJCOM.
6. To produce due-out data by organization code, enter a dash (-) in position 68. Only listings
are produced using this option.
7. To produce a data file output, enter a dash (-) in position 69.
8. To use parameter input selection by ASC, enter a dash in position 70. Position 70 may be
used with position 66 select option only. Note that the program does not read the parameter
input until it has determined that REJ 519 (NO RCDS TO BE PROC BASED UPON CD) will
not occur.
9. A 503 reject notice will occur if any of the following conditions occur:
Positions 65-68 are blank.
Position 66 contains a dash (-), and positions 67-68 are not blank.
Position 66 does not contain a dash (-), and position 70 is not blank.
Position 67 contains a dash (-), and positions 66 and 68 are not blank.
Position 68 contains a dash (-), and positions 66-67 and 69 are not blank.

6.64. MAJCOM Combat Supplies Management System (CSMS) Reconciliation
(R30/NGV895).
6.64.1. Purpose. To provide MAJCOM data images for WRM and POS levels applicable to
WRM assets. These images establish the centralized database at HQ AFMC. The database will
assist in management review, capability assessment, and immediate access for wartime tasking,
control, and circulation of war plan objectives.
6.64.1.1. To ensure that the correct CSMS reportable flag is loaded on the item record and to
validate MRSP/IRSP control record supportable authorized quantity and supportable on-hand
quantity.
6.64.2. Program Logic. This program uses five methods of obtaining or updating data based on
the report format selection. They are described below.
6.64.2.1. If the CSMS Update reportable reconciliation option is desired, the item and detail
record area are scanned. The selected item records will include the interchangeable and
substitution group except when the entire family relationship is a sub-sub relation. Also, this
option will validate the MRSP/IRSP control records, the supportable authorized quantity
(authorized quantity minus the authorized unsupportable quantity), and the supportable quantity
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       541

on-hand (quantity on-hand plus deployed quantity) for the applicable detail records for its
MRSP/IRSP control record. This option will update the CSMS reportable flag, for host and
satellites for the following detail and applicable item records:
6.64.2.1.1. Special Level Detail Record (level justification code 3 only).
6.64.2.1.2. Airborne MRSP Record.
6.64.2.1.3. HPMSK Record.
6.64.2.1.4. Non-Airborne MRSP Record
6.64.2.1.5. Airborne, non-airborne and Civil Engineer IRSP Record.
6.64.2.1.6. MSK Record.
6.64.2.2. If the Total CSMS reconciliation is required, the item and detail record areas are
scanned. Accumulates and formats the selected detail and applicable item records for the
peacetime operating stock data, repair cycle data, and the authorization data from the kit details
into the applicable reporting image. The ISG is included in the process except when the entire
family relation is a sub-sub relation. This option will reconcile all WRM records for the host and
satellites for the following details and applicable item record:
6.64.2.2.1. Authorized In-use (use code A, C, or D).
6.64.2.2.2. REM (use code J, L, or M).
6.64.2.2.3. The detail records described above.
6.64.2.3. If the selective CSMS reconciliation is required, the same logic as in the paragraph
above except, only selecting records based on the Selective CSMS Reconciliation Parameter
XT3 that will be selected from a file established by SIFS interface. This parameter will be
provided by the applicable major command. The XT3 parameter(s) are deleted upon completion
of the program processing.
Note: The CSMS reconciliation option will not pull MSK (232) details.
6.64.2.4. If the Total/Weekly Reconciliation option is required, the same logic is used as the
Total CSMS reconciliation. The only difference is that once this option is processed the Julian
date is stored on the 520 record.
6.64.2.5. If the Bypass/Weekly option is required, it is to be processed only by those host bases
which have no CSMS reportable NSNs. This also includes their satellite accounts. The
Bypass/Weekly option will only be processed with the approval of MAJCOM. This option will
also store the Julian date on the 520 record.
6.64.3. Special Instructions.
6.64.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Secondary. All options must process on the secondary except for
the CSMS Update option (Y in position 66), which must be processed on the primary database.
When the Total/Weekly or Bypass/Weekly options are processed the Julian date is stored on the
520 record. Management notices will be printed from the 7th through the 9th calendar date when
RPTEON is processed stating that the R30 weekly option must process. On the 10th calendar
date RPTEON will reject if the R30 weekly option has not processed. Once the R30
Total/Weekly or the Bypass/Weekly option is processed, the 520 record will be updated with the
current Julian date and RPTEON will process. When the R30 Weekly/Bypass option is
processed, a management notice will print out on the console typeout.

6.65. Due-Out Status Listing (R31/NGV851).
6.65.1. Purpose. To provide data for review of current due-out requirements, as well as optional
due-in and status information for selected due-out detail records. This program has two desirable
features: 1) Because of its many select options and sort sequences, the R31/NGV851 provides
LRS/Materiel Management Activity and Equipment managers with a flexible analytical tool for
use with such overall performance/management reports as the Organization Effectiveness Report
M24/NGV863) and the Monthly Base Supply Management Report (M32/NGV808); 2) The
R31/NGV851 simplifies the review process by allowing the use of a single input program select
format to select and review specific items, organizations, or functional areas experiencing
support problems. The following suggests several of the ways this program can be applied:
6.65.1.1. Bench Stock:
6.65.1.1.1. If the Organization Effectiveness Report (M24/NGV863) shows a high or increasing
bench stock due-out rate for a specific organization, managers can simplify their review by using
the activity organization code with a replenishment requisition flag. The program will review
and analyze the applicable due-outs, associated due-ins, and current status.
6.65.1.1.2. Arranging bench stock due-outs in stock number sequence, reveals items that cause
support problems across a number of different activities. Also, eliminating the activity code
selection may indicate whether higher priority due-outs are preempting bench stock
requirements.
6.65.1.1.3. Trends in the Due-Out Status Listing (R31/NGV851) can be further investigated with
other standard reports. For example, the Item Record Selective Readout (R32/NGV822)
employing a stock number sequence for all items with a bench stock other asset flag and no
demand or adjusted levels can be cross-checked to reveal potential long-range support problems.
6.65.1.1.4. By using sort option 8 in the select format (position 30) and B activity code in the
1RJ parameter (position 33), each supported bench stock can review their current requirements
and status.
6.65.1.2. Weapon System Control Record Check: Organizations may specify up to seven
combinations of SRD serial numbers in the 1RH parameter input. This feature allows the
requester to obtain all associated due-outs, due-ins, and status detail record information in mark-
for sequence. This feature also allows organizations to quickly validate maintenance records
using a single, standardized product.
Note: Users should be aware that the SRD selection, without specified serial numbers, will also
produce a listing of MRSP, MSK, WRM, and supply point due-outs associated with the selected
SRD.
6.65.1.3. Funded Due-Out Verification by Budget Code: The budget code select option of this
report provides LRS/Materiel Management Activity and Equipment customers a ready summary
of SMAG due-outs, their associated due-ins, and status details. The sort sequence groups all
organization requirements applicable to an SRD and provides dollar summaries for firm and
memo due-outs by organization, type stock record account code, and system designator. This
option is a valuable tool when determining probable causes of low fill rate on bench stock or
other high lack of supply response type items.
6.65.2. Program Logic.

6.65.2.1. Scans the record area, selecting all due-out detail records which meet EVERY
condition specified in the parameter select format. If parameter select formats were not
specified, all due-outs will be selected.
6.65.2.2. Sorts the selected records and prints in the sequence specified by the report select
format. If due-ins and status detail records related to due-outs were requested, these also are
printed, following the applicable due-out.
6.65.2.3. Selects and stores any stock replenishment requisitions requested in a sort file. The
due-out print line is flagged with two asterisks (**) under the heading FAD to indicate stock
replenishment due-ins exist for that stock number or ISG.
6.65.2.4. Provides totals based on the sort option requested.
6.65.2.5. Checks to determine if any stock replenishment requisitions were written to the sort
file. The check will occur after the due-out list is completed. If some were written, the program
sorts them in system designator, interchangeable group number, and stock number sequence. If
none were written, the program terminates.
6.65.2.6. Prints the stock replenishment listing with associated status details. Duplicate due-ins
are eliminated as the listing is being printed.
6.65.3. Special Instructions.
6.65.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Process on secondary database.
6.65.3.2. Restart Procedures: See Ch 5.

6.66. Item Record Selective Readout (R32/NGV822).
6.66.1. Purpose. To select item and detail records when item records meet all the criteria
established by a variable parameter input and to provide a readout of current data required for
local management use. The item record format for print is self-explanatory. This program
should be used only when item and detail records are selected based upon item record data.
6.66.2. Program Logic.
6.66.2.1. Sets flags and/or alters instructions to establish the selection criteria specified by the
select and parameter input. Regardless of the method used to screen item records, the program
outputs only those item records meeting all selection criteria established by positions 66-68 of
the select input image 1-34, 37-43, 48-53, 59-65 of the parameter input. For this reason, exercise
care when using the various combinations of available selection criteria. Note the following:
6.66.2.1.1. If all item records with an excess exception code or a shipment exception code are
desired, the program must be run twice, once for each option.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                          547

6.66.2.1.2. If the options for all excess exception codes and all shipment exception codes are
requested together in the same parameter input, the resulting output will consist of only those
item records with both excess and shipment exception codes assigned.
6.66.2.1.3. For edits other than those mentioned below, the parameter input WILL NOT be
rejected when requested selections requested are incompatible. Only the conditions identified
will result in rejects.
EXAMPLE: If the parameter input requests all item records with routing identifier code FKZ
and ERRCD XD1, all item records will be screened. If none meet those conditions, a notice will
be printed indicating no item records could be found meeting the requested parameters.
6.66.2.2. Prints the parameter inputs on the RPS main console immediately after the report
select image. The first 60 positions are printed on the first line, and last 20 on the second line. If
the parameter input is rejected for any condition mentioned, reject notice 558 will be printed on
the RPS main console without a second line of print, and the program will be terminated.
6.66.2.3. Determines the method used to screen item records based on position 35 of the
parameter input.
6.66.2.3.1. When position 35 is blank, the entire item record area is screened for those item
records meeting all selection criteria established in positions 66-68 of the select input and
positions 1-34, 37-43, 48-53, 59-65 of the parameter input.
6.66.2.3.2. When position 35 contains an asterisk (*), item records for stock numbers contained
in subsequent input data images are screened for those (item records) meeting all selection
criteria established by positions 66-68 of the select input image 1-34, 37-43, 48-53, and 59-65 of
the parameter input. When an item record cannot be located for the specified stock number, a
printed notice is produced.
6.66.2.3.3. When using data input, the sort option will not apply. Data input must be in desired
sequence prior to input.
6.66.2.3.4. When using data input (that is the parameter image has an asterisk (*) in position 35
and the select image contains a dash (-) in position 69 and only one system designator in
positions 71-80), the output will be sent to the output device for the system designator entered in
positions 71-72 of the select image. If position 69 is not a dash (-) or if positions 71-80 contain
all blanks or multiple system designators, all output is sent to the CSB host output device.
6.66.2.4. Screens the detail record set of those item records meeting the established selection
criteria, selecting those detail records specified in positions 66-79 of the parameter input.
6.66.2.5. Prints the selected item records in the sequence in which they are located or in stock
number sequence. The desired detail records (as specified in positions 66-79 of the parameter
input) are printed immediately following the item record image. The sequence will be the same
as that found in the detail record set.
6.66.2.6. Reads and edits the sort parameter input data (TRIC 1SJ), if sort options are used.
Reject notice 558 applies for any errors.
6.66.2.7. Rejects the item record parameter input if any of the following conditions apply:
6.66.2.7.1. Position 80 does not contain a period (.).
6.66.2.7.2. Positions 66-79 contain other than detail code or blank.
6.66.2.7.3. Positions 34 and 35 contain other than asterisk (*) or blank.
6.66.2.7.4. Positions 2-5 are not blank:
6.66.2.7.4.1. Positions 2-3 are not numeric when positions 4-5 are blank.
6.66.2.7.4.2. Positions 2-5 are not numeric when position 1 contains S or R.
6.66.2.7.4.3. Positions 2-5 are not numeric.

6.69.2.2.1. If the demand data images (1SD) option is selected, the program accumulates the
necessary demand data information from all sources within the entire family group (if the item is
in an interchangeable and substitute group). The stock number of the master item is output on
the 1SD image.
6.69.2.2.2. If the total item record demand option is selected, 1SD images are produced using
the item record cumulative recurring demands from the master and each interchangeable (if the
stock number is in an ISG) to compute the DDR.
6.69.2.3. Edits the 107 ZZZ record, NSN 9999 00 999 9999. If DOFD is greater than 365 days,
R37 processing will terminate, and console output page will state the A01 option must be
processed prior to R37 processing. When this occurs, A01 update option must be processed to
update SRD ZZZ DOFD.

6.71.2. Program Logic. Scans the item-detail area selecting delinquent shipment suspense
(SSC)/SNC detail records. SSC/SNC details are also selected when a date shipped is provided
but the TCN/GBL is not available. If the CMOS indicator is ON (a C in the 001-CMOS-C field),
Parts 1 through 4 are not produced. Selection criteria for each part are as follows:
6.71.2.1. Part 1 contains delinquent SSC details that meet the following criteria:
6.71.2.1.1. The first position of the TCN number equals a space.
6.71.2.1.2. The MRP flag is not equal to a T.
6.71.2.1.3. The detail must be delinquent. Delinquency is computed using the DOLT and the
current ordinal date as follows:
6.71.2.1.3.1. Priority Group I item (01-03) is delinquent if the difference between the DOLT and
the current ordinal date is greater than 5 days.
6.71.2.1.3.2. Priority Group II item (04-08) is delinquent if the difference between the DOLT
and the current ordinal date is greater than 9 days.
6.71.2.1.3.3. Priority Group III item (09-15) is delinquent if the difference between the DOLT
and the current ordinal date is greater than 22 days.
6.71.2.1.4. Sorted in document number sequence, ascending order.
6.71.2.2. Part 2 contains delinquent SNC details. For the purpose of this program, SNC details
are considered delinquent after 22 days. This is sorted in document number sequence, ascending
order.
6.71.2.3. Part 3 contains SSC/SNC details which have a date shipped and an asterisk in the first
position of the TCN field of the SSC/SNC detail. This indicates the item has been shipped, but
LRS/Transportation Activity data has not been provided to the LRS/Materiel Management
Activity.
6.71.2.4. Part 4 contains delinquent SSC details for items that are shipped through the
LRS/Transportation Activity to the DLADS. Selection criteria for Part 4 is the same as for Part 1
except the MRP flag must equal a T.
6.71.2.5. Part 5 contains SSC/SNC details that meet the following criteria.
6.71.2.5.1. The CMOS indicator is on.
6.71.2.5.2. The inchecker code is blank and/or the inchecker date is zero or blank.

6.72. RSP Shortages (R42/NGV904).
6.72.1. Purpose.
6.72.1.1. To provide management products for War Readiness to identify shortages for specific
RSP.
6.72.1.2. To identify where other assets are located.
6.72.2. Program Logic.
6.72.2.1. Reads and edits the report select format and allows rekeying if errors are found. If the
select format passes edits, the 1AE/1AF parameters are read and edited. If any error is found in
the 1AE/1AF parameter, program control jumps to end-of-job.
6.72.2.2. Scans the detail file and selects all records for organization and shop codes in the 1AE
parameter where a shortage exists.
6.72.2.3. Scans the detail file a second time and selects records which have on-hand quantities
available for redistribution according to the parameter input as follows:
6.72.2.3.1. If the 1AF parameter input contains an organization/shop code, a corresponding
record for MSK, MRSP, IRSP, HPMSK, Special Spares, or supply point asset is selected when
the available quantity meets the percentage input in the 1AF parameter for the specific
organization/shop code. For example, if kit A contains one asset available for redistribution and
604                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

the percent used is 40, that asset will not be considered available. However, if the percent used
is 60, then that asset will be considered available.
6.72.2.3.2. If the 1AF parameter input contains POS or ITM, the item record will be selected if
serviceable assets are available for redistribution.
6.72.2.4. Writes selected records to shortage and asset files.
6.72.2.5. Sorts and then matches records by stock number and priority of the requirement.
6.72.2.6. Creates, prints, and (if applicable) writes transfer records to an edit file or the pseudo
reader for inline input. Records written to the edit file may be updated by the requester before
transferring them to the pseudo reader for inline processing.
6.72.2.7. Produces listings. The program outputs a listing (part 1) of the shortages filled and the
source of the assets by organization and shop code. Another listing (part II) is printed of the
shortages remaining and the before- and after-asset positions.
6.72.3. Special Instructions.
6.72.3.1. Primary/Secondary: Primary and Secondary. If processed on the primary database, it
can be done in the twilight or reports mode.
Note: If processed on the secondary database, the primary database programs may modify the
available assets. If such processing occurs prior to the running of this program, it is possible that
inline rejects will occur.

must not be run together. Program selection is as follows:
6.76.2.2.1. For Weapons - The program selects item records with a Serialized Report Code of
“A”. If there is a serviceable balance on the item record, the program fetches all 249 records and
builds a sort key containing the stock number and document number. The program also fetches
all detail records and if there is a quantity on the detail, the program finds the matching 250
record. It reads the authorized in-use area and item/detail area and builds a sort key for the
following details with an in-use or on-hand balance: authorized/in-use, supply point, airborne

6.76.2.2.3. If there are mismatches between the 249 or 250 records and the information on the
item record or applicable detail records, an edit error list is created. If no error conditions exist, a
message will print out on the console typeout indicating either “No errors detected on Weapon
reconciliation” or “No errors detected on COMSEC validation”.
6.76.2.2.4. The annual Weapon reconciliation (position 66 equals W) or the semiannual
COMSEC reconciliation (position 66 equals C) produce reconciliation images which are
transferred through SIFS. For weapons (SRC of A) DSR output images for SIFS are created.
For COMSEC (SRC of C or R), XHA output images for SIFS are created. These two options are
only processed once the monthly Weapon reconciliation (dash in position 65) or COMSEC
validation (dash in position 64) are error free.
6.76.2.2.5. The Serialized Detail Option (position 67) will create applicable DSM and XHA
images for all equipment assets when an ‘E’ is entered. If the 250-SERIALIZED-REPORT-
CODE equals an ‘A’ then a DSM will be created. If the 250-SERIALIZED-REPORT-CODE
equals a ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘R’, ‘S’, or ‘W’ then a XHA will be created.

Note: Above SIFS filenames are hardcoded. Host CSB SIFS Manager will load up each one of
the filenames for each satellite supported. The filenames will be the same for each satellite
system designator except for the last two positions. The last two positions of the filename will
be dependent upon the satellite supported. For example, the last two positions for SD A1 would
be 11, 12, 13, and 14. For SD A7, the last two positions would be 71, 72, 73, and 74. A quick
way to load the CUD file entry for each one of the system designators is as follows: (1) inquire
SD 01 record for each one of the four files, (2) change filename, system designator, and blank
comment field (for it to process), and (3) add record.

6.82. Delinquent Document List (R59/NGV781).
6.82.1. Purpose. To produce a delinquent document listing. The listing contains delinquent and
pre-delinquent document control records and all delinquent source records.
6.82.2. Program Logic.
6.82.2.1. Reads and edits the select card. If the program detects an error, it produces a 503
reject and processing ends.
6.82.2.2. Reads the CT-SUPPORT record to determine if the stored delinquent date is blank or
zeros. If the date is blank or zeros, reads the SPECIAL-CONTROL record and uses the 002-
JULIAN-DATE as the processing date. If the date on the CT-SUPPORT record is NOT blank or
zeros, the program then uses that date as the processing date.
6.82.2.3. Scans the DCR and DSD. The program selects all DSDs for printing. The program
then compares the transaction date on the document control record to the delinquent date on the
CT-CONTROL record or 002-JULIAN-DATE to determine the 'number of days difference'.
This difference is compared by TRIC to the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record to define the
delinquency of each record.
6.82.2.3.1. Not Delinquent. If the 'number of days difference' is less than the pre-delinquent
days on the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, the record is not delinquent and will not appear on
the DDL. If a document control record's TRIC is not found in the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC
record file, it's identified as a new TRIC entry. All new TRIC entries print the DCR record on
the listing with asterisks (*) in the new TRIC (NT) and DEL-DAYS OLD fields.
6.82.2.3.2. Pre-delinquent. If the 'number of days difference' is equal to or greater than the pre-
delinquent days on the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, but less than the delinquent days, the
program writes the DCR record to the pre-delinquent work file. The Pre-Delinquent Days Old
entry on the R59 is calculated by determining the difference between the calendar days old and
the 708-PRE-DELINQUENT-DAYS field from the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, add one to
the difference, and the answer equals the PRE-DAYS OLD.
6.82.2.3.3. Delinquent. If the 'number of days difference' is equal to or greater than the
delinquent days on the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, then the program writes the document
control record to the delinquent work file. The Delinquent Days Old entry on the R59 is
calculated by determining the difference between the calendar days old and the 708-
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       641

DELINQUENT-DAYS field from the CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record, add one to the
difference, and the answer equals the DEL-DAYS-OLD.
6.82.2.4. Matches all selected DCR and DSD records to the item records. For each match
found, the program stores the nomenclature, EEX, IEX, REX, SEX, CIC, freeze code (FZ), and
priority (PR) and UJC. During the print, these items appear in an indicative data line below the
applicable DCR/DSD data line.
Note: When DSDs appear on the delinquent document listing, ensure you review the DSD and
the DCR printed above. Since this listing is printed in document number sequence, DSDs with
matching DCRs will appear on the listing sequentially. An example of this would be a DSD with
document number X245GR81900023 and a DCR with the same document number. The DSD
would follow the matching DCR. However, if a DSD falls sequentially behind a DCR due to the
document number (that is, the DSD document number of X234FA81900234 following the DCR
number of X234FA81900233), then it will appear on the listing sequentially. Therefore, it is
extremely important to verify the DSD to ensure it is not a duplicate of the DCR.
6.82.2.5. Sorts all selected records into two separate parts with additional sorts being performed
within each part. The following sorts are performed:
6.82.2.5.1. Part 1. The sort of part one is as follows: system designator, major sort; type
account code, first intermediate sort; type of listing (delinquent or pre-delinquent), second
intermediate sort; OPR, third intermediate sort; TRIC, fourth intermediate sort; and document
number, minor sort. A control break occurs on the change of system designator type account
code, and type of listing. A summary total, Julian date used to determine delinquency, and the
CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC record prints on the completion of each control break.
6.82.2.5.2. Part 2. The line number assigned to a record in part one stays with that record in the
part two sort. The sort of part two is as follows: system designator, major sort; function number,
first intermediate sort; type of listing (delinquent or predelinquent), second intermediate sort;
TRIC, third intermediate sort; and document number, minor sort. The sort function number is
the output terminal number from the DCR and DSD. A control break occurs first, on change of
system designator; second, on function number; and third, on type of listing. The function
number sort occurs by comparing the 704-OUTPUT-TERMINAL-NBR on the CTH record to
the CT-DELINQUENT-OPR record.
6.82.2.6. Assigns sequential line numbers to each printed record. The line number assigned to a
record stays the same in both part one and part two of the listing. This assigned number is only
good for the run being processed. The number can change when the next listing processes if
updates occurred to the DCR or DSD database records.
6.82.2.7. Prints all selected DCR records and all DSD records on the Delinquent or Pre-
Delinquent Document Listing.

6.82.7. Output.
6.82.8. Distribution. As determined locally.
6.82.9. Management/Reject Notices. This program has one management notice (R818) and
three reject notices (699, R300, R315). Management and reject notices are listed in Ch 7.
6.83. Document Control File Recovery (R60/NGV288).
6.83.1. Purpose. To recover changes to the CTH area. The program deletes or updates DCR,
deletes delinquent source documents (DSD), or updates CTH records.
Note: Updates and deletions depend on changes to the DCR file since the last backup of the
DCR Recovery File (XGV0*GV783DCC. - X equals the gang number).
6.83.2. Program Logic.
6.83.2.1. Reads the DCR Recovery File (XGV0*GV783DCC. - X equals the gang number) and
determines the type of update required. Bases the update on the type update flag stored in each
record in the DCR Change File, and performs one of the following actions:
6.83.2.1.1. If the update flag equals an S, the appropriate CTH record is located, the DCC-
CLEARED flag on the CTH record is updated with the change (if required), and the record is
written back to the file. The document control record and delinquent source document are read
and deleted if the records are located.
6.83.2.1.2. If the update flag on the DCR Change File equals C, the DCR is located, the OPR
and function number are updated, and the DCR is written back to the file.
6.83.2.1.3. If the update flag equals a G, the appropriate CTH records are read, the DCC-
CLEARED flag updated with the change (if required), and the record written back to the file.
The document control record and delinquent source document are read and deleted if the records
are located.
6.83.2.2. Produces a summary report. The report gives the total of document control records
deleted and modified. It also gives the total of CTH records modified and delinquent source
documents deleted.
6.83.2.3. Activates Program NGV288 through ECL Runstream NGV288R. The RPS submits
the runstream containing the report select image. The database records used by program
NGV288 are:
6.83.2.3.1. BASE-CONSTANTS-1 Record (Record Code 001).
6.83.2.3.2. SPECIAL-CONTROL Record (Record Code 002).

6.86. SRD Demand Data Analysis/Consolidation (R65/NGV910).
6.86.1. Purpose. To compile and consolidate demand data, DDR ranges, and dollar value by the
SRD and budget code from the 1SD images produced at different sources by the R37 program.
Outputs selected from the 1SD inputs are used to establish special levels for mission increases.
This program provides managers with visibility online items and the dollar value impact by
budget code when a mission increase occurs. It also provides managers with the ability to
analyze demand data from multiple sources to use in management forecasting of requirements.
6.86.2. Program Logic.
6.86.2.1. Reads the 1SD images from multiple or single input files. The file is then sorted in
SRD, stock number sequence. Sorted files are then scanned, 1SD images are created, and a
listing printed in the range selection of the parameter format. Maximum DDR selection will
output the quantity in the 1SD image from the SRAN with the greatest demand for a particular
stock number. When range option is not selected and data file images are desired, the average
daily demand rate from all input SRANs will be computed and output.
6.86.2.2. Furnishes an option in the program select format to allow 1SD images to be stored in a
sorted file for use by the pseudo reader.
6.86.2.3. Outputs, when desired, the BDFA add images for the gaining SRAN for transmittal to
HQ AFMC, which results in a SNUD push to the gaining SRAN.
6.86.2.4. Stratifies the dollar values by budget code at the end of each SRD and shows the dollar
value impact for minimum, maximum, or average DDR range for a year. Dollar values are
determined by multiplying unit cost by DDR and the result by 360.

6.87. Validation Of WRM Details In 024/025 Set.
6.87.1. Purpose. To validate the integrity of selected data for WRM details that are in a MRSP-
IRSP-SERIAL-NUMBER (024)/MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL (025) set and to identify WRM detail
errors that are encountered in this set.
6.87.2. Program Logic. Reads the MRSP-IRSP-SERIAL-NUMBER record(s), printing the
serial number record, type spares code, and the database record name based on the type spares
code loaded. The linked MRSP-IRSP-CONTROL record(s) are read, printing, the system
designator, the organization/shop code, UTC, and SRD. Then the linked WRM detail record(s)
are compared using the type spares code on the serial number record with the type detail record
expected. Compares the control record, using the system designator, the organization/shop code,
the UTC, and SRD with the applicable data on the detail record. If they do not match an error
message is printed, listing the type database record name found, the system designator, the detail
document number, the UTC, the SRD, the prime/sub flag, and type spares code.

6.88.2.1. Scans the organization cost center records and selects records that indicate which
organizations are currently authorized equipment. The program then formats the organization
record reports (XGL). No record of any type is reported if any of the following conditions apply:
6.88.2.1.1. The SRAN is 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015.
6.88.2.1.2. The system designator is not 01 and the major command code is 88.
6.88.2.2. Scans the authorized/in-use area and selects authorized/in-use detail records that
contain the EMEF R. The program reads the item record, and if the ERRCD is expendable, the
program formats an in-use detail overlay record (XGJ).
6.88.2.3. Scans the item record area and selects all item records with type stock record account
code E. The program will then perform the actions listed below for the following item records:
6.88.2.3.1. If the item record contains an EMC 1 or 2, the program reads the authorized/in-use
area and checks for details with EMEF R. It formats in-use detail overlay records (XGJ) for the
selected detail records and creates an item balance overlay record (XGG) when the end of the
item/detail records is reached. The program fills the balance fields of the XGG record with
zeros.
6.88.2.3.2. If the item record contains EMC 3, 4, or 5, the program reads the authorized/in-use
and item/detail areas, and formats an in-use detail overlay record (XGJ) for all authorized/in-use
and REM vehicles only detail records. The program accumulates balances as the records are
being read, and at the end of the records, it creates an item balance overlay record (XGG).
6.88.2.3.3. If the fifth position of the stock number for any selected item record contains L, P, or
S, the program formats an item record/catalog management record (XGF).
6.88.2.3.4. Provides a complete file of all reporting SRAN/computer support base SRAN cross
reference using the XSC format.
6.88.2.3.5. Provides a complete file of firm due-outs and status using XSD, (due-in/due-out
notification for budget code 9 and Z), and XSK, (supply/ship status information record), format
for stock numbers with EMC 1, 2, or 3.
6.88.2.3.6. Provides a complete file of assets currently out on repair and return (project code
440) using the XSB, (repair and return assets), format.
6.88.2.3.7. Provides a complete file of centrally procured warehouse balances by condition code
for stock numbers with EMC 4 or 5.
6.88.2.3.8. Provides a complete file of memo due-outs using XSA,(due-out notification for
budget code 9 and Z), format for stock numbers with Equipment Management Code (EMC) 1, 2,
or 3.
6.88.2.4. Prints nonstandard management notices for the following:
6.88.2.4.1. During the organization cost center record scan, the program prints the following:
6.88.2.4.1.1. XXX EQUALS ORGANIZATION CODE.
6.88.2.4.1.2. XX EQUALS SYSTEM DESIGNATOR.
6.88.2.4.2. During the item/detail record scan, the program prints the following:
6.88.2.4.2.1. SRAN NOT LOCATED.
6.88.2.4.2.2. XXX EQUALS STOCK NUMBER.

6.89.2. Program Logic. The program scans the in-use detail area and selects all mobility items
(use code A, items codes P and S) for organization codes and WRM application codes in the
parameter images. The data is stored to generate the summary portion of the report. The report
is sorted in document number and WRM-reporting-code sequence, stock number sequence, and
parameter summary sequence. When the summary sequence is selected, these details are sorted
by last-name, unit-name, unit-number, unit-name-1, (weapon system allowance standard), and
non-weapon system allowance standards. Summary data is accumulated by organization code
and WRM-application-code. Each major command determines the two-position WRM
application code (increment code) that will be assigned to all mobility authorized/in-use detail
records.

6.90. Contingency Flag Review (NGV775).
6.90.1. Purpose. Review existing due-ins to ensure they are consistent with JCS project code
requirements computation and create DIT transaction images when changes are required. Due-
ins for customer backorders are exempt from this logic, because they are not part of the JCS
logic. The program must be processed whenever JCS project flags and codes are loaded,
changed or deleted during daily in-line processing. The R76 must be processed after completion
of daily releveling.
6.90.2. Program Logic.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        663

6.90.2.1. NGV710 computes the quantities to be upgraded and/or downgraded and provides
these quantities to NGV775. NGV775 computes the JCS authorized quantity, determines the
need to modify the existing due-ins and determines the change-to project code, and creates DIT
transaction images.
6.90.2.2. Adding JCS Project Codes. When adding a JCS project code (9xx or 7xx) the program
selects the due-in with the highest priority and the oldest date and creates a DIT unless the due-in
has a Status Shipped-Detail Record (211) a Status FLP MILSTRIP Detail Record (208) with
208-Supply-Status equal to ‘ZC’ or ‘ZD’ or there is a REX Override loaded with an ‘*’ in the
003-RQN-STOCK-REPLEN-FLAG or the 003-RQN-DUE-OUT-FLAG and the 003-RQN-
PROJECT-CODE is not equal to spaces. These due-in records will not be considered for
modification. In this case, the program employs the highest/oldest logic until a due-in is located
without a 208 (other than ZC or ZD) or 211 record. When a due-in is found the program creates
a DIT and continues this process until all quantities are upgraded. If no due-ins exist without
208 (other than ZC or ZD) or 211 records no DITs will be created.6.90.2.3.
Downgrading/Removing JCS Project Codes. When downgrading or removing a JCS project
code the program selects the due-in with the lowest priority and the most current date for change.
If a 208 (other than ZC or ZD) or 211 record exists the program looks for another due-in using
the lowest/newest logic until all quantities are downgraded. When a due-in that meets this
criteria is found the program creates a DIT and continues this process until all quantities are
upgraded. If no due-ins exist without 208 (other than ZC or ZD) or /211 records no DITs will be
created.
6.90.2.4. Creating DIT Images. DIT transaction images will be created to modify the project
code assigned to existing due-ins consistent with the project code assignment rules (mentioned
above). When a due-in is selected that has a REX override then the REX override project code
will be written on the DIT.
6.90.3. Special Instructions. The R76 should be processed during normal end-of-day processing
in twilight mode on the primary system. Bases should ensure re-leveling has been completed for
that particular business day before processing the R76. The R76 creates an output file of DIT
images (#GV0<ALN>$$*PSEUDO1.) where # equals gang number and $$ equals the restart
number). These images must be processed through PSEUDO. The R76 will also create a JCS
Error Report (#GV0<ALN>$$*GV775UD###01.) where # equals gang number, $$ equals the
restart number and ### equals the occurrence number). This report lists the JCS flags that are
incompatible and these must be corrected. The item record JCS flag must be less than or equal
to the lowest JCS flag on any kit loaded with the same stock number.

                         REJECT AND MANAGEMENT NOTICES

Section 7A-- Basic Information For Reject And Management Notices
7.1. Chapter Summary. This chapter explains the reject and management notices that the
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) programs may produce. Data fields are program edited
for validity and compatibility. If here is an error, or if conditions requiring additional action
exist, the program produces a reject or management notice. However, not all management
notices require action. Some are for information only. Sec. 7A defines and explains these
notices. Sec. 7B lists the general use reject/management notices. Sec. 7C refers the reader to the
appropriate location for Accounting and Finance transactions; Sec. 7D lists those
reject/management notices for LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity; Sec. 7E lists
those from normal inline transactions; and Sec. 7F lists those for reports and end-of-day
transactions. Finally, Sec. 7G discusses the reject/management notices requiring action by the
RPS console operator.
7.2. Overview. Sec. 7A defines and explains the reject and management notices. After defining
them, the section discusses 1) the basic concepts involved in reject/management notices, 2) the
system of codes assigned to these notices, 3) the distribution of these notices, and 4) the content
of the suspense files these notices may create and the procedures for handling the suspense files.
7.2.1. LRS) and AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity are responsible for managing reject
and management notices that process on their respective computer terminals.
Notes:
1. Current and future SBSS programming may not return reject and management notices to the
appropriate computer output functions for resolution. Should this happen, forward the notice to
the applicable office for action.
2. All reports distribution by AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activities is accomplished
via their prescribed webpages.
3. While LGSPC is still reflected on SBSS output notices, the function in LRS or equivalent is
now LGLOS. The term LGSPC will be listed until programmatically updated.
4. While the term Materiel Support Division (MSD) is now Consolidated Sustainment Activity
Group-Supply (CSAG-S), The terms Materiel Support Division and/or MSD will be shown as
reflected in SBSS outputs until programmatically updated.
5. While the term LRS Systems Management is now Functional Systems Management
(LGLOS), However, the term LRS Systems Management will be shown as reflected in SBSS
outputs until programmatically updated.

6. While the term GLSC Systems Flight is now AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity.
However, the term GLSC Systems Flight will be shown as reflected in SBSS outputs until
programmatically updated.
7. Post-post is a legacy term that identified where transactions were posted/input to automated
systems after the actions were performed. Because it is listed on SBSS output notices, the term
is still retained in this publication.

7.3. Reject Notices.
7.3.1. Definition of the Reject Notices. If program edits detect an error during processing, the
program is stopped. The reject program takes control of the Standard Base Supply System
666                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

Automated Data System (SBSS ADS) processing. At this point, the database records are
restored to their condition at the start of the run, and a reject notice is printed.
Note: Reject notices are printed to advise the individual, or section receiving the notice that
certain conditions exist and that action must be taken to correct this condition. All rejects should
be processed as rapidly as possible. Normally this should be within 1 work day unless there are
specific reasons that prohibit correction of the reject within that time.
7.3.2. Format of the Reject Notices. The reject phrase contains 1) a code, 2) a descriptive
phrase, and 3) an action flag. Each reject code, type, and descriptive phrase, along with the
format of any additional printed lines and the required action, is listed.
7.3.3. Override Action Flag. The application program provides the operator the capability of
overriding the action flag and the supplementary print flag. The flags on the phrase record are
not changed. 7.3.4. Processing Reject Notices. When an error message has been printed and the
records restored to their original condition, the error must be corrected before processing can
continue.
7.3.4.1. Researching the notice. Research the inquiry and reject notice to determine, if possible,
the cause of the error. If the cause was ADPE failure, notify the maintenance engineer. After
the engineer has repaired the equipment, use FIX input for any corrective action required on the
database. If a program error is discovered or suspected, call the AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity immediately.
7.3.4.2. Handling multiple errors. If any type of error occurs repeatedly or if the operator
suspects numerous database record relationship errors, process the appropriate linkage check
routine.
Note: Due to the complexity of database record relationships in the computer, not all possible
combinations can be detailed. As operators gain experience in detecting problems and corrective
actions, they will develop shorter methods of correcting errors. Until the operators gain such
skill, the methods given will allow the RPS operator to correct problems that arise.
7.4. Management Notices.
7.4.1. Definition of Management Notices. As with reject notices, management notices are
printed to advise the appropriate individual or section that certain conditions exist and that action
to correct the condition must be taken. Management notices are not rejects. Unlike reject
notices, management notices do not stop the processing of the input. The updated database
records are not restored to their original condition. Management notices may also be printed
when certain programs have successfully processed. These management notices are for
information only.
7.4.2. Format of Management Notices. Like reject notices, the management notices contain a
code and a descriptive phrase. Management notices can be readily identified by the letters MGT
preceding the reject code and reject phrase. Each management code and phrase--together with
the required action, if further action is required. EXCEPTION: Management notices for A&F
transactions (A001-A999) follow a different format. For the format of A series management
notices (see DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.)
7.4.3. Output of Management Notices. Management notices are output in the same way as the
reject notices. See paragraph above for the output of reject notices and Para. 7.26. for the output
format of management notices.
7.4.4. Format for . The output format depicted in Para. 7.27. is printed when a valid form name
cannot be obtained (from TIP file 370 (SBSS*1348.)) to reformat the output document. All
other output formats are described throughout the manual with the SBSS transaction.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       667

7.5. General Use Reject/Management Notices. The general use reject/management codes are
assigned as follows:
7.5.1. Codes 001-249. These codes are assigned to file maintenance transactions.
7.5.2. Codes 250-499. These codes are assigned to normal inline transactions such as issues,
turn-ins, and receipts.
7.5.3. Codes 500-649. These codes are assigned to reports and end-of-day (EOD) transactions.
7.5.4. Codes 650-849. These codes are assigned to rejects requiring RPS main console operator
action.
7.5.4.1. Codes 736-754. These codes are assigned to record relationship errors. Of these,
numbers 746-754 refer specifically to record relationship errors involving the computer. The
RPS console operator must research the database record which applies and take action to correct
the relationship.
7.5.4.2. Codes 760-789. These codes are assigned to errors that cause the computer to come to
an orderly halt.
7.5.5. Codes 850-999. These codes are assigned to A&F transactions.
7.6. Alpha Prefixed Reject and Management Notices.
7.6.1. Use of Alpha Prefixed Notices. In some circumstances, programming conventions
prevent the use of the reject program. When this occurs, the active program must print the
reject/management notices. When produced in this manner, these notices usually have three
digit serial numbers prefixed with an alpha character.
7.6.2. Use of Unnumbered Phrases. In some instances unnumbered notices may be printed. See
the chapter that has the procedures for the input that caused the reject.
7.7. Unassigned Reject Notices.
7.7.1. If no error phrase has been loaded for a numeric reject, the reject program will print a
standard phrase: NOT ASSIGNED. IF PRINTED CALL THE SBSS CONTROL CENTER.
Note: The SBSS Control Center is now the Field Assistance Branch (FAB).
7.7.2. Unassigned Reject Numbers Other than 000. If the standard phrase prints with other than
reject number 000, do the following before notifying the ESC/HGGG Field Assistance Branch:
check the phrase load deck and recent releases to make sure the current phrase for that number is
loaded. If the latest phrase is not loaded, load it and reprocess the input.
7.7.3. Unassigned Reject 000. If reject 000 is printed, a program error has occurred. This
number will print if a program calls up the reject program and there is no reject number assigned
to the error.
Note: All unassigned rejects are coded to restore input data to their initial condition. The
unassigned reject also suspends the input for the Daily Reject Listing.
7.8. Distribution. Forward all rejects printed on the LRS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations
Activity RPS printer to Computer Operations for distribution. On those rejects where a specific
action agency is to get the notices, the computer will automatically include this information with
the phrase. If the phrase does not define the distribution. (See this chapter or DFAS-DE
7077.10-M on the individual notice.) Rejects printed on terminals or the RPS console are for the
activity operating the function.
7.9. Cumulative Reject Suspense.
7.9.1. Creating Cumulative Reject Record. The cumulative reject record (523) is created for
selective input DICs/TRICs by the Reject and Restore Program (D215) as the reject is created.
A 523 record will be created for rejected inputs with a document number containing an alpha in
668                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

the first position, alpha and/or numeric characters in the last four positions, and no blanks with a
DIC/TRIC equal to:

7.9.2. Clearing Cumulative Reject Records. Cumulative reject records are cleared as follows:
7.9.2.1. Successful processing of the rejected input by the System Standard Sub-Routines
Program (D205A), or;
7.9.2.2. Selected deletes via the D818 program, or;
7.9.2.3. Rejects should be cleared at the lowest level possible. Each flight chief is responsible
for appointing a reject monitor. This individual should also be authorized to process the D818
Reject Processor to clear rejected input images. Personnel may use ES-S to extract and correct
rejects.
7.9.2.4. Satellite accounts will appoint a reject monitor to clear rejects applicable to their
satellite or those generated on function 000/449 of the host account and coordinate with the host
base reject monitor to ensure rejects clear.
7.9.2.5. AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or Weapon System Support Activity will clear
rejects on functions 000 and 449 when the document number contains the host SRAN.
7.9.2.5.1. The host base will clear rejects if the document number contains activity code X or J.
7.9.2.5.2. The host base will coordinate with the applicable account to clear reject(s) if the
document number contains a SRAN other than the host SRAN (i.e., Satellites, ANG, and other
MAJCOM bases).
7.9.2.6. The host LRS will clear all A2x and A4x rejects generated on
functions 000 and 444 for unserviceable assets, "F in card column 71". AFMC
SCM-R Stock Control Activity is responsible for clearing A2x and A4x rejects
(except 520 rejects) for serviceable assets only. The LRS/materiel management activity will clear
all A2x/FTR 520 rejects.7.9.2.7. Input bases will clear all other rejects.

7.9.3. Processing Rejected Inputs and Listing Cumulative Reject Records. See section 7H for
the procedures to process rejected inputs and listing cumulative reject records.
7.9.4. Listing Forced Deleted Cumulative Rejects. Part nine of the daily supply surveillance
report (D20), provides a listing of cumulative rejects force deleted. Copies of this listing are
distributed to each branch.
7.10. Printing of D818 Output. Do not use the SQ key-in to print the output files. This causes
the output files to accumulate. Instead, use the @SYM control statement without the U option.
This flags the output files for subsequent deletion.
Section 7B-- General Use Rejects/Management Notices for 000 through 999.
7.11. Overview. Para. 7.29. lists the general use reject/management notices for file
maintenance transactions.
Section 7C-- Accounting And Finance Type Transactions.
7.12. Overview. The reject/management notices with numerical phrases A001 through A999
are used for A&F type transactions. Distribution, phrase descriptions, and instructions for
corrective action are in DFAS-DE 7077.10-M. Computer Operations will make distribution
according to DFAS-DE 7077.10-M. In the absence of specific distribution instructions, send
them to A&F.
Section 7D-- File Maintenance Reject/Management Notices F001 through F999.
7.13. Overview. Para. 7.30. lists the reject and management notices, together with any
corrective action, for file maintenance transactions.
Section 7E-- Reject/Management Notices For Normal Inline Transactions I001 through
I999.
7.14. Overview. Para. 7.31. lists the reject and management notices, together with any
corrective action, for normal inline transactions.
Section 7F-- Reject/Management Notices For Reports and End-Of-Day Type Transactions
R001 through R999.
7.15. Overview. Para. 7.32. lists the rejects and management notices, together with any
corrective action, for reports and end-of-day type transactions.
Section 7G-- Reject/Management Notices For Action By RPS Console Owner S001
through S999.
7.16. Overview. The Para. 7.33. lists the reject and management notices, together with any
corrective action, for RPS console operator action.
Section 7H-- Cumulative Reject Processor (D818).
7.17. Overview. This section provides the procedures, options, and required inputs to process
the Cumulative Reject Processor (D818) on the primary database. SBSS rejects may also be
managed in ES-S. ES-S provides a capability to manage all rejects suspended in the SBSS (not
just those processed through ES-S). This capability is designed to replace the D818 reject
management that requires users to sign-on into the SBSS in the Demand mode. Rejects may be
managed for a single base or across the entire SBSS enterprise. See Volume 2, Part 6 Managing
SBSS Transactions Rejects and ES-S Users Manual Chapter 24.
7.18. Processor Procedures for the Cumulative Reject Processor (D818).
7.18.1. Initial Procedures. The Cumulative Reject Processor (D818) is processed in the demand
mode on the primary database. See Para. 7.34. for example of the Cumulative Reject Menu
Screen (D818). To execute, key in @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV818R.
7.18.2. Processing Options.
670                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

7.18.2.1. Option 1: This option displays a specific reject. The computer displays the
Cumulative Reject Display Screen with the requested reject. See paragraph below for the
Cumulative Reject Display Screen (D818) procedures.
7.18.2.2. Option 2: This option displays all rejects by a given function number. The computer
displays the Cumulative Reject Display Screen (D818) with a reject for each given function
number. See below for the Cumulative Reject Display Screen (D818) procedures.
7.18.2.3. Option 3: This option prints all cumulative rejects for a given function number.
7.18.2.4. Option 4: This option produces a printed listing of all rejects.
Note: When either option 3 or 4 is taken to print cumulative rejects, the word YES in print
positions 113 through 115 of the listing identifies rejects over 6 days old. After all rejects are
printed for the requested function number, the following is printed at the end of the listing:

Figure 7.1. Reject Listing Information.




The above information is also listed when option 4 is requested as a cumulative total for all
function numbers and as a cumulative total for all system designators.
7.18.2.5. Option 5: This option stops processing and should be used to go to end-of-job.
7.18.3. Required Inputs:
7.18.3.1. Transaction Identification Code (TRIC): TRIC from the cumulative reject.
7.18.3.2. Document Number: Positions 30-43 from the cumulative reject.
7.18.3.3. Function Number: Three-position function number.
7.18.3.4. System Designator: Two-position system designator. When using option 4, print all
rejects; AL may be entered to print all rejects for all system designators.
7.18.3.5. Report Sort Order:
7.18.3.5.1. Option 1: Sorts the cumulative reject listing in system designator, function number,
TRIC, and document number sequence. If no sort option is selected, this sort option is defaulted.
7.18.3.5.2. Option 2: Sorts the cumulative reject listing in system designator, function number,
TRIC, and stock number sequence.
7.18.3.5.3. Option 3: Sorts the cumulative list in system designator, stock number, and TRIC
sequence.
7.18.3.6. Site ID: Enter the NTR device of the live printer (for example, NTR54P).
7.18.3.7. Number of Copies: Enter the number of copies to be printed. A valid number greater
than zero must be entered.
7.19. Cumulative Reject Display Screen (D818).
7.19.1. Cumulative Reject Input Image. This screen (Para. 7.35.) contains the rejected input
image and applicable information. The freeze code will only be printed if the rejected number
equals 98, 126, 234, 235, 240, 290, 296, 467, 469, 471, 505, 540, 579, 614, and 638.
7.19.2. Selected Options. Available options are as follows:
7.19.2.1. Reprocess reject: Reprocesses the reject. This option is used to process the reject
input image as an inline input. When the reject input image displayed on the Cumulative Reject
Display Screen (D818) processes successfully as an inline input, the cumulative reject is deleted.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        671

7.19.2.2. Display next reject: This option displays the next reject by refreshing the Cumulative
Reject Display Screen (D818) with the next reject for a given function number.
7.19.2.3. Delete reject: This option deletes cumulative rejects from the database when the
original reject cannot be cleared by any other means. A "Reason Why" phrase must be entered
when this option is taken. Otherwise, it will not be allowed to process. This phrase is overlaid in
the last 30 positions of the reject image and is entered in the Daily Reject Suspense Record
(521). During end-of-day, these transactions appear on the D20, Part Nine, Forced Reject Clear
Listing.
7.19.2.3. (AMC) Transaction date and serial number of original input along with a clear
explanation/justification will be entered in transactions that clear cumulative reject records.
7.19.2.4. Return to menu: This option returns the computer to the Cumulative Reject Menu
Screen (D818).
7.20. Reject/Management Notices. Sec. 7F provides detailed processing procedures for reject
and management notices.
7.21. CAMS (Core Automated Maintenance System) Rejects. Rejects for CAMS
transactions (activity code = J) will not be stored in the cumulative reject area.
7.22. Rejects for Satellites. Rejects for satellites may contain an 01 system designator in the
523-CALC-KEY field if the rejected transaction was processed while the satellite was up or
down. These cumulative reject suspense records may not be cleared when the reject is
reprocessed. In order to clear these rejects, use Option 3, Delete Reject, from Cumulative Reject
Display Screen menu of the D818.
Section 7I-- Personal Computer Reject/Management Notices.
7.23. Overview. Personal computer programs that interact with the SBSS have reject and
management notices in the same format as the SBSS program notices in this chapter. The
personal computer codes are numbered from P001 through P999. The code, type, and
descriptive phrase along with the corrective actions are listed in Para. 7.36. for all personal
computer reject/management notices.
7.24. Reject Notice Printout.
7.24.1. Purpose. To provide an example of the output format that reject/management notices
will take.

Notes:
1. If the computer prints the reject/management phrase on the RPS console, the phrase will be
49 characters.
2. The reject override flag is turned ON by the application program to an octal value of 135(});
otherwise, this field and the next two fields (positions 26-29) will contain octal zeros (spaces).
3. This field is applicable only if the reject override flag (print positions 24-25) contains an octal
value of 135(}). If the action flag or data location flag field contains an octal value of 042(") the
data will be obtained from the reject notices record; otherwise, the fields must contain one of the
authorized codes. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 2, for an explanation of the data location
flags and the reject action flags.
4. The data format is as follows: PPPPAA--where PPPP = program number and AA = version
number. EXAMPLE: 870b66 = program NGV870, version 66.x
5. This field will contain the word SUS if the reject is coded for suspense or the reject override
indicates suspense action. This indicates that the computer wrote the reject to the daily reject
suspense area. If the reject is not suspended, this field will be blank.
6. Whenever the computer processing date differs from the computer requisition Julian date, an
additional entry will be provided in positions 61-71 to identify the exact action date.
7. The computer may print up to four additional lines depending on the data location flag.
7.25. Reject (REJ) Notice Output Format.
7.25.1. Purpose. To provide an output whenever an input to the SBSS results in a reject. CS-
205-PRINT-LINE(s) 1 through 26 are printed on lines 5 through 30 respectively.
7.25.2. Output Destination. RPS/main system.
7.25.3. Input. All SBSS inputs.
7.25.4. Output Format. This format is produced if 001-TYPE-FORM-FLAG is equal to A or B
or 001- TYPE-DEVICE is equal to 037.

7.29.1. 000 Through 999 Rejects.
7.29.1.1. 000 REJ NOT ASSIGNED IF PRINTED-- CALL THE SBSS CONTROL CENTER
ACTION: RPS operator: This reject will occur if a program calls the reject routine without
setting a reject number in the reject phrase area. This is a program error. In order to determine
the location of the error in the program, obtain as much information about the input as possible.
Useful information includes the type issue (bench stock, supply point, war reserve materiel, and
so on) and whether the item is repair cycle, equipment, economic order quantity (EOQ), post-
post, reverse-post, and so on. Determine the location of the error before calling the AFMC
SCM-R Information Technology Activity.
7.29.1.2. 001 REJ INPUT POSITIONS WITH X BELOW ARE INVALID - INITIATOR
FORMAT: Line 4: Input image.
              Line 5: Xs under positions of the input that contain invalid data.
ACTION: For all TRICs except 1BS, correct the input and reprocess. In the 5th line of TRIC
1BS, correct and reinput only the line numbers with Xs under them. The line numbers without

Xs have successfully processed. For bases operating under the SBSS/CAMS/CAMS-FM (G081)
interface, TRIC ISU/MSI transactions with activity code J processed through SBSS must contain
the CAMS/CAMS-FM ID code in position 81 and job control number in positions 82-93. For
the BZA input, if the Xs are under the part number field of the input, it indicates that the part
number record is not loaded. Process 1AA to load the part number record and reprocess. If the
input is XS1 the X’s indicate the fields that require additional input information. Correct and
reinput. If the input is FRR or FCL then the reason code must be in the input string. Valid
values are 1, 2 or 3. Correct and reinput. If the input is FOR, the reject may be the result of
other conditions that must be met. See , Ch 8. If the TRIC is ISU and the input TEX code is %,
the following edits must be met:
1. The percentage to be discounted must be in positions 62-63.
2. The percentage to be discounted must be a number between 01-99.
3. The requisitioning objective must be zero.
4. The budget code must be 9.
5. The ERRCD must be XB3 or NF1(with IEX code E/6 or 3/K).
6. When the mission impact code on the item record is 3, 4 or blank the days different between
the computer ordinal date and the date SPC assigned on the item record must be greater than 365.
7. When the mission impact code on the item record is 1 or 2 the days different between the
computer ordinal date and the date SPC assigned on the item record must be greater than 700.
Notes:
1. If TRIC is CIC/EIC and the document number is activity code P, then the item does not meet
the criteria for non-EAID equipment processing. If the reject is the result of an inbound DSR
transaction and the input contains an asterisk in position 7 and OVERAGE reflecting as invalid
in positions 23-29 perform the following actions: Research the stock/document number on the
reject to determine the asset status. If the asset was received, manually prepare and send a DSM
transaction with the applicable transaction code in position 7 to notify AFEMS of the status (i.e.,
received, lost, adjusted, etc.). If the asset has not been received and not suspected lost take no
action. These transactions are the result of AFEMS querying the SBSS on shipments that are
over the expected age for delivery timeframes.
2. If the TRIC is FOR and the input is for an ADD or CHANGE and the type organization code
is a “3” the 311-FLAG-1 on the Project Funds Management Record (PFMR) must equal a “3”.
Corrective action: If the input is to support a flying organization the 311-FLAG-1 on the PFMR
must equal “3”, contact your supporting DFAS Field site to load a new PFMR with the E
indicator (311-FLAG-1) equal to “3”.
3. If the TRIC is 1ED, the action code must be ‘D’ or ‘I’ or ‘R’. If the action code is ‘I’, the
201-USE-CODE must be equal to ‘D’ and the type equipment code cannot equal ‘V’.
7.29.1.3. 002 REJ INPUT ACTION CODE/CARD CODE INCOMPATIBLE – LGSCD
NOTE : LRS CUSTOMER SERVICE
ACTION: Position 79 must contain a 1 or 2. Position 80 must contain L, C, or D. If position 80
contains D, position 79 must be a 1. Correct the input and reprocess.

ACTION: The flag of the input document may be determined by the TRIC.
1. If the TRIC is other than FCL, FXR, or FFC, the action code must be L, C, I or D. If the
action code is I, input can only be processed from the #051 or applicable screen.
2. If the TRIC is FCL, the action code must be A, S, or F and the reason code must be 1, 2, or 3.
3. If the TRIC is FFC, FXR, the action code must be L or D.
4. If the TRIC is 1SR, the action code must be D, I, or L.
5. If the TRIC is FEC, the action code must be C or D.
6. If the TRIC is XCA, the action code (position 42) must be D, N, R, or U. 7. If the TRIC is
RAR, the action flag in position 65 must be blank, 1, 2, or 3. When position 65 equals 1 or 2 on
the RAR input, the DIFM detail cannot contain an action flag of 1. An RAR input with a 1 in
position 65 will not process for SEX codes B or M. An RAR input with an action flag of 3 will
not process if the DIFM detail record contains a blank action flag.
8. If the TRIC is XCH, check the action code in position 7. The following action codes are
valid:

I – Initial
A – Add
C – Change
D – Delete
R – Review
9. If the TRIC is 1KT, the action code must be M or S.

a. If the type stock record account code is other than K, the application code may be any desired
data other than special characters. An * (asterisk) is used in position 5 of 1AP inputs to delete
the existing code.
b. If the type stock record account code is K and the item record stock number contains an
MMAC code of CM, the first position of the application code must be an N. All other items in
the K account must have an R in the first position of the application code. If the item is NOT
reportable, an N appears in the first position. The second position is locally assigned or left
blank.
2. Stock number changes:
a. An attempt has been made to change a stock number to MMAC code CM and the item is
loaded in the K account with an R in the first position of the application code. However, items
with an MMAC code of CM cannot be reportable. Correct and reinput.

ACTION:
1. Check the validity of the input document number. If the TRIC is FER, the detail that caused
the reject has a document number equal to the activity, organization, custody receipt account
codes (position 36-41) and the next available item number (position 70-73). Correct the next
available item number and reinput.
2. If the TRIC is FME, an authorized/in-use (P item code) detail record is already loaded with a
document number equal to the input change-to document number. However, the stock number is
unequal to the stock number on the authorized/in-use detail record for the input change-from
document number. Change or correct the input change-to document number and reinput the
FME.

ACTION: The authorized quantity field is invalid. FCI inputs may contain all zeros in this field
ONLY if the ASC is 000.
1. If the ASC on an authorized/in-use detail record is being changed from 000 to any other ASC,
the authorized quantity field cannot be blank. If this field is blank, correct and reinput.
2. FSP inputs may have all zeros, but 1MK cannot. If 1MK has all zeroes, correct and reinput.
3. If the TRIC is 2BS, enter a number greater than zero, ensuring the unit price is less than the
dollar threshold, stored on the ORG-COST-CENTER-100-999 record by the ‘FOR’ input.
Establishment of the dollar threshold may vary from organization to organization and is at the
discretion of the supported organization commander. Some considerations for the bench stock
maximum dollar threshold decision should include: proximity to the main LRS/Materiel
Management Activity warehouse where the stock is kept, cost of the items and the levels desired,
frequency of demand for the item, and mission impact if not readily available. Exceeding the
established dollar threshold for any item requires a letter of justification from the supported
organization commander. This letter will be maintained on file in the LRS/Materiel
Management Activity attached to the original bench stock request letter.
4. If the TRIC is FER, the ASC on the affected detail is 000A or 048 and the in-use and
authorized quantity fields are unequal. An FCI must be input to change the authorized quantity
equal to the in-use quantity before the FER can be processed. The edit criteria for FCI is
applicable to FED processing.
5. If the authorized quantity field is entered for any TRIC, it must contain all numeric characters.
6. If the TRIC is MSI the authorized quantity is less than the on-hand quantity. Turn in the

7.29.1.20. 019 REJ BALANCE OVERFLOW OR IMPROPER DIVISION - INITIATOR
ACTION:
1. Regardless of the TRIC used, some arithmetic computation has caused a decimal overflow.
a. Determine the cause for each input.
b. The initiator of the input should examine the item records involved, determine the corrective
action, and reprocess.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                          687

2. If the input is a stock number merge (TRIC FIC) and the records are type stock record
account code K, check to determine if the merge of the records will cause a balance overflow.
a. If the merge will cause an overflow, load -9 (dash nine) record, if required or unless already
loaded, for the change-to stock number.
b. Process an FCH to transfer enough of the balance to prevent the overflow; then reprocess the
FIC.
c. Also, verify the validity of the price on the input if the input is a price change (FCU).
(1) If the price is invalid, correct and reprocess.
(2) If the price is valid, process the price change by reducing the price by steps on the input until
the extended value of the inventory does not exceed 99999999. Then process subsequent
multiple FCU inputs in sequence until the desired price is reflected on the item record.
3. If the condition cannot be corrected locally, notify the AFMC SCM-R Information
Technology Activity.

ACTION:
1. A NSN cannot be changed to a non-NSN when dash stock numbered item record(s) with the
dash in the 14th position of the stock number are loaded for the NSN. Determine the validity of
the input.
a. If the input is invalid, no action is required.
b. If the input is valid, transfer balances by processing the FCH input using the basic item record
stock number as the from-stock number. This will cause the -9 (dash nine) balance to be
programmatically transferred.
2. Delete the -9 (dash nine) stock number and reprocess the FIC input.

ACTION: Actions required for input TRICs 1SC and FIC follow:
TRIC 1SC:
1. If the IEX reflected in the 4th line is 3, K, 6, or E, delete the IEX before processing the input
change.
688                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

2. If items authorized are IEX 3 and K or 6 and E, enter ERRCD XB3/NF1. The controlled item
code must be U, J, M, or V. Notify LRS Materiel Management Retail Sales function when the
IEX is 3, K, 6, or E. LRS Materiel Management Retail Sales function must inventory balances,
process a warehouse location change if required (FCS), and delete the IEX (FCD). Then LRS
Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must reprocess this indicative
data change.
TRIC FIC:
1. If the IEX reflected in line 4 is 3, the ERRCD must be XB3/NF1. Notify the LRS Materiel
Management Retail Sales function. Retail Sales must inventory balances, process a warehouse
location change if required (FCS), and delete the IEX (FCD). Then Records Maintenance must
reprocess this indicative data change.
2. If the 4th line of print is blank, the input is attempting to change TO or FROM budget code V
or Y (ERRC ND5 or NF5).
a. If the input is to change FROM (delete) budget code V, take the following action:
(1) Determine if the item is a vehicle.
a. If it is not a vehicle and the REM vehicles only detail record(s) should be deleted, reinput the
FIC budget code change with force code F in position 6.
b. If the item is a vehicle and the REM vehicles only detail record(s) should remain, destroy the
input.
(2) If the change is not accepted by the computer and the change was received from AFMC or
an AFMC IM (through SNUD or otherwise), coordinate or correspond with the responsible item
manager (IM) to determine the proper budget code.
b. If the input is to change TO budget code V, take the following action:
(1) If the budget code change is valid, turn the assets in from the authorized/in-use details to the
item record. Process an FCI to change the equipment code on the 201 authorized in use detail
record to V and process the FIC budget code change. Reissue the assets from the item record to
the authorized/in-use detail(s) by quantities of one (00001), using the vehicle registration
number.
(2) If the budget code change is not valid, destroy the input. Coordination with AFMC may be
required.
(3). If changing the ERRC from N*5 to N*4 or lower EMC or reverse (EMC is 4 or lower and
changing to a 5) if there details you will receive an 022 reject. Validate the change and if
accurate follow instructions in para. 2 above for TRIC FIC.
(4). If no details and changing the ERRC from N*5 to N*4 or lower EMC or reverse (EMC is 4
or lower and changing to a 5), the ERRC will be updated.
7.29.1.24. 023 REJ CANNOT LOCATE REPAIR CYCLE RCD FOR INPUT S/N OR S/D –
LGSCD NOTE: LRS CUSTOMER SERVICE
ACTION:
1. Inline TRIC(s): The input included either an erroneous stock number or an erroneous system
designator. Research these data, correct, and reinput. If there is no error in the NSN or system
designator, a linkage error may exist between the item record and repair cycle record; therefore,
obtain a 156ALL inquiry to determine if a repair cycle record exists. If no repair cycle record
exists, do one of the following:
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                        689

a. If the item record is required, the repair cycle record must be reestablished To do this, change
the ERRCD on the item record to a nonrepair cycle ERRCD with a FIX input. Next, change it
back to the correct ERRCD with an FIC input which will cause the repair cycle record to be
established. The data fields on the repair cycle record may then be corrected using FIX input.
b. If the item record is not required, process an FID to delete.
2. RPT M20: An item record is on file for which there is no corresponding repair cycle record.
Since the M20 will continue processing, perform corrective action inline (primary system)
according to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3.

ACTION: This reject means that the stock list change contains a phrase code of T and/or a
source of supply of JCK. These codes mean the item has been coded CONDEMNED because it
cannot accomplish its designed function and is considered a safety hazard to flight or
environment. From among the following possibilities, choose the necessary actions:
1. Coordinate and initiate necessary action immediately to dispose of all existing stocks. Delete
the item record. If this is a bench stock item, ensure the bench stock monitor is notified to
dispose of all stocks.
2. Make any exception to an item being coded CONDEMNED by priority message to the item
manager (IM). Coordinate with the LRS CC/AO or equivalent and the Chief of Maintenance. If
an exception is made, take action to ensure no further use of the item is made until a reply is
received from the IM.
3. If a replacing stock number is available, it will be in positions 33-47 of the input. If required,
coordinate with LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity to load
the replacing stock number and transfer demand data from the replaced stock number. Also, if
the item is on bench stock, coordinate with the bench stock monitor to provide him/her with the
replacing stock number.
Note: The program has automatically assigned a three (3) to the last position of the item record
parts preference code to show the item is coded CONDEMNED.

number in positions 8-22) is no longer procured or issued as an assembly, but will be broken
down (or disassembled) into and supported by its components (stock number in positions 33-47).
2. The computer outputs a separate notice for each of the components unless the same stock
number is used in both positions 33-47 and positions 8-22. When this happens, the input with
the M phrase code will be accompanied by input with an R phrase code (refer to) citing the
appropriate technical publication which lists the components. An 031 management notice will
be received on the R phrase code.
3. Do the following:
a. Together with LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity, cancel any due-
ins (due-outs are managed at base-level) on the item to be disassembled and requisition the
components.
b. Together with LRS Materiel Management Flight, initiate action to have any assets
disassembled.
c. Remember that the program has automatically assigned a REX code 3 to the item that is to be
disassembled.

ACTION:
1. If the action code is L for input TRICs no authorized/in-use detail record is loaded for the
input document number. Load the authorized/in-use detail record before a substitute detail can
be loaded, or the type WRM spares code is not compatible.
2. The following applies to this reject under conditions other than as stated in paragraph a above.
After locating the SUBSTITUTE authorized/in- use detail record with the same detail document
number, stock number, and system designator, the active program (indicated by the input TRIC)
was unable to locate the PRIME authorized/in-use detail record with the same detail document
number. Using the detail document number, determine if the prime authorized/in-use detail
record is in the computer.
a. If the prime authorized/in-use detail record is NOT in the computer, process an FCI input to
load the prime record.
b. If the prime authorized/in-use detail record IS in the computer, obtain all possible data
concerning the error and notify the ESC/HGGG Field Assistance Branch.
3. If the input TRIC is FET, this reject could apply to the gaining or the losing document
number. Determine the applicable document number (gaining or losing) with each reject.
4. If the TRIC is FED, this reject is caused by the input of a substitute and the corresponding
prime is not loaded. Establish the prime and reprocess the input.
5. If processing inputs for SPRAM assets using TRICs 1ED, 1ET, FET, or FME, a SPRAM
indicator or type detail code of K must be used on the input.

Dash (-) stock numbers are limited to -1 (dash one), -2 (dash two), and -9 (dash nine).
2. FIC: One of the following conditions exists. Take corrective action as noted.
a. The input stock number is a dash two (-2) or dash nine (-9) number. FIC input is not
authorized on these types of stock numbers. These records are automatically updated when
applicable indicative data are changed on the basic item record. Cancel the input and reprocess
with the basic NSN, if applicable.
b. Stock number, system designator, ERRCD, and budget code changes are not authorized on
type account code P (fuels) items. If a stock number change is required, the new stock number
must be loaded by FIL input, balances transferred from old to new FCH inputs, and demand data

these items. TRIC MSD must be used.
4. FCS: Do not process location changes against an adjunct record.
5. FCC: Process condition changes against the basic number. reinput.
6. FCH: The transfer-from stock number cannot be a -9 (dash nine) stock number because
balances on these records are programmatically transferred to the basic stock number. This
transfer is required whenever an applicable request is made against the basic stock number.
7. FSU: Process FSU TEX code R inputs for class 9150 (oil) only.
8. 1DF, 1PC, 1PR, 1RF, 1RL, 1RP, 1SP, 1RD: These TRICs are reserved for fuels transactions

Notes:
1. Check the validity of the document number, action code, and input identification code.
Correct the input format and reinput.
2. If the TRIC is 1F3, the edit is as follows:
a. If an adjusted stock level is already loaded with the same organization code, shop code, and
SRD of the input, this reject is produced.
b. If it is desired to load a multiple detail record, process the 1F3L with an asterisk (*) in
position 5 of the input.
c. If only one special level is to be loaded, use a new organization code, shop code, or SRD.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                 29 JANUARY 2014                                         705

d. If the Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) to be loaded is for a Weapon System Detail ASL and
there is a fixed level ASL already loaded (Type Level Flag E), accomplish the following in
order:
(1) Run and print an inquiry of the fixed level ASL (The printout is necessary to re-load this
ASL).
(2) Delete the fixed level ASL.
(3) Load the Weapon System Detail ASL using the same data provided on the input line of the
reject. (Ensure the Approval Date is blank).
(4) Re-load the fixed level ASL with the original data (Use the printed copy of the inquiry).
Ensure an asterisk (*) is in the Duplicate Detail Override Flag field (position 5).
(5) Process a 1F3V with the original approval date on the fixed level ASL.
        e. If the above paragraphs do not apply, this reject is output and the adjusted stock level
is loaded against a bench stock detail. The bench stock document number contained in positions
44-57 of the 1F3 input is already loaded on an adjusted stock level detail on file. Verify that
positions 44-57 are correct and reinput.
3. If action code is an L, a detail record for this input is already in the computer. If action code
is a C (change), this input would create a duplicate detail. Check the input for validity. If it is in
error, correct and reinput. This reject is produced by program NGV431.
4. TRIC XCH ISSL/MSSL input serial number positions 71-78 of the XCH image are equal to
ISSL/MSSL adjusted stock level already loaded for the same stock number and system
designator. Check input validity and, if in error, correct and reinput.

CHAP 7
7.29.1.99.1. Distribution:

Figure 7.3. Applicability for Distribution Action.




ACTION:
1. SPR: The input fund code must be compatible to the item record budget code. See AFH 23-
123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for correct fund codes.
2. DOR: ERRCD on the item record for the item being released is incompatible with due-out
ERRCD. ERRCD XD/XF versus ND/NF or XB is not compatible for release. If the property is
still desired, either change the ERRCD--if research determines error is involved--or cancel the
due-out and load an authorized/in-use detail record if appropriate. Then process an issue request
for the item using the appropriate demand code.
3. FIL: FB7048 only, Atomic Energy Detection System (AEDS), items must have a P serialized
stock number, ERRCD must be XD2, and RIC must be JBZ. Correct if necessary and reprocess
the input.
4. REC: An attempt has been made to release a due-out as a result of a substitute receipt or a
force DOR TEX code in the REC input, and the item records involved do not contain compatible
ERRCDs. Reinput the receipt with a bypass due-out release TEX code. If the property is still
desired, follow the procedures above for TRIC DOR.
716                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

5. TIN: An attempt has been made to force release a due-out for an item with incompatible
ERRCD. Blank positions 67-80 of the TIN input; then reprocess the turn-in with a bypass due-
out release TEX code. If the property is still desired, follow the procedures for TRIC DOR.
6. Other: The ERRCD/routing identifier code/budget code on input versus item record are
incompatible.
a. Determine errors as follows:
(1) If all three of these elements (ERRCD/routing identifier code/budget code) are blank on
input, the data already on the item record are erroneous.
(2) If only one or two of these elements are on input, the combination of data between input and
item record is incompatible.
(3) If all three elements are on input, the input is erroneous.
b. Correct data as shown in (a), (b), and Table 7.39.
(2) Prepare correct input(s) and reprocess; also input an FIC to change any of these data on item
record(s). Correct combinations of these data are as follows:
SBSS ROUTING IDENTIFIER/BUDGET CODE/ERRCD COMPATIBILITY TABLE (Note 6)
FB/FE ACCOUNTS: (Note 1)
c. Correct BMC input data as shown in (a) and (b) below:
(1) SNUD has pushed incompatible data in the BMC input. For example, ERRCD "T" (XD2)
with budget code 1, check the Management Data List (ML-C) or input 1SQ, SNUD Stock
Number Interrogation, with appropriate option code (see , Ch 8).
(2) The 1SQ input creates a BVAC/BVUC image that queries AFMC for correct catalog
management data. Reinput BMC with correct data.

Notes:
1. See the applicable paragraph of Ch 8, for proper use of budget code Z. Budget code Z
(authorized for equipment only) is assigned instead of budget code 9 when the unit price is
$250,000 or more. Since prices vary at different SBSS locales, AFMC will push items which
may be either budget code 9 or Z, depending upon location. In this case, AFMC (SNUD) will
push budget code asterisk (*) and program control will assign the proper budget code (9 or Z) as
determined by unit price. Except as specified in this chapter, the SBSS does not change these
budget codes once they have been assigned. D(xx) routing identifiers may be used with FSC
5800 when associated with FX3101 scheme materiel.
Note: 3101 procedures are no longer used, but logic has not been removed from the SBSS.
2. Budget code/ERRCD is assigned to local/depot manufacturer items as specified in this
chapter.
3. Budget Y is assigned to selected equipment items with a unit price of less than $250,000 that
are centrally procured with MAJCOMs O&M funds.

Notes:
1. Positions 7-36 are fields for selection.
2. Positions 40-69 are fields that contain or indicate data that are to be entered into the output
FCI.
3. The following information applies:
a. If selection of authorized in-use detail records is based upon the organization code, enter all
numbers for the organization code. There must be an organization cost center record loaded that
is equal to this code.
b. If selection is not based upon the organization code, leave this field blank.
4. The following information applies:
a. If selection is based upon the shop code, enter the shop code. Also enter the organization
code in positions 7-9, since selection is not made by shop code alone.
b. If selection is not based upon the shop code, leave this field blank.
5. The following information applies:
a. If selecting records for a specific use code, enter A, B, C, or D. Also enter the allowance
identification. Do not enter the use code unless the input organization and shop codes are blank.
b. If a use code is not needed for selection, leave this field blank.
6. The following information applies:
a. If the allowance identification is used for selection, enter this field. Use allowance ID as
follows:
(1) The first three positions must be numbers or blanks. The first three positions can be blank
only if the use code is D (WRM equipment). Do not use commas in the first three positions or
the input will reject.
(2) The last four positions can be numbers, letters, blanks, or commas. All except the commas
are used as selection factors. If you enter a comma in one or more of these positions, the
program will ignore that character of the allowance ID as a selection factor. You may use four

commas. A comma is the only special character that can be entered in these four positions;
otherwise, the input will reject.
(3) Allowance ID cannot be used for selection unless the change-from organization and shop
codes are blank.
(4) If selecting on WRM report code, this field cannot be blank.
b. If allowance ID is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
7. The following information applies:
a. If selection is by the organization code only, enter the change-to organization code. This code
must be a number and equal to an organization code that is loaded. The input will reject if the
change-to organization code is blank or equal to the change-from organization code.
b. If selection is by both organization and shop codes, the change-to organization and shop
codes must be entered. The change-from organization or shop code must be different from the
change-to code. The change-to organization code must be numeric and the applicable
organization cost center record must be loaded.
8. The following information applies:
a. If selection is by shop code, enter the change-to shop code. The change-to code can be equal
to the change-from code if the change-to and change-from organization codes are different.
Either the change-to organization code or the change-to shop code must be different from the
change-from code.
b. If selection is not by shop code, leave this field blank.
9. The following information applies:
a. Use codes A, B, and C can only be changed to A or B. If the change-from use code is D, the
change-to code must be D.
b. If this field does not apply, leave it blank.
10. The following information applies:
a. If the allowance ID is used for selection, enter this field.
(1) The first three positions can be any combination of numbers, blanks, or commas. Do not use
alpha characters in the first three positions.
(2) The last four positions can be any combination of letters, numbers, blanks, or commas. Any
position of the change-to allowance ID that contains a comma will cause the character in that
position of the allowance ID on the selected authorized-in-use detail record to be carried forward
to the same position of the allowance ID on the output FCI. Any input position that does not
contain a comma will cause that position from the input to be carried forward into the output
FCI. Do not use any special characters other than commas.
b. If the allowance ID is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
11. The following information applies:
a. If debit and credit transfer (issue and turn-in) documents are not desired when the FCI cards
are input, enter an S in this field. The S will be carried forward into the output FCI.
b. If debit and credit transfer documents are desired, leave this field blank. The blank will be
carried forward into the output FCI.
c. If this field is anything other than S or blank, the input will be rejected.
12. The following information applies:
a. If selection is desired by both the organization and shop codes, this field will contain a
beginning control number. (Position 78 must be blank.)
(1) Enter a four-digit number greater than zero. This number will be the next available control
number that can be assigned to an authorized-in-use detail record for the change-to shop code.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                          729

The last four positions of the change-to document number in the output FCIs will begin with this
number and run consecutively. EXCEPTION: If an authorized in-use detail record is already
loaded for the gaining custodian (same stock number, system designator, use code, WRM-
reporting application code, BASS composition, base of planned use, alternate storage location,
equipment code, end item identification code, UTC, increment code/number, and allowance ID),
the losing detail will be consolidated with the gaining detail record. The output FCI will contain
the document number of the gaining detail in the change-to document number field.
(2) All FCIs will be output with a complete change-to document number when selection
depends upon the shop code.
b. If the organization and shop codes are not used for selection, leave this field blank.
13. The following information applies:
a. If you use the organization code without the shop code for selection, use M (merge) or R
(retain) in this field. If position 78 contains anything other than M or R, or if position 78 is
blank, the input will be rejected.
(1) Enter M, and leave positions 74-77 blank, if you believe that the change-to organization code
has existing authorized-in-use detail records and the change-from organization code will merge
with that organization. If the computer finds an authorized-in-use detail to be merged with the
losing detail, the FCI will be output with the complete document number of the gaining detail
that the losing detail can be merged with. If no gaining detail is found that can be merged with
the losing detail, the gaining detail serial number portion will be blank on the output FCI image.
(2) Enter an R if it is desired to retain the losing detail serial number. If no details are found for
merging, the losing detail serial number will be entered into the gaining document number of the
output FCI.
b. If the organization code is not used for selection, leave this field blank.
14. System designator is a mandatory entry.
15. If you want the FCI images to be loaded to the pseudo for processing, enter a P. Leaving
this position blank will create a file with the file name of GV555UD900. The qualifier will be
the same as the qualifier for the print file. This file may be reviewed and/or edited prior to
loading to pseudo for processing. If this position equals a P and the program is being processed
on the secondary gang, ensure the primary gang is up.
14. Process change to prime detail only. This field is based on the change-to use code. For
change-to use code A, the field must be numeric (mobility increment number). For change to
use code B or D, the field can be alpha/numeric.

(1) The reject was due to a DIFM or authorized/in-use detail record not being in the computer
for the document number in positions 67-80 of the input. Correct and reinput.
(2) The input document number (positions 30-43) is invalid. Correct and reinput.
(3) The UJC AR or BR was assigned in error. Correct and reinput.
(4) The DIFM document number in positions 67-80 is a credit DIFM detail and cannot be used
as an AWP end item. Correct and reinput.
b. When the DIT input contains TEX code 5, the mark-for field must contain a DIFM document
number. Correct and reinput.
(1) Verify the end item document number (positions 67-80), the input document number
(positions 30-43), and the UJC.
(2) If they are invalid, correct and reinput.
(3) If the document number in positions 67-80 and the UJC are valid, forward the reject notice
to the LRS Customer Service if the end item is DIFM, or if the end item is an EAID type item.
(4) The LRS Customer Service will take necessary action to determine why the request was
processed as AWP if no details were in the computer for the end item.
(5) If it is determined that an end item is, in fact, in Maintenance or in the PMEL for repair,
determine if a DIFM or authorized/in-use detail record should be loaded to the computer.
(6) If so, initiate necessary documentation to load the detail and reinput the request with the
proper document number in positions 67-80.
(7) If it is determined that an end item exists but cannot be loaded to the computer, reinput the
request with TEX code E in position 51 and change the mark-for field, positions 67-80, to the
maintenance issue format when the requesting activity is equal to type organization code V, G, I,
7, 8, or 9.
(8) If the AWP end item is no longer loaded, then enter Y in position 81 and reinput.
2. RVP: Positions 4-6 contain the following:
a. ISU/DOR/MSI/TIN: If the input affects an authorized/in-use detail, supply point, WRM,
MRSP, or MSK detail, a detail record must be in the computer with a document number equal to
the input. Load the applicable detail if appropriate and reinput the RVP.
b. TIN/REC:
(1) When reversing unserviceable receipts or turn-ins, a DIFM unserviceable detail record must
be in the computer equal to the document number contained in positions 67-80 of the input.
Correct and reinput, if necessary.
(2) When reverse-posting TEX Q receipts, a DIFM unserviceable detail record must be in the
computer equal to the last eight positions of the input document number (positions 36-43) and
just after R920RW. Correct and reinput, if necessary.
c. SHP:
(1) When the SHP contained TEX code P, R or Z and there is no SNC detail record in the
computer equal to the input document, the reversal will not process. Destroy the input.
(2) When the TEX code is R, the unserviceable status code must be 4 and the supply condition
code must be J. If the budget code is other than 9 or Z and the TEX is P or Z, blank the TEX and
reinput.

(2) If the input matched the AFTO Form 350, work with Maintenance to ensure the AFTO Form
350 is correct.
(3) If no corrective action is made to the document number, enter the TEX code (12-zone punch
position 51) and re-input. This will cause the computer to bypass the DIFM edit. For non-
DIFM, verify the input document number.
(4) If the document number is in error, correct and reinput.
(5) There must be a corresponding detail record in the computer for all turn-ins that contain
activity codes C, E, M, S, U, or W. When the input contains a TEX code to force a due-out
release and the due-out detail record is not in the computer, this reject will result. The document
numbers in positions 30-43 and positions 60-80 must both be valid.
b. If the TIN input contains ALL of the following:
(1) Activity code B in position 30.
(2) Condition code A in position 44.(3) Supply action taken code U in position 62, then verify

appropriate:
(1) Re-input the TIN using activity code R.
(2) Load the bench stock detail and re-input the TIN.
5. B9(x): The input is a MICAP interrogation and the detail record is not in the computer or
does not have a MICAP flag.
6. DIT: The actions outlined for ISU inputs in the paragraph above also apply to DIT inputs
with the following exceptions:
a. No search is made for a corresponding authorized/in-use detail record. When the input
contains activity code E in position 67, the end item document number edit will be bypassed.
b. When it has been determined that an end item exists, but a detail record cannot be loaded to
the computer, the DIT will be reinput with TEX code E in position 7 in order to bypass the end
item document number edit.
7. FCS: The input document number is in error or not loaded. Correct and reinput.

8. FEX: Verify the input document number and supply condition code against the document
number and the supply condition code of the DIFM unserviceable detail record. If data are in
error, correct and reinput.
9. MSI: A detail record equal to the input document number, stock number, and system
designator must be in the computer.
10. REC: When the input contains a TEX code to force a due-out release, and the due-out detail
record is not in the computer, this reject will result. The document numbers in positions 60-73
must be valid. Correct and reinput. When the input contains RAR in positions 4-6 and project
code 440 in positions 57-59, the applicable due-out detail must be loaded. For the repair base,
process the A0E the owning base to establish the due-out detail required to process the RAR
receipt. For the owning base, process the RAR input to establish the due-in and due-out details.
11. TRM-post-post: Verify the input DIFM unserviceable detail document number and supply
condition code against the document number and supply condition code of the DIFM
unserviceable detail record. Correct and reinput.

a. Verify the input supply condition code against the DIFM unserviceable detail(s) supply
condition code for number. Correct and reinput.
b. For A2(x)/A4(x) being processed to clear an RDO suspense detail (* in position 73) verify the
document number is correct. If the document number is correct and still get a 260 reject there is
no RDO suspense detail to be cleared.
14. FTR: Verify the excess report detail record supply condition code against the DIFM
unserviceable detail record supply condition code for input stock number. Correct and reinput.
15. SHP: Verify the input DIFM unserviceable detail record document number and supply
condition code against the document number and supply condition code for the DIFM
unserviceable detail record. Correct and reinput.
Note: When input SHP contains TEX code R (Deficiency Report shipment), the input must
contain supply condition code J and the DIFM unserviceable detail record must contain
unserviceable status code U and supply condition code J.
16. SPR: Verify the input to ensure it is for an HPMSK due-out (UJC 1Z). If not, correct
UJC/due-out document number and reinput. Verify the input stock number of detail to be
loaded; then reprocess.
17. 1VR: The input detail document number is not in the computer. See Table 7.66. for 1VR
input format. Research the document number to determine why it is not loaded.
18. 1VS: The input detail document number is not in the computer. See Table 7.67. for 1VS
input format. Research the document number to determine why it is not loaded.
19. 1XA: The computer cannot find a detail record with the input document number, stock
number, or system designator to change or delete. Correct and re-input.
20. RAR: An authorized/in-use detail record must be loaded and contain a balance for
equipment items when EMC is other than 1. Verify the input document number. Correct and re-
input.
21. DSF/DSR (forward to Document Control): Research the D21 report for the date specified in

1. FER: The unit of issue on the change-from and change-to item records is unequal. Correct
erroneous unit(s) of issue. If the unit of issue is correct but unequal on both item records, issue
the misidentified item(s) to LRS Materiel Management Flight for turn-in under the correct stock
number.
2. FIS: The unit of issue on the input stock number is unequal to the unit of issue on the current
master item. These stock numbers cannot be related as M and/or I. Destroy the input.
3. REC:
a. This reject will occur when the REC input contains a unit of issue unequal to the input item
record. Review the unit of issue and unit price to ensure they are correct and compatible.
Coordinate suspected errors with LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity to process changes, if required.
b. This reject will also occur on a substitute receipt if the unit of issue of the item received is
unequal to that of the item requisitioned and if any of the following conditions exist:
(1) The input contains an over/short flag in position 65.
(2) The input unit of issue is not convertible to the requisitioned unit of issue.
(3) The converted input quantity is greater than the due-in detail record quantity.
c. To correct the condition in paragraph c(2)(a) above, simply blank position 60-65.
d. To correct the conditions paragraphs c(2)(b) and c(2)(c) above, notify the LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity of the substitute receipt so they can relate
the two stock numbers in an ISG. After notifying LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity, follow the procedures outlined below to process the receipt
correctly.
(1) If the receipt is for a nonfunded due-in or for a funded due-in with no BNR detail record,
forward to LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity.
(a) LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will cancel the due-in with an
AE1 status code Z6 and a TEX code M in position 51 if the due-in is for a MICAP requirement.
Then LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will prepare a due-out
cancel (DOC) for any due-outs with cancellation code Z6 that can be supported by, but not
automatically released by, the receipt. If there is a status ship detail on file, delete it with a TAR
D, then process the AE1/Z6.
(b) The REC will then be returned to Receiving which will reprocess the receipt with a J in
position 52. This processing will bypass the search for a due-in detail record.
(2) If the receipt is for a funded due-in and a BNR detail record does exist, forward the receipt to
LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity which will cancel the due-in with
an AE1 status code Z6 and with a TEX code M in position 51 if the due-in is for a MICAP
requirement. Then LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity will prepare a
(DOC) for any due-outs with cancellation code Z6 that can be supported by, but not
automatically released by, the receipt.
(a) The status program will internally create a 1DB input and interface with A&F program
NGV960 to delete the BNR detail record and re-identify it to a claims receivable detail record
when required.
(b) The REC will then be returned to Receiving which will reprocess the receipt with an I in
position 51. This processing will bypass the search for a due-in detail record, eliminate the
786                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

building of an RNB detail record, and clear the claims receivable detail record if required.
(c) Receiving will furnish a copy of the receipt accepted notice to LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or Mission Readiness. LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or Mission Readiness will prepare an ISU using
the canceled due-out document number, converting the unit of issue and quantity as required, and
forward the issue document to Demand Processing for processing.
e. Receipt not due-in processing will, under certain conditions, perform a claims receivable
detail record search (type detail F). The input unit of issue will be tested against the claims
receivable detail item record unit of issue. If the units of issue are incompatible, internal logic
will attempt the unit of issue conversion. When the unit of issue conversion cannot be
accomplished internally, LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
will accomplish an off-line unit of issue conversion. Reprocess the receipt after unit of issue
conversion actions have been completed.
4. FCU: The input unit of issue equals the item record. If the input is for a price change only,
the unit of issue field must be blank.
5. RVP: Have LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity prepare an
FCU to change the unit of issue back to the transaction history unit of issue. Also prepare
another FCU to change the unit of issue back to the current unit of issue. Then process inputs in
the following sequence:
a. Process an FCU to change the unit of issue back to what it was on the original transaction
history.
b. Process reverse-post inputs.
c. Process an FCU to change the unit of issue to the current unit of issue.
6. All other TRIC:
a. Correct the unit of issue and/or quantity and reinput. If necessary, contact LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity for assistance and the requesting
organization to verify the quantity desired.
b. When the reject occurs during due-out release processing, the input TRIC may be REC, TIN,
or DOR. The due-out being force released has a different unit of issue than the item record with
assets. Process the REC or TIN with TEX 8. Due-outs cannot be force released against an item
record with an unequal unit of issue.

record is not loaded for the input stock number.
3. TEX code I (REC input position 51) and Receipt Not Due-In Flag J (REC input position 52)
are not allowed for F(X)3101 project REC processing.
ACTION:
1. Determine if the document number applies to any valid due-in. The input document number
may have been incorrectly entered. If so, correct the input document number and reinput. An
AIQ input inquiry (inquiry code SN) for type record retrieval codes R, B, F, I, S will be output
following the 356 reject. This AIQ helps to determine duplicate shipments.
2. If the input is a due-in cancellation (TEX code E) and the document number appears to be
correct, forward the reject to LRS Customer Service indicate that an attempt has been made to
cancel a due-in that is no longer valid. No further action is required.
3. If the input document number is correct and this is a non-funded receipt (budget code other
than Z or 9), the receipt trigger input may be reinput with a J in position 52, which will cause a
bypass of the due-in detail search. Check for budget code and RID compatibility. After
processing the receipt, work with LRS Materiel Management Flight to determine if a ROD/SDR
exists.
4. If the input document number is correct and the receipt is for a funded item (budget code Z or
9), forward the reject to LRS Customer Service for research of the CTH . After processing the
receipt, work with LRS Materiel Management Flight to determine if a ROD/SDR exists.

Service must contact the BCO to ensure that proper authority exists for the local purchase
receipt.
6. A due-in detail record must be in the computer for all serviceable receipts that contain an
input routing identifier code of JBD, JBT, JBR, or RAR. The due-in detail record must also be
loaded for budget code Z items. If the input document number is correct, forward the reject to
LRS Customer Service for research and corrective action.
7. Determine that the due-in detail record is loaded. Correct and reinput. If the due-in detail
record is not loaded, no further action is required.
8. If the input document number has the current Julian date and serial number 9900 through
9999 inclusively, take action.
9. DIT processing prohibits any changes to "push" due-ins (demand code Z).
10. 1TO: Either the due-in document number on the due-out detail is blank, or the due-in cannot
be found. 1TO can only transfer due-outs that are linked to do-ins.

FORMAT:
Line 4: Due-in detail record (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 5 for processing format.)
Line 5: Local purchase status detail record.
ACTION:
1. Nonlocal purchase receipts:
a. The input quantity, due-in quantity, and/or quantity variance flag are not compatible. Receipt
due-in inputs that do not contain TEX code 2, 6, or Y must contain O, S, , E, or blank in position
65. Any other entry in this position is invalid. Correct and reinput if necessary.
b. A specific due-out cannot be force released (TEX code 2, 6, or Y) if the quantity received and
quantity due-in are unequal. Quantity variance flags S and O are not authorized for use with
receipt not due-in procedures. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for proper use of quantity variance
flags.2. Local purchase receipts: This reject will occur under one of the following conditions:
a. The due-in quantity does not equal the status quantity. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Process an
LPA input to change the status quantity.
b. The quantity received exceeds the quantity due-in. This includes receipt quantities that
exceed the authorized variation. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Use discrepant local purchase
procedures to resolve this problem. SF 364 paper form can be used for local purchase
discrepancies to the BCO. After correction, reprocess the receipt with the correct variation code
in position 54, or blank when no quantity variance is authorized.
c. When a quantity variation is authorized (positions 25-29 of the 5th line contain variable data),
the reject can occur in two ways:
(1) The input quantity is equal to or greater than the due-in quantity, but the input quantity
variation code (position 54) shows a partial receipt. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Change the input
variation code (position 54) to show a final receipt.
(2) The difference between the input and due-in quantity is greater than the authorized variation
recorded on the status detail. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Use the discrepant local purchase
procedures; SF 364 paper form can be used for local purchase discrepancies to the BCO.

REFERENCES: See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5E, Document Control and Detail Records.
ACTION: Document Control take actions outlined below.
830                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

1. Reason for Reject. The AFX/AFZ follow-up contains an advice code in positions 65-66 to
indicate the reason for the follow-up. The reason for the reject can be determined by using the
following advice codes:
a. Advice Code 35. This code tells you that the quantities in the AS3 sent by the LRS/Materiel
Management Activity and the XR1 sent by your DLADS did not match when they were received
by DLADS.
b. Advice Code 36. This code tells you that DLADS received the DLADS-generated XR1
transaction but has not received the LRS/Materiel Management Activity-generated AS3 status
document. The matching shipment-suspense detail transportation control number is blank. This
must be updated with the transportation control number that the A5J was shipped under. If there
is no shipment-suspense detail for this document number then process a REJECT CLEAR
CARD to clear the reject.
c. Advice Code 37. This is the opposite of advice code 36. This advice code tells you that the
DLADS received the LRS/Materiel Management Activity-generated AS3 status document but
has not received the corresponding XR1 transaction from your supporting DLADS. This advice
code will create a 528 reject from the initial input.
d. If you receive a large number of AFX/AFZ follow-ups with advice code 37, you should
contact your DLADS to determine why they are not forwarding the required XR1 transaction to
the DLADS.
e. You will only receive a 528 reject notice when the computer cannot automatically respond to
the AFX/AFZ follow-up or there is a discrepancy in the quantity shipped and the quantity
received by the DLADS.
2. Processing Actions:
a. Document Control will review the A5J document in file to determine the actual quantity
received by the DLADS.
b. If the quantity matches the 528 reject quantity, reprocess the AFX/AFZ input with a C in
position 44 and the actual quantity signed for on the A5J disposal document in positions 25-29.
This will cause an ASZ response to be automatically produced and sent to DLADS to clear the
suspense. No further processing is necessary.
c. If the quantities on the A5J and the 528 reject do not match, determine if a special inventory
and reverse-post action have already been accomplished. If no special inventory action has been
accomplished, forward a copy of the 528 reject notice to the Inventory Section for special
inventory action. Now, reprocess the AFX/AFZ reject with an R in position 44 and the actual
quantity which was received by the local DLADS in positions 25-29. This will cause an ASZ
response to be automatically produced and sent to DLADS to clear the suspense. No further
processing is necessary.
d. When a signed copy of the A5J disposal document is not in the document control file, contact
the DLADS and determine if they have received the shipment/transfer. Verify the quantity
DLADS received and obtain a signed duplicate copy of the document. If the quantity received
by DLADS and the quantity shipped by the LRS/Materiel Management Activity match,
reprocess the AFX/AFZ with a C in position 44 and the actual quantity which was received by
the local DLADS in positions 25-29. This will cause an ASZ response to be automatically
produced and sent to DLADS to clear the suspense. No further processing is necessary.
e. If DLADS confirms only a partial receipt or indicates that the shipment was not received,
make note of the facts and the amount of quantity variance on the 528 reject and forward the
reject to LRS Procedures and Accountability for special inventory action. Now, reprocess the
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        831

AFX/AFZ reject with an R in position 44 and the actual quantity which was received by the local
DLADS in positions 25-29. This will cause an ASZ response to be automatically produced and
sent to DLADS to clear the suspense. No further processing is necessary.

Determine by research the valid type stock record account code and delete the record from the
invalid type stock record account code.
2. AE1, AS1, AN1, and other MILSTRIP Status Documents. The second position of the status
document number contains a type stock record account code that is different from the one stored
on the due-in detail record (202-TYPE-SRAN). If the input document is correct, there is a
possibility that the source of supply has duplicate requisitions under two different type stock
record account codes. Contact the source of supply to determine whether duplicate requisitions
are on file for both stock record account codes involved. If a duplicate requisition exists and the
requisition can be canceled, submit a manually prepared AC1 cancellation request for the

ACTION: The computer produces this notice as a result of processing an XCA, Readiness
Based Leveling (RBL), input when the input stock number is not loaded in the SBSS. The LRS
Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity monitor must check the AFMC D043B
system using either online D043A or FEDLOG to see if the stock number provided in the XCA
image belongs to an ISG.
1. If the stock number is not loaded in the D043B system (does not belong to an ISG), reprocess
the XCA image with TEX code “T” in position 80 of the input. An XCC output image will be
produced with “99999” in the quantity field, a reconciliation/update code “N” in position 42, and
a compatible/incompatible code of “I” in position 58. This will advise AFMC that your base
should not be considered a user of the item any longer.
2. If the stock number in question is loaded in an ISG and it is listed as the D043B (AFMC)
master item, then check to see if any of the other stock numbers in D043B are loaded locally in
the SBSS. If at least one of the stock numbers in that ISG is loaded in the SBSS, process TRIC
FIL to load the stock number and TRIC FIS to link the items in a local ISG. Reprocess the
original XCA image.
3. If the stock number is loaded in the D043B but it is not the D043B master item, then contact
HQ AFMC/LGIC to determine why the base received an RBL allocation on the item. Advise
HQ AFMC/LGIC that your base is not a user of the item in question and the item is not the
D043B master item so it does not need to be loaded locally. HQ AFMC/LGIC should remove
the base as a user. Reprocess the XCA image with TEX code “T” in position 80 of the input.
An XCC output image will be produced with “99999” in the quantity field, a
reconciliation/update code “N” in position 42, and a compatible/incompatible code of “I” in
position 58.
7.29.1.609. 612 REJ XCA STOCK NUMBER LOADED IN I&SG WITH SUBSTITUTES -
LGSMS NOTE: LRS CUSTOMER SERVICE/GLSC STOCK CONTROL
Note: While AFGLSC is still reflected on the reject notice, the function in AFMC is now
AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity.
DISTRIBUTION: LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity.
ACTION: The computer produces this notice as a result of processing an XCA, Readiness
Based Leveling (RBL), input when a local ISG contains both a master/interchangeable
relationship and a substitute stock number with an ISG source code equal to 9. Upon receipt of
the 612 reject notice and an attached AIQ, LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
Activity must review the substitute (relationship code “S”) items in the group.
1. If any substitute stock number has a numeric order of use code, LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must determine if any of the RBL quantity
should be applied against the locally coded substitute stock number(s). This action is necessary
because AFMC allocates RBL quantities on the D043B master item for the whole D043B group,
regardless of how individual bases have the items linked locally. To make this decision, LRS
Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must check the AFMC D043B system
using either online D043A or FEDLOG to see if the substitute item is in the same D043B ISG as
the base master. If the base master and the base substitute(s) are in the same D043B ISG, then
the RBL quantity will have to be divided up among the base master/interchangeable relationship
and the base substitute(s).
2. If the level is to be divided among the master stock number and substitute stock numbers,
LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must create XCA inputs with a
844                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

TEX code A in position 80. Process the XCA inputs against the master and all substitute stock
numbers that have an ISG order code equal to 9.
Note: If substitutes exist with ISG source code other than 9, then no manually prepared XCA is
necessary because these items will either get an RBL themselves or SNUD ISG processing will
automatically change them to interchangeables.
3. If the quantity is not sufficient to be divided among the master and all substitute items,
process an XCA with a zero level for the master or each substitute without a positive level in the
group. Do not exceed the quantity on the original XCA received from AFMC.
4. If LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity decides to apply the level
against the master stock number only, enter an A in position 80 of the original XCA and
reprocess. Also prepare and process XCAs with an A in position 80 and a quantity of zero
against each substitute item that has an ISG source code equal to 9.
5. After these XCAs with an A in position 80 are reprocessed (regardless of how the RBL
quantity is divided up), LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must
manually prepare a level receipt acknowledgment (XCC) transaction reflecting the stock number
and quantity received on the original XCA transaction, i.e., from the 612 reject input image. The
manually prepared XCC must be forward to the RPS for transmission through DLATS.
6. If the base master and the base substitute(s) are not in the same D043B ISG group, then the
substitute(s) should get an RBL in its own right so no further action on the substitute(s) is
necessary at this time. However, LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity
must still reprocess the original XCA with an A in position 80 against the base master and
manually prepare and transmit an XCC as stated above.

ACTION: Verify the input quantity, Stock Number, and Document Number. If the input
quantity of the rejected transaction is greater than or less than the total number of 249 or 250
records, action must be taken to correct. If the total number of 249 or 250 records match the
input quantity, make sure only those details effected by the transaction are properly flagged.
Any other details flagged with the corresponding action code or receipt code will cause the

must be an ‘I’ for the affected detail(s).
2. IAD: The action code of the 249 detail(s), or action code of the 250 detail(s), must be an ‘A’.
Ensure that only those details that are currently being adjusted contain these codes. Any other
detail document numbers that contain an ‘A’ in the action code field will produce this reject.
3. 1ET, TIN(from details): The 250-ACTION-CODE field must be blank for complete
quantities. For partial quantities, the 250-ACTION-CODE must be ‘T’. Ensure that only those
details that are currently being transferred or turned in contain these codes. Any other detail
document numbers that contain an ‘T’ in the action code field will produce this reject.
4. 1KT: The 250-ACTION-CODE field must be blank for complete quantities. For partial
quantities, the 250-ACTION-CODE must be ‘K’. Ensure that only those details that are
currently being transferred between kits contain these codes. Any other detail document
numbers that contain an ‘K’ in the action code field will produce this reject.
5. FET: The 250-ACTION-CODE field must be blank for complete quantities. For partial
quantities, the 250-ACTION-CODE must be ‘F’. Ensure that only those details that are currently
being transferred between custodians contain these codes. Any other detail document numbers
that contain an ‘F’ in the action code field will produce this reject.
6. MSI: The 250-ACTION-CODE field must be an ‘M’. Ensure that only those details that are
currently being issued contain these codes. Any other detail document numbers that contain an
‘M’ in the action code field will produce this reject.
7. SRC: Enter the actual on-hand quantity of the authorized in-use detail in the quantity field.
Do not enter the adjustment level quantity.
8. REC:
a. When processing REC for serialized COMSEC or WEAPONS, check to be sure that the
suffix field of the document number is the same. CAUTION: Screen #058, REC inquiry, will
bring forth DUE-IN with a ‘Z’ in the suffix code field. If the serialized document number does
not have a suffix code, delete this field before processing the REC. Prior to processing an REC,
the same number of serialized control details (249 record) must be loaded as the REC quantity.
Only those serialized details to be immediately received may have a 249-receipt code of ‘R’.
Blank all other 249 receipt codes equal to ‘R’.
b. If reject is a result of a REC/DOR and there are due outs. An XHB must be processed to
identify the serial number that will be released. When processing the REC and the asset is to be
released to a specific due out, the REC can be processed with a TEX code ‘2’ and the due out
document number entered in positions 60-73. The TEX 2 will create a 249 record and store an
‘I’ in the 249-ACTION-CODE.
9. TIN: If the reject is a result of a TIN and there are due outs. The transaction must be
processed with a TEX code ‘2’ and the due out document number entered in positions 67-80.

ACTION:
Determine if the file in the 4th line is assigned to another run. If the file is assigned to another
run, wait until the run is completed before processing the input. If not and the images in the file
are valid, follow the steps below:
1. Determine which SIFS files are currently cataloged on the system by doing the following:
 Figure 7.4. Cataloged SIFS Files.




2. Check each cataloged file using any text editor. If the file is empty, does not have an end-of-
file marker, or is not a standard data file, delete it.
3. All valid files must be retriggered using SIFS utility menu option 9.
4. Reprocess input (transaction that 630 reject occurred on).
7.29.1.628. 631 REJ INPUT NOT GENERATED BY AFEMS.

detail records should not exceed the base Requisition Objective.
ACTION: FSP (LRS Materiel Management Flight), 1MK (LRS War Readiness).
If the detail authorized quantities are valid, process a request for a special level. If the detail
authorized quantities are not valid, reduce the authorized quantities and re-process the
transaction.
For 1MK only: Under special and temporary circumstances the 632 reject can be bypassed using
transaction exception code “Y” in position 60 of the input of the 1MK. This will load/change the
MSK detail but it will not correct the underlying problem with the RO not being adequate to
cover the requirement so an I140 management notice will be produced when requirements
computation is performed on the item. These situations should be monitored closely and
corrected as soon as possible.

Note: Fuels procedures are no longer used, but logic has not been removed from SBSS.
ACTION:
1. This reject occurs when TRIC 1RD, 1RF, 1DF, 1FN, or 1BN inputs do not match with the
AVFUEL validation record (CIC, organization code, MDS, and/or DODAAC not compatible).
These rejects go to the activity that created the input (BFMO, A&F, ANG, AFRC). To assist in
the research, each input activity is provided an AVFUEL Validation Table List (M33/NGV973).
2. If the input is incorrect, correct and reprocess.

3. If the AVFUEL Validation record is incomplete, take the following action:
a. BFMO, ANG, or AFRC units must immediately contact the A&F Office (AFO) which will
process a TRIC 1VT input to update the record. Following this action, reprocess the rejected
input transaction. The AFO will do the same for TRIC, 1FN inputs that rejected.

DISTRIBUTION: LGLOS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity.
ACTION: The RPS console prints this message to indicate that the computer has completed an
inline follow-up scan.
7.30.1.30. F031 MGT ITEM RECORD SOURCE CODE IS OTHER THAN ALPHA
ACTION: LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity must determine the
specific numeric parts preference code (NPPC) assigned to the item record and research either
the D043A or FEDLOG to determine if the item is properly coded. However, the only NPPCs
that are actually listed in FEDLOG are NPPCs 4 and 9. If the NPPC assigned to the NSN in
question is a “2”, then check to see if the NSN has a phrase code N assigned to it (because a
phrase code N in the D043A or FEDLOG equates to an NPPC “2” in the SBSS). If the NPPC
assigned to the NSN in question is a “5”, then check to see if the NSN has an acquisition advice
code AFMC TRAP Activity of Y assigned to it (because an AAC Y equates to an NPPC “5” in
the SBSS). (Note: If the NPPC is "4" and the "4" does not show up in the D043A or FEDLOG,
then contact your TCTO monitor to determine if the NPPC "4" is valid.) If you determine that
the item is not properly coded, process an FCD to remove the NPPC and reprocess the original
XCA transaction using the F031 input image. If the item in question is in an ISG, consider the
fact that the input transaction (DIC: XCA) will reflect the D043B master item, not the base
master. If this is the case, and the base-level master is the item with the NPPC, then process FIS
transactions (using source code 9) to change the base master to an interchangeable or substitute,
as appropriate, and reprocess the XCA. After this is done, reprocess the original XCA
transaction. If the D043B master appears to be properly coded with an NPPC or if the item is not
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      877

in an ISG and it appears to be properly coded, then contact your MAJCOM RBL monitor, who in
turn will coordinate with the RBL monitor at HQ AFMC/LGIC to verify the NPPC and to
determine if the item should be excluded from the RBL allocation or if some other action is
necessary.
1. If the NPPC is verified as correct, manually prepare an XCC transaction, using the F031 input
image, with an I in position 58 and a quantity of 99999. Forward the XCC to the RPS for
transmission through DLATS.
2. If the NPPC is incorrect, process an FCD to remove the NPPC and reprocess the XCA using
the F031 input image.
Note: See “Processing Readiness Based Level (RBL) Transactions (DIC XCA)” for further
instructions on handling the F031 management notice.
7.30.1.31. F032 MGT COMBAT FUELS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CFMS) RECORD IS

document, even though it created multiple histories. Therefore, the quantity printed on the
warehouse change document should be compatible with the ending balance reflected in the
transaction history, identified by the transaction serial number on the DCC input and warehouse
change document. Ignore the DCC input quantity, and transaction history action quantity when
the computer mechanically prints this management notice on the document.

number. Conduct proper research to determine if one of the stock numbers applies to the
requested item.
1. If none of the stock numbers applies, process the input according to Ch 8.
2. If a stock number does apply, reinput the request with the stock number in positions 8-22.
Notes:
1. The computer also produces this notice when a single stock number is loaded for a part
number but assets are not available for issue. Research and reprocess as outlined above. The
computer prints all part number detail records located according to the format listed in AFH 23-
123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 5.
2. Issue inputs are limited to the first 14 positions of the part number. All part number detail
records listed on this notice will match the 14 positions of the input, but may not match the full
part number requested. EXTREME CAUTION should be used when determining if a stock
number is applicable when the requested part number is more than 14 positions.
3. For fuels TRIC, the product grade code must be loaded to the part number detail record. If no
part number/stock number has been loaded, or a duplicate is in the computer, take corrective
action (see Ch 8); that is, load or delete the part number/stock number as necessary.

ACTION: The computer produces this notice as a result of an ISU or A0(x) (lateral support
requisition) input that has been killed or cannot be completely filled. This notice is also
produced when an A2x/A4x is processed and the Master or Interchangeable has a numeric parts
preference code (NPPC) assigned or when a substitute NSN has a source code other than “X”.
Another scenario for producing this notice is when the A2x/A4x is processed and Supply Points
and MSK assets are off base and deployed respectively. When this occurs, the I023 management
notice is amended to the I136 management notice and forwarded to LRS Customer
Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity.
1. If the input TRIC is ISU, see Issue Requests for Expendable Items (TRIC ISU) and Issue
Requests for Non-Expendable Items (TRIC ISU).
2. If the input TRIC is A0x, see the paragraph on lateral requisitions.
3. If the input TRIC is LVL, assets are available in an (ISG) with a firm due-out on file. Force
due-out release as applicable.
4. If the input TRIC is A2x/A4x, then LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control
Activity will have to check the numeric source coded item in the D043 or FEDLOG to determine
what the source code was before it was tailored and if the source code is equal to or higher than
the one on the input stock number (taking the jump-to code into account also). Then the item
can be shipped to satisfy the RDO. After research has been conducted and the asset cannot be
shipped, then take action to deny the RDO. Reinput the RDO request to ship or deny and to
decrease and/or delete the RDO suspense detail.
Note: The computer also provides this notice for serviceable TIN inputs for -1 (dash 1) other
than TEX 2 and -2 (dash 2) NSNs) when due-outs exist. Force due-out release (DOR)/post-post

detail record balance which caused the error or creation of a -9 (dash 9) record. If the sum of the

a releveling inquiry. If the error still exists, contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
Activity.
2. This reject is caused by an arithmetic register overflow. To correct this reject, process a type
2 inquiry. Verify that the item record unit price is in error and process a unit price change
(FCU). If the unit price is correct, verify the cumulative recurring demands. Compute the daily
demand rate. To determine if the daily demand rate is realistic, it may be necessary to adjust the
cumulative recurring demand field in order for the item to be releveled. To adjust the level,
process a demand data change (FCL) input.

point/MSK/RSP/HPMSK/DIFM detail records when the requested quantity cannot be satisfied.
The process also creates an RDO suspense detail when this notice is produced. The only way to
clear the RDO suspense detail is to contact the supply point and/or MSK, RSP, HPMSK and/or
DIFM monitor to determine if the requested items can be shipped. For MSK, RSP, or HPMSK
assets that are in a deployed status and, after verification, it is determined that the assets can be
released for shipment, then the deployed indicator will be taken off. If the items can be shipped,
the A2x/A4x can be reinput to ship directly off the applicable detail or the items can be turned in.
After enough items have been turned in, reinput the A2x/A4x to cause shipment. If the item(s) is
not available from supply point, MSK, RSP, HPMSK or DIFM, then reinput the A2x/A4x with
the appropriate TEX/denial code to deny the shipment.

COMPLETE PROCESSING
DISTRIBUTION: LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity or Mission
Readiness.
ACTION:
1. If DIT input is required, then process a DIT to realign the mark-for field using the original
type transaction phrase code (TTPC) 2A or 2C transaction history. If a due-in detail record is
created by reverse-posting of an REC, include the requisition number in DIT input to relate the
due-in record to the due-out record, if required.
2. If NOR input is required, then process a NOR input for upgrading the due-out.
3. If SPR input is required, then process a special requisition (SPR) input to re-requisition the
Mission Capability (MICAP) requirement.
7.31.1.213. I258 MGT INPUT AND DETAIL DATE OF OBLIGATION UNEQUAL
ACTION:
1. If, after thorough research, it was determined that the input contained an incorrect date or
entry, then correct and reinput.
2. If, after thorough research, it was determined the detail record contained an incorrect date of
obligation, then an FIX input will be required to correct the detail record. LGLOS/AFMC SCM-
R Computer Operations Activity will be advised and provided all information compiled during
research of the problem. They will prepare and process the FIX input. If the input obligation
date is valid and second prior or prior fiscal year, then the detail record should contain the same
date with an overpunch in the first position, (an 11-zone for second prior and a 12-zone for prior
fiscal year). For example, the date 4179, when given an 11-zone overpunch, becomes D179.
7.31.1.214. I259 MGT ORIGINAL EXTENDED COST INVALID IN CARD NBR 2

ACTION: The input is already entered for this system designator/type stock record account
code. Lines 5-7 are the images of those inputs already entered for this transaction. If the last
input was entered without END in positions 78-80, then prepare and enter another input with the
next highest input number (position 7) in the following format: positions 1-6, positions 23-24,
positions 30-43, and position 52 will be the same as the inputs already entered; position 7 will be
the next highest number; and positions 78-80 must have END.
7.31.1.218. I263 MGT INVALID CARD POSITION IN POSITION 7
ACTION: The input number must be 1-4. Correct and reinput.
7.31.1.219. I264 MGT DOCUMENT NUMBER = xxxxxxxxxxxxxx QUANTITY TO BE
SHIPPED = xxxxx
This management notice is printed immediately after receiving the 616 reject. It informs the
initiator that a discrepancy was detected when the shipment was being processed against a
serialized asset. The 616 reject notifies the initiator that the A2(x) input quantity does not equal
the total number of 250-In-Use-Serialized-Control details in the supply point or MSK detail.
The I264 Management Notice, on the other hand, provides the initiator the specific detail from
940                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

which the RDO (TRIC A2x) was being processed against when the discrepancy was
encountered. The quantity to be shipped on the notice is the actual quantity that will be shipped
from the detail. This quantity may not be the same as the quantity on the rejected A2x
transaction. EXAMPLE: A2x input quantity is 10, item record balance is 8, and supply point
detail balance is 5. The program will ship from the item record first (quantity of 8) and then try
to ship 2 more from the supply point detail. Since a quantity of 2 is all that’s required, a 616
reject is produced because the supply point detail has 5 (five) 250-In-Use-Serialized-Control
details.
ACTION: Process TRIC DSR for equipment or XHB for COMSEC assets using phrase “RDO”
in positions 23-25 to mark the serialized assets to be shipped. Remember to process an equal
number of DSR or XHB inputs to match the “Quantity To Be Shipped” on the management
notice. In the above example, process two (2) DSR/XHB inputs to mark the 250-In-Use-
Serialized-Control details, and then reprocess the rejected A2(x) input for the original input
quantity, which is ten (10).

DISTRIBUTION: LRS Customer Service/AFMC SCM-R Stock Control Activity.
ACTION: The computer has assigned REX 1 due to processing local purchase status which
contained status code ZG/ZH. Review the requirement with the user to determine if a substitute
item is acceptable. If a substitute is acceptable, then rerequisition it through normal channels.
Remove REX code 1 and replace it with a local REX and IEX code to prohibit automatic
requisitioning. If a substitute item is not acceptable, then the following actions must be taken:
1. If the fifth position of the stock number is P and the routing identifier code equals JBx, then
coordinate with LRS Customer Service personnel for the assignment of the routing identifier
code as outlined in Ch 8. If the stock number is a catalog item, then remove the REX 1 and
assign REX code 2. This action will cause the item to be requisitioned from the federal stock
class/materiel management code (FSC/MMAC) item manager with advice code 2A.
2. If the item record routing identifier code is other than JBx, then remove the REX code 1 and
prepare a special requisition (SPR) to rerequisition the item from the item record routing
identifier code and assign advice code 2A. If CW status continues to be received on a given
item, then assignment of a local REX modifier may be needed. A local REX modifier will
assign advice code 2A to prevent the CW cancellation from the item record source of supply.
3. REX code 2 has been automatically assigned due to processing of status code ZG at overseas
bases other than Alaskan Air Command bases.

ACTION: Program NGV024 prints this notice on the item and repair cycle link errors report. It
indicates that the computer cannot locate a repair cycle record for an item record with an XDx
ERRCD. A linkage error exists between the item record (owner record) and repair cycle record
(member record).
1. If the item record is not required, process a FID to delete.
2. If the item record is still required, reestablish the repair cycle record. To do this, change the
ERRCD on the item record to a nonrepair cycle ERRCD with a FIX input. Next, change it back
to the correct ERRCD with an FIC input which will cause the repair cycle record to be
established. You may then correct the data fields on the repair cycle record using FIX input.

FORMAT: Repair cycle record
DISTRIBUTION: LGLOS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity RPS console

ACTION: Program NGV024 prints this notice on the item and repair cycle link records report.
It indicates that the computer cannot locate the item record for a repair cycle record or the
ERRCD on the item record is not XDx or XFx.
1. Process an inquiry for the item record. If the item record is in the computer, the ERRCD
should equal other than XDx or XFx. If the ERRCD on the item record is correct, use a FIX
input to blank the repair cycle record. If the ERRCD on the item record is incorrect, input a FIX
to correct the item record ERRCD. Do not attempt to input a file maintenance input, such as
FIC, to correct the item record ERRCD. The computer will generate an additional error
condition when the program attempts to create a repair cycle record.
2. If the item record is not in the computer, research the stock number through
document/transaction registers and Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) update changes to
determine if there has been a stock number change. If the stock number has changed, check
further to determine if an item record for the new stock number is in the computer. If the new
stock number is in the computer, and there is no repair cycle record for this item record, comply
with the actions in the S528 management notice. If there is already a repair cycle record for this
item record, use FIX inputs to merge the repair cycle record data into the correct record and
blank the duplicate repair cycle record.
3. If the item record is not in the computer and a stock number change is not involved,
determine if there are data on the repair cycle record that must be involved in the RAMPS report.
If there are, the item record must be reestablished. Comply with the actions in the S528
management notice. If there are no RAMPS reportable data on the repair cycle record, use a FIX
input to blank the repair cycle record. This notice is for information only. Program NGV024
does not take automatic corrective action.

ACTION: Program NGV210 generates this notice on the RPS console. It indicates that the RPS
console operator is attempting a beginning-of-day (BOD) initialization, and the ordinal date is in
error. The RPS console operator should verify INT image, and ensure that the date is not equal
to or less than the special control record (002-ORDINAL-DATE). If the operator finds an error,
correct it and reprocess the image. If the image is correct and the special control record ordinal
date is invalid, use program NGV026 to adjust the 002-ORDINAL-DATE to be 1 day less than
the date on the INT image; then reprocess BOD. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3 for initialization
input format and preparation instructions.

ACTION: Program NGV898C generates this management notice when the input RPTRUN
select input contains an * (asterisk) in position 80. The use of this option in the RPTRUN select
input will bypass the internally generated database (IRU) dump. EXTREME CAUTION must be
used when this option is selected, since the recovery start point will then be the last database
(IRU) dump taken. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3 for RPTRUN select input format and
preparation instructions.
7.33.1.109. S744 MGT SECONDARY DATABASE IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR
PROCESSING
DISTRIBUTION: LGLOS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity RPS console
operator.
ACTION: Program NGV898C generates this management notice when the computer has built
the secondary database for reports processing and that database is ready. The RPS console
operator must now input the secondary database CON inputs if the secondary database requires a
different user terminal and/or printing device configuration for secondary database output
products than that established for primary database output.
7.33.1.110. S745 REJ TYPE DATABASE INCORRECT
DISTRIBUTION: LGLOS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity RPS console
operator.
ACTION: Program NGV801A generates this reject notice when the RPS console operator
attempts to process reports against the secondary database, but has the computer database loaded
as the primary database. This reject notice will also occur when reports processing is to be
against the primary database and the computer database is loaded as the secondary database. If
the RPS console operator has loaded the incorrect set of CON inputs against either database, this
reject notice will also occur. The base constants-1 record 001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-
FLAG is improperly set. Reinput the CON inputs with CON 02 (position 51) equal to P or S, as
required.
7.33.1.111. S746 REJ REPORTS HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED ON THE SECONDARY
DATABASE
DISTRIBUTION: LGLOS/AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity RPS console
operator.
ACTION: Program NGV801A generates this reject notice for one of two reasons:
1. The computer has processed RPTRUN select input against the primary database. However,
the computer has not processed RPTEON select input against the secondary database. An
attempt was made to initiate the next computer reports processing day prior to completion of the
current reports processing day.
2. The computer has processed RPTRUN select input against the primary database, but the
beginning of day (BOD) has not been initiated. However, the computer has processed RPTEON
select input against the secondary database. Process the RPTEON select input against the
primary database.
Note: The computer generates this reject notice to prevent any attempt to allow two concurrent
processing to occur. It also prevents any damage to the primary database reports sequence
control record to result after RPTEON has been processed on the primary database.

ACTION: Program 898C generates this management notice when the input RPTRUN select
input contains an (*) asterisk in position 80 or a B in position 79. The use of these options in the
RPTRUN select input will bypass the internally generated data-base (IRU) dump and the tape
dump of the primary CTH areas. Extreme caution must be used when the (*) asterisk in position
80 is used, since the recovery start point will then be the last data dump taken and there will not
be a current tape dump of the primary CTH areas. When the B in position 79 of the RPTRUN
select input is used (position 80 = blank), the data-base (IRU) dump will be generated and the
primary CTH areas tape dump will be bypassed. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3 for RPTRUN
select input format and preparation instructions.

                                    Chapter 8
                       RESEARCH AND RECORDS MAINTENANCE

Section 8A-- Item and Part Number Detail Record Loads
8.1. Chapter Summary.
8.1.1. This chapter explains specific processes of Research and Records Maintenance, which are
in the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity respectively and are part of the Customer Support Section (LGRMC) at the LRS level.
The LRS through the LGRMC manages all Research and Records Maintenance responsibilities
for local purchase/manufacture item records.
8.1.1.1. Research. Sec. 8A and section 8B explains the primary responsibilities and procedures
of Research. Among its various responsibilities, Research identifies requested items to a NSN;
initiates inputs to load new item records; researches inputs that have rejected because the item
record was not loaded; acts as a single point of contact for technical publications requirements
and distribution for LRS/Materiel Management Activity. Also, it maintains a current central
research file of stock lists and supply publications, a current publications index file, and a limited
working file of specifications, standards, and drawings required for research purposes. Research
processes/functions are primarily performed at the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity maintains item records and processes all stock list
changes received from AFMC data systems.
8.1.1.2. Records Maintenance. Sec. 8C through Sec. 8T describe the general and specific
procedures of Records Maintenance. Among its responsibilities, Records Maintenance maintains
and updates the internal records of the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) (Sec. 8D through
Sec. 8G); maintains the Stock Number Directory (M14/NGV814) (Sec. 8H); establishes and
maintains interchangeable and substitute groups (ISGs) (Sec. 8I); establishes and maintains
frozen item records, transportation data, and other indicative data (Sec. 8J through Sec. 8O).
Also, it processes shipping destination records, organization cost record, and other records (Sec.
8P through Sec. 8S); and prepares, controls, processes, and follows up on AF IMT (Information
Management Tool) 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action. (For more information about
Records Maintenance responsibilities, see AFI 23-101, Sec. 1B, Organization Structure and
Responsibilities.) Records Maintenance processes/functions are primarily performed at the
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity. Notes: 1. While LGSPC is still reflected on
SBSS output notices, the function in LRS or equivalent is now LGLOS. The term LGSPC will be
listed until programmatically updated.       2. While the term Materiel Support Division (MSD)
is now Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S), The terms Materiel Support
Division and/or MSD will be shown as reflected in SBSS outputs until programmatically
updated.
8.2. Overview. Section Summary. This section first provides instructions for loading item
records. Next, it gives instructions for loading, changing, and deleting part number detail
records.
8.3. Scope of Operation. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and LRS Research
and Records Maintenance process and update records for all items managed in the SBSS.
8.4. Record Load Preparation and Processing.
8.4.1. Item Record Load. Procedures for preparing and processing item record loads are
contained in Document Flow for Item Record Loads (Para 8.187).
1000                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.4.2. Noncataloged Items. Research and processing actions for noncataloged items are outlined
in section 8B.
8.4.3. Part Number Load. The procedures for preparing and processing part number to stock
number load are contained in Part Number Detail Record Load, Change, or Delete Format (Para
8.190).
8.5. Changes to Item Records.
8.5.1. Part Number Data. Sec. 8A explains the procedures for preparing and processing part
number loads, changes, and deletes.
8.5.2. Indicative Data. Sec. 8D through section 8T explain the procedures for preparing and
processing changes to essential data on item, detail, and support records.
8.6. General Procedures for Loading Item Records.
8.6.1. Conditions for Item Record Loads. In general, load new item records after a management
or reject notice output indicates that the item record is not in the SBSS database. An exception
to this loading procedure occurs when special support requirements, such as an Initial Spares
Support List (ISSL)/Wholesale Contractor Initial Spares List (WCISL), are loaded. Procedures
for processing such exceptions are contained in the chapter covering the particular requirement.
The LRS or AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity can load item records, however, the
LRS, Customer Service Section, will load item records when base customers are unable to
process their own item record loads.
8.6.2. Document Flow for Item Record Loads. Para 8.187 explains document preparation and
flow for an item record load.
8.6.3. Required Research for Item Record Loads. Before you load a new item record, you must
first check the Stock Number Directory, stock lists, other related technical publications, or D043
to validate the stock number; to determine indicative data, codes, nomenclature, etc.; and to
prepare the Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) FIL, Item Record Load (see Para 8.188)..
8.6.4. Loading of Part Number Detail Record. A part number detail record will be loaded at the
time of a new item record load for all NSN, part numbers, and P serialized numbers which
resulted from a part number request.
8.7. Specific Data for Specific Item Loads.
8.7.1. Non-Stock Listed (NSL) Part Numbered Items. Use section 8B to determine what data to
include on item records for NSL part numbered items. The LRS loads item records for NSL part
numbered items.
8.7.2. Vehicle Items. Assign budget code V or Y to vehicles as identified in D043 or FEDLOG.
8.7.3. Loads with Incorrect Data. When the input quantity unit pack code, shelf life code, or
application codes are invalid (incorrect), load the item record without them. Management notice
F302 will be produced when there are any unacceptable data. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for
specific codes.
8.7.4. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Kits.
8.7.4.1. Nomenclature. Normally, the nomenclature will contain the letters TO in the first two
positions, a blank in the third position, and the technical order in the remaining 16 positions of
the available nomenclature field (for example: TO 1B-52F-634-A). If the TCTO kit is directed
by the parent command or locally directed the nomenclature field will contains TO in the first 2
positions, a blank in the third position, and the command designation in the next three to five
positions (such as ACC, AMC, PACAF). The remaining fields contain the entries indicated
above.
8.7.4.2. ERRCD XD2. ERRCD XD2 will be assigned to each TCTO kit item record.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1001

8.7.4.3. Routing Identifier Codes. Routing identifier codes will be assigned as follows.
Centrally procured depot/contractor assembled TCTO kits will be assigned the appropriate depot
routing identifier codes (FHZ, FLZ, etc.). Base assembled TCTO kits will be assigned routing
identifier code JBD (local manufacture).
8.7.4.4. Unit Cost. The unit cost of TCTO kits authorized for assembly at base level will be
equal to the total cost of all parts in the kit.
8.7.5. Loading Other Service-Managed Reparable Items. Other service-managed assets where
the Air Force is not a known user, and the reparability code for the item equates to an Air Force
ERRCD of XD2 or ND4, will be loaded using ERRCD XF3 and NF3, respectively. In addition,
an excess exception code 1 and a shipment exception code 2 will be assigned to the item record
to preclude automatic transfer of assets to DLADS and allow IM disposal authority.
8.8. Health Hazard Items.
8.8.1. Caution must be used when loading and ordering hazardous material. Hazardous items
are normally approved and ordered through the Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Pharmacy,
however the time to identify a potentially hazardous item is when the item record is initially
loaded. Two sources of information available to help accomplish this are Federal Standard 313,
Material Safety Data Sheets, Transportation Data, and Disposal Data for Hazardous Materials
Furnished to Government Activities and the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS).
8.8.1.1. Federal Standard 313 contains two tables that can be used as guides to identify
potentially hazardous items. Table I contains Federal Supply Classes (FSC) in which most items
are hazardous and require a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Table II contains additional
Federal Supply Groups (FSG) which contain a significant number of hazardous items.
8.8.1.2. The FLIS also identifies potentially hazardous items in the form of a Hazardous
Materiel Identification Code (HMIC). The HMIC is only a flag to advise users that an item may
be hazardous. It does not identify the nature or degree of the hazard. For an explanation of
HMICs (see Para 8.235).
8.8.2. Federal Standard 313 and HMICs listed in FLIS should only be used as a guide.
Definitive guidance on hazardous substances must be provided by the Base Environmental Flight
(BEF). All potentially hazardous items must be reviewed by the BEF to ensure correct issue
exception codes are loaded. For specific guidance on handling and ordering hazardous material,
contact the HAZMAT Pharmacy or a supply inspector.
8.9. Exception Codes.
8.9.1. ERRCD XBx or NFx Items. Note: The ERRCD, budget, and controlled item codes are
the selection criteria for items which may be located in the Base Service Store (BSS) and the
Individual Equipment Element (IEE). Local management will decide which items to manage in
the general outlet.
8.9.1.1. IEX code 3/K. For ERRCD XBx, or NF1 items that have budget code 9 and a
controlled item code U, M, J, or * (asterisk), use IEX 3 or K. Issue exception code 3 or K
applies to items that are stored in the Base Service Store.
8.9.1.2. IEX code 6/E. For ERRCD XBx, or NF1 items that have budget code 9 and a
controlled item code U, V, J, or * (asterisk), use IEX 6 or E. Issue exception code 6 or E applies
to items that are stored in Individual Equipment.
8.9.2. Retail Outlet Items. Retail outlet will annotate reject 295 for items meeting Base Service
Store (BSS) restrictions with 3/K or 6/E. This code must be entered in the FIL input if so
annotated.
1002                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.9.3. Requisition Exception Code 2. Requisition exception code 2 will not be stored on the
item record unless the first two positions of the routing identifier code are JB.
8.10. Acquisition Advice Code AFMC TRAP Activity.
8.10.1. Indicates how (as distinguished from where) and under what restrictions an item will be
acquired. The AAC will reflect applications of three basic methods: (1) by requisition; (2) by
fabrication or assembly; (3) or by local purchase. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for a list of
codes.
8.10.2. AAC Assignment. Only SNUD processing (Document Identifier Code BMx, BVE,
BV4) will assign acquisition advice codes.
8.10.3. Requisition Restrictions. Knowing how an acquisition advice code works will help
prevent requisitioning delays. Certain codes indicate the item cannot be requisitioned. If the
code is ignored, the base will experience a requisition delay. To prevent such a delay, see AFH
23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for how and under what restrictions an item will be acquired. For example,
if an item appears in the D043 or FEDLOG with an AAC of M, then tell the requester that the
requested item is coded for restricted requisitioning. This code directs that the item requested
cannot be requisitioned unless the activity is authorized to perform major overhaul functions.
8.11. Equipment Management Codes (EMC).
8.11.1. Definition. Equipment management codes (EMC), which are distributed in the SNUD,
identify what equipment a base must account for and what kind of reporting (if any) the
equipment requires. Although the EMC appears on the item record in the last position of the
ERRCD, it is not part of any ERRCD, unit cost, or source of supply. The following are the five
categories of EMC:

Table 8.1. EMC Codes.

EMC     Requirements
1       No in-use details required; no reporting.
2       Item coded EMC 1 in the cataloging systems for which
        MAJCOM has directed or approved the maintenance of
        EMC 2 will be assigned only at base level and will
        constitute an override of EMC 1; in-use details required, no
        reporting.
3       In-use details required; overlay/transaction reporting.
4       In-use details required; asset reporting.
5       In-use details required; serial number reporting.


8.11.2. Assigning EMC. Para 8.191 presents guidelines for assigning EMC.
8.11.3. Challenging SNUD Data. If required to do so, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity will challenge SNUD data using the 093 management notice provided by SCM-R
Equipment Activity or LRS EAE.
8.11.3.1. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will verify the indicative data, other
than EMC changes, and, if required, prepare an AF IMT 86, Request for Cataloging
Data/Action (see section 8T).
8.11.3.2. EMC assignment challenge. Any Air Force Equipment Management System
(AFEMS, C001) user can challenge the EMC assignment by inputting into the AFEMS (C001)
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1003

the EMC change request (IREC) online transaction. The AFEMS (C001) will send an e-mail
message to HQ AFMC through the initiator's parent Command Equipment Management Office
(CEMO) to review and validate an EMC challenge request. An additional e-mail notice will be
provided to the initiator and evaluator, advising them of the final disposition. AF IMT 86 will
not be used to challenge EMC codes. If notified by the initiator, AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity will load an asterisk (*) in the first position of the item record
nomenclature field (NF2/ND2 only). Indicative data will remain the same. When you receive
verification of the management data, process an indicative data change if required and notify
EAE. Note: If position 7 is not a 1 and position 52 is equal to S or U of the BVE/BV4, then
the asterisk (*) will be removed during SNUD processing.
8.12. Avoiding Reject Conditions.
8.12.1. Required Supporting Records. Before you load a FIL input, the following support
records and related input/data codes must be loaded. Without these records, the FIL input will
reject.
8.12.1.1. Routing identifier (RID) record. If the RID record is not loaded, contact the AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity for RID record load.
8.12.1.2. Exception phrase record (when input contains exception codes)
8.12.1.3. FSC and Materiel Management Code (MMAC) records
8.12.2. Required Data Formats. If essential data are blank or incorrectly loaded, a reject will
occur. Use the following information to load essential data correctly.
8.12.2.1. Stock number structure must conform to the formats shown in Definitions of Data
Elements for FIL Input (Para 8.189). The National Item Identification Number (NIIN) portion
of any stock number must NOT be loaded with a different FSC and/or MMAC.
8.12.2.2. ERRCD and budget code must be valid and compatible or reject 100 will occur. See
Chapter 7, reject 100 for further information.
8.12.2.3. Unit price must be numeric and greater than zero.
8.12.2.4. Unit of issue must be alpha.
8.12.2.5. System designator must be 01 or alpha/numeric.
8.12.2.5.1. If the system designator is alpha/numeric, the satellite organization record must be in
the SBSS database.
8.12.2.5.2. If the type stock number account code is K, the system designator must be 01 or A1-
A9.
8.13. Loading Records In Multiple System Designators.
8.13.1. The procedures outlined below explain how to ensure compatibility of data between
similar records in multiple systems. For example, like data may be in host, satellite, or forward
supply point (FSP) systems.
8.13.2. Satellite System Designator. Satellite item records may be loaded through the satellite
when the satellite system designator is used. The input is subject to edits and restrictions
common to all FIL inputs. If local procedures direct that Computer Support Base (CSB) LRS
Records Maintenance update the satellite Stock Number Directory, satellite Research will insert
CSB LRS Records Maintenance information into positions 179-181 of the FIL input.
8.13.3. Input Elements in SBSS Data Base. When the input item is in the SBSS database with a
different system designator, subject to the restrictions outlined in Sec. 8B internal records are
considered to be correct. Its indicative data (including unit of issue, price, routing identifier
code, budget code, ERRCD, shelf life, airlift investment code, Special Packaging Instructions
(SPI) data, and nomenclature) are duplicated on the input record. EXCEPTION: L and P
1004                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

serialized number item loads. The serial number in positions 6-11 and the stock record account
number in positions 12-15 are unique to each system designator. Item records for these items are
not loaded across system designators.
8.13.4. System Designator and NIIN. Internal programs will allow you to load only 01 and
satellite system designators. You cannot load a stock number NIIN portion in more than one
FSC/MMAC. You can load a stock number in multiple system designators only if the
FSC/MMAC are also equal.
8.13.5. ISG. If ISG grouping applies, it will be accomplished by a TRIC FIS ISG Load, Change
and Delete input. See section 8I for more information.
8.14. Program Control Assignments.
8.14.1. Assigned Zeros. Under program control, zeros will be assigned to the serviceable
balance field and the number of demands fields; zeros will also be assigned to the demand level,
and cumulative recurring demands.
8.14.2. Date of Last Transaction (DOLT) and Date of Last Inventory (DOLI). The current date
will be assigned to DOLT and DOLI fields.
8.14.3. Budget Code for General Support Division (GSD) of the SMAG Items. A budget code
is internally assigned for GSD items (see Para 8.189).
8.14.4. Codes for Type Stock Record Account Code P Items. Controlled item code U, RIC S9F
(for AVFUELS) or JBP (for ground fuels), ERRCD XB3, and type cargo code J are
automatically assigned to type stock record account code P items. Note: Fuels procedures are
no longer used, but logic has not been removed from SBSS. This Note applies to the entire
chapter and will not be repeated.
8.14.5. Miscellaneous Fields. Warehouse location, national motor freight classification code
(NMFCC), file status code, Date of First Demand (DOFD), bench stock indicator, freeze code,
and type cargo code will be assigned blanks. In addition, Date of Last Demand (DOLD), date of
last releveling, Order and Ship Time (O&ST), releveling indicator, and all unused fields are
assigned blanks.
8.15. Program Control Record Load or Creation.
8.15.1. Overflow Adjunct Item Records. If required, overflow adjunct item records (-9 in
positions 14-15 of an NSN) are normally loaded under program control. Item records with -9 in
positions 14 and 15 of the stock number are considered as overflow adjunct records only when
the first 11 positions are a valid NSN. These records will always have a unit of issue of MX,
which means one thousand times the basic unit of issue (see Para 8.189). The Excess, Issue,
Requisition, and Shipment Exception Codes (EEX, IEX, REX, and SEX) for these records will
be blanked under program control.
8.15.2. Fuels Management/Fuels Price Stabilization Record. When an item record is loaded for
bulk fuels, type stock record account code P, a fuels management and fuels price stabilization
record is established under program control.
8.15.3. Repair Cycle Records. Repair cycle records are automatically established for ERRCD
XD and XF, except adjunct (-9) item records. RPT is automatically stored in the reparable
destination/disposition code field. This causes excess items to be reported for disposition
instructions until a BDR, Reparable Item Movement Control image, is processed. See section
8U for more information.
8.16. Output Products.
8.16.1. Daily Document Register (D04) or Discoverer script replicating the D04. The Daily
Document Register may be used as follows: To check the accuracy of the input for records
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1005

maintenance programs that update internal records and create a transaction history. These
programs do not output a completed action notice. Thus, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity may use the Daily Document Register (D04), Part 2/Discoverer script to assist with
maintaining records. The letter Y in the first position of the document number identifies the
transactions you may check. Note: The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and
LRS are responsible for the accuracy of the D04 transactions they process.
8.16.2. Management Notices. Management notices are produced as explained in this chapter.
When you input data to correct a reject condition, you may code the input FIL to provide a load
notice to the unit having the suspended reject. Management notice F304 will be printed.
8.16.3. SNUD Add Images. SNUD add images are produced when the loading record qualifies
for the SNUD program and is not already loaded with another system designator. See section 8H
for complete information.
8.16.4. Exception Control Images (ECC). ECC images are also produced if requested by the
FIL input. (For more information, see Para 8.188)
8.17. Part Number Detail Record Load, Change, or Delete.
8.17.1. Conditions for Loading a Part Number Detail Record. To automate the part number to
stock number cross-reference file, a part number to stock number conversion record (part number
detail record--record code 222) must exist. This conversion record will change the part number
to a stock number under program control, thus eliminating external research action. You must
load a part number detail record under the following conditions:
8.17.1.1. A part number detail record has to be loaded when you load a part number item record
(FIL) so that Military Standard Requisitioning & Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) A0B
(Requisition MILSTRIP/Domestic)/A02 (Requisition MILSTRIP/Overseas requisitions are
created in lieu of A0E/A05 requisitions.
8.17.1.2. When you load a new item record for an NSN or P serialized numbered item that was
requested from a technical order by a part number as a recurring demand.
8.17.1.3. When you want to identify a specific user/end item application for a part number/stock
number that is not P serialized.
8.17.1.4. All other part number loads will be a AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or
LRS CC/AO or equivalent option.
8.17.1.5. A part number detail record has to be loaded when you load a part number item record
(FIL) in order that A0B/A02 requisitions are created in lieu of A0E/A05 requisitions. The
Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) and technical order data are used in creating these
type requisitions. If a part number record is not on file, the program cannot generate the correct
type requisitions due to lack of available data.
8.17.2. Results of Loading a Part Number Detail Record.
8.17.2.1. Item record matching. When a part number detail record is loaded, it will be matched
via ITM-PRT, which transmits the information to the affected item record in the SBSS database
based on the input system designator.
8.17.2.2. Multiple part number relationships. Multiple part number relationships to the same
stock number may be established.
8.17.2.3. Automatic updating. The stock number field of part number detail records will be
updated automatically by SNUD or as a result of local processing of a stock number change.
(See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 5 for additional information.)
8.18. Part Number Loading Data.
8.18.1. The data element requirements for detail record loads are as follows:
1006                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.18.2. Part Number. A part number is usually taken from a drawing, technical order, or
specification. However, any combination of 1 to 32 characters may be used, such as an item
description (for example, door-6FT8IN-x36IN-hollow core or paint-blue-lacquer-QT). Keep in
mind that a part number cannot be edited once its record has been loaded. The records for all
part numbers which equate to the same stock number will be loaded to the SBSS database(s) and
related to the applicable item record. Note: Two digit (numeric) part numbers 00-99 are
restricted to 'P' account NSNs issued at the automated service station only. See Para 8.199 for
assignment of a part number.
8.18.3. Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE). The manufacturer's identification code
will always be the required five-digit CAGE. These codes are defined in the Federal Cataloging
Handbook H4/H8, CAGE. When the CAGE cannot be determined, use ZZZZZ in the
appropriate positions.
8.18.4. User/End Item Application. In this 19-position field, enter a TO number, drawing
number, specification number, or any data that will help local management determine the use of
a basic item record. Note: If the CAGE is all numeric, the TO field cannot be blank.
8.18.5. Stock Number. The only restriction on this 15-position field is that the basic item record
must be loaded. Enter the technical manual number, figure and index. Program logic will
automatically relate the part number detail record to the affected item record, based on the input
stock number and system designator.
8.18.6. Input Flag. The input flag must be L.
8.18.7. System Designator. Part numbers are system designator unique and must be separately
loaded for each system designator requested.
8.18.8. Allowance Standards P Numbered Noncataloged Stock Numbers. Allowance managers
must provide item descriptions via CEMO to applicable bases for P numbered stock numbers
placed in allowance standards prior to assignment of NSNs. The occurrence of P numbered
stock numbers in allowance standards should be exceptional rather than regular practice and
should only occur during Support Equipment Transformation.
8.19. Part Number Change Process.
8.19.1. Part Number Change. To change a part number, enter the original part number in
positions 5-36, the stock number in positions 37-51, system designator in positions 71-72, the
CAGE (from the part number detail record that is being changed) in positions 73-77, and the
change-to part number in positions 78-109. The type input indicator must be P (see Para 8.190
for the format).
8.19.2. User or End Item Change. To change the user or end item application, do the following:
8.19.2.1. Enter the part number as it appears on the part number detail record in positions 5-36,
change-to user/end item application in positions 52-70, system designator in positions 71-72, and
the CAGE in positions 73-77.
8.19.2.2. To blank this field, enter an asterisk (*) in position 52. If the CAGE is all numeric, do
not blank the user/end item application field.
8.19.2.3. Use type input flag C.
8.19.3. CAGE Change. To change the CAGE, process a change input as follows:
8.19.3.1. Enter the part number as it appears on the part number detail record in positions 5-36,
system designator in positions 71-72, change-from CAGE in positions 73-77, and the change-to
CAGE in positions 78-82.
8.19.3.2. Use type input flag C.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        1007

8.19.4. Stock Number Field Change. The stock number field cannot be changed with a change
input. To change this field, process a delete input and then a new load input.
8.20. Part Number Delete Process.
8.20.1. Enter the part number in positions 5-36, stock number in positions 37-51, system
designator in positions 71-72, and CAGE in positions 73-77.
8.20.2. Use type input flag D.
8.21. Part Number Reject Conditions.
8.21.1. Avoiding Rejects. To avoid a reject notice, the input must meet the following
conditions:
8.21.1.1. The basic item record must be loaded.
8.21.1.2. The first position of the part number cannot be blank.
8.21.1.3. If the manufacturer's code is all numeric, the TO field cannot be blank.
8.21.1.4. The input stock number cannot be for an adjunct item record (-1, -2, or -9).
8.21.1.5. The fifth position of the input stock number cannot be L, W, or X.
8.22. Part Number Item Record Output Notices. No output notice is produced when the
input is processed through the Computer Operations/main system. Reject notices are produced
when applicable.

Section 8B--Research And Processing Actions Required To Assign Stock Numbers To
Noncataloged Items

8.23. Overview. Noncataloged items consist of part number items, non-NSN items, and NSL
items. This section describes the procedures Research must follow to assign a stock number to a
noncataloged item. Sec. 8B describes the purpose of the Standard Procurement System (SPS)
Listing and how Research can use this listing and other information to research a noncataloged
item. This section also includes the requirements for completing DD Form 1348-6, Non-NSN
requisition (manual) and actions for processing noncataloged transactions.
8.24. Verification of Source Document.
8.24.1. Verify that the source document (DD Form 1348-6, etc.) contains all necessary data
elements to complete the research action (that is, if a TO reference is given, the figure and index
must be included). If a TO reference gives a non-procurable source code, Maintenance must
provide AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply. (See TO 00-5-
1, Ch 5.) If a sole source or brand name is specified, the customer must provide a letter of
justification.
8.24.2. Insufficient Data. If the data are insufficient, return the document to the requester.
8.24.3. Sufficient Data. If there are sufficient data, proceed with specific research actions
outlined below for part number items, non-NSN items, and NSL items. Note: Identify hazardous
material according to directions in Para 8.196.
8.25. Research Actions for Part Number Item Requests.
8.25.1. To assign a stock number to a part number item, take the following actions:
8.25.2. Verifying Part Number Structure. Be sure the part number is structured as follows:
8.25.2.1. If the manufacturer's part number is ten digits or less, use the federal supply class, a P,
and the manufacturer's part number.
8.25.2.2. If the manufacturer's part number is greater than ten digits, use the FSC, a P, and a
base-assigned serial number, and the base Stock Record Account Number (SRAN).
1008                                        AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

8.25.2.3. If the structure is incorrect, correct it and then verify that the part number is not already
loaded with the correct structure.
8.25.2.4. If characters are obviously missing from the standard part number structure, return the
request to the customer for correction.
8.25.3. Validating or Assigning the CAGE. Use DLA's Business Identification Number Cross-
Reference System (BINCS): http://www.dlis.dla.mil/bincs/begin_search.aspx to validate or
assign the CAGE. If the request contains a TO reference, use the CAGE cited in the TO. If you
cannot identify a CAGE for a part number, include the TO, figure, and index number on the
request. This referenced information enables system equipment specialists to positively identify
the item requested. To assign a CAGE, use the following guidelines:
8.25.3.1. If the part number contains a military specification prefix, assign one of the following
CAGE:

Table 8.2. Prefix and CAGE.

Specification Prefix                             CAGE
MS (Military Standard)                           96906
NAS (National Aeronautical Standard)             88205
AN (Army-Navy Standard)                          88044
Other                                            81349
Note: CAGE 81349 is assigned only to items designed
to a military specification. Use this code only when
other codes listed above are not appropriate. DO NOT
apply this code to commercial items.


8.25.3.2. If an CAGE cannot be identified, assign local code ZZZZZ. Note: It is critical that
you identify the CAGE of the piece parts if possible; that is, do not automatically assign the
CAGE for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Piece parts and end items are rarely
made by the same manufacturer. The same is true for piece parts and the next higher assembly.
However, if you cannot identify the CAGE of the piece part, go to the next higher assembly.
8.25.4. Verifying Provisioning Source Code. If a source document cites a technical
order/technical publication, determine and verify the provisioning source code (PSC) and take
appropriate action (see Para 8.197).
8.25.5. Converting the Part Number to an NSN. Screen the part number and the CAGE against
the Fedlog/D043 in an effort to convert the part number to an NSN. If several NSN are listed for
a single part number and CAGE, use the FSC as a guide. Before you assign the NSN, check the
description of the requested item to be sure that the item you found is in fact the same as the one
requested.
8.25.6. Checking for Prior Load of Part Number. If the part number does not match an NSN in
the FEDLOG, screen the number against the non-NSN control file of DD forms 1348-6 to
determine if a part number record has previously been established. If so, verify that the item
record is still loaded and advise the initiator (Demand Processing, Receiving, etc.) to reinput.
8.25.7. Checking for Prior Conversion of Part Number. If you cannot find a part number record,
research Stock Number Directory postings, document/transaction registers, etc. to see if the part
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1009

number has been converted to an NC, ND, or NSN. If the part number has been converted, tell
the initiator that the correct stock number is loaded.
8.25.8. Loading Part Number Item Record. If, after thorough research, you cannot convert the
part number to a loaded stock number, complete DD Form 1348-6 (as instructed in section 8B
and Para 8.195). Load the part number item record as described in section 8A.
8.25.9. Loading 11N Series Technical Order. If an 11N series technical order is shown on DD
Form 1348-6, you will normally load the part number item record using type account code K. .
Note: Munitions procedures/logic are no longer used, but logic has not been removed from
SBSS. This Note applies to the entire chapter and will not be repeated.
8.25.9.1. Use B or E account codes, depending on the ERRCD, when any of the following
occurs:
8.25.9.1.1. A CP cancellation notice is provided to Customer Service.
8.25.9.1.2. The munitions accountable supply officer (MASO) certifies in writing that the source
of supply is local purchase or manufacture after giving verbal confirmation.
8.25.9.1.3. The applicable page of the TO is provided to confirm that the source of supply is
local purchase or manufacture.
8.25.9.2. Look for an NSN. Before you assign and load a part number item record for an 11N
series TO, look for an NSN by screening the part number request against the basic issue cross-
reference listed in the unclassified portion of the C1100-ML/IL-AF(CM) (Nuclear Ordinance).
Most of the reference/part numbers used in the 11N Series Technical Orders are not listed in the
Fedlog/D043.
8.25.9.3. Prepare an interrogation by CAGE/reference number (part number). When you load
the part number item record, prepare an interrogation.
8.25.10. Verifying AFMC RICs. If the part number has an AFMC RIC other than F(x)Z or
FPK, you must verify that it is correct. If the RIC on the item record load is correct, advise
Stock Control that requisitions for these items must contain a 2A advice code in order to bypass
DLATS edits.
8.25.11. Loading the Part Number Record. When your research reveals that an item record must
be loaded, load the part number record at that time. Also, if the part number requested matches
an NSN or part number currently in the database, you must load a part number record to link the
items.
8.26. Research Actions For National Stock Number (NSN) Requests.
8.26.1. To assign a stock number to a non-NSN (K, L NC, or ND stock numbers) request that
does not have part numbers, take the following actions:
8.26.2. Non-NSN Control File Screening. Check the request against the non-NSN control file.
8.26.3. Stock List Data Validating. Validate the stock list data by screening K, NC, and ND
items against such publications as technical orders, stock lists, the Master Equipment
Management Index (MEMI), etc.
8.26.4. DD Form 1348-6 Processing. If after thorough research, you cannot convert the non-
NSN to a stock number which is already loaded, follow instructions for DD Form 1348-6 (see
Para 8.195).
8.27. Research Actions For Non-stock Listed (NSL) Items.
8.27.1. If you identify an NSN for an item after thorough research, but the number does not
appear in the Fedlog/D043, take the following actions:
8.27.2. Seeing if the Number Has Been Replaced. Screen the NSN against the Fedlog/D043 to
determine if a valid stock listed number is contained in an ISG.
1010                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.27.3. Requisitioning Stock Numbered Items. Non-consumable items (other than ERRCD XB
or XF) will be requisitioned by part number to the Air Logistics Center (ALC) having
responsibility for the applicable -4 technical order or the end item. Requisition consumable
items that convert to an NSN, but do not have a DF entry in the C-ML-AF, directly to the source
of supply listed in the C-ML-AF when the following conditions apply:
8.27.3.1. The item is not a safety of flight item.
8.27.3.2. The reference/part number as listed in the MCRL-1 is item identifying (reference
number category code (RNCC) of 1, 2, or 3 or reference number variation code (RNVC) of 2) or;
8.27.3.3. The reference number from the illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) crosses in the
MCRL-1 to one and only one NSN.
8.27.3.4. Requisitioning by Part Number. If the NSN does not appear in the C-ML-AF, or if you
have any doubts about the safety of the item, then always requisition by part number. Be sure to
use the correct RID for the responsible AFMC item manager, as listed in the appropriate
Numerical Index and Requirement Tables (NI&RTs).
8.27.3.5. Submitting AF IMT 86. At this time, AF IMT 86 is not required. AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity will submit this form, when required, based on the response from
AFMC to the BDFA, SNUD Add transaction.
8.28. SPS Item Descriptions.
8.28.1. An item description is maintained in the SPS for each local purchase item ordered by
LRS/Materiel Management Activity for bases supported by a SPS. The descriptions are
maintained for the following time frames:
8.28.1.1. NSN and P-Numbered items: 24 months after the estimated delivery date (EDD) of
the last local purchase receipt.
8.28.1.2. L-Numbered items: 12 months after the EDD of the last local purchase receipt.
8.28.2. LRS/Materiel Management Activity loads the descriptions for local purchase items into
the SPS system when a new item is loaded into the supply system and sends a local purchase
requisition to the SPS. Since the description for these items are maintained in the SPS, the
LRS/Materiel Management Activity or equivalent has the option to use the SPS system to
maintain the non-NSN description file instead of the manual DD Form 1348-6 file required in
this section. When this option is used, LRS/Materiel Management Activity will use the
following guidelines:
8.28.2.1. LRS/Materiel Management Activity can use either the SPS terminal to inquiry the SPS
when an item description is needed or use a SPS Item Listing (when authorized by Base
Contracting). If a listing is used, it must be maintained current by obtaining a new listing on a
scheduled basis.
8.28.2.2. LRS/Materiel Management Activity will maintain a temporary DD Form 1348-6 file
for each item loaded into the SPS for 30 calendar days to ensure the description is retained
permanently in SPS. Conditions such as incomplete descriptions may result in the description
being deleted from the SPS. MAJCOMs may specify a different retention period for this
temporary file.
8.28.2.3. LRS/Materiel Management Activity must have an item description for all noncataloged
items which are active in the SBSS. If a description is deleted from the SPS, a DD Form 1348-6
must be prepared for the item, or the description must be loaded back into the SPS.
8.29. Researching Noncataloged Items.
8.29.1. Noncataloged items include part numbers, non-NSN items, NSL items, etc.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1011

8.29.2. Required Research for NSN Assignment. Research personnel must thoroughly research
stock lists, cross-reference lists, available technical publications (TO, IPB, drawings, etc.),
available SPS listings, and the non-NSN control file in an effort to relate the requested item to an
assigned NSN or to a non-NSN item record which is already loaded.
8.29.3. Processing the Request Document with the Proper NSN. If you find an NSN for the item
as a result of research, add the stock number to the request document, prepare the source
document for item record load, and return the request document to the initiator (Customer
Service, Receiving, etc.) with an attached notification of the load.
8.29.3.1. If an 11N series technical order appears on the DD Form 1348-6, then you will usually
not load the stock number in the supply account. EXCEPTIONS: If ANY of the following
occurs, then load the stock number in the B or E accounts, depending on the ERRCD:
8.29.3.1.1. Demand Processing receives a CP cancellation notice.
8.29.3.1.2. The MASO certifies in writing that the source of supply is local purchase or
manufacture when verbal confirmation is received.
8.29.3.1.3. The applicable page of the TO is provided to confirm that the source of supply is
local purchase or manufacture.
8.29.4. Researching Sole Source or Brand Name Requirements. In addition to the research
outlined in this section, check sole source or brand name requests against commercial catalogs
and GSA federal supply schedules.
8.30. Indicative Data For Noncataloged Items.
8.30.1. If Research cannot find a valid stock number through research actions outlined in this
section, and if the item has not previously been given a locally assigned number, follow these
instructions for determining the entries on DD Form 1348-6.
8.30.2. Stock Number. Para 8.189 contains the structures of stock numbers used within the
SBSS. Following are specific instructions for assigning stock numbers to noncataloged items at
the base level.
8.30.2.1. Determine the FSC (the first four positions of all stock numbers) based on the item
description and nomenclature as given in the H-2 series of publications. Note: If an L or P
number is to be assigned, and the item is a brand name or genuine replacement part, assign the
stock class of the next higher assembly or end item rather than using the description and
nomenclature to determine the stock class.
8.30.2.2. Follow these instructions for items with part/reference numbers:
8.30.2.2.1. Load all items with a CAGE and part number, manufacturer's item identification
number, or reference number using the applicable FSC and a P in the fifth position.
Assign/verify the CAGE by using DoD cataloging handbooks H4/H8. Automated systems such
as FEDLOG and the Master Item Identification Data Base System (D043A), that contain
equivalent or more up to date cataloging information, for any element of catalog management
data, may be used in lieu of, or in addition to, the DoD cataloging handbooks, where these
systems are available. Part number/reference number/item identification structure must follow
the Federal Cataloging System Standards.
8.30.2.2.2. If the part/reference number is ten positions or less and does not duplicate an existing
part numbered item, enter the part or reference number immediately following the FSC and the
P. Note: Enter CAGE or ZZZZZ.
8.30.2.2.3. If the part/reference number exceeds ten positions or duplicates an existing part or
reference number, use a P serialized number. The P serialized number will be made up as
follows: The FSC, a P in the fifth position, the next unused serial number from the serial number
1012                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

ledger, and the base stock record account number in positions 12 through 15. P serialized
numbers are assigned from a serial number ledger that is maintained by each stock record
account.
8.30.2.3. Follow these instructions for items with no part/reference numbers:
8.30.2.3.1. Assign an L number. Make up the L serialized number as follows: the FSC, an L in
the fifth position, the next unused serial number from the serial number ledger, and the base
stock record account number in positions 12 through 15. Assign a P serialized number for
locally procured Equipment Authorized In-Use details (EAID) when the part/reference numbers
are not known. Exceptions are typewriters, portable buildings, and locally manufactured
equipment. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5D, Equipment Management. L serialized numbers are
assigned from a serial number ledger that is maintained for the stock record account code for the
system designator of the item record being loaded.
8.30.2.3.2. Change the L number to a P number if a part or reference number is later assigned to
the item.
8.30.2.4. Process a stock number change using TRIC FIC, Item Record Indicative Data Change,
when an NSN or service assigned control number (NC, ND, or K) is assigned to a base
noncataloged item. Note: Some stock number changes occur under program control based upon
receipt of status.
8.30.3. Assign the routing identifier code (RIC) to a noncataloged item . When an item must be
requisitioned from an ICP and cannot be related to an NSN, the requisition, whenever possible,
should be submitted under document identifier code "A02"/"A0B," using the manufacturer's
five-digit index code (FSCM) and ten (or less) digit part number. If the part cannot be related to
a manufacturer's index code or the part number exceeds ten digits, part numbered requisitions
should be on an "A0E"/"A05" document . All personnel who assign RICs for these items must
become familiar with this process. In determining RICs for noncataloged items, Customer
Service personnel will follow the sequence given in these paragraphs:
8.30.3.1. See if the noncataloged item is listed in a weapon or systems technical order, technical
manual, or system managers (SM) catalog or parts list that is either source coded for central
procurement, or is not source coded. If it is, assign the AF (FxZ) or (FPD) RIC of the technical
order or system manager ALC. Also, see that the RIC is consistent with the technical order PSC
(as outlined in Para 8.197). For example, if TO PSC is M, the appropriate local manufacturer's
RIC must be assigned to this request. Also, enter the TO reference in the user/end item
application. Assign RIC FPK to noncataloged items listed in an 11-N series technical order.
8.30.3.2. Assign an Air Force (FxZ) or (FPD) RIC if the noncataloged item is not in TO, and the
item is a repair part that can be related to an end item or next higher assembly managed by an
AFMC ALC. Note: To determine if the end item is managed by AFMC, find the RIC for the
next higher assembly with an NSN.
8.30.3.3. Assign RIC code JBB (local procurement) or the appropriate local manufacturer's RIC
if noncataloged items cannot be related to the above categories of AF managed items. Process
requisitions for local purchase items according to the policy AFI 23-101, Sec. 3C, Local
Purchase & Retail Sales.
8.30.3.3.1. If local procurement or local manufacture is not possible, assign REX code 2 to the
item record. This will cause requisitioning from the centralized FSC IM (AFMC/DLA/GSA)
using advice code 2A.
8.30.3.3.2. If items are authorized for procurement through a contract parts store (COPARS),
obtain them from that source.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1013

8.30.3.3.3. For commercial administrative vehicles, commercial construction equipment and
materiel handling equipment, Demand Processing may load the REX (9, W, or X) at the time of
the FIL action. This may be done at the option of the overseas MAJCOM and ONLY if the item
is not available locally.
8.30.3.4. Assign the RIC of the service or agency that applies if items can be related to an end
item or assembly managed by another service or agency. Requisition from that activity using
MILSTRIP procedures.
8.30.3.5. Overseas activities must adhere to balance of payments (gold flow) restrictions, etc. in
addition to following the above procedures.
8.30.3.6. RICs may be changed by the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity after
receiving MILSTRIP status from the DLATS or from the originally assigned source of supply.
One of the more common changes is to local purchase when the original requisition does not
contain advice code 2A. Other RIC changes result when you receive a reply to an AF IMT 86,
the FSC changes, or the item is cataloged.
8.30.4. Nomenclature. Use the following guidelines for assigning nomenclature to a
noncataloged item.
8.30.4.1. If an AF RIC is assigned and the fifth position of the stock number is P, but it is not a
local serialized stock number, enter the nomenclature (32 positions) in this field. The program
does not edit for T/O in the nomenclature field. However, the T/O number is used in part
number record and should be entered in the user/end item field (positions 160-178 of the FIL
format or positions 52-70 of the 1AA format).
8.30.4.2. If a local serialized stock number is assigned, a part number detail must be loaded.
Note: Remember that the first position of the nomenclature CANNOT be blank.
8.30.4.3. Enter a numeric, alpha, alpha/numeric combination, or ZZZZZ CAGE for all part
number records. Take this code from the applicable TO.
8.30.4.4. When you cannot locate an CAGE using the BINCS
http://www.dlis.dla.mil/bincs/begin_search.asp assign ZZZZZ to all routing identifier codes. An
error in assignment of ZZZZZ results in an AOE/AO5 document identifier code on output
requisitions, which prohibits use of Automated Data Reports Submission System (ADRSS) for
transmission.
8.30.5. ERRCD. For noncataloged items, assign the ERRCD according AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch
2, and the procedures outlined in Para 8.192. The ERRCD must also be consistent with the TO
provisioning source code (PSC) (as outlined in Para 8.197). For example, if the PSC is M1,
normally you would assign XD(x) or ND3.
8.30.6. Budget Code. Budget codes assigned to noncataloged items must be compatible with the
RIC and the ERRCD. See Ch 7, reject 100 for compatibility edits. The budget code/RIC
combination determines the requisition fund codes (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2).
8.30.7. Unit of Issue/Unit Price. Determine the unit of issue and the unit price by comparing the
request against similar items already loaded into the account or listed in the C-ML-AF.
8.30.8. Controlled Item Code (CIC). The CIC assigned to a noncataloged item must be
compatible with the controlled item codes (outlined in DoD 4100.39-M, Federal Logistics
Information System (FLIS) Procedures Manual and Para 8.231).
EXAMPLES: If the noncataloged item is photographic equipment and supplies, assign CIC X if
additional controls are warranted (see Para 8.231). If the item is a hand tool and/or shop
equipment, assign code M unless the item has a unit cost of less than $10.
1014                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

8.30.9. Precious Metal Indicator Codes (PMIC). If the requested item contains precious metals,
load a PMIC as explained in Para 8.188. If you do not know if the requested item contains
precious metals, check the FSG against the groups listed in Para 8.192. If the groups match,
contact the requester to determine if the requested asset contains precious metals. If the
requested item contains precious metals, load a PMIC as explained in Para 8.188.
8.30.10. Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE). If the requested asset is for one of the
FSGs listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, an ADPE identification code must be loaded as
outlined in Para 8.234.
8.31. Preparing DD Form 1348-6.
8.31.1. Items Included. Prepare DD Form 1348-6 for all locally assigned (serialized L and P)
items; NC, ND, and command assigned stock numbers; non-serialized part number items (P in
the fifth position); and any NSN not listed in AF, DoD, or GSA stocklists. There are five
exceptions:
8.31.1.1. MAJCOMs may specify that DD Forms 1348-6 are not required for part number items
requisitioned using AO2/AOB procedures.
8.31.1.2. MAJCOMs may specify that DD Forms 1348-6 are not required for DLA Land And
Maritime managed commercial auto parts (Project JZO/ REX code 9).
8.31.1.3. MAJCOMs may specify that DD Forms 1348-6 are not required for NC/ND numbers.
8.31.1.3. (AMC) DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document is not
required for NC and ND stock numbers.
8.31.1.4. At the option of the LRS CC/AO or equivalent, DD Form 1348-1A may be used
instead of DD Form 1348-6 for AFMC-managed items only. 8.31.1.5. At the option of the LRS
CC/AO or equivalent, an automated research inquiry may be filed in place of a DD Form 1348-6.
This option is only authorized for those supply accounts that have an automated research
capability and provided the automated inquiry contains sufficient information to adequately
identify the requested item.
8.31.1.4. (AMC) DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document will be
used for Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)-managed items.
8.31.2. Instructions for Completing DD Form 1348-6. Complete the form (as outlined in Para
8.195). Responsibilities for completing entries, routing the form, and distributing it are explained
in the following paragraphs.
8.31.2.1. Requests submitted by voice communication and which do not furnish an NSN must
be routed through Customer Service for identification.
8.31.2.1.1. If sufficient technical publications are available for positive identification, Customer
Service will initiate the DD Form 1348-6 when an NSN cannot be identified.
8.31.2.1.2. If technical data are not available, or the item is difficult to describe, ask the
customer to furnish a photograph or drawing of the item. If identification cannot be made, the
customer must furnish the data for initiation of DD Form 1348-6.
8.31.2.1.2.1. (Added-AMC) For Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) requests,
load generic description with statement: “Demand requires DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line
Item Requisition System Document with unique frequencies and other options,” in the Standard
Procurement System (SPS) once the demand shows up on the Demand Awaiting Description list.
Research will send a copy of DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System
Document citing complete description, unique frequencies and options, to the base operational
contracting division. If DD Form 1348-6, DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document is
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1015

not available, request one from the customer. For non EAID items, load the complete description
in SPS after loading the item record.
8.31.2.2. Routine requests for non-NSN items must be forwarded in the same manner as
required for cataloged items. However, the customer must include four copies of a DD Form
1348-6, completed as much as possible.
8.31.3. Actions for Items Source Coded Local Purchase. Research will prepare one copy of DD
Form 1348-6 on all stock listed items source coded local purchase.
8.31.3.1. Prepare this copy when any of the following occurs:
8.31.3.1.1. You process an FIL.
8.31.3.1.2. FIC processing changes the source to local purchase.
8.31.3.1.3. A customer generates a request.
8.31.3.1.4. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity representative in Base Contracting notifies
you.
8.31.3.2. Hold this form until a requisition is created. The complete catalog description must be
furnished by the customer. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 3B, Local Purchase and Retail Sales
8.31.4. Document Flow. See Document Flow for DD Form 1348-6 on Non-NSN Items (Para
8.194).
8.32. Non-NSN Control.
8.32.1. Control and Reference File. The DD Form 1348-6 serves as a control and reference file
for establishing records to support noncataloged requirements. Complete the form and maintain
files for every L, P, NC, and ND item established within the account, except items referenced in
above.
8.32.2. Master File. Maintain a master file within Customer Service that contains at least one
copy of the DD Form 1348-6 processed according to this paragraph. Normally, this file consists
of a hard copy of the DD Form 1348-6. However, the file may be automated and maintained on
a microcomputer at the option of the LRS CC/AO. When this option is used, local procedures
will be developed as a supplement. Local procedures must ensure that the basic guidelines and
intent for maintaining the master file are met. Bases which are supported by a SPS do not have
to retain descriptions (DD Form 1348-6) on local purchase items if the procedures in this section
are used. Autonomous satellite accounts with research capability will maintain their own master
files.
8.32.2.1. File part numbered items (P in fifth position) in part number sequence without regard
to FSC. You may file P serialized numbers using one of the following options:
8.32.2.1.1. File one copy in part number sequence. (If you choose this option, you must enter
part number and CAGE on non-NSN serialized control number ledger.)
8.32.2.1.2. File two copies, one in P serialized sequence, the other in part number sequence as a
cross-reference. (If you choose this option, you do NOT have to enter part number and CAGE
on the non-NSN serialized control number ledger.)
8.32.2.2. File all other part numbered items in stock number sequence (the same sequence as the
Stock Number Directory). Note: The major command may choose to deviate from the usual
filing sequence. Local or command option may establish cross-reference records for use in
preparing non-NSN listing in various sequences; for example, part number to NC/ND number,
etc.
8.32.3. Screening New Requests Against Master File. Screen new requests for non-NSN items
against the master file before further processing. This will prevent the assignment of new serial
numbers to identical items already established in the account.
1016                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.32.4. The Non-NSN Control Ledger. Use this ledger to assign six-digit serial numbers to L
and P type stock numbers. The ledger is in serial number sequence and includes the following
minimum data for each entry:
8.32.4.1. Serial number and assigned FSC.
8.32.4.2. Part number (for P serialized numbers).
8.32.4.3. CAGE (for P serialized numbers).
8.32.4.4. AF IMT 86 control number (if required for local management).
8.32.4.5. Date of deletion (only required if base is reusing the serial number before reaching the
maximum 999999).
8.32.5. L and P Serial Number Maintenance and Assignment. Each LRS/Materiel Management
Activity Customer Service function is responsible for the assignment and maintenance of a serial
number control ledger for the stock record account code for the system designator of the item
record being loaded.
8.32.6. Entering Date of Deletion. If your base is planning to reuse the serial numbers before
reaching the maximum number of 999999, enter the date of deletion in the ledger. Use the Daily
Document Register (D04) for this purpose.
8.32.7. Added or Deleted Major Components on a Bench/Mockup Set. When you receive
notification that major components have been added or deleted on a bench/mockup set, modify
the DD Form 1348-6 to show this change. Also, adjust the price on the appropriate L numbered
item record.
8.32.8. Removal of DD Form 1348-6. Remove the DD Form 1348-6 maintained when the Daily
Document Register indicates an L or P type stock number has been deleted.
8.32.9. Quarterly, LRS/Materiel Management Activity will screen part/reference numbers in the
SBSS for conversion to valid NSNs in the Air Force Catalog (D043).
8.32.9.1. Bases may build a 1SQ Image File which creates interrogation images that are
transmitted to D046 for inquiring D043 catalog data. The Query Language Processor (QLP)
routine in Para 8.200 is used to build the file of 1SQ images, the images process through pseudo
to create BVUC25 interrogations. These interrogations are automatically sent to AFMC by the
Supply Interface System (SIFS).
8.32.9.2. The procedures above apply only to part numbers with valid CAGE loaded. Part
numbers loaded with ZZZZZ in the CAGE field cannot be interrogated through the Base
Account Screening Exercise System (D046 Interrogations). The program will automatically put
a Y in position 76 of the BVUC25 interrogation. This will prevent BVRC (no stock number
match) responses from AFMC.
8.33. Inspection Processing.
8.33.1. Non-NSN. When Research does not maintain a central file of non-NSN items,
Inspection must establish and maintain a reference file to supplement the published stocklist.
Inspection will use this file to confirm item identification of non-NSN materiel and maintain it in
assigned L or P stock number sequence. Inspection will process stock number changes and unit
of issue changes affecting non-NSN items against this file to ensure its effectiveness. It may also
purge inactive forms from this file. Inspection must make arrangements with Customer Service
to obtain copies of the applicable document registers.
8.33.2. Control of Noncataloged Items.
8.33.2.1. Central File for DD Form 1348-6. When Inspection is located close to Demand
Processing, and when congestion, access, or related factors would not hinder the efficiency of
either section, a central file of DD Forms 1348-6 may be established for their joint use.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1017

Alternatives. If the MAJCOM/A4 has not directed otherwise, a central file of DD Forms 1348-
6/AF Form 1220, Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual-long form) will be
maintained within Demand Processing. When a central file is not maintained, one of the
following options may be used:
8.33.2.2. Option One. Demand Processing may furnish the supply Inspectors a copy of all DD
Forms 1348-6 for L and P numbers, NC and ND numbers, and those NSN not appearing in AF,
DLA, or GSA catalogs.
8.33.2.3. Option Two. Demand Processing may furnish Inspection a copy of DD Form 1348-6
for items with a source of supply other than local. Demand Processing identifies local purchase
items using parts I, II, and III of the CIAPS Item Listing. Materiel Management Flight will ask
Base Contracting to provide a copy of this listing to Inspection on a monthly basis.
8.33.2.4. Choosing the Filing System. Inspection should choose the most efficient method of
filing DD Forms 1348-6. Factors to be considered are the ease of identifying and accepting
items and the effect of the physical installation at any given base.
8.33.2.5. Bases Not Operating Under CIAPS. Those bases not operating under the SPS must
use option 1.
8.34. Maintenance of Air Force Technical Orders. Air Force Technical Orders will be
ordered, maintained, and disposed of in accordance with the procedures contained in TOs 00-5-1,
00-5-2, and 00-5-15.
8.35. Technical Order Reconciliation.
8.35.1. Reconciliation between Maintenance Organizations and the LRS/Materiel Management
Activity. At the option of the LRSCC/AO or equivalent, a reconciliation between maintenance
organizations and LGLOS, Customer Service, may be performed yearly. When this option is
used, a consolidated listing of all technical orders maintained by Customer Service must be
produced. A copy of the consolidated listing will then be forwarded to all support organizations.
8.35.2. Production of Reconciliation Listing. The Reconciliation Listing may be produced in
any of the following ways:
8.35.2.1. A computer generated list.
8.35.2.2. Prepare inputs and list them using program NGV003 Supply User Report Generator
(SURGE).
8.35.2.3. Reproduce copies of the Code Selected Reconciliation List (CSRL). This list will be
automatically furnished by the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALCAFMC AIR
LOGISTICS COMPLEXES) if the LRS CC/AO or equivalent has a technical order account
established with OC-ALC AFMC AIR LOGISTICS COMPLEXES. To obtain an out of cycle
CSRL, submit a written request to OC-ALC/MMDUB, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma 73145. This
written request must cite the TO distribution code (TODC) number used to requisition technical
orders. Justify the request for an out of cycle CSRL by stating the following:
A COPY OF THE CSRL IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM AN OUT OF CYCLE
RECONCILIATION BETWEEN BASE SUPPLY AND SUPPORTED MAINTENANCE
ACTIVITIES ON THIS BASE. THE RECONCILIATION WILL ALLOW US TO DELETE
UNNECESSARY TECHNICAL ORDERS AND REQUEST TECHNICAL ORDERS
REQUIRED BUT NOT ON FILE.
8.35.3. Annotation of Reconciliation Listing. Each maintenance organization will annotate the
individual entries on the listing with one of three designations--NOT REQUIRED, REQUIRED,
or ADD. When this procedure is completed, each maintenance organization will return the
1018                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

listing to Customer Service. Each listing returned by an organization will be filed until the next
listing is annotated and returned by the organization to Customer Service.

Section 8C--Records Maintenance General Procedures

8.36. Overview. This section describes general procedures to update and maintain the internal
records of the SBSS. It explains how to prepare new data for old item records, handle file
maintenance programs, make mass changes to internal records, process reject notices, maintain
suspense files, and use the work listings produced by the computer and the SNUD.
8.37. General Data Processing To Update Internal Records.
8.37.1. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity routinely receives written
communications, such as documents, listings, notices, letters, or memos that contain information
for updating the records for supply items. Following is the basic procedure for processing these
products.
8.37.2. Determining Processing Priority. Generally, you should handle rejected inputs and
requisition status notices immediately. If you receive a status change on a requisition status
notice that will change the indicative data in the computer, then update the item record
immediately. Annotate the correction on the face of the DD Form 1348-1A and send it to Stock
Control for further processing.
8.37.3. Verifying Input. Before processing any additions, deletions, or changes to an internal
record, check the appropriate work listing to be sure the input is valid and required.
8.37.4. Processing Input. Use one of the following ways to process the input:
8.37.4.1. Use source documents and then place the documents in a suspense file.
8.37.4.2. Use a SURGE program, if you must change any of the indicative data on a large
number of records (for example, if you must add/delete/change system designators, application
codes, RIC, etc.). The SURGE program will produce the required change input.
8.37.5. Verifying the Processing. After the new data have been entered, you must verify that it
has been accurately processed and then purge the suspense file.
8.38. File Maintenance Programs.
8.38.1. File maintenance programs update indicative data on computer records. Following are
instructions for handling specific kinds of maintenance programs.
8.38.2. Programs without Completed Action Notices. File maintenance programs that update
internal records and create a transaction history do not output a completed action notice. With
these programs, you must use the Daily Document Register (D04)/Discoverer script to check the
accuracy of the input and to purge the suspense file. If you find an error, prepare the correct
input, suspend it, and process it. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or LRS can
update internal records and verify actions on the D04/Discoverer script.
8.38.3. Programs with Completed Action Notices. File maintenance programs that update
internal records and do not create a transaction history will output a completed action notice.
Use this notice to check the accuracy of the input and to purge the suspense file. Destroy the
completed action notice after you have verified input processing.
8.38.4. Programs that Create New Item Records from Status Input. If an item must be
substituted for the one originally requisitioned, then AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity/Materiel Management Activity personnel will process a status input with a stock
number different from the one requisitioned. As a result, internal programs may create a new
item record if one is required. (See Sec. 8D for stock number changes.) The programs will load
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1019

the indicative data of the requisitioned stock number, update internal records, and automatically
relate items in an ISG if necessary. (See section 8I for ISG.) The programs will not create a
transaction history, but will output a notice.
8.39. Reject Control.
8.39.1. Reject Number Assignment. If a program finds an error in input data or in an internal
record, it does not update the internal records. Instead, the program assigns a reject number and
prints a reject notice at the input function or Computer Operation.
8.39.2. Suspended Rejects. Some rejects are suspended and are printed in the Cumulative
Reject Processor (D818), a management tool for controlling rejected input data. Supervisory
personnel must screen this listing daily to be sure that all rejected input data are being corrected
for reinput. Copies of all reject notices that are still being processed are contained in the reject
suspense file. Personnel may use ES-S to extract and correct rejects.
8.40. Stock Number Catalog Data.
8.40.1. Stock number catalog data distributed through SNUD originate from the AF cataloging
suite of systems. The D043 System, Master Item Identification Control System (MIICS), is the
Air Force’s primary repository for cataloging and standardization data. This system contains
logistics records for about 2.6 million AF-used items. The data is provided to the D071 System,
Stock Number User Directory (SNUD), which distributes it to recorded users of the stock
number. HQ AFMC has responsibility for catalog systems. Procedures for stock number catalog
data changes are contained in section 8H of this chapter.
8.40.2. The stock number catalog data originating from the AFMC catalog suite of systems is
the authoritative data used by the AF. In addition to the data being transmitted to the SBSS, data
can also be viewed in a near real-time fashion by querying the D043A system. Also, the data can
be viewed using the FEDLOG CD-ROM diskettes. The FEDLOG diskettes are not real-time,
whereas a D043A query provides the most current data available to the retail user.
8.40.3. The stock number catalog data, in addition to being pushed by the SNUD system,
can also be interrogated by the SBSS. In this case, the catalog data is distributed from the
catalog suite of systems via the D046 system, Base Account Screening Exercise System
Interrogations, instead of the SNUD system.
8.41. Work Listings and Maintenance.
8.41.1. Purpose. Work listings present lists of specific data contained on internal records. Ch 5
- 6 explain how often and in what form the listings are produced.
8.41.2. Use. Always check work listings before processing additions, deletions, or changes to
be sure that the input is valid and required.
8.41.3. Maintenance of Work Listings. LRS/materiel management activity and AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity will maintain the work listings. Following is a brief description of
the work listings used in Records Maintenance, along with instructions for managing them.
Note: Locally developed listings/scripts may be used to enhance processes. Annotating changes
on listings is no longer required.
8.41.3.1. The Stock Number Directory (M14/NGV814) lists item records within type stock
record account code. Records appear in order according to their stock numbers and system
designators. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and LRS are responsible for the
accuracy of the transactions they process. Note: The M14 does not need to be retained.
8.41.3.2. The Daily Document Register (D04/NGV804) is produced daily for file maintenance.
If a cross-reference work file is maintained, you may file the Daily Document Register
(D04/NGV804) as follows:          Note: The D04 does not have to be maintained.
1020                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.41.3.2.1. Option 1. File the register in date sequence in a separate binder and maintain it until
the new Stock Number Directory is prepared. If you use this option, be sure to cross-reference
each book carefully to tell personnel that the Daily Document Register is filed separately. You
can use labels on the outside of the binder or annotated sheets inside the directory binder.
8.41.3.2.2. Option 2. File the register in date sequence in the same binder with the Stock
Number Directory (M14/NGV814) and maintain it until the new Stock Number Directory is
prepared.
8.41.3.2.3. Option 3. Maintain copies using the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
web page or file using microcomputer. Note: The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity and LRS are responsible for the accuracy of the D04 transactions they process.
8.41.3.3. Exception Phrase Listing (R03/NGV870) lists exception phrases, by type phrase, in
exception code sequence. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity manages all
exception phrase records, accomplishes a semiannual review and maintains and updated a
current copy of the R03. LRS will accomplish a semiannual review of manage all base-level
assigned exception codes and override records and process inputs to load, change and delete
locally assigned codes as required. Note: LRS will coordinate with AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity for all phrase record updates. After phrase validation is complete, AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will forward a new R03 to the ECC database manager
with the following information and request a mass update of the ECC Exception Phrase Records
(as required). SRAN, exception type code, type code and exception phrase, etc.
8.41.3.4. The Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) Listing (R02/NGV866) lists stock
numbers within ISG in ISG (interchangeable and substitute) number sequence. A separate listing
is also prepared in stock number sequence. This listing contains a cross reference to the ISG
number for each stock number listed.
8.41.3.4. (AMC) To update the Interchangeable and Substitute Group (ISG) listing, use program
NGV404, AFMC D043B ISG Update, is an option to produce a supplementary listing of all
changes occurring after the R02 listing has been prepared. If you select this option, you will need
to manually update the ISG data for this option should provide the necessary cross-references
between stock number and ISG number.
8.41.3.5. Organization Effectiveness Report (M24/NGV863) lists each organization cost center
record, in sequence, by organization code. The LRS is responsible for maintaining the M24 and
ensuring accuracy of the data in the M24.
8.41.3.6. Repair Cycle Data Listing (Q04/NGV819) lists repair cycle records with data greater
than zero (reparable generation, net repair cycle days, Awaiting Parts (AWP), Not Reparable
This Station (NRTS)/condemn, and turn-ins) in system designator/stock number sequence. This
edit does not pertain to the indicative data list. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity and LRS are jointly responsible for maintaining the Q04 and responsible for maintain
the accuracy of the repair cycle records.
8.41.3.6.1. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will load, change, and delete
reparable destinations and disposition codes on repair cycle records. Advise applicable AFMC
materiel managers when the Reparable Item Movement Control System (RIMCS) reflects the
same ship to data reflected on the supply discrepancy report (SDR). Initiate RIMCS reports
BDR and BV8 to correct SBSS records when RIMCS reflects different data.
8.41.3.6.2. LRS will obtain, prepare and process the load, change, and delete data to maintain
designated base repair activities.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1021

8.41.3.7. Routing Identifier Record Listing (Q05/NGV871) lists routing identifier records in
routing identifier code sequence. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will
maintain a current copy of the Q05 to be used for RID updates.
8.42. Unit Price Verification.
8.42.1. Format for Unit Price. The item record price is ten positions long. Eight of the positions
are dollar positions, and two are cents, except for items with type stock record account P. For
type stock record account P items, the unit price is reflected in three-position dollars, two-
position cents, and three-position mills. For items with a unit price of 99 million dollars or more,
load the price with all nines as the item record unit price.
8.42.2. Verification of Estimated Prices. Research will check the estimated prices customers list
in block 7 of DD Form 1348-6 to see that they are realistic compared to similar items already
loaded in the stock record account or listed in the Management List (ML)

Section 8D-- Item Record Indicative Data Change

8.43. Overview.
8.43.1. Section Summary. This section describes the use of the FIC input to change indicative
data on the item record.
8.43.2. Purpose of the FIC Input. Personnel use the FIC input to change the following indicative
data on the item record: 1) stock numbers, 2) routing identifier codes, 3) budget codes, 4)
ERRCD, and 5) equipment management codes (EMC). Note: In the changing or merging of
stock numbers, the same FIC input cannot be used to change the routing identifier code, the
budget code, or the ERRCD.
8.43.3. Simultaneous Change of Codes. Personnel entering new stock numbers may
simultaneously change the routing identifier code, the budget code, and the ERRCD. Doing so,
however, changes all item records for that stock number, regardless of the system designator.
(See Para 8.204 for the required compatibility of changes to routing identifier codes, budget
codes, or ERRCDs.)
8.44. Changing Stock Numbers.
8.44.1. Reasons for Changing Stock Numbers. Stock number changes normally are made 1) by
an AF IMT 86 (see section 8T for formats), 2) as a result of changes in the stock list, or 3) as
corrections to erroneous file maintenance data on original FIL inputs (as indicated by reason why
code P on the input). The stock list publications provide the current indicative data as registered
at AFMC.
8.44.2. Automatic Updating of Stock Numbers. In order to more efficiently update the item
records, AFMC automatically sends changes in stock numbers to the SBSS. Thus for numbers
registered in SNUD, personnel do not have to find the changed numbers on the stock list and
then enter them by FIC input.
8.44.3. Conditions for Changing Stock Numbers. Program control changes the stock number
when the new or change-to stock number is not already in the SBSS database. If the change-to
stock number is not in the SBSS database, the program finds all items, repair cycle, and detail
records and changes the stock number on each record, replacing the old stock number with the
change-to stock number.
8.44.4. FIC Rejects. Program control rejects FIC inputs having an NSN with a dash one (-1) in
position 14. These records can only be changed when applicable data on item records with the
basic NSN are changed.
1022                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014


8.45. Merging Stock Numbers.
8.45.1. Conditions for Merging Stock Numbers. Stock numbers are merged when the change-to
stock number is already in the SBSS database and system designator. When merging stock
numbers, the program not only performs all of the tasks above, but combines the assets if the two
stock numbers are compatible (that is, match). The program combines assets by adding the
change-from stock number to the change-to stock number and deleting the change-from record(s)
from the SBSS database.
8.45.2. Program Defaults in the Merging of Stock Numbers.
8.45.2.1. The program does not allow stock number changes from one type of stock record
account to another.
8.45.2.2. The program automatically adjusts the unit price, unit of issue, and quantity unit pack
difference to the change-to stock number.
8.45.2.3. The program rejects the input if the type stock record account code is K and if the first
position of the application code (munitions report code N or R) is not the same on both the
change-from and change-to stock numbers. The program also rejects the input if one of the
items has a budget code I, signifying that it is an Energy Research Development Agency
(ERDA)-owned asset, and the other does not. ERDA-owned assets may not be merged with
non-ERDA owned assets.
8.45.2.4. The program deletes a change-from stock number if it is in an ISG, but adds a change-
to stock number to the original group, provided that the stock number is not already loaded in
another group.
8.45.2.5. The program merges the input stock numbers only if the document numbers are equal
for the following detail records:
8.45.2.5.1. Supply point (type detail P) (record code 218).
8.45.2.5.2. WRM (type detail W) (record codes 240 and 241).
8.45.2.5.3. Mission Support Kit (MSK) (type detail Q) (record code 232, 235 and 236).
8.45.2.5.4. Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSP) (type detail U) (record code 233, 234,
237, 238 and 239).
8.45.2.5.5. Authorized/In-Use (type detail B) (record code 201).
8.45.2.6. The program merges Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) detail records (type detail D)
if the change-to and the change-from stock numbers are both repair cycle. But when the change-
to stock number is expendable and the change-from is repair cycle, the program deletes DIFM
detail records unless they are R920RW unserviceable or contract maintenance (activity code C).
The program also deletes repair cycle records if the DIFM items are being changed to
expendable. If they are not, the program either changes them to the gaining stock number or
merges them with the record data.
8.45.2.7. The program deletes the detail record if an excess report detail record (type detail code
X) is in the SBSS database for the change-from stock number, unless the change is a result of
DLATS rerouting of excess reports. These transactions can be identified with an excess
transaction status code TZ. (For excess transaction status codes, see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2).
When the program deletes an excess report detail record, it also flags the item record for file
status, resulting in an evaluation of the excess stockage positions of the change or merge-to stock
number.
8.46. Changing the Routing Identifier Code.
8.46.1. Reasons for Changing the RIC. Routing identifier codes must be changed whenever the
source of supply changes. In order for personnel to change a routing identifier code, a routing
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1023

identifier record must already be loaded on the SBSS database for each system designator that
has the input stock number loaded. Note: B and C series satellites always use routing identifier
records in system designator 01.
8.46.2. Applicability of the Changed RIC. The changed routing identifier code applies to all
item records for the input stock number, regardless of its system designator.
8.46.3. RICs for P Account Items. RICs for P account items (fuels and ground fuels) can only
be changed to and from RIC JBP, S9F, ARM, and NAV, and may be input by specific system
designator.
8.46.4. Source of Supply. In order to change the RIC, the RIC of the normal source of supply
must be loaded on the item record. The normal source of supply must be one of those shown in
the catalogs, furnished by SNUD, or determined otherwise.
8.46.5. Deletion of Exception Code 2. The program automatically deletes requisition exception
code 2 when local purchase items (RIC of JBx) are changed from a local purchase RIC, except
for RIC JBD, JBE, and JBZ. The program also turns the DD Form 1348-6 flag (procurement)
OFF or ON accordingly.
8.47. Changing the Budget Code.
8.47.1. Reasons for Changing the Budget Code. In general, SNUD assigns or changes budget
codes when item records are moved from one SMAG division to another. More specifically, the
budget code must be changed when a record is moved from the CSAG-S to the General Support
Division (GSD). See part 10 for definitions of the various SMAG divisions. (For other special
applications of budget codes, see Para 8.204)
8.47.2. Requirements for Loading the Budget Code. The budget code may be blank on the item
record when the routing identifier code is JBZ. AFMC assigns asterisk (*) budget codes to items
not yet having valid budget codes. Since the asterisk (*) budget code is not loaded in the SBSS,
the program assigns these items a budget code that is already in the SBSS, usually 9 or Z,
depending upon unit price.
8.47.3. Effects of SNUD Changes on Budget Codes. SNUD changes may realign previously
assigned budget codes. The budget code may be changed either independently or as a result of
changes to the ERRCD or the routing identifier code. In each instance, the program edits the
proposed changes to see that they meet compatibility requirements. Note: Budget code 1 can
only be assigned to NATO.
8.47.4. Assignment of Budget Code 9. (See Para 8.204 for the compatibility of
ERRCD/RIC/BC edits.)
8.47.5. Assignment of Budget Code Z. In general, budget code Z is assigned to locally funded
items of equipment costing more than $250,000 per unit. Once the budget code has been
assigned, it usually is not changed until the end of the fiscal year. This prevents excessive
changes between investment funds (major appropriations) and stock and/or Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) funds. Note: For Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC)
Atomic Energy Detection Systems (AEDS) (RIC JBZ, stock number P or L, and budget code Z)
the assigning or changing of budget code Z is not determined by unit price of the item. LRS/
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel may therefore change it as required in
any given situation. AFI 65-601, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Vol 1, Ch 8, provide the
criteria for determining whether or not an investment equipment item is authorized a budget code
Z.
8.47.6. SNUD-Assigned Budget Codes. Budget codes 8, or alpha other than Z, and I for XB3,
XF3, XD1, XD2, ND, and NF (AFMC or contractor sources of supply) are provided by SNUD.
1024                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

These budget codes may be changed locally as required. (See Para 8.204 for compatibility
requirements before entering any changes.)
8.47.7. Budget Code V and Y, EMC 5 Changes (Vehicles).
8.47.8. The program rejects changes from budget code V and Y, EMC 5 unless the force code (F
in position 6 of FIC) is entered when Registered Equipment Management (REM) vehicles only
detail records (type detail V) are loaded for the input stock number. When the force code is
entered, program control deletes the REM vehicles only detail records and the equipment code V
from the authorized/in-use detail records.
8.47.8.1. The program rejects changes to budget code V and Y, EMC 5 when authorized/in-use
detail records are loaded having positive quantities and no REM vehicles only detail records.
But if authorized /in-use detail records are loaded having zero quantities, or if REM vehicles
only detail records have already been loaded, the program processes the FIC input and enters
equipment code V on the authorized/ in-use or REM vehicles only detail records.
8.47.9. Budget Codes for ERDA-Owned Assets. Budget code I (ERDA-owned assets) can be
assigned only to item 1) loaded in either the FE or FK accounts and 2) having an MMAC code of
CM.
8.47.10. Review of Budget Code 9/Z Item Records. Changing item records to or from budget
code 9 and Z is determined by the cost price. Therefore, during the annual review of budget
code 9 and Z item records, applicable local purchase surcharges are deducted from the item
record standard price to determine if changing the budget code is necessary. Note: For AFTAC
Atomic Energy Detection Systems (AEDS) (RIC JBZ, stock number P or L, budget code Z), the
assignment of budget code Z is not determined by the item's unit price. AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Ch 8,
provide the criteria for determining whether or not an investment equipment item is authorized a
budget code Z.
8.47.10.1. Updating budget code 9 item records. For nonlocal purchase items, the item record
standard price is the cost price. But for local purchase items, the cost price is computed by
dividing the item record standard price by 1.086. If the result (the cost price) is $250,000 or
more, the item record is changed to budget code Z.
8.47.10.2. Updating budget code Z item records. The item record standard price is the cost
price. If the cost price is less than $250,000, the item record is changed to budget code 9.
8.47.11. MACR Updates. Some budget code changes cause program control to change the
MACR. More specifically, when budget codes are changed either to or from the SMAG or to or
from divisions of the SMAG, the program updates (increases or decreases) the orders placed
field of the MACR. An example would be from 9 to 8 (GSD to CSAG-S), 8 to 9, 9 to Z, or Z to
9. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for further explanations of this subject.)
8.47.12. Budget code 8 Items. Budget code 8 items which are locally assigned will result in the
item record being frozen with a P freeze code. The P freeze code can be removed by processing
TRIC MSD.
8.47.13. Budget code Y Items. Budget code Y is assigned to selected equipment items with a
unit price of less than $250,000 that are centrally procured with MAJCOMs O&M funds.
8.48. Changing the ERRCD.
8.48.1. Reasons for Changing the ERRCD. The ERRCD is changed as a result of a stock list
change in SNUD, as required by an AF IMT86, or as required by a documented special
authority. Changes in the ERRCD from or to supplies or equipment also change the type stock
record account code. Note: An ERRCD from stock-lists or stock-list change inputs must be
assigned to every item record.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                    1025

8.48.2. Effects of Changing the ERRCD.
8.48.2.1. An ERRCD change alters all item records for the input stock number, regardless of the
system designator.
8.48.2.2. An ERRCD change to or from expendable, that is, from XD to ND, or ND to XD,
causes the type stock record account code to change from or to B or E. Other types of stock
record account codes may not migrate with this input. For example, changes from P to K, B to
P, F to P, K to B, or K to E are not allowed. (See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure
for instructions on transferring property and records between different types of stock record
accounts.)
8.48.2.3. Program control rejects ERRCD changes from XB or NF if the item record contains an
IEX 3 or 6.
8.48.2.4. When special authority is used to change an ERRCD, an FIC must be processed to
place a (Y) in the local ERRCD flag. (This prevents unintentional changes to those ERRCD
pending resolution of proper coding when control of assets is involved. For example, changes
from nonexpendable to expendable or vice versa.)
8.48.3. Changing the ERRCD and SNUD Registry Compatibility. SNUD automatically changes
the local ERRCD flag to an (N) when the ERRCD on the item record is the same as the one on
the SNUD input. This assures SNUD registry compatibility. ERRCD differences are corrected
by either the data received from SNUD in response to an inquiry or through normal SNUD
processing. Thus, a user or LRS/Materiel Management Activity may question the validity of a
SNUD assigned ERRCD, but if AFMC determines that the original ERRCD is correct, SNUD
pushes only the authorized ERRCD and changes the SBSS. In this instance, the SBSS change
the local ERRCD flag from (Y) to (N) by FIC input.
8.48.4. ERRCD Changes that Produce an 093 Management Notice. When SNUD changes an
ERRCD from X to N or N to X, the program produces an 093 management notice in order that
Equipment Management may take appropriate action.
8.48.5. Changing the ERRCD Locally. If the ERRCD in the stocklists or stocklist change input
is obviously incorrect, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel may enter a
locally assigned ERRCD in the item record. To assign an ERRCD, Records Maintenance must
do the following:
8.48.5.1. Process an FIC input to place an (Y) in the local ERRCD flag to identify these items.
Once a (Y) has been assigned to the local ERRCD flag, the program control will not change the
ERRCD until the inline Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) program pushes an equal
ERRCD to the item record. Program control will ignore equipment management code (EMC)
edits and will change equipment item codes only when SNUD pushes the one position ERRCD.
8.48.5.2. Send a mechanical (short) AF IMT 86 to the IM responsible for assigning the ERRCD.
See paragraph 8 of the Air Force Management Data List (C-ML-AF) for specific instructions for
routing questions about stock control data. Note: If a request to change an ERRCD involves a
Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability Code Change Request, Records Maintenance personnel
use the AF IMT 86.
8.48.5.3. Maintain a suspense copy of all correspondence in order to justify assigning the
ERRCD. Note: AF IMT 86 files may satisfy this requirement. LRS Records Maintenance
personnel review the locally assigned ERRCD flag (Y) upon receipt of the first reply from the
IM. If the IM disapproves of the locally assigned ERRCD, LRS Records Maintenance may
obtain more information about the assignment by resubmitting the AF IMT 86. To do so, load
the ERRCD from the IM to the record and retain the locally assigned ERRCD flag (Y). LRS
1026                                    AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

Records Maintenance must keep all correspondence on file until SNUD automatically removes
the locally assigned (Y) ERRCD flag.
8.48.5.4. Keep supporting documentation from Maintenance on file in order to justify assigning
ERRCD for XB3/XF3 items. LRS Records Maintenance must keep this information because it
may retain its assignments of ERRCD even after receiving a second disapproval from the IM.
Note that to do so, Maintenance must demonstrate the capability to repair the items. Twice a
year LRS Records Maintenance must check the local ERRCD code part of the Stock Number
Directory (M14/NGV814) to verify the validity of the ERRCD it has assigned with Maintenance.
8.48.5.5. Verify that the locally assigned ERRCD flag is valid, as determined by the
correspondence in the suspense file or the pending AF IMT 86. Use the local ERRCD part of the
Stock Number Directory for the verification.
8.48.6. Processing Emergency BDR Inputs That Change ERRCDs. As appropriate, LRS/
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel process emergency BDR inputs to
change the ERRCD and reparable item movement control system (RIMCS) codes H and J.
8.48.6.1. If the BDR contains RIMCS code H, then receiving and processing the BDR will
change the ERRCD to XD2, place a an (Y) in the local ERRCD flag field, build a repair cycle
record if required, load new shipping information, and store the RIMCS code in the repair cycle
record.
8.48.6.2. If the BDR contains RIMCS code J, and if the current ERRCD is XB3 then receiving
and processing the BDR will change the ERRCD to XF3 and place an (Y) in the local ERRCD
flag field. A repair cycle record will be loaded containing new shipping information and the
RIMCS code. If the ERRCD is already XF3, load only the new shipping information along with
the RIMCS code in the repair cycle record.
8.48.6.3. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is not responsible for monitoring or
controlling the ERRCD assigned as a result of RIMCS codes H and J received from the IM
through the BDR inputs. LRS may retain output management notices from BDR inputs to help
review the local ERRCD part of the Stock Number Directory.
8.49. Changing the Equipment Management Code (EMC).
8.49.1. Dissemination of EMC. EMCs 1, 3, 4 and 5 are disseminated through SNUD and may
not be locally assigned. However, equipment L and P stock numbers may be changed from
EMC 1 to 3 or 4, and EMC 3 or 4 may be changed to 1 by manual FIC processing.
8.49.2. Assignment of EMC 2. At the direction or approval of the MAJCOM, equipment
management code 2 can be assigned at base level to those items AFMC has designated as EMC
1. It is also permissible to change EMC 2 items back to EMC 1 when required.
8.49.3. The ERRCD Required to Change EMC 1 and 2. To assign EMC 2 or to change an EMC
2 back to EMC 1, LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity 29-30 and the EMC (2 or
1) in position 31 of the FIC input and system designator in positions 23-24.
8.50. Outputs. Stock Number Changes (TRIC 1IC). Stock number changes or merges produce
these images only when 1) the item record contains a routing identifier code of JBx for local
purchase; 2) the item record does not contain a REX code 2; and 3) the LRS/Materiel
Management Activity is supported by an automated contracting system (base constants -1 record
procurement flag is a B or C).

Section 8E--Records Maintenance Miscellaneous Data Load/Change (FNL)

8.51. Overview.
8.51.1. Section Summary. This section describes the use of the FNL input to load or change
miscellaneous data on the item record.
8.51.2. Purpose of the FNL Input. The FNL input loads or changes the item record
nomenclature, shelf life code, quantity unit pack code, and the demilitarization code. FNL serves
also as a trigger input for loading the quantity unit pack conversion record.
8.52. Nomenclature Load.
8.52.1. Descriptive Nomenclature. All item records in the SBSS database will have a
descriptive nomenclature loaded. It must not exceed 32 characters for all items. The
nomenclature field also identifies exceptions as follows:
8.52.2. The First Character. The first character cannot be blank.
8.52.3. The Department of Defense Item Code (DODIC). If the type stock record account code
is K and the first position of the application code is R, then the first four positions of the
nomenclature must be the DODIC.
8.52.4. Changes to Grade Code. If the type stock record account code is P and the input is to
change the grade code, see further instructions (described in Para 8.198 and Para 8.199).
8.52.5. Sample Items. SR in the first two positions of the nomenclature field identifies field
manufacture items (RICs JBD, JBE, JBI, or JBT). When the items have been manufactured and
the manufacturer has samples and/or drawings, change the first two positions of the
nomenclature field to SA (sample available). If you already know that the manufacturer
provides the necessary drawings, samples, etc., you may enter SA with a complete nomenclature
in the FNL change. For sample items, leave at least one space between SA/SR and the
manufacture description in the nomenclature field.
8.53. Shelf Life Code. Although this field may be loaded with an FIL input, it can be changed
only by an FNL input. The shelf life code must be one of the authorized ones specified in AFH
23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
8.54. Quantity Unit Pack Code/Quantity. This code is loaded by FIL input and may be
changed by FCU, Unit of Issue and/or Unit Price Change Input. Changes by FNL input should be
processed only for items coded local purchase. Use a one-digit code (as specified in Para 8.189)
8.55. Demilitarization Code.
8.55.1. Changes to Demilitarization Codes. This code may be loaded with an FIL but can only
be changed by an FNL input. Inspection reviews all disposal documents having demilitarization
1028                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

code X (UNK) in order to assign the appropriate standard code to them. Inspection then informs
LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity of the required code changes. The servicing
DLADS is authorized to challenge the demilitarization codes assigned to all shipments it
receives.
8.55.2. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity Options in Changing
Demilitarization Codes. When informed of a change to the demilitarization code, LRS/AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must take one of the following courses of action:
8.55.2.1. If the current code is X (UNK), LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
personnel use an FNL input to change the item record to agree with the local determination.
They then follow the necessary steps.
8.55.2.2. If the current code is a standard DoD code (other than X), LRS/AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity cannot change the item record but must follow the necessary steps
described below.
8.55.2.3. If the local DLADS or Inspection determines that a demilitarization code has been
improperly assigned, LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel must process
a TRIC 1SQ, SNUD stock number interrogation, with option code 09 to verify the code (see
Para 8.219). This causes a BVAC09 image to be output to AFMC. If the reply to the BVAC09
inquiry indicates that the assigned code is correct, LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity may continue to challenge the assignment of the code by sending a letter to the IM for
the FSC. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must keep the challenging activity
(either Inspection or the servicing DLADS) informed of the progress of the correspondence until
the conflict is resolved.
8.56. Output Products. When the input data is invalid, program control produces either
management or reject notices. When the program can process the input successfully, it provides
no output.
8.57. Quantity Unit Pack Conversion Record. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity personnel use an FNL, File Maintenance Miscellaneous Data Change input to load the
quantity unit pack conversion record from program constants to the quantity unit pack
conversion record. No output is produced as a result of this input.

Section 8F--Unit of Issue/Unit Price Change (FCU)

8.58. Overview.
8.58.1. Section Summary. This section describes the use of the FCU input to change unit price,
unit of issue, and unit pack quantity on internal records. The AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity only processes price changes during reconciliation, at End-of-Year, and
when problems arise. The LRS process price changes for L and P numbered items and make
corrections as necessary for stock numbered items.
8.59. FCU Definition. The FCU input changes the unit price, unit of issue, and unit pack
quantity fields on internal records. Changes to unit price, unit of issue, and quantity unit pack
may be made simultaneously, unless the input is Procurement Status Input (LPS) or Procurement
Status Adjustment (LPA). Note: The FCU input updates all records using the input stock
number, except for L or P stock numbers and item records with RIC JB(X). FCU inputs are
produced by SNUD processing (see section 8H), program interface, and external records
maintenance input. Printed output resulting from FCU input is described in Para 8.208, Sec. B,
and Para 8.210.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1029

8.59.1. Adjusting Unit Price for Noncataloged Items. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity personnel adjust the unit price of noncataloged items (except local
purchase) as they are received from contractors by reviewing advanced copies of contract and
receipt documents.
8.60. Unit Price Changes.
8.60.1. Causes of Unit Price Changes. Unit price changes may result from receipt processing of
local manufacture, local purchase, and other funded receipts. Letters or messages that direct or
cause unit price changes will be retained in file for 1 year after the transaction (FCU input)
processing date. Input of Base Contracting status and adjustments (LPS and LPA) may also
change unit price. Input of a local purchase status (LPS) or local purchase adjustment (LPA)
will change the due-in detail price (for the item requisitioned only), the due-out detail linked to
that due-in, and it will update the item record unit cost. The item record and the due-out unit
cost will contain the current surcharge. The due-in will have the unit cost without surcharge, and
the local purchase status detail will have the contract extended price without surcharge.
8.60.2. Results of Entering Price Changes. Entering a price change produces the following
results:
8.60.2.1. The program updates the item record price and creates transaction history records for
serviceable balance.
8.60.2.2. The program writes transaction history records for RSP, supply point, DIFM,
MRSP/MSK, authorized/in-use (Use-Code = D only), and due-out detail records. These
transaction history records are required for financial inventory accounting (FIA) purposes.
8.60.3. Changing Unit Price on Overflow Item Records. The unit price on overflow (-9) item
records is updated in conjunction with price changes to the basic item record.
8.60.4. Changing Unit Price on item record that identify recapped tires. The unit price on Dash
Two (-2) item records are not updated when the basic item record unit price is updated. When
the unit price on a recapped tire is required a unit price change input (FCU) must be processed
against the -2 item record.
8.60.5. Pricing Vehicle Type Items. The unit price for vehicles with a source or category code
of APP is obtained from AS 001 (MEMI). If these data are not available, LRS/AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity personnel should initiate correspondence to the appropriate
inventory manager to obtain them.
8.60.6. Updating the MACR. Whenever the program can successfully process a price change
for a SMAG item with a fund code of 6C, the net price changes against due-in details result in a
change (either increase or decrease) to the obligations field of the GSD MACR record.
8.61. Unit of Issue Changes.
8.61.1. Unit of Issue Change Entries. Unit of issue changes must contain a unit price entry and
should contain quantity unit pack code when appropriate. Existing price data must be used if the
price is not being adjusted.
8.61.2. Standard Changes. A conversion factor is not required. The unit of issue conversion
table in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, is used to adjust record balances. Program control rejects the
unit of issue change when the old unit of issue is not convertible to the new, in which case the
procedures for nonstandard changes must be used.
8.61.3. Nonstandard changes. Unit of issue changes (such as box, package, roll, etc.) will be
internally computed by program control when processed as follows:
FORMULA:
UNIT OF MEASURE FACTOR CHANGE FROM = CONVERSION
1030                                    AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

UNIT OF MEASURE FACTOR CHANGE TO                        FACTOR
CONVERSION X SERVICEABLE = ADJUSTED
 FACTOR           BALANCE         BALANCE
EXAMPLE A:
To change unit of issue from EA (each) to PG (package) with a serviceable balance of 24 EA
when the Unit of Measure (U/M) in PG is 12, meaning 12 units in 1 package.
OLD CHANGE NEW CHANGE
U/I TO U/M U/I FROM U/M
EA 12          PG     1
Unit of measure factor change from = 1
Unit of measure factor change to = 12
(quantity in package)
Conversion factor = .0833 x 24 = 1.999
This input adjusts the serviceable balance to 2 pg.
EXAMPLE B:
To change unit of issue from DZ (dozen) to BX (box) with a serviceable balance of 37 DZ when
the unit of measure in BX is 100, meaning 100 units in one box.
OLD CHANGE NEW CHANGE
U/I TO U/M U/I FROM U/M
DZ 100         BX      12
Unit of measure factor change from = 12
Unit of measure factor change to = 100
(quantity in box)
Conversion factor = .12 X 37 = 4.44
This input adjusts the serviceable balance to 4 BX with the 44 remainder going to residue.
EXAMPLE C:
To change unit of issue from FT (feet) to CL (coil) with a serviceable balance of 1650 FT with
the unit of measure in CL is 750, meaning 750 feet in one coil.
OLD CHANGE NEW CHANGE
U/I TO U/M U/I FROM U/M
FT     750     CL      1
Unit of measure factor change from = 1
Unit of measure factor change to = 750
(quantity in coil)
Conversion factor = .0013 X 1650 = 2.145
This input adjusts the serviceable balance to 2 CL with a reminder of 150 FT for residue.


8.61.4. Results of Unit of Issue Change. Changing the unit of issue has the following results:
8.61.4.1. The program changes the record unit of issue and adjusts the following elements when
the conversion factor is other than 00001:
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1031

8.61.4.1.1. Serviceable balance.
8.61.4.1.2. Cumulative recurring demands.
8.61.4.1.3. Repair cycle record balance fields.
8.61.4.1.4. Detail record balances and authorized quantities, except for received-not-billed,
shipped-not-credited, and REM vehicles only detail records.
8.61.4.2. The program creates transaction history records for all updated detail records and for
serviceable balance.
8.61.4.3. The positive fields are half-adjusted in the units position. For example, if the unit of
issue changes from each to box and the box contains 12 units, the item record balance is
multiplied by .0833. If the item record serviceable balance is 5, it will be multiplied by .0833(5
X .0833 = 0.4165 + .5000 = 0.9165) which results in less than 1. The item record serviceable is
adjusted to 0 (zero). The quantity that is not equally dividable by the conversion factor can be
placed in an organization bench stock or given to a customer. The program does not allow detail
record balances to be adjusted to zero. It therefore assigns a balance of 1 to detail records when
zero would be the result and prints a notice to identify the detail record.
8.61.4.4. The program produces a single output document to bring about external storage and
inspection.
8.61.4.5. The program simultaneously adjusts the quantities on overflow adjunct (-9) item
records and basic item records. Note that the program also combines the quantities from the
basic and the (-9) item records, converts the combined totals, and enters the resulting adjustments
on both the basic and overflow adjunct item records. Personnel editing the results of the unit of
issue conversion must therefore consider the effects of the program's combining the balances
from both the (-9) and the basic records. If they do not, the change may seem to be incorrect.
8.61.4.6. At SPS -supported bases only, the program produces a TRIC 1CU, SPS Unit of Issue
Change Notification output to change the unit of issue in the SPS database. (See Para. 8.210.
for details.)
8.61.5. Unit of Issue Changes of ISG Items. The program requires that all master and
interchangeable items in an ISG bear the same unit of issue. Whenever a unit of issue change
affects an item record containing an interchangeable code M or I, program control automatically
changes the interchangeable code to S and prepares a BVA query image for submission to
AFMC for processing by the D043B system.
8.61.6. Unit of Issue/Price Changes to Bulk Issue (IEX 3/6) Items. When a unit of issue or a
price change for an item having either IEX 3 or IEX 6 and a positive balance exists, program
control freezes the item record with a P freeze code, causes a BIR input to be punched, and
produces an F014 management notice. When the Retail Service Store re-inputs the BIR, the
program unfreezes the item record and makes the appropriate change for unit of issue or unit
price.
8.61.7. Unit Of Issue Changes For Budget Code 9 And Moving Average Cost (MAC). When
processed, the program first computes extended MAC by multiplying the 022-FILLER-1 * 022-
FILLER-2. The program saves the results internally, then processes FCU changes as normal.
The program computes the total asset balance by summing the 101 item balance, the detail on-
hand quantity, and the detail deployed quantities on any of the existing details, after the Unit of
Issue change on the 218, 230, 232, 233, 234, 237, 238, 239, 240, or 241 details. Moves the
summed result to the 022-FILLER-1 field. Program then divides the extended MAC by the 022-
FILLER-1 field and stores the results of this division in the 022-FILLER-2 field. This value is
1032                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

the new computed MAC. Price changes do not affect the MAC and the new unit price is not a
consideration in computing a MAC on FCU inputs. Applies only to budget code 9 assets.
8.62. Quantity Unit Pack Code Changes.
8.62.1. QUP Changes and Other Input. Changes to the QUP code may either be entered
independently or made in conjunction with changes to unit price or unit of issue. Standard QUP
codes will be used (as specified in Para 8.189).
8.62.2. Effect of QUP Code Changes on Detail Records and Transaction Histories. Changing
the QUP code does not change detail records and does not create transaction history records.
8.62.3. QUP Codes and SNUD. Bases will not change those QUP codes received through
SNUD, except for those items coded local purchase.
8.63. Assignment of Excess Cause Flags.
8.63.1. Criteria for Assigning Excess Cause Flags. The program automatically assigns an excess
cause flag of C to all item records without one being loaded, provided that the following
conditions are met:
8.63.1.1. The input quantity unit pack is less than that currently stated on the item record.
8.63.1.2. The unit of issue change and the ERRCD are both XB.
8.63.1.3. The unit price increase and the item record ERRCD are both XB or are being changed
to XB.

Section 8G-- Item Record Delete (FID)

8.64. Overview.
8.64.1. Section Summary. This section describes the use of the FID input to delete item records.
8.64.2. The Two Ways of Deleting Item Records. In general, item records are deleted in either
of two ways: 1) internally by the program during file status processing, 2) by processing an FID
input as outlined in this section. The internal delete requires no manual input by a technician,
whereas the external delete requires the manual processing of an FID input by a technician.
8.64.3. Deleting Item Records from the ISG. When an item record for a stock number in an ISG
record is deleted, the stock number is also deleted from the ISG record. (See section 8I for ISG
update procedures.)
8.64.4. Deleting Item Records for Bulk Fuels. When an item record for bulk fuels (type stock
record account code P) is deleted, program control enters a D in the 420-DELETE-FLAG field of
the matching fuels management record.
8.65. The FID Deletion Criteria.
8.65.1. Requirements for Deleting Item Records with the FID. In general, item records will be
deleted during file status processing. The input of a correctly prepared FID deletes item records
when all of the following conditions have been met:
8.65.1.1. The serviceable balance field is zero.
8.65.1.2. The demand level field is either blank or zero. Note: To delete item records with
other than a blank or a zero in this field, the FID input must contain force code F in position 4.
8.65.1.3. The date of last demand was more than 365 days ago. To delete item records
regardless of the date of last demand, use force code F in position 4.
8.65.1.4. The stock number being deleted is not an ISG AFMC master item.
8.65.1.5. None of the following detail records exists: due-in, due-out, DIFM, unserviceable,
excess, received but not billed, shipped but not credited, REM vehicles only, special level
(Exception: Readiness Base Level (RBL) with quantity of zero), Economic Order Quantity
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                 29 JANUARY 2014                                        1033

(EOQ) consumption details, demand data variance details (except when the organization/shop
code is 007SC), serialized control, and in-use serialized control details.
8.65.1.6. None of the following detail records exists with on-hand/authorized quantities: WRM
detail records 232-241, supply point, and authorized in-use detail records. Note: Without on-
hand/authorized quantities, an FID input deletes these detail records.
8.65.1.7. A status detail record exists without a matching due-in detail record. An FID input
also deletes the status detail record.
8.65.1.8. The current quarter data fields on the repair cycle record are zero for repair cycle items
(ERRCD/XD and XF). Note: The FID input also deletes the repair cycle record.
8.65.1.9. A part number detail record exists for the input system designator. The FID input also
deletes the part number detail record.
8.65.1.10. The 101-UNSUITABLE-ITEM-FLAG equals U and the date in positions 1-5 of the
nomenclature is less than the current date, otherwise an 032 reject notice occurs. To override the
date check, position 7 must contain reason why code F.
8.65.2. Non-deletable Item Records. Item records having a basic NSN cannot be deleted if an
active dash stock numbered item record (dash in the 14th position following the NSN) is loaded
for that NSN. The program uses the same criteria to delete dash stock numbered item records as
it does to delete all other item records. Thus if an FID input has a basic NSN and if a dash stock
numbered item record has already been loaded for that NSN, the program will delete both items
if both meet the criteria for deletion. However, if either one does not, the program rejects the
FID input. If the reason for the rejection is the dash number, it will be so stated in the fourth line
of the reject notice.
8.66. Input. FID inputs to delete item records must be prepared and input (see Para 8.212)
8.67. Output.
8.67.1. To the Computer Operations/Main System. If the FID is input through the Computer
Operations/main system, the program prints a notice only if it rejects the input. If the program
processes the FID input, it does not print any notice.
8.67.2. For FID inputs, the program provides notices for successful processing, as well as
rejects.
8.67.3. To Stock Number Directories and Input Suspense Files. The Daily Document Register
for activity code Y and FID inputs may be used to update Stock Number Directories and to clear
input suspense files. Update the Stock Number Directory by drawing a single, nonobliterating
line through the stock number.
8.67.4. SNUD Delete Cards. The program outputs a SNUD delete when an item record for a
SNUD eligible stock number is not loaded with another system designator. (See section 8H for
details.)

Section 8H--Stock Number User Directory

8.68. Overview.
8.68.1. Section Summary. The SNUD, D071 System, is AFMC operated data system. SNUD
distributes stock control data such as stock-lists to the recorded users of the stock numbers. This
section explains how each base, once registered as a SNUD user, will process AFMC output,
request data or report inaccurate data, and verify (annually) its SBSS database with the SNUD
file. Also discussed is the defense inactive item program (DIIP) and how it meets its objective
with the help of the item manager, Distribution, and Stock Control.
1034                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.68.2. Purpose of SNUD. SNUD provides automatic distribution of stock number management
data to bases that are recorded users of the stock number. Distribution based on established user
interest reduces the need for users to manually research reference documents such as stock-lists,
stock-list change notices, General Services Administration (GSA) catalogs, etc.
8.68.3. Groups/Stock Numbers Excluded From SNUD. Federal supply groups 65 and 89, and
USAF Security Service special stock numbers (X = fifth position) are excluded from SNUD.
Stock-lists, stock-list change notices, and GSA catalogs for these groups must be screened
against the Stock Number Directory (M14/NGV814) and necessary inputs (for example, FIC,
FCU, FCD, FCL, etc.) created to update local records. Also make sure that manual action,
required because of the stock-list changes, is taken (for example, break down items into
component parts, dispose of items, condemn items, etc.).
8.69. References. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will become completely
familiar with the following reference and its contents: AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
8.70. Stock Number Catalog Data.
8.70.1. Stock number catalog data distributed through SNUD originate from the Air Force
cataloging suite of systems which comprise several systems. The D043 System, Master Item
Identification Control System (MIICS), is, however, the Air Force’s primary repository for
cataloging and standardization data. This system contains logistics records for about 2.6 million
AF-used items. The data are mechanically provided to the SNUD system which distributes it to
recorded users of the stock number to which the data apply.
8.70.2. The mechanically distributed data from SNUD are the authorized source of stock
number catalog data.
8.70.3. Users may question the catalog data if they believe the data are not correct.
8.71. Initial Registration/File Buildup.
8.71.1. Conversion to SBSS. Before converting to the SBSS, AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity will refer to the following:
8.71.1.1. Prepare and submit an AF IMT 1991 (document identifier code, Master Base Address
Record). Send the form and a letter requesting authorization to participate to
imcscustomerser@wpafb.af.mil.
8.72. Daily SNUD Add/Delete/Inquiry (BDF/BVA) Reports.
8.72.1. Computer Output of SNUD Add/Delete/Inquiry Reports. The computer automatically
outputs SNUD add (BDFA) and delete (BDFD) reports when you add/ delete a record (except
USAF Security Service special stock numbers--X in fifth position and FSC 65 and 89). As
stock-list change inputs (BM(x), BVE, or BV4) are processed, the computer will edit each input
for proper format. The computer will output a SNUD delete (BDFD) when the input stock
number (positions 8-22) cannot be located. Process AFMC output from these SNUD add/delete
images according to Para 8.218. When stock-list change images (BM(x), BN(x), BVE, or BV4)
are processed with invalid input data, (specifically unit of issue, quantity unit pack code, shelf
life code, airlift code, demilitarization code, ERRCD, phrase code, physical security code, and
budget code), a 640 reject notice is output. The fifth line of print on this reject notice shows the
incorrect data fields. Research for correct data and reinput using the formats in Para 8.214,
Para 8.215, and Para 8.216. If correct data are not found, input 1SQ to generate a SNUD stock
number interrogation to AFMC. (See Para 8.219 for 1SQ format.) Process AFMC output from
these stock number interrogations according to Para 8.218.
8.72.2. Establishing and Deleting Base Interest in an Item in SNUD. The BDFA will establish
base interest in the item in the SNUD (DO71) system, and will cause a full range of stock control
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1035

data to be returned to the base by an automatic interface between the AFMC central systems.
The BVAC12 (inquiry) will ask the AFMC Base Account Screening Exercise (BASE (D046)
system for current ammunition data. The BDFD will delete the base interest in the item from the
AFMC SNUD (DO71) system. The BVAC09 (inquiry) reports are inquiries which ask the
AFMC BASE (DO46) system for current stock control data. Note: A BVM will be returned
from AFMC on input of a BVAC12.
8.72.3. Processing of AFMC Output from Daily SNUD Add/Delete/Inquiry Reports.
LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel will process AFMC output from
daily SNUD add/delete/inquiry (as outlined in Para 8.218).
8.72.4. Processing of Item Records with IEX 3 or 6. When stocklist change reports (BM(x),
BN(x), BVE, or BV4) process for item records with IEX 3 or 6, the following will take place:
the record will be frozen with a P, an F014 management notice will be produced, and a bulk
issue request (BIR) input will be produced under program control.
8.73. Weekly Stocklist Changes.
8.73.1. Processing of ISG Data Inputs. Routine ISG data formats (BDS) are output weekly
through the SNUD. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel will process
this output (see Para 8.218).
8.73.2. Processing of Priority Stock Control and RIMCS Data Changes. Priority stock control
and urgent RIMCS data changes (document identifier codes BM(x), BN(x), and BDR) are also
output on a weekly basis. Process these changes according to the effective date on the input.
Priority stock control data changes are limited to the following:
8.73.2.1. Reactivation of an item from disposal status.
8.73.2.2. Change of items from active to condemned (JCK, SOS modifier).
8.73.2.3. Correction of significant price errors.
8.73.3. Processing of Ammunition Data Changes. Ammunition data changes (BDM) are output
weekly by AFMC. (Process these inputs inline according to Para 8.218)
8.74. Monthly Stocklist Changes.
8.74.1. Distribution of Stock-List Changes. Routine stock control, transportation, and RIMCS
data changes (document identifier codes BM(x), BDT, and BDR) are distributed through SNUD
to recorded users of the applicable stock numbers. These changes are distributed monthly--
during the second week of the month prior to the effective date.
8.74.2. Processing of Catalog Management Data (CMD) Changes. Process CMD changes as
follows: 1) at the close of business the last day of the month, or 2) at the beginning of business
the following month. CMD changes are processed based on the effective date of the input.
Note: When possible, process CMD changes after end-of-month (EOM) processing. This
policy allows approximately one month for detecting and correcting inaccurate CMD updates.
Numerous updates or the necessity to provide continued inline support may require changes in
this policy. In these situations, process CMD changes as soon as possible after the effective date.
8.74.3. BV8 (Reparable Item Movement Control Report)/BDR. Management of RIMCS is a
joint responsibility of the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity and LRS Repair Cycle
Support.
8.75. SNUD Annual Reconciliation.
8.75.1. The AFMC SCM-R Records maintenance Activity will perform an annual SNUD
reconciliation on all bases."
8.75.2. AFMC Reconciliation Actions. After reconciliation, AFMC will take the following
action:
1036                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.75.2.1. Delete user interest in stock numbers for which the submitting activity is a registered
user.
8.75.2.2. Establish user interest in stock numbers submitted by the activity in the reconciliation.
8.75.3. Output. Further processing by AFMC will result in the following output to the user:
8.75.3.1. Current stock number catalog data are output when at least one element of input base
data does not match AFMC central files.
8.75.3.2. Current transportation data are output when at least one element of input base
transportation data does not match AFMC central files.
8.75.3.3. All RIMCS, I&S, and ammunition data are automatically output for stock numbers of
which the base is a registered user.
8.76. Requesting/Reporting Specific Types of Data.
8.76.1. Inquiry of the AFMC Central Files. The AFMC Base Account Screening Exercise
(BASE) D046 system allows activities to inquire of the AFMC central files 1) the specific types,
or 2) a complete range of data. The input and option codes submitted determine the type of data
obtained.
8.76.2. Requesting a Complete Range of Data. An activity may ask AFMC, by letter of request,
to automatically send the following data for the activity's particular stock record account: a
complete range of part number, ISG, RIMCS, or transportation data.
8.76.3. Requesting Current Data. If an activity suspects its local records contain inaccurate data,
the activity will input a TRIC 1SQ, SNUD stock number interrogation, to generate a BVAC to
AFMC for current data for that particular stock number. For example, misrouted requisitions or
reparable shipments indicate the routing identifier code or RIMCS data on the base's records are
inaccurate. Input of 1SQ with specific option codes generates BVAC images to AFMC for
specific types of data. For example, input of a 1SQ option code 09 queries AFMC for the most
current CMD, or option code 14 queries AFMC for current RIMCS data. When a part number is
loaded with less than 11 positions and a CAGE reference number, input a 1SQ with the part
number and no option code. This generates a BVUC25 to AFMC. 1SQ inputs are not allowed
for part numbers with ZZZZZ CAGE. The AFMC D046 system will not accept BVUC25
interrogations without a valid CAGE and part number.
8.76.4. Recommendation for Data Revision. If the base does not agree with the response to the
data being questioned, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel will forward a
request for verification or a recommendation for revision to the person responsible for that data.
8.77. Data Elements.
8.77.1. Data Elements. Data elements and their definitions are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 1,
Ch 2.
8.78. Assignment of Excess Cause Flags.
8.78.1. File maintenance programs assign an excess cause flag of C when none is on the item
record and the following conditions exist:
8.78.2. ERRCD Code Changes:
8.78.2.1. XB to XD/XF/ND/NF.
8.78.2.2. XF to XB/XD/ND/NF.
8.78.2.3. XD to XB/ND/NF.
8.78.2.4. ND/NF to XD/XF/XB.
8.78.3. Budget Code Changes:
8.78.3.1. Blank to 9, except when the expendability, recoverability, reparability cost designator
(ERRCD) change is XD to XF, or ND to NF.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1037


8.79. Defense Inactive Item Program.
8.79.1. Objective of the Defense Inactive Item Program. The objective of the defense inactive
item program (DIIP) is to eliminate all unneeded items, reducing the item inventory to the
minimum level necessary for mission accomplishment.
8.79.2. Item Manager's Actions. To help ensure the program objective is achieved, item
managers will take the following action:
8.79.2.1. Conduct a systematic review of managed items.
8.79.2.2. Identify potentially inactive items.
8.79.2.3. Remove the inactive items, when identified, from the file.
8.79.3. Program NGV448 processing. As a result of the item manager's actions, SNUD
forwards inactive item reports (IIRC) document identifier code BDD (BDE for follow-ups).
BDD/BDE images are processed inline from SIFS by program NGV448.
8.79.3.1. If, based on the review, the item is no longer required, the program will: code the
BDD/BDE DL (deletion) in positions 65-66, enter the five-position ordinal date in positions 69-
73, and convert the DIC in positions 1-3 to BDG, Defense Inactive Item Review Reply (BDH
Defense Inactive Item Review Follow-ups).
8.79.3.2. If, based on the review, the item is to be retained because of a current or projected
requirement, the pro-gram will: code the BDD, Defense Inactive Item Inquiry/BDE, Defense
Inactive Item Inquiry (Follow-up) RE (retention) in positions 65-66 enter retention reason codes
1 or 2 in position 44, enter the five-position ordinal date in positions 69-73, and convert the DIC
in positions 1-3 to BDG (BDH for follow-ups). Definitions of and directions for retention reason
codes 1 and 2 are given as follows:
8.79.3.2.1. Retention reason code 1 (RRC1). Active items do not necessarily create demand
within the specified time periods, but they are essential to current or future mission requirements.
8.79.3.2.2. Retention reason code 2 (RRC2). Semi-active items must be retained in the supply
system because 1) stocks of the item are on hand or in use below the wholesale level, or 2) in-use
assets are being reported.
8.79.4. Output of BDG/BDH Responses. BDG/BDH responses will be output to AFMC based
on RID through DLATS.

Section 8I--Interchangeable and Substitute Groups (ISGs)

8.80. Overview.
8.80.1. Section Summary. This section defines ISG items. It outlines what factors you must use
to establish each grouping, and what procedures you must use to maintain the AFMC
Interchangeable and Substitute Data Maintenance System (D043B). Next, this section tells you
how to establish the SBSS ISG, and how to set up ISG relationships for local use. Procedures to
process the D043B update program (NGV404), D043B X file relationships, and program GV403
ISG cleanup are then explained. Finally, input format for loading, changing, and deleting an ISG
record appears in this section. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity manages ISG
actions.
8.80.2. Definition of ISG. Interchangeable and substitute groups (ISG) consist of items that are
similar physically and functionally. In other words, ISG items may be substituted for one
another and used to do comparable work. After performing these similar tasks, ISG items must
consistently provide the same quality of performance. Each group is also designed to contain
items that have management data compatibility.
1038                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.80.3. Purpose of the SBSS ISG. The SBSS ISG provides bases with information about items
that may be used interchangeably for local use. Stock numbers on the SBSS ISG record are
arranged in sequence by ISG order code within relationship code: master, interchangeable,
substitute, components, next higher assembly, and repair kits. By using this information, each
base may select suitable substitute items from a wide range of relationships and adapt these items
for local use. Maximum use of these interchangeable and suitable substitutes will reduce waste
throughout the Air Force.
8.81. Interchangeable and Substitute Group Correspondence.
8.81.1. Computerized ISG Inquiries. BVAC10 (SNUD Inquiry) and XXX (D043B) inquiries
are normally produced under program control. However, input of a 1SQ, SNUD stock number
interrogation, with option code 10 also produces these inquiries.
8.81.2. Manual Correspondence. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will manually
prepare inquiries that concern ISG items. Prepare inquires manually only when required by
procedures in this section. Address manual inquiries to HQ AFMC/A4SI, 4375 Chidlaw Rd,
Bldg 262, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006.
8.82. AFMC Interchangeable and Substitute Data Maintenance System (D043B).
8.82.1. Purpose of D043B System. Interchangeable and substitute groups (ISG) for supply
items are loaded and maintained on computer through the D043B system. The D043B system
contains three files: 1) D043B J contains items that AFMC considers completely compatible; 2)
D043B X contains relationships that, according to AFMC, contain incompatible management
data or are not completely comparable in functional performance; 3) D043B R contains a record
of responses to base XXX inquiries. The stock numbers and their relationships recorded in files
D043B J and D043B X are published in the USAF ISG stock list (SL-ISG). Data from these
three files are sent in BDS/BVS format, through SNUD, to registered users. Note: For the
remainder of this section, the D043B J, D043B X, and D043B R files will be referred to as J, X,
and R files.
8.82.2. D043B Processing Procedures. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel
maintaining the base ISGs should be thoroughly familiar with the D043B system and its
influence on the SBSS.
8.82.3. The J File. This file contains groups of items that are completely interchangeable (or
suitable substitutes) and contain compatible management data. These groups of items are
organized as follows:
8.82.3.1. Subgroups. Each group of items is divided into subgroups. Each subgroup is
identified by a sequentially assigned alphabetical code (AA, AB, AC, etc.). The first subgroup
(AA) indicates the least preferable item or group of like items; each successive subgroup
indicates a more desirable item or group of items.
8.82.3.2. Parts preference code. The order in which items in the same subgroup are used is
controlled by the parts preference code (AAA, AAB, AAC, etc.). Items with a restrictive
application are assigned a numeric parts preference code (AA2, AA3, AA4, etc.).
8.82.3.3. Order of use code. This code is formed by combining the subgroup and parts
preference code. The order of use code indicates a one-way relationship between a subgroup and
stock numbers in a more preferable subgroup:
8.82.3.3.1. Interchangeable items. The first two positions indicate the items are fully
interchangeable when placed in the same subgroup within the same ISG (AA). The third
position (A, B, and C) indicates the order of use for the interchangeable items.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1039

8.82.3.3.2. Substitute items. The first two positions indicate the items are suitable substitutes
when placed in different subgroups within the same ISG (AAA, ABA, etc.). Note: One-way
interchangeable conditions are explained as follows: Customer requirements for items in
subgroup AA(x) can be satisfied in all conditions from the items in subgroup AB(x), but
requirements for items in subgroup AB(x) cannot be satisfied from items in subgroup AA(x).
8.82.4. The X File. This file contains relationships between items that, according to AFMC, are
not completely comparable in functional performance or that contain incompatible management
data. These conditions are explained as follows:
8.82.4.1. Limited substitute relationships. Items in this category cannot be issued freely or used
in place of older items or items with less performance capabilities. However, such items can be
used as suitable substitutes at certain bases.
8.82.4.2. Interchangeable and substitute relationships. Items in this category cannot be recorded
in the J file because the relationships contain incompatible management data or the Air Force is
not a recorded user of an item.
8.82.5. The R File. This file contains a record of responses to base XXX inquiries.
Relationships in this file are not contained in the X or J file. They may, however, be moved to
the X or J file after HQ AFMC/LGSI actions are completed. AFMC will delete relationships that
are moved from this file to the X or J file.
8.83. Source Data For Establishing SBSS ISG.
8.83.1. The AFMC D043B System. The AFMC D043B system is the primary source used to
establish base level interchangeable and substitute groups (ISG). The D043B file is updated
weekly; changes are forwarded through the SNUD D071 system to bases registered as users of
one or more stock numbers in the ISG. The D043B file is published quarterly in the SL-ISG,
which may be used to help establish local relationships.
8.83.1.1. Changes to AFMC D043B data before storage in SBSS records. The base level ISG
system is established on information passed by the AFMC D043B system. But the data undergo
certain changes before they are stored in the SBSS database records. Specifically, the three-
position AFMC order of use code from J file records is changed as follows: 1) the first position
of the subgroup code is dropped, 2) the second position is stored as the item record ISG source
code, and 3) the third position is stored as the item record parts preference code. Note: The ISG
source code and the parts preference code combine to form the item record ISG order code. For
example, store the AFMC order use code ABA as BA in the item record ISG order code field.
8.83.1.2. Establishing ISG relationships from J file data. The base level ISG system crosses
AFMC subgroups when establishing ISG relationships from J file data (for examples of how
D043B groups items, see Para 8.224, example 1). This crossover occurs because, at any given
base level activity, items in different subgroups can possibly be used interchangeably. (The
procedures in paragraphs 8.90 and 8.91 apply when changes to D043B established groups are
required.)
8.83.1.3. Creating substitute relationships. The SBSS creates substitute relationships when the
management data outlined in paragraph 8.89 are not compatible between the SBSS master item
and other items within the same D043B ISG.
8.83.2. Status/Receipts/Push Due-Ins. When processing MILSTRIP status, receipts, or push
due-ins indicating that a substitute item is being supplied, the computer automatically evaluates
the controlling data on the two items and determines if a relationship can be established. The
following criteria are used to determine the type of relationship to establish:
1040                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.83.2.1. Interchangeable relationships. Interchangeable relationships are set up (under program
control), except as noted in (2) or (3) below. If one of the items is already in an ISG, the
remaining item is loaded to that ISG as an interchangeable. When neither stock number is in an
ISG, the requisitioned item is loaded as the master; if it has a numeric parts preference code, the
master will be the supplied item.
8.83.2.2. Substitute relationships. Set up substitute relationships under the following conditions:
8.83.2.2.1. Different units of issue.
8.83.2.2.2. Munitions items with different reporting codes.
8.83.2.2.3. Both items in different D043B ISGs.
8.83.2.2.4. Either stock number already in an ISG as a substitute.
8.83.2.2.5. Different source of supply.
8.83.2.3. No relationships. Relationships are not set up under the following conditions:
8.83.2.3.1. Either item is already in an ISG as a component, next higher assembly, or repair kit.
8.83.2.3.2. Both items are in a different ISG as master or interchangeable items.
8.83.2.3.3. One or both items are in the fuels (P) stock record account.
8.83.2.3.4. Both items are not in the same type stock record account.
8.83.2.3.5. Incompatible ERRCD codes.
8.83.3 Locally Determined. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity may establish
locally determined relationships from information contained in Tables of Allowances, technical
order parts list, or information submitted by base activities. Master/interchangeable relationships
cannot be established between items in different AFMC D043B ISGs. When
master/interchangeable relationships are established, specify the master stock number by the
TRIC FIS input.
8.84. Composition of a Base Level Interchangeable and Substitute System.
8.84.1. Purpose of Relationship Codes. A base level ISG consists of 2-24 items. Relationships
are established among these items. A relationship code specifies the relationship between two
items within an ISG.
8.84.2. Master Item (Relationship Code M).
8.84.2.1. Definition of master item. An ISG may contain only one master item. The master
item must be a suitable substitute for interchangeable in the ISG: the master must not only have
the same physical and functional characteristics of but also be as suitable for local use as each
interchangeable in the ISG. The designation of master is determined by the type stock record
account code and reportability of the items within an ISG.
8.84.2.2. Selecting the master for equipment items. The master item for an ISG containing
equipment items will be the D043B most preferable item for which an item record is loaded. In
groups with a source other than the D043B, the master is the requisitioned item or stock number
specified by the requesting base. Once the ISG is established, bases may use FIS inputs to
rearrange the ISG so they conform to local requirements.
8.84.2.3. Selecting the master for other than equipment items. ERRCD XD, XF, or XB items
normally are loaded by the D043B update processing (program NGV404). The most preferred
item (the AFMC master item) is loaded to the base level ISG as the last interchangeable item.
The least preferred item, other than stock numbers with a numeric parts preference code, is
specified as the SBSS master item. Bases may use FIS processing and ISG source code 7 to set
up ISGs for these items. AFMC verifies these groups automatically. Once these groups are
established, bases may use FIS inputs to designate the master of the groups so they conform to
local requirements. CAUTION: DO NOT use FIS inputs to delete the AFMC master item.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1041

8.84.2.4. Determining the SBSS master stock number for groups of expendable items. The
SBSS master stock number for groups of expendable items is determined by the source of the
ISG as follows:
8.84.2.4.1. In groups that have D043B ISG update processing (NGV404) as their source, the
base level master stock number is the least preferred item.
8.84.2.4.2. In groups that have a source other than D043B the SBSS master item is assigned as
specified in paragraph 8.88.
8.84.3. Interchangeable Items (Relationship Code I). Interchangeable items can be exchanged
for the master or other interchangeables in the same ISG. They have the same physical and
functional characteristics of and are as suitable for local use as the master or other
interchangeables. Interchangeables have a two-way relationship with the items they replace.
When interchangeables are exchanged for these items, neither the interchangeable nor the items
they replace are changed.
8.84.4. Substitute Items (Relationship Code S). Substitute items have the same (or similar)
physical characteristics as other master, interchangeable, or substitute items in the ISG.
Substitute items can be used in place of these items only for particular uses or under certain
conditions. Stock numbers that are freely interchangeable but have incompatible management
data and items with a one-way relationship are also loaded as substitutes.
8.84.5. Next Higher Assembly (Relationship Code H). A requested item may be an end item--a
complete unit in itself. But a requested item may also be a part (a subassembly) of a larger item
(the next higher assembly). If a requested item is not in stock, you may be able to purchase it as
part of the next higher assembly. Stock Control can reference asset notices (made from your
due-out) to check whether the item is in stock as part of the next higher assembly. Relationship
code H identifies for Stock Control the next higher assembly that contains the item you
requested.
8.84.6. Repair Kit (Relationship Code K). Relationship code K identifies a repair kit that can be
used to repair a requested item. A repair kit is a package of selected maintenance and overhaul
parts. Normally grouped into one package of selected bits and pieces, these parts are identified
as a single item within the same commodity class as the end item needing repair. Use this kit
when other means to repair the item are not available.
8.84.7. Component Part (Relationship Code C). A component part is an item manufactured for
use in assemblies, subassemblies, end items, or end products. These parts are listed in the
blueprint, drawing, technical order, or specification of the assembly, subassembly, end item, or
product in which they are to be used. (Note: Parts of items or assemblies that are completely
replaced during overhaul or repair--nuts, bolts, gaskets, O-rings, etc.--are not component parts.)
If a requested component part is not in stock, you may be able to purchase it as part of a major
end item. Relationship code C identifies for Stock Control assemblies of a major end item.
When processing other asset notices for due-outs on the major end item, Stock Control can check
whether the requested component part is in stock as part of the major end item.
8.85. ISG Constraints and Limitations.
8.85.1. Review the following restrictions before loading stock numbers to an ISG.
8.85.2. Items Excluded from ISG. The following items will reject if you try to load them into
the computer:
8.85.2.1. Items in the fuels account.
8.85.2.2. Dash stock numbers (adjunct records).
8.85.3. Contents of an ISG. Base level ISGs contain the following elements:
1042                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.85.3.1. Items that have the same type stock record account number.
8.85.3.2. Must have at least two stock numbers, but cannot exceed twenty-four (24).
8.85.3.3. An interchangeable and substitute group must consist of one master (M) and at least
one interchangeable (I), but not more than twenty-three (23). Other stock number relationships
can consist of substitutes (S), component parts (C), next higher assembly (H), and/or repair kit
(K).
8.85.3.4. A substitute group that does not have a master or interchangeable. These groups are
established by local management when items have the same characteristics but must be reviewed
by the user before issue can be made.
8.85.3.5. A master, when the ISG also contains an interchangeable.
8.85.4. Loading Restrictions for Stock Numbers. Stock numbers are loaded to a base level ISG
under the following restrictions:
8.85.4.1. Load each stock number to only one ISG.
8.85.4.2. Load, in an ISG with master/interchangeable relationships, only stock numbers that
have the following characteristics:
8.85.4.2.1. Equal unit of issue.
8.85.4.2.2. Compatible ERRCD (compatibility edits are waived for equipment items).
8.85.4.2.3. Equal munitions reporting codes.
8.85.4.2.4. Equal RAMPS report codes.
8.85.4.2.5. Equal source of supply.
8.85.4.3. The D043B master stock number in an ISG must be loaded in each system designator
that contains a D043B interchangeable.
8.85.4.4. When a base master stock number is deleted, the system selects the next
interchangeable stock number from the ISG record and re-identifies it as the base master
regardless of the system designator.
8.85.5. Master/Interchangeable Items with IEX code 3, 6, E, or K. If, when you load or add
items to an ISG, the master or an interchangeable item in the ISG has an IEX of 3, 6, E, or K,
that IEX code will be assigned by the computer to the master and all interchangeables in the
group. Note: Substitute items in the ISGs must be reviewed by Retail Sales personnel to
determine if these items should be stocked. When personnel decide the items should be stocked
in a retail sales outlet, an FCD must be processed to assign the appropriate IEX code.
8.86. ISG Order Code.
8.86.1. Purpose of the ISG Order Code. This code is a combination of two data elements: the
source code (the first character) and the parts preference code (the last character). The ISG order
code identifies the preference for an item relative to other interchangeables in the same ISG.
This code is stored on the item record and updated by FIS or NGV404 processing.
8.86.2. Purpose of the ISG Source Code. This code identifies the source used to establish
relationships between items. On the item record, the field for the ISG code is blank when the
item is not in an ISG.
8.86.3. Acceptable ISG Source Codes. Definitions of acceptable ISG source codes are as
follows:
8.86.3.1. An alpha character identifies D043B grouped items. For example, an X identifies X
file processing. Note: Alpha codes may be assigned to an item by FIS processing if the item's
current source code is 9.
8.86.3.2. A numeric character identifies a relationship that is established locally or under
program control. The source code may be different from that in the D043B system.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1043

8.86.4. Types of Numeric Characters. The use of and definitions for acceptable numeric
characters are as follows:
8.86.4.1. Code 2. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code 2 (by the
computer) when XXR (AFMC Response from XXX Interrogation) response or R file processing
shows a valid relationship exists between the items. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity may assign code 2 with FIS change inputs when the item's current source code is 7.
8.86.4.2. Code 3. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code 3 (by the
computer) when XXR response or R file processing shows a valid relationship exists between the
items. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity may assign code 3 with FIS change inputs
when the item's current source code is 8.
8.86.4.3. Code 4. Items originally established as code 7 are changed to code 4 (by the
computer) when XXR response or R file processing shows no D043B relationship exists between
the items. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity may assign code 4 with FIS change
inputs when the item's current source code is 7.
8.86.4.4. Code 6. This code identifies items that are component parts, next higher assemblies, or
repair kits for one or more of the other stock numbers in the ISG. Code 6 can be assigned by
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity with FIS inputs or under program control from X
file processing.
8.86.4.5. Code 7. This code identifies items grouped by LGRMC processing of FIS inputs as
substitutes or complete interchangeables. Code 7 is temporary; it is changed to an alpha, 2, or 4
when AFMC processes the XXX inquiry, produced when this ISG relationship is made. Items
with incompatible management/controlling indicative data can be used only as substitutes.
8.86.4.6. Code 8. This code identifies items grouped as a result of MILSTRIP status, push due-
in, or receipt processing. Assigned through the SBSS program, code 8 is temporary; it is
changed to an alpha or 3 when AFMC processes the XXX inquiry, produced when this ISG
relationship is made. If AFMC reports an invalid relationship between items, that relationship
will be broken under computer control. Code 8 cannot be assigned.
8.86.4.7. Code 9. This code identifies D043B grouped relationships that are not compatible with
the relationship required for base use. Note: When a relationship is identified as code 9, local
management may find it necessary to assign other item record exception data to the items. For
example, local management may assign the requisition exception (REX), issue exception (IEX),
or excess exception (EEX) code. For specific information on item record exception data.
8.86.4.7.1. Changing an item from interchangeable to substitute. AFMC D043B grouped items
originally identified as master/interchangeables that cannot be used for all other items in the base
level ISG must be changed to substitutes. To make this change, bases must process an FIS input
to change the master/interchangeable to a substitute, and assign ISG source code 9 to the items.
8.86.4.7.1.1. If the noninterchangeable items are in the same subgroup, AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity must forward to HQ AFMC/LGSI detailed correspondence describing any
differences in physical or functional characteristics among the items.
8.86.4.7.1.2. If the noninterchangeable items are in different subgroups, do not forward
correspondence to HQ AFMC/LGSI: LGSI already knows that a fully interchangeable
relationship does not exist between items in different subgroups. (For examples of how the
D043B system groups items, see Para 8.224, examples 3 and 4.)
8.86.4.7.2. Changing an item from master to interchangeable. An item established by the
AFMC D043B ISG Update (program NGV404) as the base level master item can be changed to
an interchangeable. To make this change, the following actions must be taken:
1044                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.86.4.7.2.1. Bases must assign source code 9 to the items and change the relationship to I
(interchangeable).
8.86.4.7.2.2. The program will then select as the new master item the next interchangeable that
does not have an ISG source code of 9 or a numeric parts preference code. You may repeat this
procedure until the desired stock number is established as the master item. Do not forward
correspondence to HQ AFMC/LGSI for this procedure. (For an example of how the computer
selects the master item, see Para 8.224, example 2.)
8.86.5. Characters Assigned to the Parts Preference Code. The purpose of alpha and numeric
characters and how they are assigned to parts preference codes (NPPC) are discussed as follows:
8.86.5.1. An alpha character assigned to a parts preference code indicates the order of preference
among items within a subgroup. Parts preference code Z is assigned to the AFMC master item
by the AFMC D043B ISG Update (program NGV404) processing.
8.86.5.2. A numeric character assigned to a parts preference code identifies items with
restrictive use. The numeric character is assigned to the code by AFMC D043B ISG Update
(program NGV404) processing, SNUD, or FCD processing. NPPCs not only specify why the
item is unsuitable for normal issue and/or use but also identify limitations and alternative uses
for the item.
8.86.6. Types of Numeric Parts Preference Codes. The use of and definitions for acceptable
numeric parts preference codes are as follows:
8.86.6.1. Code 2 (Disposal). This code identifies an inactive disposal item--an item that the
system manager (SM) or item manager (IM) has decided is no longer required or has limited use.
Base items may be issued when they can satisfy a local need. NPPC 2 is normally assigned
during SNUD processing when an N phrase code is entered in position 32 of the input.
8.86.6.2. Code 3 (Condemned). This code identifies an inactive condemned item--an item with
a technical deficiency that has safety-of-flight or other hazardous implications. CAUTION: Do
not issue these items to base activities. Depending on how code 3 is assigned to an item, take the
appropriate action as follows:
8.86.6.2.1. Code 3 assigned by AFMC D043B ISG Update. Items that are assigned code 3 by
AFMC D043B ISG Update (program NGV404) become substitutes in the base level ISG. On
the item record, the demand data field for code 3 items will be blanked after information in the
field is transferred to the demand data field for the group master item. If a master item does not
exist, the demand data will be blanked under computer control.
8.86.6.2.2. Code 3 assigned by other means. When code 3 is assigned to an item by means other
than AFMC D043B ISG Update, the computer changes the item to an interchangeable and
produces a SNUD inquiry to verify the code was assigned. Demand data fields are not blanked
at this point.
8.86.6.3. Code 4 (TCTO). This code identifies items that require time compliance technical
order (TCTO) action. NPPC 4 is assigned only to items that have changed form, fit
(specification of size), or function. Items with these changes must be reidentified and assigned a
new NSN. For instructions to assign a new NSN (see AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4B, Time
Compliance Technical Order). Note: The TCTO flag code is assigned to items that need
modifications for reasons other than having changed in form, fit, or function. Assigning the
TCTO flag will prevent issue of unmodified items. NPPC 4 is not authorized for bench stock
items.
8.86.6.4. Code 5 (Non-published). This code identifies disposal items that can no longer be
provided or supported because the items are old or the IM/SM cannot obtain spare parts for
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1045

them. On-hand items may be used until they are gone or until the cost to repair the code 5 item
meets the requirements for being condemned.
8.86.6.5. Code 9 (Restricted Issue). This code identifies items that are not acceptable for Air
Force use. Depending on how code 9 is assigned to an item, take the appropriate action as
follows:
8.86.6.5.1. Code 9 assigned by AFMC D043B ISG Update. Items that are assigned code 9 by
AFMC D043B ISG Update (program NGV404) become substitutes in the base level ISG. On
the item record, the demand data field for code 9 items will be blanked after information in the
field is transferred to the demand data field for the group master item. If a master item does not
exist, the demand data will be blanked under program control.
8.86.6.5.2. Code 9 assigned by other means. When code 9 is assigned to an item by means other
than AFMC D043B ISG Update, the computer changes the item to an interchangeable and
produces a SNUD inquiry to verify the code was assigned. The demand data field is not blanked
at this point. Note: NPPC 9 is not authorized for bench stock items.
8.86.7. Loading, updating, and processing NPPCs.
8.86.7.1. Loading NPPCs. NPPC codes for unsuitable items identified by base activities are
loaded to item records by Stock Control. To begin this loading action, process an FCD number 2
format (Stock Control Data Change).
8.86.7.1.1. When NPPC 3, 4, or 9 is loaded and the item in the computer contains an IEX code
3, 6, E, or K, Stock Control must process an FCD input to delete the IEX code. If NPPC 4 or 9 is
assigned to a bench stock item, the computer will delete the bench stock and EOQ consumption
data for the NSN.
8.86.7.1.2. When NPPC 2 or 5 is loaded and the item in the database contains IEX 3, 6, E, or K,
do not delete the IEX code and do not assign IEX D.
8.86.7.2. Updating NPPCs. Stock Control must process an FCD input to update the item records
for all system designators. A notice for each record updated is produced by the computer.
8.86.7.3. Processing Output Notices (F110-F111-034). Output notices are processed as outlined
below:
8.86.7.3.1. Inactive disposal and non-published (codes 2 and 5).
8.86.7.3.1.1. When a replacing stock number is assigned to an inactive item, the replacing
number is identified in the input or by the order of use if the inactive stock number is in a D043B
ISG. If necessary, LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must 1) load an item
record for the replacing stock number, and 2) begin action to load the inactive and replacing
stock numbers into an ISG as master and interchangeable. When the items cannot be related as
master/interchangeable, load the items as substitutes; next, transfer the consumption data from
the inactive item to the replacing stock number. Keep the inactive item's assets until they are
worn out or no longer needed.
8.86.7.3.1.2. When a replacing stock number is not available, Stock Control must determine
whether the item should be retained. If a valid requirement exists for the item (levels, in-use,
bench stock, WRM, etc.), the Stock Control function will coordinate with LRS/AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity to submit AF IMT 86 to the applicable IM. If a valid
requirement does not exist, Stock Control must process inputs to dispose of the assets and delete
the item record.
8.86.7.3.2. TCTO (code 4). For procedures to process F111 management notices, see AFMAN
23-122, Sec. 4B, Time Compliance Technical Order.
1046                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.86.7.3.3. Condemned (code 3). Stock Control must notify all elements that maintain assets for
the condemned item (supply point, MRSP, DIFM, bench stock, etc.) to turn in those assets.
Next, begin necessary actions to dispose of all existing stock, and delete the item record. If a
replacing stock number is available, work with Demand Processing to load an item record, when
required; then transfer the demand data to the replacing stock number. Also, provide the
replacing stock number to all activities that maintain assets for the condemned stock number.
8.86.7.3.4. Restricted issue (code 9). When D043B processing (program NGV404) assigns
NPPC 9 to an unsuitable item, the program takes the following actions:
8.86.7.3.4.1. Loads an item record for the replacing stock number, if necessary, and relates the
items in an ISG.
8.86.7.3.4.2. Transfers the demand data from the NPPC 9 item to the replacing stock number.
8.86.7.3.4.3. Changes the NPPC 9 item to a substitute.
8.86.7.3.4.4. Stock Control will review the F110 management notice and report all on-hand
assets as excess to the inventory manager or process them to DLADS.
8.86.7.3.5. Distribution of notices. If the item is managed by Retail Sales (IEX 3, 6, E, or K),
forward a copy of the notice to Retail Sales after processing of the notice is complete.
8.86.8. Examples of ISG Order Codes. Specific examples of ISG order codes are as follows:

Table 8.4. ISG Order Code Examples.

Code          Definition
AC            The alpha source code identifies the item as a J file record in
              subgroup A. The alpha parts preference code C indicates the
              order of preference of the item in the subgroup.
CZ            The alpha source code identifies the item as a J file record in
              subgroup C. The alpha parts preference code Z identifies the item
              as the AFMC master item.
X (blank)     The alpha source code identifies the item as a J file record in sub-
              file X. The blank parts preference code indicates the base did not
              assign a preference for the item's order of use among other items
              in the same subgroup.
B4            The alpha source code identifies the item as a J file record in
              subgroup B. The NPPC 4 identifies the item as being unsuitable
              for normal issue.
7 (blank)     The numeric source code 7 identifies the item as being grouped
              with other items by local AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
              Activity processing of FIS inputs. See X (blank) for definition of
              the blank parts preference code.
2 (blank)     The numeric source code 2 indicates that AFMC SCM-R Records
              Maintenance Activity has, through XXR or R file processing,
              determined that a valid relationship exists. See X blank for
              definition of the blank parts preference code.
4 (blank)     The numeric source code 4 indicates that AFMC SCM-R Records
              Maintenance Activity has, through XXR or R file processing,
              determined that an invalid relationship exists. See X (blank) for
              definition of the blank parts preference code.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1047


8A             The numeric source code 8 identifies the item as being related to
               other items through MILSTRIP status, push due-in, or receipt
               processing. The alpha parts preference code A indicates the item
               is a J file record in subgroup A.
(blank) 3      A blank source code identifies this item as not being in a base
               level ISG. The NPPC 3 indicates restrictive usage/application of
               the item.
9A             The numeric source code 9 indicates that FIS processing has
               identified the item as not being fully interchangeable for base
               application/use. The alpha parts preference code indicates the
               item is a J file record in subgroup A.
(blank)        The blank ISG order code field indicates the item is not in an ISG
               and does not have a restrictive application.


8.87. Establishing Relationships for Local Use.
8.87.1. Purpose of Establishing Local Relationships and Groups. Local relationships and groups
are established to make it easier for bases to use and requisition items.
8.87.2. Submitting Requests to Load New Groups and Items or Delete Stock Numbers. The
using/requiring base organization must submit to Customer Service a written request to load new
groups, load items to existing groups, or delete stock numbers from an ISG. Customer Service
will forward the request to the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity for
approval/disapproval and processing
8.87.2.1. Request requirements. As part of its request, the organization must include a
justification for setting up local relationships and groups or deleting items.
8.87.2.1.1. Justification for setting up local relationships/groups. To show the item or group in
the request is equal to other specified item(s) in application, performance, and durability, the
request must specify the following information: intended use, limitations, technical order data,
physical or functional characteristics, catalog data, etc.
8.87.2.1.2. Justification for deleting items from D043B grouped ISG relationships. To show the
item in the request is incompatible with other items in the same ISG, the request must specify the
following information about that item: limitations, technical order data, differences in physical
or functional characteristics, etc.
8.87.2.2. Requesting items. All requests must be signed by the Operations or Maintenance
Group Commander (or the designated representative) or someone of equal position in non-
maintenance organizations. Depending on the type of item being requested, take the appropriate
action as follows:
8.87.2.2.1. Requesting items that are used by more than one organization. An organization
requesting an item(s) that will be established in a master/ interchangeable relationship and used
by other organizations must first check with the other users before submitting the request. AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or LRS Customer Service personnel will make sure that
all using organizations are in agreement with the request: they will screen the CTH Register for
all organizations having issues/due-outs within the previous six months.
8.87.2.2.2. Requesting administrative supplies/hand-tools. The LRS CC/AO or equivalent may
grant a written waiver for requests to establish local relationships on administrative
supplies/hand-tools--items normally stocked by the Base Service Store/Tool Issue Center.
1048                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.87.3. Actions after Receiving a Written Request. After receiving a written request, LRS
Customer Service must 1) review the request and coordination of the using organizations for
completeness, and 2) research the quarterly SL-ISG to see if a valid relationship exists.
8.87.3.1. If the requested relationship is valid (listed in the SL-ISG), forward the request to
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity to process the FIS inputs necessary to establish
the relationship (see Para 8.222 for FIS format). After processing the FIS input, you may
destroy the written request.
8.87.3.2. If the requested relationship is not valid, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
process the FIS inputs as above. File the written request in stock number or ISG sequence, as
locally desired. You must keep the written request as long as the relationship is effective.
8.87.4. Establishing a New Group. To establish a new group you must, when entering the
information for the first time, leave the ISG number field blank and enter two stock numbers in
positions 8-22 and 31-45 on the FIS input. Depending on the type of relationship you want to
establish, take the appropriate action as follows:
8.87.4.1. Establishing a master and interchangeable relationship. To establish this relationship,
1) enter the master stock number in the first input field (positions 8-22), and 2) enter an
interchangeable in the second input field (positions 31-45).
8.87.4.1.1. Master and interchangeable relationships will not be established under the following
conditions: if the items have incompatible ERRCD (for example, ERRCD coded XD items
cannot be linked with ERRCD coded XB items); items are ERRCD coded XD items; the items
are in different D043B groups; the items contain incompatible management data; or another
using organization does not agree with the requested relationship.
8.87.4.1.2. When a specified relationship cannot be established, take the following actions: 1)
group the items as a substitute, 2) notify the requesting organization of the change, and 3) enter a
7 in the ISG source code (first position) field to specify local use.
8.87.4.2. Establishing a relationship other than master and interchangeable. To establish other
types of relationships, 1) leave the ISG number field blank, 2) enter two stock numbers and their
desired relationships in positions 8-22 and 31-45 on the FIS input, and 3) enter a 6 or 7 in the
ISG source code field, as applicable.
8.87.5. Adding an Item to an Established Group. To add an item to an ISG already established,
you must enter, in an FIS input, the ISG number and stock number(s). Depending on the type of
item you are adding to an ISG, take the appropriate action as follows:
8.87.5.1. Loading a new master. You can load a new master to an established group only if the
input contains an interchangeable in the second input stock number field or the group already
contains at least one master/interchangeable relationship. To be loaded, the new master must
also contain compatible management data. After the new master is loaded, the old master is
changed under computer control to an interchangeable. Note: If the new master item is in a
D043B group, do not load it to a group that contains master/interchangeable relationships in a
different D043B group.
8.87.5.2. Loading a new interchangeable. You must load a new interchangeable to an
established group under the same conditions that apply to loading a new master.
8.87.5.3. Loading a relationship other than master/interchangeable. To load other types of
relationships you must enter, in an FIS input, the ISG number, stock number(s), and relationship
code(s).
8.87.6. Changing Items in an ISG. When processing a change, you must process only one stock
number for each input and leave blank the ISG number field. If no change is required, you may
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1049

change or leave blank the ISG order code or relationship code. Depending on the type of item
you are changing, take the appropriate action as follows:
8.87.6.1. Changing a substitute or interchangeable to a master. You can process FIS inputs to
change the master item of a specific group only when the old and new master do not contain an
alpha character in the ISG source code field; the alpha character indicates the item was grouped
by D043B processing. When the new master is processed, the old master is changed under
computer control to an interchangeable and established in a relationship.
8.87.6.2. Changing a master to an interchangeable or a substitute. If the present master item
contains an alpha character in the source code field, the ISG order code that you enter must
contain a 9 in its source code field, and its parts preference code field must be blank. The
computer will then select as the new master item the next interchangeable that does not have an
ISG source code of 9 or a numeric parts preference code. (For examples of base exceptions to a
D043B established master and D043B related items that are not fully interchangeable, see Para
8.224, examples 2, 3, and 4.)
8.87.6.3. Changing an interchangeable to a C, H, K, or an S relationship. If the present
interchangeable item contains an alpha character in the ISG source code field, the ISG order code
that you enter must contain a 9 in its source code field, and its parts preference code field must
be blank. The change-to relationship field must also contain an S (substitute). If the source code
is not 9, you may change the order and relationship code as required.
8.87.6.4. Changing a C, H, K, or an S to an interchangeable relationship. If the present ISG
source code field contains a 9, the ISG source code that you enter must contain an alpha
character. If the ISG source code does not contain an alpha character, the item you are changing
to an interchangeable will be subject to the same loading conditions as a new interchangeable.
8.87.6.5. Changing relationships among C, H, K, and S items. You may change the
relationships among these items as desired.
8.87.7. Deleting an Item from an ISG. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must
carefully process requests for deleting an item from an ISG to make sure the person requesting
the deletion obtains the desired results. Depending on whether the item has an alpha character or
a 9 in the source code field, take the appropriate action as follows:
8.87.7.1. Deleting items with alpha or 9 ISG source codes. To make sure D043B processing
does not override your deletion of these items, use source code 9 to change the items to a
substitute before deleting them.      Note: You may also delete these items by entering an F in
position 80 of the FIS delete input. This process, however, may not work. ISG inquiries for
AFMC are produced under program control when a D043B grouped item is deleted from a base
level ISG. The D043B system then establishes a valid relationship between the items, and the
cycle of delete and add continues.
8.87.7.2. Deleting items with ISG source codes other than 9. You must delete these items as
follows:
8.87.7.2.1. If you delete an item and only one item remains in the ISG, the last item will be
deleted and the group will be blanked under computer control.
8.87.7.2.2. If you delete a master and only one interchangeable remains in the ISG, the last
interchangeable will be changed to a substitute under program control. If more than one
interchangeable remains, the computer will select as the new master item the next
interchangeable that does not have an ISG source code of 9 or a numeric parts preference code.
8.87.8. Producing and processing an XXX Inquiry for Local Relationships. Follow the
instructions below to produce and process an XXX inquiry:
1050                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.87.8.1. Producing an XXX inquiry. The FIS program will produce an XXX inquiry for each
master, interchangeable, and substitute relationship established for local use. The inquiry
follow-up date will be updated with the current date, and the inquiry follow-up code I will be
stored in the ISG record.
8.87.8.2. Processing an XXX inquiry. For the AFMC computer to process the XXX inquiry, the
basis of relationship code and source of relationship must be contained in the FIS input. These
entries are explained in the FIS input in Para 8.222.
8.87.9. Forwarding Correspondence to HQ AFMC/A4SI. After FIS inputs have been processed
to establish the requested relationship, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must
decide whether to forward correspondence to HQ AFMC/A4SI for action.
8.87.9.1. Forward correspondence to HQ AFMC/A4SI under these conditions:
8.87.9.1.1. D043B groups (other than X file) have incompatible management data, as listed:
8.87.9.1.1.1. Equal unit of issue.
8.87.9.1.1.2. Compatible ERRCD (compatibility edits are waived for equipment items).
8.87.9.1.1.3. Equal munitions reporting codes.
8.87.9.1.1.4. Equal RAMPS report codes.
8.87.9.1.1.5. Equal source of supply.
8.87.9.1.2. Incompatible items are in the same AFMC subgroup. When ISG source code 9 is
used to change or delete relationships in D043B groups, forward detailed correspondence
describing any differences in physical or functional characteristics among the items.
8.87.9.2. Do not forward correspondence to HQ AFMC/A4SI under these conditions:
8.87.9.2.1. Incompatible items are in different AFMC subgroups. HQ AFMC/A4SI already
knows that a fully interchangeable relationship does not exist between items in different
subgroups. (For examples of how D043B groups items, see Para 8.224., examples 2, 3, and 4.)
8.87.9.2.2. Inquiry is made automatically. Automatic inquiry is made when groups are locally
related with ISG source code 7 or assigned by status, push due-ins, or receipts with ISG source
code 8.
8.87.10. Filing and Screening Written Requests. After deciding whether to forward
correspondence to HQ AFMC/A4SI and taking the appropriate action, AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity must file and screen the written requests as follows:
8.87.10.1. Filing written requests. File a copy of the correspondence only if the SL-ISG
indicates the relationship is not valid. The correspondence will be in stock number or ISG
sequence, as locally desired. Keep the correspondence as long as the ISG relationship is
effective.
8.87.10.2. Screening written requests. Quarterly, after receiving the SL-ISG, screen the filed
written requests using the Stock Number Directory (M14/NGV814), ISG Listing
(R02/NGV866), and SL-ISG as follows:
8.87.10.2.1. Screen the correspondence against the Stock Number Directory to determine if all
items are still loaded. If the stock numbers are no longer loaded or if only one stock number is
loaded, the correspondence will be destroyed. Note: If correspondence is valid, continue to.
8.87.10.2.2. Screen the correspondence against the Interchangeable and Substitute Listing to
verify that the requested relationship still exists. If the relationship no longer exists, ask the
person who made the request whether the relationship is still required. If not, destroy the
correspondence. If so, use FIS inputs to reestablish the ISG. Note: If the correspondence is
valid, continue to.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1051

8.87.10.2.3. Screen the correspondence against the current SL-ISG to determine if the requested
relationship is listed in the SL-ISG. If so (the two relationships are the same), destroy the
correspondence. If not, date and return the correspondence to the file.
8.87.11. Security Service Items. Security service items (X in fifth position of stock number)
may be loaded, changed, and deleted above. Interrogation data will not be updated, and no XXX
inquiry will be output.
8.87.12. Processing Procedures for Typewriters. Typewriters require special processing
procedures. They are accounted for with a locally assigned stock number (L in fifth position)
and grouped using the following criteria:
8.87.12.1. Unit cost difference of $100 or less.
8.87.12.2. Carriage length.
8.87.12.3. Standard characteristics (type pitch, keyboard, etc.).
8.87.12.4. Special features (self-correcting, indexing, multi-pitch, etc.). The local stock number
will be linked in the ISG of the authorized prime NSN.
8.88. Processing Organizational Refusals.
8.88.1. Customer Service Activities. After receiving an issue/ due-out release document that has
been marked as an organizational refusal, Customer Service must take the following action:
8.88.1.1. Determine whether the refusal is a result of ISG relationship. If not, destroy the refusal
document. If so, continue to (2).
8.88.1.2. Determine whether the ISG relationship is a result of ISG Update processing (program
NGV404). If not, request AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity process FIS delete
inputs. Use the organizational refusal document as authorization for delete. If the relationship
did result from this processing, contact the organization that refused the item for preparation of
the required documentation. Meanwhile, establish the relationship required to ensure the items
are not issued as interchangeables.
8.89. Base Initiated XXX Interrogations and R02 Follow-Up System.
8.89.1. Anytime an ISG is locally established or tailored in the SBSS, a TRIC XXX
interrogation is forwarded to AFMC in order to validate the local relationship against the D043B
system. The D043B is the primary source of ISG relationship information for the Air Force.
8.89.1.1. A TRIC XXX interrogation is produced for Source Code 7 & 8 items. NGV400, ISG
Record Load/Change/Delete Program generates the initial XXX interrogation. The interrogation
is transmitted through DLATS and ultimately processed against the D043B system. The AFMC
D046, BASE system, will suspense and control the interrogation.
8.89.1.1.1. Source Code 7 items. Items locally established or tailored by processing an FIS
transaction by the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity technician.
8.89.1.1.2. Source Code 8 items. Items grouped as a result of MILSTRIP status, push due-in, or
receipt processing. Assigned through the SBSS program.
8.89.1.1.3. The primary difference between the Source Code 7 and 8 is the 7 is the result of
processing by a technician; where the 8 is the result of an action by the computer. The XXX and
follow-up system processing for these two codes is almost identical.
8.89.2. The Inquiry/Follow-up Code and Date of the ISG record are used to determine whether
follow-up action is required. The technician has visibility of Inquiry/Follow-up Code and Date
information on the R02 listing. Inquiry/Follow-up codes and dates are as follows:
8.89.2.1. Code I - Indicates an initial XXX interrogation was transmitted. The Inquiry/Follow-
up Date is the date the XXX was created.
1052                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.89.2.2. Code E - Indicates a BVS, Interchangeable and Substitute Group Data (D043B
Responses) with action code E was received by the SBSS. This indicates the XXX was received
by D043B; however, no relationship existed, so the interrogation will be forwarded for review by
a HQ AFMC/A4SI ISG technician. The Inquiry/Follow-up Date is the date the BVS was
received.
8.89.2.3. Code F - Indicates the first follow-up was prepared and transmitted. The
Inquiry/Follow-up Date is the date the XXX follow-up was prepared.
8.89.3. The R02/NGV866, Interchangeable and Substitute Program, takes over as the follow-up
mechanism, after the initial XXX interrogation is produced by the NGV400 Program and
transmitted to AFMC.
8.89.3.1. Process the R02/NGV866 program at least every 2 weeks, ensuring the follow-up
interrogation option is requested according to Ch 6.
8.89.3.2. After the initial XXX interrogation is transmitted, and no response received, two
follow-ups will take place. The first is automated, while the second is manual. The manual
follow-up is via a message.
8.89.3.2.1. The first follow-up (automated) is made 15 days or more after Inquiry/Follow-up
code I is entered on the ISG record, or 21 days or more after Inquiry/Follow-up code E is
entered. A XXX interrogation with an F in position 4 will be prepared by the SBSS and
transmitted. At this time, the Inquiry/Follow-up Code will be changed to an F and the
Inquiry/Follow-up Date will be updated to the current Julian date.
8.89.3.2.2. The second follow-up (manual) is made 25 days or more after Inquiry/Follow-up
code F is entered on the ISG record. An Interrogation Follow-up Management Work List is
produced by the R02/NGV866 program, and provides a list containing ISG records that need
manual follow-up action. All stock numbers in the affected group will be listed, even though
only one stock number within the group has source code 7 or 8 assigned. This second follow-up
action requires an offline message be prepared and submitted to HQ AFMC/A4SI, containing
previous follow-up actions and any other pertinent information concerning the interrogation.
Also at this time, process an FIS transaction to de-link the item from the group and remove the
source code 7 or 8.
8.90. AFMC Initiated Responses to XXX Interrogations.
8.90.1. Anytime an ISG is locally established or tailored in the SBSS, and a Source Code 7 or 8
is assigned to an item, a TRIC XXX interrogation is forwarded to AFMC in order to validate the
local relationship against the D043B system. The D043B is the primary source of ISG
relationship information for the Air Force. Whether or not the base initiated XXX interrogation
matches a file in the D043B, a BVS is output and processed as follows:
8.90.1.1. Matches a file. When the base interrogation matches the J file, a BVS image is output
for each item in the group. When the base interrogation matches the R or X file, a single BVS is
output describing the relationship between the items.
8.90.1.2. Does not match a file. A BVS with action code E indicates the base interrogation
doesn’t match a file in the D043B. When a match is not made, the interrogation is forwarded for
review by a HQ AFMC/A4SI ISG technician.
8.90.1.2.1. The HQ AFMC/A4SI ISG technician reviews the specification/technical data for the
input stock numbers, and informs the submitting activity of the findings.
8.90.1.2.2. The HQ AFMC/A4SI ISG technician also prepares inputs to load the information
into the R file. By loading this information into the R file, the next time a base interrogates the
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1053

D043B system for the same stock numbers, an automatic reply (BVS, R file) will be sent to the
base.
8.90.2. HQ AFMC/A4SI replies to the base initiated XXX interrogations with XXR responses
through ADRSS. In special cases, the technician sends the replies by letter to the bases. The
computer will process HQ AFMC/A4SI replies as follows:
8.90.2.1. Response codes A, B, C, D, E, and F. When the two stock numbers identified in the
input are in the same ISG, the present relationship is maintained, and the ISG Source Code is
changed to 2 or 3, as applicable. If the Source Code is 7, it will be changed to 2; if the Source
Code is 8, it will be changed to 3. When the two stock numbers are not related in the same ISG,
an F023 management notice is produced, and bases must consider the reply code and item record
data to determine the appropriate relationship. Note: The F023 management notice is produced
only on response codes B, E, or F. Inputs with response codes A, C, or D will be ignored if they
are not in the same ISG.
8.90.2.2. Response codes G and H. When both stock numbers have a D043B ISG source or the
items are not in the same ISG, the input is ignored. When the ISG record contains items other
than the input stock number, an F023 management notice is produced. Under any other
condition, the ISG source code is changed to 6 and the relationship codes are changed to C or H,
as applicable.
8.90.2.3. Response code I. When the input stock numbers are in the same ISG and their current
ISG Source Code is 7, the ISG Source Code is changed to 4, the relationship is changed to
substitute, and an F021 management notice is produced. When the input stock numbers are in
the same ISG and their current Source Code is 8, the items are deleted from the ISG. Under any
other condition, the input is ignored.
8.90.2.4. Response code J. Processing is the same as for code A above. EXCEPTION: An
F023 management notice will not be produced when the two stock numbers in the same ISG are
not related.
8.90.2.5. Response codes K and L. An F020 management notice is produced for the invalid
stock number.
8.90.2.6. Response codes M and N. The ISG Source Code is changed to 2 or 3 as applicable,
and a BDFA is produced for the replaced stock number.
8.90.2.7. Response code O. The XXX interrogation is resubmitted if the stock numbers have
not been grouped by D043B processing. This response indicates the item interrogated is part of
a D043B established group and BVS(J) images will be transmitted to the base. The SBSS will
continue to send an XXX image until the BVS(J) images are received and the group successfully
updated.
8.90.2.8. Response code P. When required, an item record is loaded for the replacing stock
number, and the item is related to an ISG that has the replacing stock number as the master.
8.90.2.9. Response code Q. An F022 management notice is produced.
8.90.3. Processing Output Management Notices. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity Element will process management notices from XXR processing or X and R file
processing to make sure the items are correctly related. After the relationship has been verified
(based on the management notices), FIS inputs should be processed, if necessary. Processing
FIS inputs will ensure ISG Source Codes 7 or 8 are removed and the appropriate code assigned.
8.91. Processing the D043B Update Program (NGV404).
8.91.1. Preparing and Processing Interchangeable and Substitute Relationships. Interchangeable
and substitute relationships are prepared and processed as follows:
1054                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.91.1.1. Interchangeable and substitute relationships are prepared by the ISG activity of the AF
Cataloging and Standardization Office, Battle Creek, MI, and at the Air Logistics Center (ALC).
8.91.1.2. Interchangeable and substitute relationships are input into the AFMC D043B system
every week. A BDS is output from this processing The BDS is distributed through the SNUD
D071 system to all bases registered as users of one or more of the stock numbers in the affected
group.
8.91.2. Processing BDF Adds. The SBSS produces a BDF add for each new item record loaded
with a NSN. This BDF add is input into the AFMC D071 system to register the base as a user of
the stock number. The D043B system is inquired to provide bases AFMC ISG data. If the input
stock number is in a D043B ISG, a BVS is produced for each number in the group
8.91.3. Processing XXX Inquiries. XXX inquiries are sent to AFMC through DLATS for
processing by the D043B systems. When the base inquiry matches the file, BVS outputs are
created for each stock number in the matching group. When the base inquiry matches the R or X
file, a single BVS is output providing the relationship between the two requested items.
8.91.4. Processing BVS/BDS Inputs. Program NGV404 will be processed as received, or at
least weekly, using the SNUD-FOR-ISG SIFS data file. Follow the processing procedures
outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3.
8.91.4.1. Process X and R file relationships and input BVS inputs with action code E as follows:
8.91.4.1.1. Process X file relationships and delete D043B grouped items, as required. Process R
file inquiries exactly the same as for an XXR.
8.91.4.1.2. Input BVS inputs with action code E. Enter the current Julian date in the
inquiry/follow-up date field of the ISG record, and change the inquiry/follow-up code to E.
8.91.4.2. Z is entered, under computer control, in the parts preference code field of the D043B
master item input. All remaining inputs are then sorted into D043B master item sequence.
8.91.4.3. An item record is loaded, under computer control, when an item record is not in the
SBSS computer for the D043B master stock number. Item records are loaded under these
conditions: 1) if records are set up for one or more of the interchangeables, or 2) the D043B
group consists of items that are ERRCD coded XD or XF, or unsuitable for normal issue
(numeric parts preference codes). When a new item record is being loaded and the stock number
is loaded in another system designator the price data from its 022-Cost-Record will be used. If
the stock number is not loaded the standard price will be used to populate the 022-Cost-Record
and a ‘P’ freeze code will be assigned to the item record and a BDFA (SNUD REGISTRATION)
will be created. This BDF add is input into the AFMC D071 system to register the base as a user
of the stock number.
8.91.4.4. Order codes are updated, under computer control, on item records with the input data.
CAUTION: Do not override local exceptions--9 in the source code field (first character)--unless
the group is being completely rearranged.
8.91.4.5. Change a master or an interchangeable item record to a substitute when the master or
interchangeable is the only item record loaded for the stock numbers in a D043B grouping, and
the following conditions apply to the item: the item is 1) ERRCD coded XD or XF, or 2) in a
base level group with another D043B grouped item.
8.91.4.6. Load or change the base level ISG when two or more item records are loaded for the
stock numbers in a D043B ISG. Under any other conditions, take the appropriate action as
follows:
8.91.4.6.1. If none of base level ISG, load a new group for the input item (see Para 8.224,
example 1). These items normally are grouped as master/interchangeable relationships.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1055

However, the items will be related as substitutes if management data for the selected master item
differ from the following management data:
8.91.4.6.1.1. Unit of issue.
8.91.4.6.1.2. ERRCD (compatibility edits are waived for equipment items).
8.91.4.6.1.3. Munitions reporting codes.
8.91.4.6.1.4. RAMPS report codes.
8.91.4.6.1.5. RIC.
8.91.4.6.2. If the D043B stock numbers are loaded in several base level ISGs, delete the input
stock numbers and then reload them into a new ISG (see Para 8.224, example 5). The stock
numbers remaining in the old ISGs will be reloaded to the new ISG if they are compatible and
not already in a D043B group.
8.91.4.6.3. If all stock numbers are loaded to the same base level ISG, the relationship and order
codes will be validated and updated, when needed.
8.91.4.6.4. If some D043B grouped stock numbers are loaded to the same base level ISG and
some are not, the ungrouped stock numbers will be loaded under computer control to the ISG.
Relationships and order codes will be validated and updated under computer control, when
needed.
8.91.4.7. Numeric parts preference codes (NPPC) 3 and 9 are processed by the AFMC D043B
ISG Update (program NGV404) as follows:
8.91.4.7.1. If the NPPC 3 or 9 item is loaded as an interchangeable item, the computer transfers
the demand data from the NPPC 3 or 9 item to the master item in the same ISG, and then blanks
the demand data on the NPPC 3 or 9 item. The computer adds data in 1 and 2 below to the
master item; data in 3-5 are transferred from the NPPC 3 or 9 item to the master item:
8.91.4.7.1.1. Number of demands.
8.91.4.7.1.2. Number of cumulative recurring demands.
8.91.4.7.1.3. Date of first demand (DOFD).
8.91.4.7.1.4. Date of last demand (DOLD).
8.91.4.7.1.5. Stockage priority codes (SPC) are assigned to ERRCD XB3 items as follows:
8.91.4.7.1.5.1. If both items contain a numeric SPC, the lowest SPC is assigned. For example, if
an NPPC 3 or 9 item has an SPC 2 and the master item has an SPC 4, then SPC 2 is assigned.
8.91.4.7.1.5.2. If the master contains an alpha SPC, the SPC is not changed.
8.91.4.7.1.5.3. If an NPPC 3 or 9 item contains an alpha SPC and the number contains a numeric
SPC, an F18 management notice is produced under computer control. The master SPC is not
changed.
8.91.4.7.2. If the NPPC 3 or 9 item is already loaded to the base level ISG as a substitute item,
the computer will blank its demand data. The group relationship is not changed.
8.91.4.8. After the processing above is complete, the computer produces a list of the updated
base level ISG records. The records listed will be as specified by the input parameter, prepared
by AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity, in Ch 5 of this manual.
8.92. D043B X File Processing.
8.92.1. Purpose of X File Processing. Base level processing of X File relationship is necessary
because items in the X file are not fully interchangeable (they do not appear in the D043B master
file). ISG loads performed by this processing--loading new groups or adding an item to an
existing group--relate the items based on input relationship codes as a substitute, component part,
or next higher assembly. Note: If the relationship is currently master/interchangeable and
SBSS processing indicates a valid response, the relationship is not changed.
1056                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.92.2. Processing an ISG File Reference List. The AFMC D043B Update (program NGV404)
completes most steps for base level processing. ISG source code X file processing is the source
for this ISG relationship. Note: Component parts and next higher assemblies retain source
code 6.) When base level processing requires AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
personnel to make a decision (processing is external, management notices are output for research
action. If the AFMC D043B Update does not update the ISG record, the computer will list the
ISG files for review. The computer takes the following steps to produce this reference list:
8.92.2.1. Attempts an automatic load, based on relationship codes I, S, L, or N. Items with
codes I, S, or L are loaded as a substitute. Items with code N are loaded as next higher assembly
or component parts. An F023 management notice is output under the following conditions:
8.92.2.1.1. When items with relationship code L are loaded, an F023 management notice is
output. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel must check items on the F023
management notice against the ML-C to assure similarity. These items may also be checked
with the using organizations for possible master/interchangeable use. Once verified,
relationships are established by AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel.
Note: Items that are not usable may be left as substitutes with source code X, or you may
change the source code to 9.
8.92.2.1.2. When the items are currently in different base level ISGs, an automatic load is not
attempted. When the current source code is not alpha, 6, or 9, ISG source codes are updated and
an F023 management notice is output. Note: When items are in different ISGs, AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity personnel must determine the correct grouping and process FIS
inputs. (They may have to check with the using organization to make this decision.)
8.92.2.2. Attempts an automatic deletion on items in the same ISG that have a relationship code
of U or M. Note: An automatic delete is not attempted if the item record ISG source code is 9
or alpha. Under this condition, an F021 management notice is output. When the items are not in
an ISG or are in different ISGs, the computer takes the following actions:
8.92.2.2.1. When the items are not in an ISG and the relationship code is U or M, no action is
taken.
8.92.2.2.2. When the items are in different ISGs and the relationship code is U or M, the ISG
source codes are changed to X if they are currently numeric and other than 6 or 9.
8.92.2.3. Changes ISG source codes to X when items currently related in the same base level
ISG have a relationship code of I, S, or L. Under this condition, a management notice is output.
Note: If the relationship code is N, the items will be changed to next higher
assembly/component parts. (If the current source code is alpha, 6, or 9, no update will occur.)
8.92.3. Definitions and Examples of X File Codes. Definitions and examples of ISG
relationship codes and incompatibility codes are as follow:
8.92.3.1. ISG relationship codes appear in position 7 of BDS/BVS for X file processing only.
This code shows the type of relationship between the stock number in positions 8-22 and the
related stock number in positions 33-47. ISG relationship codes are as follows:

Table 8.5. ISG Relationship Codes.

Code      Relationship
I         Interchangeable
S         Suitable Substitute
L         Suitable Limited
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                  1057


U         Unusable Item
N         Next Higher Assembly
M         No Known Relationship


8.92.3.2. ISG incompatibility codes appear in position 26 of BVS/BDS for X file processing
only. This code indicates why the item is not in the J file (fully compatible file). ISG
incompatibility codes are as follows:

Table 8.6. ISG Incompatibility Codes.

Code         Incompatible Condition
1            Federal Supply Class (FSC)
2            Materiel Management Code (MMAC)
3            Source of Supply (SOS)
4            Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Cost Designator
             (ERRCD)
5            Unit of Issue (U/I)
6            AF is not a registered user on the related item (positions 8-22)
             (NOTE)
7            Pilferage Code
8            Security Classification
9            Local Purchase
A            Acquisition Advice Code
B            AF has no CMD on related item (positions 33-47) (NOTE)
C            AF is not a registered user on either item (NOTE)
M            No Known Relationship
N            Next Higher Assembly
P            Consolidate with, Transfer to, Cancel - Duplicate
R            Does not meet DoD I&S MOE rule assignment criteria
Note: The AFMC ISG technician systematically reviews ISG relationships in
the X file to determine the currency of exceptions that prevent items from
being grouped. In many cases, items cannot be ISG grouped because the AF
has not been registered as a user of the items. Aware of these cases, the ISG
technician will take steps, if appropriate, to register the AF as a user in the
CMD. CAUTION: Do not take steps to register less than preferred items. For
example, item standardization code 3 and E, and items previously removed
from ISGs, are generally not appropriate. Submitting AF IMT 86 to request
the adoption of such items is therefore discouraged.


8.93. Processing Program NGV403 Base Level ISG Cleanup.
8.93.1. Purpose of Processing Program NGV403. Program NGV403 provides a rapid, automatic
method of cleaning up ISG and item records. The program gives notice of error conditions and
1058                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

an uncoded phrase indicating what action has been taken under computer control. The program
also resequences and packs the ISG records to make room for more records.
8.93.2. Program NGV403 Processing Schedule. Program NGV403 is processed ten days before
the R02/NGV866, Interchangeable and Substitute Listing; AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity and Computer Operation must have enough time to correct any ISG errors discovered
during processing. Processing should also be considered whenever a large volume of reject
notices 736 or 745 are received during inline processing.
8.93.3. Reestablishing ISGs under Computer Control. Use the error listing and BVAC10 output
from this process to reestablish any required ISGs as follows:
8.93.3.1. ISG relationships that were locally established (source code 7) must be reestablished
using FIS inputs.
8.93.3.2. Relationships originally established by the AFMC D043B System require no base
action. These groups are reestablished as a result of AFMC response to the BVAC10 output by
program NGV403.
8.93.4. Reestablishing ISGs Manually. An ISG record that has an invalid database key is the
only condition that cannot be corrected under computer control. AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity must work with Computer Operations to reestablish this ISG record.
8.94. Application of an ISG by Other SBSS Processing.
8.94.1. Uses for ISG Systems. Many internal program decisions are made based on the
information contained in the ISG record. It is therefore necessary that personnel maintaining the
ISG be thoroughly familiar with the ISG systems and their uses.
8.94.2. Requirements. SBSS processing accumulates item and usage data from master and
interchangeable grouped items. Requisitioning programs base the decision to requisition on the
asset position of the accumulation of data. Adjusted stock levels assigned to any M or I coded
items in the same group apply equally to all other master/interchangeables. Relationships other
than M or I are considered single items and are requisitioned individually.
8.94.3. Requisitioning Stock. Requisitions for stock are submitted for the master stock number
(coded M). Requisition exception codes placed on M or I grouped items apply only to
requisitions submitted for that stock number.
8.94.4. Issues. If a requested master or interchangeable item is not available, the ISG record will
be read (under computer control). SBSS processing will attempt to issue the requested item as
follows:
8.94.4.1. Checking master/interchangeable stock numbers. Starting with the master stock
number, the computer attempts to fill the request from items recorded on
master/interchangeables that do not have a numeric parts preference code 3, 4, or 9.
8.94.4.2. Checking substitute stock numbers. After checking the master and interchangeables in
a group, the computer determines whether items are available on substitute stock numbers that
have a unit of issue different from the requested item (the unit of issue can be converted through
the conversion record). If available, the item will be issued. If the item is not available, another
asset notice is produced on interchangeables with numeric parts preference codes 3, 4, or 9, and
other relationship coded S, C, H, or K items.
8.94.5. Redistribution Orders (RDO). For procedures on how the computer produces
redistribution orders, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
8.94.6. DIFM Turn-In. When processing a DIFM turn-in with a stock number different from the
stock number for the DIFM detail record, both stock numbers must be in the same base level
ISG. If the stock numbers are in different ISGs, the input must be coded to bypass this edit.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1059

8.94.7. Due-Out Release. When determining items available for automatic due-out release
action, the computer examines the master and any interchangeable not coded with a parts
preference code of 3, 4, or 9.
8.94.8. Functional Check Flag. The functional check flag is assigned under program control (by
system designator) to all master or interchangeable items within a group. A load or change to a
master or interchangeable item causes the computer to check the master item and all
interchangeable items (by system designator). If any items in this group have a functional check
flag, the computer will attempt to load the functional check flag to the master and all
interchangeable items. Note: This attempted load does not include substitute items, kits, etc.
8.95. Processing F126 Management Notices.
8.95.1. Producing F126 Management Notices. This notice is produced when an item has been
deleted from a base level ISG, and a WRM, MRSP, MSK, or authorized/in-use detail record still
exists. These conditions are caused by two processes: 1) when a response from AFMC indicates
that items currently in a base level ISG are not compatible, the items are removed from the ISG,
and 2) when ISG delete inputs are processed to remove items from base level ISGs.
8.95.2. Purpose of F126 Management Notices. This notice alerts AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity that a WRM, MRSP, MSK, or authorized/in-use detail record for the item
being deleted from the ISG is still in the computer. The F126 management notice lists each of
these details on a single DD Form 1348-1A. Also, an inquiry showing all details for the stock
number is provided for review to determine whether any of the details need a change in
authorization.
8.95.3. Inquiry Document. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel will pull a
copy of the F126 management notice and file for control use. AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity will forward the other copies to the various elements--based on the activity
code of the document numbers printed. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will
determine if a valid prime/substitute relationship still exists and take appropriate action.
8.95.3.1. Valid relationship. Notify Record Maintenance that no action is required.
8.95.3.2. Invalid relationship.
8.95.3.2.1. Work with Records Maintenance to prepare the inputs required to delete the current
prime/substitute relationship. (You may need to process turn-ins, delete, and load inputs.)
8.95.3.2.2. Work with Requisitioning to make sure due-ins and due-outs are canceled, if
required.
8.95.3.2.3. Prepare inputs to establish due-out and due-in detail records under the proper stock
number.
8.95.3.2.4. Notify Records Maintenance that all actions have been completed.
8.95.4. Follow-up Action. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will take follow-
up action when these actions have not been completed within seven days.
8.96. Reconciliation of ISG items.
8.96.1. Tracking during reconciliation. During the annual SNUD reconciliation, there is a
method to track ISG items in order to ensure successful reconciliation. This process establishes a
baseline of all items being reconciled, identifies items that have successfully reconciled, and
differentiates between those that haven’t so research and follow-up action can be taken.
8.96.1.1. Reconciliation baseline. The current computer date will be assigned to the 105 ISG-
RECORD when the annual reconciliation is processed and reconciliation images (BDFR) are
created. This date will be reflected on the R02 in a column labeled “RECON DATE”. A date in
this column indicates a BDFR image was created for SNUD processing and is the date it was
1060                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

created. No date in this column indicates a BDFR image wasn’t created and warrants research to
determine why not, and then, corrective action.
8.96.1.2. Items that have reconciled. The phrase “RECNCLD” (short for reconciled) will
overwrite the computer date on the 105 ISG-RECORD, and also be reflected on the R02, as a
result of successfully processing the BVS/BDS images received from SNUD. In addition to the
images received, the BVS/BDS images received throughout the year will also update the field
with the phrase “RECNCLD”, if not already reflected. The only reconciliation image
(BVS/BDS) that won’t update this field is the BVS with “E” in position 80, since this is the only
BVS image that when successfully processed doesn’t indicate a successful reconciliation. Note:
The “RECNCLD” statement indicates the group has been reconciled with the AF Catalog
(D043). Items in the group still possessing a local source code (i.e. 7 & 8) after reconciling with
D043, require normal tracking and follow-up via the XXX Interrogation/R02 Follow-up system
mentioned within this section.
8.96.1.3. Items that have not reconciled. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
technicians will research and follow-up on items that don’t reflect “RECNCLD” on the R02 once
the annual reconciliation data from SNUD has been received and processed. Part of the follow-
up action may include 1SQ interrogations.
8.96.1.4. Before the next reconciliation. The field on the 105 ISG-RECORD will be blanked
immediately prior to processing the next annual reconciliation, subsequently if an R02 was
immediately processed it too would reflect blanks in the “RECON DATE” field. This cleans the
slate and prepares for the upcoming reconciliation.

Section 8J--Description of Freeze Codes

8.97. Freeze Codes. This section explains how freeze codes are used to freeze an item record
and then to clear the freeze status to allow for further processing. These procedures are useful
for loading data on item records in preparation for inventory. Freeze codes are also used to show
the reason an item record was frozen and the function responsible for freezing the record. Only
authorized personnel can freeze and delete freeze codes. Freezing an item record will stop
computer processing of specific transactions and related actions. Note: This chapter explains
the input and output restrictions and their format.
8.97.1. Management of Freeze Codes. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or LRS
/Materiel Management Activity personnel assign freeze codes to item records in order to identify
the reason for freezing the item record and the responsible activity. Personnel using an FFC
input request to ADD or DELETE freeze codes A, D, E, L, Q, R, and S. EXCEPTION: To
load/delete the freeze code N from NWRM item records, contact the NWRM Transaction
Control Cell (NTCC) or the AFSPC LSC. Para 8.226, NWRM Freeze Code Load or Delete
(1FC) will be utilized to load/delete the N freeze code. Note: LRS /Materiel Management
Activity personnel at a satellite can assign freeze codes only to records of that satellite system
designator.
8.97.2. Loading. The loading of these freeze codes follows these rules: 1) Load freeze codes by
using an FFC input with action code L (see Para 8.225 for format); 2) only ONE freeze code
may be assigned to an item record (when an item record has already been frozen, the computer
will reject a second code assignment); and 3) load freeze codes using the FFC input except codes
C, I, and P.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1061

8.97.3. Deleting. The deletion of freeze codes conforms to these rules: Delete freeze codes by
using an FFC input with action code D. The exceptions are freeze codes C, I, and P. C and I
may be deleted for type stock record account P records. (See Para 8.225 for input format and
Para 8.227 for output format.)
8.97.4. Assignment of Freeze Codes. Freeze codes are assigned and managed as follows: Note:
The activity responsible for assigning the freeze codes will maintain a suspense file for each FFC
load output suspense notice.)
8.97.4.1. Code A. The Record Maintenance is responsible for freeze code A. This code is
assigned to personnel who do not have an authorized freeze code. Record Maintenance is also
responsible for maintaining the suspense notice file.
8.97.4.2. Code C. Inventory is responsible for the use and control of freeze code C. Freeze code
C designates items under a complete inventory. The Fuels Management Flight may delete this
code by using an FFC input when the stock record account code is P. Inventory is also
responsible for maintaining the suspense notices.
8.97.4.3. Code D. The Base Service Store assigns this code to items with an issue exception
code 3 or 6. This code is loaded by processing program S06 or an FFC input. This code is
deleted by processing a BIR input with a D in position 52 or by processing an FFC input. The
Base Service Store is also responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file.
8.97.4.4. Code E. Equipment Management assigns this code and is also responsible for
maintaining the suspense notices file.
8.97.4.5. Code I. Two sections, Inventory and the Storage and Issue, assign this code for special
inventory. Inline programs also assign this code when insufficient balances require a special
inventory or when a corrected input is required. Note: An FFC input for type stock record
account codes B, E, and K cannot load or delete this freeze code. Inventory is responsible for
maintaining the suspense notices file.
8.97.4.6. Code L. Computer Operations assigns this code when either a database key or set error
is detected. When Computer Operations Personnel notice an error, the Computer Operation
operator must check the condition and correct the error. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity is available for help. See 798 and 799 reject notices in Ch 7. Computer
Operations is also responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file.
8.97.4.7. Code N. NTCC assigns this code when the NWRM Indicator equals ‘Q’. Notes: 1.
Loading/Deleting of this freeze code is accomplished using Para 8.226, NWRM Freeze Code
Load or Delete (1FC). 2. For all NWRM Equipment related transactions that were processed
thru AFEMS, but received 296 Reject, the NWRM freeze code will need to be removed and then
re-processed in SBSS.
8.97.4.8. Code P. Program Control loads and deletes this code. It cannot be loaded or deleted
with an FFC input. Programs assign this code when a unit of price change is processed for an
item with an IEX 3 or 6. Programs delete this code when a BIR input is processed with a P in
position 52. The Base Service Store is responsible for maintaining suspense notices file.
Programs also assign a P freeze code to the item record for budget code 8 items which are locally
assigned. This freeze code will be removed by processing TRIC MSD (Price List Change Input).
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for maintaining suspense notice
file.
8.97.4.9. Code Q. This code is assigned to items requiring reverse-post action. Document
Control is responsible for maintaining the suspense notice file.
1062                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.97.4.10. Code R. Record Maintenance uses this code to freeze item records that may require
correction or deletion of indicative data when extended research or checking is required. Record
Maintenance is also responsible for maintaining the suspense notices file.
8.97.4.11. Code S. The Stock Control assigns this code and is responsible for maintaining the
suspense notices file.
8.98. Control of Frozen Records.
8.98.1. Management of Notices. A suspense notice of all FFC load or delete actions will be
output on the input function of the activity responsible for the freeze code. In addition, an input
processed notice will be produced on the Computer Operations/main system and will be sent to
the activity responsible for the freeze code. The responsible activity will maintain one copy of
each FFC load output suspense notice (or frozen record notice, TRIC FFC) in a suspense file in
stock number sequence.
8.98.2. Filing of Rejected Inputs. Inputs rejected because the item record is frozen (except
freeze codes C and I) will be placed behind the FFC load output suspense notice/frozen record
notice in the suspense file.
8.98.3. Release of Frozen Records. The activity assigned the freeze code is responsible for
prompt clearance of freeze codes. If item records are frozen more than three working days, a
justified reason for the delay must be written on the suspense notice.
8.98.4. Release of Freeze Codes C, D, I, and P. Inventory is responsible for the timely release of
item records with freeze codes C and I. The retail sales outlets are responsible for the timely
release of item records with freeze codes D and P. Note: One exception is type stock record
account code P (fuels). The Fuels Management Flight is responsible for this code when the type
stock record account is P.
8.98.5. Suspense Delete Notice. When an FFC output suspense delete notice is received, the
matching FFC suspense load notice/frozen record notice and any rejected documents will be
removed from the suspense file and reinput.
8.98.6. Processing a Reverse-Post Input. When a reverse-post input is processed and the item
record contains a freeze code of Q, an I105 management notice is produced. This notice will be
screened against the frozen record suspense file. Any documents in this file that match the stock
number on the notice will be selected and processed. Note: If the freeze load notice in the file
reflects a later date and time than the one shown on the I105 management notice, that I105 must
be destroyed.
8.99. Reject Conditions.
8.99.1. If the following conditions are not met, the FFC input will reject:
8.99.2. Item Record Not Loaded. The item record for this stock number and system designator
must be loaded (FFC load or delete).
8.99.3. System Designator for Satellite Terminal. Input from a satellite terminal must have a
system designator in positions 23-24 equal to the system designator assigned to that satellite
account (FFC load or delete).
8.99.4. Item Record Freeze Code Field. The freeze code field in the item record being frozen
must be blank (FFC load).
8.99.5. Item Record Freeze Code Field. The freeze code field in the item record being released
must be equal to the input freeze code (FFC delete).
8.99.6. Authorized Freeze Code for Loading and Deleting. The input freeze code must be A, D,
E, L, Q, R, or S (FFC load or delete). However, for type stock record account code P item
records, it may be C.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1063

8.99.7. Input Action Code. The input action code must be D for delete and L for load on all
FFC inputs.
8.99.8. Input TRIC. The input TRIC must be FFC.
8.100. Frozen Record Notice.
8.100.1. Daily Frozen Record List. Frozen record listing will be produced daily using a locally
developed program.
8.100.2. Suspense Filing of FFC Documents. FFC documents will be placed in the suspense
file. When filed, the matching FFC output Records Maintenance suspense load notice may be
destroyed.
8.100.3. Notification for Prompt Clearance. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity
will notify each section responsible for frozen item records of the records needing prompt
clearance. The frozen record notices will be either listed or duplicated and forwarded to the
appropriate section.

Section 8K--Controlled Items Codes

8.101. Overview.
8.101.1. Section Summary. This section provides details on the handling of item records.
Controlled items are discussed, along with the codes that indicate whether there is to be a degree
of security handling and the type of security handling required.
8.101.2. Definition. Controlled items are items that are assigned the categories of classified,
sensitive, or pilferable. They require different kinds of handling for security purposes. The
controlled item code is a one-position alpha/numeric code used to indicate the degree of security
handling needed for a given item. See DoD 4100.39-M for complete list and Controlled
Inventory Item Code definitions.
8.102. Stock Numbers. The stock numbers of controlled items are listed in the Stock Number
User Directory (SNUD) DO71 and the Master Item Identification Control (MIIC). They are also
published in the USAF Federal Supply Catalog. All NSNs (excluding FSG 65 and 89),
noncataloged (NC) numbers, nonsignificant (ND) numbers, and kit (K) stock numbers are
included in the SNUD.
8.103. Aspects of Processing.
8.103.1. Responsibility. Research assigns the controlled item code when the item record is first
loaded. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity or Inspection is responsible for all
subsequent actions. It is the responsibility of LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity to ensure that all controlled item phrase codes are loaded.
8.103.2. Suspected Discrepancies. When you suspect that a coding is incorrect, you should
assign the code requiring a higher degree of security handling. If the item is included in SNUD,
you can submit an inquiry to SNUD (BVA output). SNUD will submit current stock control data
via SNUD BV4 format. If you are still unsure of the coding, the personnel responsible for
cataloging the item should be contacted. SNUD inquiries are always submitted under the FB
account of the computer support base.
8.103.3. Local Upgrading. Local managers, at their discretion, can upgrade items coded through
SNUD as unclassified, nonsensitive, or nonpilferable to pilferable status. Such items will be
assigned controlled item code asterisk (*). An (*) can be assigned only to item records having an
existing code of U and will not be changed through SNUD interface. To upgrade, enter the
desired system designator in positions 23-24 of the input TRIC 1SC. If the originator wants to
1064                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

change only one system designator from (*) to U, the same logic applies. Blanks in this field
will load all system designators with input CIC. Input of any CIC code other than U or (*) will
override the system designator option, and all records will be changed to the input CIC.
8.104. Controlled Item Code Change and Upgrade.
8.104.1. Changing Codes. Controlled item codes are first assigned by item record load (FIL)
inputs. They are changed by input of TRIC 1SC. (Para 8.228 contains the input format.)
8.104.2. Updating Records. When a controlled item code change is made, all item records are
changed with the input stock number except when an item is changed with a CIC U or (*). The
input must be on the basic stock number. The overflow (-9) and supplemental (-1,-2) adjunct
records will be changed automatically.
8.104.3. IEX Code N. When issue exception code N appears in the item record, it will signify
that all controlled item codes are authorized on bench stock items. If you change the controlled
item code to U, I, Y, or Z, the issue exception code is blanked on the item record.
8.104.4. Controlled Item Codes.
8.104.4.1. Code X. Controlled item code X is authorized on bench stock items.
8.104.4.2. Codes I, U, Y, Z, and (*). These controlled item codes are authorized on bench stock.
Code J items that fall into the categories covered by controlled item codes I, Y, and Z are also
authorized on bench stock.
8.104.4.3. Code Changes for Bench Stock Items. When an item has a CIC that authorizes it for
bench stock, and the CIC is changed to a CIC that does not authorize it for bench stock, all
master bench stock detail and EOQ (economic order quantity) consumption records will be
deleted by program control.
8.104.5. Controlled Item Code Upgrade. When controlled item codes are upgraded and the item
has a serviceable balance/warehouse location, the item record will be frozen automatically with
an I and placed under special inventory procedures.
8.105. Printed Output for Warehouse Changes and Upgrading.
8.105.1. Changing a control item code will cause the computer to output these documents:
8.105.2. Item Record with Serviceable Balance and/or Warehouse Location. When an item
record has a serviceable balance and/or warehouse location, a warehouse change notice is
produced. (See Para 8.229 for format.) This document is processed by Storage and Issue.
8.105.3. Upgrading of Controlled Item Code.
8.105.3.1. Controlled Item Code Changes.
8.105.3.2. When the controlled item code is upgraded (for example, from unclassified to
classified, or from pilferable to sensitive), inventory count information will be output on firm
DIFM detail records and a memo DIFM notice will be printed on memo DIFM detail records.
8.105.3.3. Inventory Count Information. The inventory count information will be forwarded to
and processed by Inventory.
8.105.3.4. Memo DIFM Notice. The memo DIFM notice (see Para 8.230) will be processed by
Repair Cycle Support personnel. They will also coordinate with Maintenance Materiel Control
to ensure that all memo DIFM items are properly identified and controlled. One copy of the
notice will be filed by the Reparable Processing Center with the due-out notice.
8.106. Output for Warehouse Change Notices and Inventory. A document control image
(DCC) will be output when a warehouse change notice is produced. This output is suspended in
Document Control until all actions are completed on the notice by the Storage and Issue.
8.107. Edit/Reject Conditions.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1065

8.107.1. In the listing below, the rejects are itemized by number, and the circumstances that
cause them to be output are given:
8.107.2. Reject 022. 1) If the item record has an issue exception code of 3 or K and the
controlled item code is other than U or M; or 2) if the item record has an issue exception code of
6 or E and a controlled item code other than J, U, V, or (*).
8.107.3. Reject 056. If the input stock number is for an overflow adjunct (-9) or supplemental
adjunct (-1, -2) record.
8.107.4. Reject 159. 1) When the input change-to code is blank or equal to the controlled item
code on the item record; or 2) when an attempt is made to load CIC (*) and the item record CIC
is not U.
8.107.5. Reject 179. If input is not done through the LGRMC or the Computer Operations/main
system.
8.107.6. Reject 190. When the input stock number is blank.
8.107.7. Reject 200. When the input change-to CIC is an invalid code.
8.107.8. Reject 295. When an item record for the input stock number cannot be located.
8.107.9. Reject 296. When an item record is frozen due to database key or set errors (type
freeze code L). Note: See Ch 7 for further definition and corrective actions on each individual
reject.

Section 8L--Transportation Data

8.108. Overview.
8.108.1. Section Summary. This section discusses the loading, changing, and deleting of
transportation data. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity loads and maintains
transportation data.
8.108.2. Purpose of Special Packing Instructions (SPI). SPI and the foam-in-place code are
provided to help the LRS/Transportation activity personnel prepare items for movement.
Although in general, these numbers and codes apply to recoverable items, they may be assigned
to some expendable items. The information represented by these codes is stored on the item
record and will be printed on all DD Form 1348-1A shipping, issue, and due-out release
documents. In addition, the phrase REUSABLE CONTAINER will be printed on all DD Form
1348-1A shipping, issue, and due-out release documents when an SPI applies. The phrase
REUSABLE CONTAINER will also be printed on selected REC, DOR, and TIN management
notices.
8.108.3. Transportation Data Elements on Item Record. The following elements of
transportation data are maintained on the item record:
8.108.3.1. National motor freight classification code (NMFC)
8.108.3.2. Type cargo code
8.108.3.3. Special packing instruction (SPI). This information will be stored on the item record
as follows: The SPI number will be either: 1) a discrete and unique special packing instruction
number (9-position numeric), 2) a fast pack number (9-position alpha/numeric) or, 3) a standard
pack number (9-position alpha/numeric). See configuration of SPI numbers in the paragraph
below. The foam-in-place code is also stored on the item record and will be either an F
(flexible), R (rigid), or S (semi-rigid).
8.108.4. Configuring SPIs. Configuration of SPI numbers is shown below. All LRS/Materiel
Management Activity personnel using this information must become familiar with AFI 24-203.
1066                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

TYPE DATA POSITIONS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Fast Pack         00000NAAN
Standard Pack     00000NANN
Discrete SPI       NNNNNNNNN
Note: Personnel handling these items must take precautions to see that 1) neither the items nor
the returnable and reusable containers are damaged, and 2) the containers are, when possible,
returned with the replaced items. Foam-in-place flags identify specific methods or requirements
for preparing and packing items to prevent loss or damage during handling.


8.108.5. Reconciliation and Verification of Transportation Data. LRS/Traffic
Management/Materiel Management Activity will use the Special Packaging Instructions
Retrieval & Exchange System (SPIRES) to verify the accuracy of transportation data. Refer to
AFI 24-203 for further guidance on the use of SPIRES. Transportation data on the item record is
available by inquiry and program S02. The S02 listing will be forwarded to Cargo Movement for
their use in verifying the accuracy of the SPI information in ILS-S. If ILS-S is invalid a
BDT/BVT may be processed to correct or they may input 1SQ, SNUD stock number
interrogation, with option code 15 to receive updated catalog data. See Para 8.219 for input.
8.109. Loading, Changing, and Deleting Transportation Data.
8.109.1. Input Formats. Either the BDT or BVT input format may be used to load, change, or
delete transportation data. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity personnel must
exercise extreme care in preparing BDT or BVT inputs, because the data in the input will be
loaded on the item record. EXAMPLE: If a data field is blank on the input, the corresponding
field on the item record will be blank also. See Para 8.232.
8.109.2. Updating Item Records. One input will update all item records with a stock number
equal to the input stock number regardless of the system designator. Print (F116 management
notice) notification will be produced as necessary for system designators 01 and A1 through A9
only (see Para 8.233).
8.109.3. Output Notices. A management notice or a reject will be output for each BDT or BVT
input only when the input is by remote or is rejected, except when TPO information action
occurs. An F116 management notice is produced in each instance when the following occurs:
8.109.3.1. A new TPO is loaded to an item record that previously did not contain a TPO. Note:
TPO used in this context applies to discrete transportation packing order numbers only. Fast
pack numbers and/or standard pack numbers being loaded or changed on item records will not
produce an F116 management notice. Fast pack/standard pack data apply to a large volume of
stock numbers and are referenced by the master index in the LRS/Transportation activity Office.
They are printed on property movement documents; however, load or change notification is not
required.
8.109.3.2. An existing TPO on the item record is changed to another TPO.
8.109.3.3. The ordinal effective date (BDT positions 65-69) of an SPI, defined in BDT positions
71-79, is within 60 days (plus or minus) of the current computer processing date.
8.110. F999 Reject Notice. An F999 reject notice will be produced when the NMFC code or
type cargo code is invalid. The F999 reject notice also applies when a T is present in position 64
of the input (SPI data present), and ALC prime site code, SPI effective date, or TPO number is
blank or contains special characters. Rejects for these conditions should be forwarded to the
LRS/Transportation activity to be resolved. If the LRS/Transportation activity personnel are
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1067

able to determine the correct data, they will provide LGRMC with the correct data for
reprocessing.

Section 8M--Application Code/Precious Metals Indicator Code/Automated Data Processing
Equipment Code/AFTO Form 95 Code Load/Change/Delete

8.111. Section Summary. This section describes the loading, changing, or deleting of
application codes, precious metals indicator, automated data processing equipment code, and
AFTO Form 95 codes on the item record. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is
primarily responsible for processing all required actions for managing these codes, however, the
LRS will process required inputs for all local stock numbered items.
8.112. Application Codes.
8.112.1. Purpose of Application Codes. Application codes relate items to specific systems,
subsystems, end items, etc. The major commands assign application codes for stock numbers
other than weapon system applications. For stock numbers assigned weapon system application,
the AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will monitor and validate assignment of the
first two characters of the three position (the third position letter “F” will not be used) Weapon
System Designator Code (WSDC) in the application code field for 635 SCMW
supported/managed accounts to provide an enterprise view for monitoring, tracking usage and
analysis for a given weapon system. The Single Manager for each weapon system is responsible
for identifying the requirement to add or delete a weapon system’s registration, which results in
assignment and/or cancellation of a WSDC as well as identifying stock numbers assigned to their
WSDC in the Weapon System Support Program (WSSP) Workbench (D040). The above
procedures are optional for LRS/Materiel Management Activities not supported/managed by the
635 SCMW.
8.112.2. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will review the Weapon System Support
Program (WSSP) Workbench (D040) prior to add, change or delete of WSDC application codes
in ILS-S.
8.112.3. Application Code Inputs. The application code input must contain a specific system
designator, and can only be loaded on the stock number for that system designator. An asterisk
(*) in the second position deletes the application code from the item record. If the item record
pertains to a packaged aviation oil product in the B type stock record account, the application
code must be AO (alpha). If the item record is for a utility or heating fuel in type stock record
account code B, the application code must be HF. The program does not edit this field on the
input; therefore, omission of the application code on these items results in an erroneous update of
the element of expense investment code (EEIC) on the organization cost center record.
Application codes can be loaded on item records through TRIC 1AP or by FIL when the item
record is loaded. Note: Do not use Application code AO. This code applies to Packaged
Aviation products which are no longer maintained in the SBSS, although the supply logic will
still update the EEIC to 602 when AO is used.
8.112.4. Stock Record Account Code K. If the type stock record account code is K, the first
position of the application code must be N or R. If the first position is being changed from N to
R, the DODIC AFAC must be reflected in the item record nomenclature or a reject will occur.
See section 8E for details. Only the second position of the application code field can be blanked
if the item is type stock record account code K.
1068                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.113. Precious Metal Indicator Codes. PMICs are used to identify defense materiel items
that contain precious metals and the content value of the metal. PMIC codes are pushed through
SNUD for NSNs, but L and P stock numbers require manual loading. (See Para 8.234 for input
format and Para 8.236 for applicable codes.)
8.114. Automated Data Processing Equipment Codes. Automated Data Processing
Equipment (ADPE) codes are used to identify DoD ADPE/ADP components in the supply
system. ADPE codes also help DLADS identify these items at the time they are transferred to
disposal. ADPE codes are pushed through SNUD for NSNs, but L and P stock numbers require
manual loading. Refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for applicable codes. ADPE code 8 will be
assigned to ADPE equipment items with L and P stock numbers when the other ADPE codes do
not apply.
8.115. AFTO Form 95 Codes. The AFTO Form 95 (significant historical data) is required when
serially controlled items are shipped off base. AFTO Form 95 codes are pushed through SNUD
for NSNs, but L and P numbers require manual loading. (See Para. 8.234. for input format.)
Each item that maintenance keeps a record of maintenance on requires an AFTO Form 95.
Normally, these items have been stock listed. If there is any doubt during the load of a nonstock
listed item, contact the requester to determine if a record of maintenance must be maintained on
the item. When a record of maintenance is prepared, the AFTO Form 95 code must be loaded.
8.116. Munitions Reportability Data.
8.116.1. Reportability Code N. If the change-to munitions reportability code is N and the item
record reflects ERRCD of XD(x), a report code of 6 is added to the item record.
8.116.2. Reportability Code R. If the change-to munitions reportability code is an R, the ARMS
reporting code data is blanked
8.117. Exceptions.
8.117.1. Changes to the Reportability Code for stock record account code K items. If the input
results in a change to the munitions reportability code type stock record account code K item, the
program writes either an application code 91 or 92 transaction history.
8.117.2. Changes to other than type stock record code K items. Changes to other than type stock
record code K items do not cause the program to write transaction histories.

Section 8N--Standard Reporting Designator Record

8.118. Overview.
8.118.1. Section Summary. This section first defines the standard reporting designator (SRD)
record, explains why this record is used, and finally describes how to correctly use the record.
AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity researches and prepares inputs to load, change
and delete SRDs and performs annual SRD validations. The LRS/Materiel Management
Activity will load SRD records if required for establishment of MICAP due-out details.
8.118.2. Definition. The SRD record is a computer-generated record that identifies the aircraft,
end items, or systems assigned to the base and/or satellite accounts. This record consolidates the
elements of mission design series (MDS) and maintenance equipment classification designator
(MECD). 8.118.3. Purpose of the Standard Reporting Designator Record. This record reflects
all authorized SRDs.
8.119. Operation of the Standard Reporting Designator. The 008-MICAP-FLAG will be set
to a Y for MICAP reportable SRD and N for non-MICAP SRD. The MICAP flag may be
interrogated by processing a 1SR inquiry. (See Para. 8.237. for input format.)
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                    1069

8.120. Verification Responsibilities. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will
load, change, or delete the standard reporting designator record when required. The SRD and
MICAP flag loaded in the standard reporting designator record will be verified for currency and
accuracy and changed or deleted as necessary. (See Ch 6, section 6A, for program NGV567
SBSS/IMDS SRD Reconciliation processing instructions.) Frequency Annually EOM March or
as required. This program compares the SRDs loaded in REMIS with the SRDs loaded in SBSS.
The program does not verify the MICAP flag. If the SRD is loaded in Supply and not in REMIS
a 1SRD is created and processed via pseudo. This program does not create 1SRCs or1SRLs.
8.121. Reject Conditions.
8.121.1. Rejects. The input to the standard reporting designator record will reject if the
following conditions are NOT met:
8.121.2. The action code must be L, C, D, or I.
8.121.3. The three-position SRD must be alpha/numeric and not contain any special characters
or blanks.
8.121.4. Position 8 (MICAP flag) must be Y for MICAP or N for non-MICAP if load or change
is to be processed.

Section 8O--Federal Supply Class (FSC) and Materiel Management Aggregation Codes
(MMAC)

8.122. Overview.
8.122.1. Section Summary. This section explains what FSC and MMAC are and what FSC and
MMAC do. In addition, the section describes the maintaining and monitoring FSC and MMAC
records. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for FSC and MMAC
records.
8.122.2. Definition. FSC and MMAC records identify the federal supply classes (FSC) and
materiel management codes (MMAC) loaded and/or authorized in each SBSS computer.
8.123. Maintaining FSC and MMAC Records.
8.123.1. Purpose of FSC and MMAC Records. These records are used to route reports and
shipments to the correct item manager (IM). FSC and MMAC record formats are given in AFH
23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3. (AFMC IM codes are listed in Para 8.240)
8.123.2. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for maintaining,
monitoring, researching and preparing inputs to load, change, or delete FSC and MMAC records.
To review these records, use program NGV538, which lists the FSC and MMAC records loaded.
(See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3, Ch 6, for processing instructions and input format.)
8.124. Source of Data For FSC and MMAC Records. FSC and MMAC record data are
available on a weekly basis by the SNUD. Federal supply class (FSC) and MMAC screening are
available for either a whole FSC and MMAC data file or only a portion of the file. (See Para
8.238 and Para 8.239 for input and output formats.)
8.125. Required Records.
8.125.1. FSC and MMAC Record Requirements. AFMC will provide FSC and MMAC record
requirements as additions, changes or deletions from the logistics system. Sometimes AFMC
automatically sends the BVL/BDL inputs. This automatic procedure is often referred to as a
PUSH of a BVL/BDL input. This push of BVL/BDL inputs is the response of AFMC to a BVA
or a new requirement.
1070                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.125.2. FSC and MMAC Record Maintenance. FSC and MMAC records must be maintained
for all FSC and MMAC appearing on item records in the SBSS computer.
8.125.3. New Item Record Load Inputs. New item record load inputs (FIL) will reject unless an
FSC and/or MMAC record is already in the computer with an equal FSC and/or MMAC.
8.125.4. MMAC Record Loading. An MMAC record may be loaded for each alpha-alpha
combination; for example, AA-AZ through ZA-ZZ.
8.125.5. Limitations to FSC Loading. The following FSC inputs will reject if the FSC is in
FSG: 00, 09, 21, 8, 33, 50, 57, 64, 82, 90, 97, and 98.
8.126. Load, Change, or Delete Instructions.
8.126.1. Rejection of Item Record Load. When a request for item record load (FIL) is rejected,
or an FSC or MMAC record is not loaded or is invalid, a 092 reject notice is generated.
LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will process a BDL and prepare a BVA
(FSC/MMAC interrogation) for submission to AFMC.
8.126.2. An 048 Management Notice. The computer will provide a 048 management notice
when a BVL/BDL is input for a load or for a change of an MMAC record.
8.126.3. Validation of the MMAC Requirement. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity will validate the requirement for the MMAC. If the requirement is valid, LRS/AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will enter an R in position 18 of the first line on the
management notice, and then reinput or forward to keypunch for input to Computer Operations
/main system.
8.126.4. Processing Inputs. Inputs received to load, change or delete FSC records and to delete
MMAC records will be processed internally.

Section 8P-- Shipping Destination Records

8.127. Overview.
8.127.1. Section Summary. The shipping program uses shipping destination records (SDR) to
print addresses for shipments on DD Form 1348-1A. This section describes the maintenance of
these records, including shell records. Also explained are procedures for changing and deleting
shipping destination records. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity loads and
maintains shipping destination records.
8.127.2. Maintaining Shipping Destination Records (Code 519). When unserviceable ERRCD
XD2 items are shipped to destinations other than the FSC or FSC/MMAC unserviceable storage
site, a shipping destination record is maintained for each destination. AFMC uses SNUD to
selectively disseminate data for controlling the movement of reparable items. (See section 8U
for details.)
8.127.3. Shipments Requiring Shipping Destination Records. AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity will load and maintain a shipping destination record for each shipment to
any of the following: AFMC IM, AFMC unserviceable storage site, DLA storage sites, General
Services Administration (GSA), and Army storage points. Shipping destination records may also
be established when redistribution orders (RDO) and lateral support requests give rise to frequent
shipments (serviceable and unserviceable) to any authorized stock record account number.
8.127.4. Ship-to Account Field of the shipping destination record. When the input ship-to
account code is EZ or EY in the first two positions, the system will allow loading of a RIC on the
shipping destination record.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1071

8.127.5. References. Shipping addresses, routing identifier codes, and ZIP codes are found in
the following references:
8.127.5.1. Shipping address information and routing identifier codes are listed in DLM 4000.25-
1, Military Standard Requisition and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP).
8.127.5.2. ZIP codes are listed in the postal ZIP code manual.
8.127.6. ES-S Manage Shipment Destination Process. The ES-S Manage Shipment Destination
Process queries the Air Force Supply Central Databank (AFSCDB) to list current shipment
destination records applicable to any SRAN. This new capability provides authorized users the
ability to review, edit, delete, and load SBSS shipping destination records. A major advantage of
using this new capability is the ability to manipulate shipment destination records with a new
FRD transaction screen combining the functionality of existing SBSS FRD1, FRD2, and FRD3
screens. In other words, ES-S automatically generates FRD1, FRD2, and FRD3 transactions (as
applicable) to the SBSS upon input. Additionally, this new FRD screen supports a new query to
the SBSS to read shipment destination records directly from the SBSS database. See Ch 15 of
the ES-S User Manual for more information.
8.128. Shell Records.
8.128.1. A shell record is a partial record of shipping data. The record is loaded pending the
input of complete information.
8.128.2. Establishing the Shell. Occasionally a BDR format (see section 8U) may be input
containing a ship-to account code, and no destination record is loaded in the computer for that
particular code. When this happens, shell shipping destination records containing only the ship-
to account code are established under program control.
8.128.3. Notice to Complete Shell. When a shell record requires completion, the phrase F012
MGT COMPLETE SHELL SHIP DEST RECORD FOR (ship-to account code) will be printed
on the third line of the BDR output notice. (See Para 8.241 and Para 8.242 for data needed to
complete the shipping destination record.)
8.128.4. Deadline for Completing Shell Record. Shell shipping destination records should be
completed within one duty day after the F012 management notice is received. Note: Reason
loaded code A (AFMC directed) is automatically assigned to the shipping destination record by
BDR processing.
8.129. Loading New or Complete Shell Shipping Destination Records.
8.129.1. Required FRD (Shipping Destination Record Load/Change) Inputs. Two FRD inputs
are required to load a new shipping destination record. Completing a partially completed record
or shell may require the input of both number 1 and number 2 inputs, depending upon which data
fields require completion. (See Para 8.241 and Para 8.24 for shipping destination records.)
Note: To ensure correct processing of input number 2, number 1 must be input first.
8.129.2. Reject Notice for FRD Input. Notification of rejected input will be in the format shown
in Para 8.243.
8.129.3. Invalid Ship-To Addresses. DLA inventory control points S9(X), that is, S9E, S9I,
S9C, S9G, SMS, etc., are not valid ship-to addresses. If an attempt is made to load one, the
program will override the address field with the phrase NOT AN AUTHORIZED SHIP-TO
ADDRESS.
8.130. Changing Shipping Destination Records.
8.130.1. Requirements for Changing Shipping Destination Records. FRD input format 1 or
format 2 is used to change data on existing shipping destination records. The data to be changed
1072                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

determine which input format to use. In order to change an existing record, the ship-to-account
code must match that of an existing record.
8.130.2. Notice That Shell Is Not Loaded. If a change is processed but the shell record is not
loaded, the phrase NO FIND ON INPUT ATTEMPT. SHIP TO ACCT NOT ON FILE will be
printed on the FRD output notice. Verify the input and load the necessary shell record.
8.131. Deleting Shipping Destination Records.
8.131.1. Shipping Destination Records for Repair Cycle Items. A shipping destination record
should not be deleted if it is required for a repair cycle item.
8.131.2. FRD Delete. Shipping destination records can be deleted by processing an FRD3 input
(see Para 8.245 for input format). The program must find an equal ship-to-account loaded in the
computer. If the program can find no match, then it prints the phrase NO FIND ON INPUT
ATTEMPT. SHIP TO ACCT NOT ON FILE on the output notice.
8.132. Shipping Destination Record Cleanup.
8.132.1. Shipping Destination (Record Cleanup), must be accomplished whenever the
MISCELLANEOUS AREA becomes full or anytime shipping destination records need to be
deleted. This should be accomplished by running Program NGV586 or utilizing ES-S Shipping
Destination management (See Ch. 15 in ES-S User Manual).
8.132.1.1. Full Area. When the miscellaneous record area is full, a 799 reject is output with
error code 12, error number 0084, error set: miscellaneous area full. The message
MISCELLANEOUS-AREA IS FULL is printed.
8.132.1.2. Record Deletion. There are two codes to help you decide which shipping destination
records to delete.
8.132.1.2.1. When you select the input option flag P (print), program NGV586 prints a listing of
all shipping destination records currently stored on the database in the miscellaneous area.
8.132.1.2.2. When you select the input option flag V (validation), program NGV586 lists
shipping destination records which are not required for repair cycle items and which can be
deleted. Shipping destination records that can be deleted are sorted based on date of last
shipment and reason loaded code.
8.132.2. NGV586 Processing Schedule. Upon receiving notification that the shipping
destination area is full, or anytime shipping destination records need to be deleted, Records
Maintenance may contact Computer Operations to schedule processing of programs NGV586
and NGV826/R08 or utilize ES-S Shipping Destination management (See Ch. 15 in ES-S User
Manual).
8.132.3. Exiting NGV586. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity does the following to
exit program NGV586:
8.132.3.1. Uses action code F and presses Enter to exit the review process without deleting
suspense records. The review process starts again. The phrase FRD REVIEW PROCESS NOT
COMPLETED displays.
8.132.3.2. Uses action code A and presses Enter to delete all suspense records and the FRD-
delete-header record. The phrase FRD REVIEW PROCESS COMPLETE ALL SUSPENSE
RECORDS HAVE BEEN DELETED displays.
8.132.4. Program Errors. The review and validation process should be done every time the
validation option for program NGV586 is processed.
8.132.4.1. If you attempt to start the review process using screen number 538 (FRDR) without
first running program NGV586, the phrase NO FRD HEADER SUSPENSE RECORD
LOCATED will be printed.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1073

8.132.4.2. If you insert an incorrect ship-to-account-code or one that is not loaded using screen
number 539, the phrase NO SHIPPING DESTINATION RECORD LOADED FOR SRAN: will
be printed.
8.132.5. Program Completed. After program NGV586 is complete and the validation option
processed, AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity processes program NGV826/R08 to
ensure that current data are available for off-line shipments.
8.132.6. Rejects. Notification of rejected input reflects the format shown in Para 8.243.

Section 8Q--OCCR, Load, Change, or Delete

8.133. Overview. Explains the purpose of organization cost center records and the actions
required to establish, change, or delete OCCR). LRSs are responsible for loading, changing, and
deleting OCCRs for all on-base organizations, satellite accounts and geographically separated
units. The AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for loading, changing
and deleting OCCRs for deployed units at contingency sites.
8.134. Establishing Organization Cost Center Codes.
8.134.1. Organization Code. LGRMC assigns the organization code to identify organizations
and detachments receiving logistical support from the LRS/ Materiel Management Activity. The
organization code also identifies the internal functions of the LRS/ Materiel Management
Activity. Many A&F and Supply internal program decisions are made based on organization
codes. OCCRs 100 through 999 are authorized for each system designator.
8.134.2. Cost Center Codes. When more than one cost center exists within an organization,
each cost center has its own three-digit organization code.
8.134.3. Operating Budget Account Number. Each operating budget account number (OBAN)
which processes issues of aviation oil package products needs a separate organization cost center
record.
8.134.4. MRSP, MSK Items and Joint Use Items. MRSP and MSK involving multiple use need
a separate organization code for each command involved. Authorized/in-use detail records
involving joint use of equipment also need a separate organization code for each command
involved. CAUTION: Only one using command code is stored on each OCCR.
8.134.5. Letters and Forms. Establishing an organization account and appointing an equipment
custodian may be requested on a letter or form. When one letter or form is used, a copy must be
provided to Equipment Management for their actions.
8.134.6. A separate organizational identification code will be loaded for each resident school
course outlined in the education and training course announcements and developed. Contact HQ
AETC/LGSWE ROF monitor with courses to be added, changed or deleted. HQ AETC will load
the information in AFEMS. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity will receive a
notice in e-mail conference of organization identification codes assigned, which have changed.
Assignment of multiple courses will not be allowed against one organization identification
number.
8.135. Load of an OCCR (001 - 099).
8.135.1. Organization cost center records 001-099 are used for information only and will not be
used for issue/turn-in transactions. These records are used primarily for printing addresses on
documents. Organization cost center records 041-069 are used to support satellite activities,
such as, media and status (M&S) and SRAN for the servicing DLADS, etc.
1074                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.135.1.1. AMC Forward Supply Locations will establish a separate OCCR for each AMC
owned Mission Design Series (MDS) (C-5 and C-17). OCCRs will be established for ANG and
AFRC owned C-17 and C-5s in accordance with direction provided by HQ AFMC/A4s
Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office.
8.135.2. LRS Customer Service at the host base will load OCCRs 001-040, 070 through 099, if
required. The data required when loading these OCCRs are:
8.135.2.1. Organization Code. Organization codes must be assigned as described AFH 23-123,
Vol 1, Ch 2.
8.135.2.2. Organization Title. Satellite OCCRs for organization codes 041-049 must contain the
FB, FE, or FK account number assigned to their satellite. This number appears in the first six
positions. The satellite name is in the next sixteen positions. Organization codes 050-069 must
use FG and their SRAN.
8.135.2.3. Delivery Destination Code. Delivery destination code is a three-position field that
identifies a delivery destination.
8.135.2.4. Parcel Post/Freight Address. The parcel post/freight address from organization cost
center record 001, 041-069 is printed in Block 2 (Ship-From) of the DD Form 1348-1A shipping
documents.
8.135.2.5. Zone Improvement Code (ZIP) code. Enter the ZIP code for the organization.
8.135.3. The Record Maintenance at the satellite (or host for 001) should load organization cost
center record based on system designator assigned to these satellites, i.e., A1 - 041, B1 = 051.
The data required for these organization cost center records are the same as the above plus the
following:
8.135.3.1. Major command code. Major command codes are described in AFH 23-123, Vol 1,
Ch 2.
8.135.3.2. Force Activity Designator. Force activity designator is described in AFH 23-123, Vol
1, Ch 2.
8.135.3.2. (AMC) Force Activity Designator. Assign Force Activity Designator (FAD) code
“V” to orderly room and administrative functions not specifically authorized a higher FAD in the
Air Force program document.
8.135.3.3. Satellite Purchasing Capability Flag. The satellite purchasing capability flag applies
only to satellite organization cost center records. The codes and their meanings are as follows:
8.135.3.3.1. Code 4--The satellite Contracting Office supports this satellite. The satellite does
not use the Standard Procurement System (SPS) procedures.
8.135.3.3.2. Code E--The satellite Contracting Office supports this satellite and uses the SPS
procedures.
8.135.3.3.3. Code Blank--The computer support base Contracting Office supports this satellite.
8.135.3.4. SRAN of servicing DLADS.
8.135.3.5. ZIP of servicing DLADS.
8.135.3.6. DLADS - TMO - delivery flag (T) specifies if the property is for delivery to DLADS.
Blank specifies the property is shipped through Cargo Movement. Note: Old term for Cargo
Movement is listed in notice.
8.135.3.7. DLADS Lot Flag.
8.135.3.7.1. The DLADS lot flag is set to Y when bases choose to transfer materiel to DLADS
and require only three copies of DD Form 1348-1A.
8.135.3.7.2. The DLADS lot flag is set to a Blank if items are shipped to DLADS by Cargo
Movement.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1075

8.135.3.8. Media & Status code. This code specifies the type status you require in response to
your requisition. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for a description of media and status codes.) If
these fields are blank on input, a K will be assigned. (K = means exception supply status and
100 percent shipment status.)
8.135.3.9. Bulk Issue Flag. The bulk issue or line item accounting flag applies only to
organization codes 001 and 041 through 069. It identifies those organizations operating Retail
Sales under bulk issue or line item accounting procedures.
8.136. Actions Necessary to Load an Organization Cost Center Record (100-999).
8.136.1. Upon receipt of a request to load a new OCCR (100-999), LRS/AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity will ensure the data elements required are provided. They must
also verify the organization identification code, force activity designator, major command code,
gaining command code, and geographical location code with the data loaded in AFEMS (C001).
These data elements must agree with the AFEMS database or rejects will occur.
8.136.2. Work with the Accounting and Finance Office (A&F) to obtain additional data as
required. Coordinate with the Materiel Management Flight to ensure there are no planned or
projected mission changes that could impact the assignment of organization code(s).
8.136.3. Force Activity Designator (FAD) override code assignment:
8.136.3.1. When a requester requires an item used in direct mission support of a higher priority
FAD, have the requester use the FAD of the requirement being supported.
8.136.3.1.1. Three options exist for assignment of FAD override code:
8.136.3.1.1.1. Option 1. When higher FAD requirements are supported but do not predominate
on a routine and continuing basis, use the FAD override option on an individual issue request.
8.136.3.1.1.2. Option 2. When higher FAD requirements are supported on a routine and
continuing basis but do not predominate, establish a separate organization cost center record
(OCCR) for the higher FAD requirements.
8.136.3.1.1.3. Option 3. When higher FAD requirements are predominantly supported, the
higher FAD will be loaded to the existing OCCR.
8.136.3.1.2. When either option 2 or 3 above is used, it must be so stated in writing and signed
by the Chief of Maintenance and the LRS CC/AO or equivalent. Letters do not need to be
updated when either the Chief of Maintenance or the LRS CC/AO or equivalent changes.
Remove the letter when the higher FAD is no longer required. Note: For organizations not
under a Chief of Maintenance organizational structure, the supporting commander or staff
agency chief, as appropriate, will sign the correspondence.
8.136.3.1.3. Also use these procedures to establish FAD override support for special emphasis
programs listed in the USAF Program Document (PD).
8.136.3.1.4. Do not use these procedures for routine administrative support.
8.136.4. Action required by the Accounting and Finance Office. The Accounting and Finance
Office takes the following action on organization cost center record loading:
8.136.4.1. Project Funds Management Code. The project funds management record (PFMR) is
a control record for one (or more) OCCR. It is used in the control of SMAG issue and due-out
charges or turn-in refunds.
8.136.4.2. Cost Center Code. The cost center code identifies the lowest level organizational
entity for which financial and performance data are accumulated. At the end of the month, cost
center reports are produced for input to the operating accounting system.
8.136.4.3. Expense Record Output Flag. A&F end-of-day programs use the expense record
output flag to determine if E records will be produced.
1076                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.136.4.4. Type Organization Code. Use the type organization code to identify funding
responsibility. You must use the correct code since it influences internal decisions on refunding,
reimbursement, and the correct fund appropriation. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for type
organization codes.)
8.136.5. Action required by LRS Customer Service. LRS Customer Service takes the following
action on organization cost center record loading:
8.136.5.1. Verify all data.
8.136.5.2. Organization Title. Use the organization title to identify the specific organization,
detachment, function, etc., for which the organization record is established.
8.136.5.2.1. Off-base organizations that have an activity address code different from the host
(computer support base) enter their activity address code in the first six positions of the
organization title field (for example, FY8018 Boeing Commercial Airplanes). Refer to DLM
4000.25-1 for activity address codes. Data in this field are printed on off-base issue and due-out
release documents.
8.136.5.2.2. Assign the applicable organization code.
8.136.5.2.3. The off-base flag is optional for off-base activities when the written agreement
states they are responsible for pickup of their materiel, and they request the materiel not be
routed through the local Transportation Management Office. Off-base organizations will not be
able to process an issue (ISU) on IEX 3 and 6 items.
8.136.5.3. Equipment Authorization Flag. The equipment authorization flag identifies those
organizations not authorized equipment. If this flag is equal to 1, activity code E issue requests
will not process.
8.136.5.4. Delivery Destination Code. The delivery destination code is a locally assigned
designator indicating where to deliver supplies or equipment. The code will be used if the ISU
request did not have a delivery destination code. LRSs are responsible for processing delivery
destination record loads, changes and deletes and maintaining a current delivery destination
listing.
8.136.5.5. System Designator. The system designator identifies the account the organization
cost center record is authorized to use for issue or turn-in transactions.
8.136.5.6. Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Maintenance Activity Designator/AMC
Forward Supply Support Flag or the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) Reimbursement
Designator. The flag and designators are defined as follows:
8.136.5.6.1. The ICBM maintenance activity designator (M) identifies organizations performing
ICBM maintenance. The issue/due-out release program also uses it to assign DIFM status codes.
8.136.5.6.2. The DMA reimbursement designator (C) identifies those DMA activities supported
by the SBSS. These activities provide materiel on a reimbursable basis (appropriation
reimbursements) with the exception of base-procured investment items purchased with other
procurement funds (57*3080).
8.136.5.7. Bench Stock Override Print Flag. The bench stock override print flag designates that
BSU outputs are to be produced instead of having DD Forms 1348-1A.
8.136.5.8. Gaining Major Command Code.
8.136.5.8.1. Air National Guard or AF Reserve. If the parent command code is Air National
Guard or AF Reserve, always load a gaining major command code. An XSE, Organization
Change input is used to update the major command code.
8.136.5.8.2. Double asterisk. If a double asterisk (**) appears in the gaining command code
field of the M24/NGV863, Indicative Data List, then the gaining command code for an Air
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1077

National Guard/Air Force Reserve (ANG/AFR) organization is absent. LRS must promptly
correct this condition.
8.136.5.8.3. MRSP/MSK use. When organization cost center records exist for MRSP/MSK use,
make sure that each record is loaded with the proper using command code.
8.136.5.9. Maintenance Unit Identification Code. This may contain an alpha character other
than X. This will be provided by maintenance. On the IMDS/G081 systems, this is known as
the ID.
8.136.5.10. AWP Delivery Destination. The AWP delivery destination code designates a
location or holding area for delivery of bits and pieces required for repair of AWP items. This
code is locally assigned and input by the LRS.
8.136.5.11. Prepare and process FOR, Organization Cost Center Record Load/Change/Delete
inputs.
8.136.5.12. Forward all correspondence to Computer Operations. After successfully processing
the FOR inputs, they use this correspondence as authority to establish distribution bins or boxes
for the new organization. Computer Operations returns all correspondence to LRS/AFMC SCM-
R Records Maintenance Activity for the organization record file.
8.136.6. Delivery Destination Record. Load the delivery destination record. LRS must ensure
that a delivery destination record is loaded for the 3-digit delivery destination code for any shop
code identified for that organization. (See section 8X for loading delivery destination records.)
8.136.7. Mission Design Series (MDS) Code. The base OCCR must accurately identify the
standard MDS associated with the organization. LGRMC personnel will use the FOR to input
(or change) appropriate MDS codes when creating new OCCRs. The MDS input in the FOR
transaction should be the predominate MDS supported by the organization. These OCCR data
elements enable the SBSS to provide consumption (failure) data by MAJCOM and MDS. The
MAJCOM-by-MDS consumption data will be used to determine cost per flying hour and to
budget and allocate AF Organization and Maintenance (O&M) funds. The bases shall assign the
appropriate MDS to each organization code within the base OCCRs. For the base OCCR MDS
data to be useful, all bases must use standardized MDS codes. MDS standardization will allow
AFMC to accumulate the base reported consumption across bases by MDS. In the future, the
standardized MDS codes will be provided as an enumerated pick-list in the FOR GUI screen.
However, until that improvement is fielded, it is imperative that base personnel use one of the
standardized MDS codes provided in Para 8.247 (FOR input format).
8.136.8. Organization Identification. The organization record contains data applicable to both
the CSB and satellite; therefore, the general title "Supply Points" should be used for both types
of activities. This means that the organization identification field on organization record 005
should not contain a SRAN or any other data relative to only one system designator.
8.137. Changing Organization Cost Center Records and Associated Data.
8.137.1. The organization may request changes to its data. The request must be in writing and
will be processed according to the following instructions.
8.137.2. Equipment Management. If the change affects only the assignment of equipment
custodians and alternates, forward the correspondence directly to Equipment Management.
Equipment Management will ensure these changes are forwarded to Pickup and Delivery--and to
any other section that requires notification of custodian changes.
8.137.3. LGRMC Actions. Process all changes the same way as the original. When changing
the Organization Title field, only alpha/numeric characters are accepted. Special characters will
produce a 001 reject. When changing the FAD, you may use a SURGE program to produce the
1078                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

inputs and outputs required to update the due-in and due-out detail records for the affected
organizations. Coordinate these actions with Stock Control and Computer Operations.
8.138. Deleting Organization Cost Center Records.
8.138.1. To delete OCCRs, you should either have a written request from the organization
commander or know about the deletion from AFEMS (C001), XSE transaction, or AFEMS E-
Mail. Requests for deletion will be forwarded to the Operations Support Flight. The following
actions are required to delete an organization cost center record:
8.138.2. Work with the other elements or flights to make sure they have completed all the steps
necessary to process the OCCR delete.
8.138.3. Have Computer Operations process Organization Record/Detail Cleanup List
NGV340/UTL340 program (see Ch 6) to make sure that detail records are not loaded for the
organization code being deleted. If any records are loaded, work with the appropriate flights to
delete the detail records before deleting the OCCR.
8.138.4. Prepare and process a FOR delete after verifying that there are no records loaded (see
Para 8.246 or Para 8.247).
8.138.4.1. When processing deletes of organization codes 100 through 999 (see Para 8.247)
review the output delete notice to make sure the appropriate cost center record is identified for
deletion. The inline program does not delete these organization codes. Instead, it stores a delete
flag of D on the organization cost center record.
8.138.4.1.1. Accounting and Finance programs delete organization codes 100 through 999 if all
the dollar fields, except the following, are blank: supplies and equipment net nonreimbursable
issues, net investment issues, and forced sales.
8.138.4.1.2. Program NGV946 will delete those OCCRs (100-999) that have been identified for
deletion (refer to DFAS-DE 7077.10-M). Also, program NGV977B (M03) will delete the
organization cost center record (518) (see DFAS-DE 7077.10-M).
8.138.4.2. If the delete is for organization codes 001 through 099, the program deletes the
OCCR since there are no financial data on these records. When deleting organization codes 041-
069, make sure there are no item records loaded with the applicable system designator.
8.139. Freezing Organization Cost Center Record.
8.139.1. Freeze or Delete Flag. The freeze or delete flag is a dual-purpose flag stored in the
organization cost center record. It is loaded, changed, or deleted with an FOR input (see Para
8.247).
8.139.2. Freeze Flag R. The freeze flag “R” is assigned by an FOR input when the LRS CC/AO
or equivalent has decided to restrict financial transactions (except for turn-ins, due-out releases,
and reverse-post transactions) against an organization being deactivated, consolidated,
transferred, or for administrative reasons.
8.139.3. Delete Flag D. When action code of “D” is used, a delete flag “D” is stored on the
organization record (518) when no details exist. If details exist the organization record will store
a “P” and once details deleted it will be changed to a “D”. Processing of program NGV946,
Accounting and Finance (A&F) End-of-Fiscal-Year Closeout, or monthly M03/NGV977 will
delete any organization record with a “D” in the freeze/delete flag field of the organization
record (518).
8.140. Files and Listings.
8.140.1. LRS is responsible for maintaining or monitoring the following files and listings:
8.140.2. The Organization Effectiveness Report (M24). Update current list as changes are made
and verify changes upon receipt of new listing.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1079

8.140.3. The OCCR File. The OCCR file is not required; however, MAJCOMs may direct that
this file is maintained. When this file is maintained, it will be disposed of IAW the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). One folder will contain all the supporting documentation
for adds, changes, and deletes of organization records. Maintain the supporting documentation
in organization code sequence.

Section 8R--Exception Phrase And Type Cargo Phrase Records: Load, Change, Or Delete
(FXR/CPH)

8.141. Overview.
8.141.1. Definition. Phrase records are records that use narrative phrases rather than alpha-
numeric code that is loaded on an item record. These phrase records are used for narrative
processing. The exception phrase record gives specific information about an item record. First,
it decodes the code in a narrative phrase; second, it specifies the category under which an item
falls. Exception phrase records provide a plain language phrase for codes loaded on item
records.
8.141.2. Section Summary. This section first describes codes used for exception phrase
processing. Next, loading procedures are given, including loading override records. Finally,
changing and deleting records are explained.
8.141.3. Use of Exception Phrase Records. Exception phrase records are used to control and to
identify items that are not subject to normal excess, issue, requisitioning, and shipping
procedures. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for loading,
changing, or deleting exception phrase records. (The FXR input format is shown in Para 8.248)
8.141.4. Use of Type Cargo Phrase Records. Type cargo phrase records are required to provide
the plain language phrase for printing on DoD single line item release/receipt document, DD
Form 1348-1A. LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity is responsible for loading,
changing, or deleting type cargo phrase records. (See Para 8.249 for CPH, Type Cargo Phrase
Load/Change/Delete input format.)
8.141.5. Exception Phrase Record (EPR). The basis for all exception code management is the
exception phrase record (EPR). The EPR supporting shipment exception codes is used to justify
and explain the reason for assigned shipment exceptions. When normal shipment procedures do
not satisfy local, MAJCOM, or source of supply requirements, Stock Control personnel may use
a combination of exception (SEX) codes, shipment modifiers, and shipment overrides to restrict
or modify out-bound base shipments. See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 8 for more information
concerning exception phrase record creation and management.
8.141.6. Exception Notice Code (ENC). The exception notice code (ENC) is contained on each
exception phrase record (EPR) in the retail supply system. The ENC is used to augment
individual SEX codes and is used to either stop (ENC R) or allow (ENC P) shipment processing
under special conditions. Exception notice code R will “reject” any attempt to automatically ship
the item. Exception notice code P will “process” and produce a notice of shipment. See AFH 23-
123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 8 for more information.
8.142. Use of Exception Code.
8.142.1. Exception Processing. The exception code on the item record identifies the applicable
exception phrase record for exception processing of excess, issue, requisition, and shipping
transactions for that item.
8.142.2. Meanings of Codes R and P. These codes either prevent or permit processing.
1080                                        AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

8.142.2.1. If the code in the exception phrase record is R, a notice (the phrase on the exception
phrase record) will be printed out and the input will be rejected. Note: In order to process under
these conditions, the input document must contain an exception code equal to the code in the
record.
8.142.2.2. If the code is P, the notice will be printed out but the input will process.
8.142.3. Assignment of Codes. Exception codes 1-9, requisition exception code (REX) O, and
certain alpha codes are assigned by HQ USAF. Other exception codes may be assigned by major
commands and bases.
8.142.4. Printing. To cause PRINTING of exception phrases on issue and turn-in, use an
asterisk (*) in the first position of the exception phrase field. An asterisk (*) in the first position
of the exception phrase record on shipments will produce shipment override data.
8.143. Loading the Exception Phrase.
8.143.1. To load an exception phrase record:
8.143.2. Transaction Identification Code. For this code (positions 1-3), enter FXR.
8.143.3. Exception Phrase. The exception phrase cannot be over 35 digits in length and will be
entered beginning with position 18. Unneeded positions will be left blank.
8.143.4. Exception Code. Enter assigned exception code. Check the appropriate code in AFH
23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 before loading the phrase record.
8.143.5. Exception Notice Code. This code must be P or R.
8.143.6. Exception Flag. This code identifies to the program the area of the record that a given
phrase applies to. An E will be used for excess processing, I for issue, R for requisitioning, and
S for shipping. This code does not appear in the record.
8.143.7. Action Code. For this code (position 80), enter L.
8.144. Loading Override Records.
8.144.1. Exception Phrase Records. Exception phrase records loaded to override requisition
/shipping data are identified by an asterisk (*) in the first and/or second position of the exception
phrase. These records are set up by processing FXR input (see Para 8.248 for format).
CAUTION: Use extreme care when loading override records to ensure that all data elements
entered are compatible with each other and with MILSTRIP. Also, use extreme care when
assigning the REX codes to item records to ensure compatibility with item record data. AFMC
SCM-R Stock Control Activity will manage override records and will maintain exception control
formats (ECC) for each record loaded (. AFMC SCM STOCK CONTROL ACTIVITY Stock
Control controls all changes, additions, and deletions.
8.144.2. Requisition Override Records. Requisition override records are used by the requisition
programs. Internal edits are performed on FXR load inputs as follows:
8.144.2.1. Stock replenishment flag in position 18 must be an asterisk (*) if the input code
applies to requisitions for stock replenishment. If the code does not apply to this, leave it blank.
8.144.2.2. Due-out requisition flag in position 19 must be an asterisk (*) if the input code
applies to requisitions for due-outs. If the code does not apply, leave it blank.
8.144.2.3. Project code in positions 20-22 must be alpha-numeric. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch
2.
8.144.2.4. System designator in positions 23-24 must be two numerics other than zeros, or any
combination of alphanumeric.
8.144.2.5. RIC in positions 25-8 must be equal either to a routing identifier record loaded or to
three blanks.
8.144.2.6. Forward supply point category code in position 28 must equal 1, 2, 3, or be blank.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1081

8.144.2.7. MICAP source of supply override in position 29 must equal a Y if the item record
routing identifier is to be used; otherwise leave blank.
8.144.2.8. Urgency of need designator A source of supply override in position 30 must equal a
Y if the item record routing identifier is to be used; otherwise leave blank.
8.144.2.9. The ship-to/bill-to supplementary address in positions 33-36 may be blank or contain
any valid ship-to address. This field is not edited by the program (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch
2). This field will not be used for local use (Y in position 33).
8.144.2.10. Priority designator in positions 37-38 must be either two numerics within the range
of 01 through 20 or blank.
8.144.2.11. Lateral requisition flag in position 39 must be 1 (one) or blank. If a 1, the

requisition.
8.144.2.12. Advice code in positions 40-41 must be one numeric followed by one alphanumeric
or two blanks (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2).
8.144.2.13. Project name in positions 42-51 will be the project name, if applicable, or left blank.
8.144.2.14. TEX code in position 52 may be blank, 7, or R. Requisition programs store the TEX
code contained in the TEX code field in position 72 of the requisition. This applies if the advice
code is 6X or 6Y.
8.144.3. Shipping Override Records. The shipments program uses the shipping override
records. Specific entries in the FXR load input are:
8.144.3.1. Enter an asterisk (*) in position 18 to indicate an override record.
8.144.3.2. Enter a 1 (one) in position 19 to identify items supported by centralized repair facility
(CRF). When this flag is ON, any pre-post turn-in with MATC 1-7 will be changed to Not
Reparable This Station (NRTS) D and shipped to the activity reflected on the override record.
The output documents will also reflect the project code and priority from the override record.
Enter an asterisk (*) to delete the flag.
8.144.3.3. Enter the SRAN of the IM to receive credit in positions 20-25 (two alphas followed
by four numerics). This entry will be printed on the DD Form 1348-1A shipping document.

1082                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

a. Ship reparable to the centralized repair activity using maintenance action-taken codes
(MATC) 1 through 7. If this flag is ON, reparables with MATC 1-7 will be shipped or reported
to the activity specified by RIMCS--unless modified by TEX or SEX code. If a 1 is used, then
positions 32-33 must be equal to FB or FG.
b. Produce only one book of shipment documents.
c. Shipment suspense detail records are not required for this ship-to SRAN. Shipped-but-not-
credited detail records will continue to be created when appropriate.
d. Enter a 1 to turn On this flag and an asterisk (*) to delete it.
e. When no ship-to SRAN is used, the program will use ship-to SRAN assigned to the repair
cycle record.
Note: If any of the data does not apply to a specific REX or SEX code, leave it blank. If the
input does not meet the edits, the input will reject.

8.145. Changing the Exception Phrase Record. If you need to change either a phrase or the
exception notice code, input a format the same way you would load an exception phrase record,
position 80 is L. For example, the phrase you want to change is for exception code A and it
reads DO NOT ISSUE. To change it to read ISSUE ONLY QUANTITIES OF 1, you would
input a load the same way you would if exception code A were not already loaded. You have to
be certain that the new phrase applies to the item records having the same code that appeared
under the old phrase. Note: You must complete all fields or the input will be rejected.
8.146. Deleting the Exception Phrase Record.
8.146.1. Clear Before Deletion. Delete the exception phrase record only after the exception
codes have been deleted from all item records.
8.146.2. Codes. To delete an exception phrase record, the following fields of the input must be
entered as indicated.
8.146.2.1. TRIC. Enter FXR (positions 1-3).
8.146.2.2. Exception code. Enter the exception code.
8.146.2.3. Exception flag. Enter the exception flag that is no longer applicable: E for excess, I
for issue, R for requisitioning, and S for shipping.
8.146.3. Action code. This code must always be D for delete inputs.
8.147. Loading and Deleting the Type Cargo Phrase. The authorized type cargo phrases are
outlined in Para. 8.250. Codes listed as not assigned will be deleted (D in position 8 of the CPH
load input). When a delete input is processed, the load program (NGV290) places the phrase
S050 MGT NO PHRASE in the appropriate record positions in place of an abbreviated phrase
message. Local assignment of type cargo phrase records is not authorized.

Section 8S--Routing Identifier Records (FRI)

8.148. Overview.
8.148.1. Section Summary. This section defines and explains the use of routing identifier
records. It also discusses how routing identifier records are loaded, changed, deleted and
updated. Finally, the section tells how to monitor exception status codes.
8.148.2. Definition of Routing Identifier Records. Routing identifier records are used by the
computer to accumulate the data required to compute order and shipping time (O&ST). These
records also contain management data that help local managers determine if given supply
sources are quickly and efficiently processing their requisitions.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1083


8.149. Maintaining Routing Identifier Records.
8.149.1. Purpose. Routing identifier records must be maintained for each routing identifier code
that is used by system designators 01 and A1 through A9. For system designators B0 through
C9, routing identifier records are not required. All data pertaining to system designators B0
through C9 will be reflected on the system designator 01 routing identifier record.
8.149.2. Routing Identifier Records with No Transactions. During end-of-year Q05, Routing
Identifier Listing/NGV871 processing, routing identifier records with no transactions during the
year should be considered for deletion. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity must
check that no item records or requisition override records contain the routing identifier code that
is to be deleted. Only when that check is done may LRS/AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance
Activity delete the routing identifier record.
8.150. Loading Routing Identifier Records.
8.150.1. Specific Loading Instructions. To load routing identifier records, follow these steps:
8.150.1.1. The TRIC must be FRI.
8.150.1.2. RICs must be authorized. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for a list of authorized
codes. Routing identifiers FPH, JCA, JCK, and JCD are not authorized.
8.150.1.3. System designators must be 01 or A1 through A9, or an 068 reject notice will be
produced.
8.150.1.4. Pipeline time format (PTC) flag is no longer used and should be blank.
8.150.1.5. Status exception code fields may be blank. If blank, status codes BB, BD, BF, BG,
BH, CA, CH, CN, CP, and CS will be assigned by the computer under program control. Status
codes ZA, ZE, ZF, ZG, ZH, ZJ, ZK, ZL, ZM, and ZY will be assigned under program control for
routing identifiers JBB, JB1, JB3, JB4, JB5, and JB6. If status codes other than those outlined
above are required, they must be entered in positions 41-60 of the input. (See chapter AFH 23-
123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for authorized status codes.)
8.150.1.6. Action flag must be L, C, or D, or a reject will occur.
8.150.1.7. Change-to status exception code fields are NOT required on new load inputs.
8.150.1.8. Order and shipping time (O&ST) standard is organized by priority group. The
standard O&ST days are loaded automatically under program control at the time of initial load.
(The standard O&ST days are defined in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.)
8.151. Changing a Routing Identifier Record.
8.151.1. Specific Instructions. To change a routing identifier record, follow these steps:
8.151.1.1. The TRIC must be FRI.
8.151.1.2. A routing identifier record must be loaded for input code or a 181 reject notice will be
produced.
8.151.1.3. A routing identifier record must be loaded for the input system designator or a 181
reject notice will be produced.
8.151.1.4. Pipeline time format (PTC) flag is no longer used and must be blank.
8.151.1.5. The status exception codes that are loaded may be changed. To change all ten status
exception codes, enter the new codes in positions 41-60 of the FRI input. To change or blank a
specific code, you will need to do two things: 1) enter the old code in positions 20-39 of the
input, using the same relative position in which it is loaded on the routing identifier record, and
2) enter the new code or blank the same relative positions in positions 41-60 of the input. If you
elect to change or select LESS than the recommended ten status codes that were loaded at the
time of initial establishment of the routing identifier record, a change input with the desired
changes must be processed. EXAMPLE: If you desire to change CA to ZR and you want to
1084                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

blank CH, you would enter CA in positions 20-21, CH in positions 22-23, and ZR in positions
41-42 and blanks in pos. 43-44. When changing a status code, you need not input in the same
sequence used to load the routing identifier record. When a change is processed, any data
already stored on these areas in the computer will be reset to zero. That is, the data changed to
zero will be lost.
8.151.1.6. The action flag must be C.
8.152. Deleting a Routing Identifier Record.
8.152.1. Specific Instructions. To delete routing identifier records, follow these steps:
8.152.1.1. The TRIC must be FRI.
8.152.1.2. Enter the routing identifier code that you want to delete. A 181 reject notice will be
produced if the routing identifier record is not loaded.
8.152.1.3. Enter the system designator that you want to delete. A 181 reject notice will be
produced if the routing identifier record is not loaded for the system designator.
8.152.1.4. The action flag must be D.
8.153. Routing Identifier Update.
8.153.1. The routing identifier record is updated as follows:
8.153.2. Command Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and the Command Retention Quantity.
These data elements are loaded by processing the demand data (FCL) input (see AFMAN 23-
122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure). These data elements also are used by the requirements
program.
8.153.3. Number of Requisitions Submitted by Priority Groups. These fields are updated by the
requisition programs--SPR, FRC, stock and due-out requisitioning.
8.153.4. Distribution Table by Priority Group. These fields will be updated by ONE for each
receipt processed, based first on priority and then on the difference between the date the item
was ordered and the current requisition date on the computer.
8.153.5. Total O&ST Days by Priority Group. These fields will be updated by the receipt
program based on the priority and the computed difference between the requisition date and the
current requisition date. Only those receipts that fall within the 175% of the Uniform Materiel
Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) standards for your location will be
accumulated. (For continental United States/overseas (CONUS/overseas) standards.) Those
receipts that exceed 175 percent of the standard will not be included.
8.153.6. O&ST Standard by Priority Group. These fields are used by the requirements program
when computing demands. These fields are updated by program Q05, Routing Identifier Listing,
when 100 or more receipts have been processed for a given priority group. These fields are
updated unless the bypass flag is ON. Once the bypass flag is ON, program Q05 will print the
new data for local management to review.
8.153.7. O&ST Standard for Air Investment. This field is NOT updated by the Q05. The
O&ST for air investment items is computed by the ALC and is passed to the base SRAN by
means of a DIC 7H7, Base O&ST input. The same rules apply to this field as for O&ST
standard by priority group. The field will not be updated if bypass flag is ON.
8.153.8. Bypass Update Flag. These fields are used to suppress automatic update of the O&ST
standard by priority group and air investment items when processing the Q05. If these fields are
used, Stock Control must ensure that the listing is reviewed so that the computed data versus the
exception data are accurate.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                      1085

8.153.9. Base Location Code. This code is assigned by the computer under program control at
the time of load of a routing identifier record. This code is also used by the Q05 and the receipt
programs to determine the proper O&ST standards.
8.153.10. On Time Status. These fields will be updated upon receipt of status for priority
groups I and II requisitions when FEWER THAN 3 days have passed from the date the item was
ordered and the status processing date. In addition, the on time status fields will be updated
when FEWER THAN 6 days have passed between the date the item was ordered and the status
processing date for priority group III requisitions.
8.153.11. Delayed Status. These fields will be updated upon receipt of status when the status
processing date is 3 DAYS OR MORE from the requisition date for priority groups I and II
requisitions. These fields will also be updated for priority group III requisitions when the status
processing date is 6 DAYS OR MORE from the requisition date.
8.153.12. Based Initiated Cancellations. These fields will be updated when processing an
external request for due-in cancellation by way of a transaction exception (TEX) code E.
8.153.13. Requirements Initiated Cancellations. These fields will be updated during processing
of the releveling program when requesting due-in cancellation due to excess requirements.
8.153.14. Depot Confirmed Cancellation. These fields will be updated upon receipt of BQ, B4,
B6, ZF, and ZL status code in DIC AE1.
8.153.15. Depot Cancellation. These fields will be updated upon receipt of an FA, FB, FC, FJ,
FR, FK, ZA, ZE, ZG, ZH, ZJ, ZK, ZM, ZR, and ZY when a due-in detail record is in the
computer for the status requisition number.
8.153.16. Depot Rejects. These fields will be updated upon receipt of a CJ, CK, CL, CM, CN,
CP, CQ, CS, CT, CU, CW, CX, F2, FO, FP, FU, FX, FY, FF, FM, FG, FL, FN, CV, CG, CH,
CR, CA, CD, and CY when a due-in detail record is in the computer for the status requisition
number.
8.153.17. Follow-up Submitted Without Status. These fields will be updated internally under
program control during the processing of inline follow-up. These fields will also be updated
when an externally prepared FLP, Follow-up Action Record or AFC, MILSTRIP EAD Modifier
is processed for which a due-in detail record exists.
8.153.18. Follow-up Submitted with Status. These fields will be updated internally under
program control during the processing of program NGV588, Requisition Inline Follow-up, and
program NGV598, Depot Reconciliation Follow-up (Q12). These fields are updated when a
status detail record OTHER THAN a follow-up status detail record exists--for example, 99, 98.
Also, these fields are updated when an externally prepared FLP or AFC is processed and a status
detail record other than a follow-up status detail record exists.
8.153.19. Number of BAO, Base to Source Requisition Reconciliation Submitted. This field
will be updated when processing an AN1 Reconciliation request.
8.153.20. Number of Reconciliation Responses Received with BF Status. This field will be
updated when processing an AE1, Supply Status with BS status.
8.153.21. Number of Reconciliation Responses Received with BS Status. This field will be
updated when an AP1, Reconciliation Response image is output as a result of processing the
AN2 reconciliation.
8.153.22. Number of Reconciliation Responses Received with BR Status. This field will be
updated for every AP1 image output when processing program GV598, Depot Reconciliation
Follow-Up (Q12).
1086                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

8.153.23. Status Code Exceptions. These fields will allow local management to monitor up to
ten status codes. For example, if one base is monitoring a problem with BF status from a source,
another base can monitor a BS status from that same source at the same time.
8.154. Monitoring Exception Status Codes. If you elect to monitor exception status codes, all
the status code counter fields can be blanked at once, only during end-of-year processing using
the Routing Identifier Listing, Q05. Any other time, these fields can only be blanked by
processing FRI change inputs (position 40 equals C). To blank a status counter, you must enter
the new status codes in positions 41-60 and in the same relative position of the status exception
code field on the routing identifier record. If you elect not to monitor exception status codes
when loading a new routing identifier record, you must process FRI change input to blank the
exception status codes.

Section 8T--Requests For Stocklist Data

8.155. Overview. This section describes AF IMT 86 procedures. Use the AF IMT 86 to request
assignment of a NSN for items not yet in the Federal Cataloging System, and to request
cataloging data actions on existing NSNs. Items registered in the Federal Cataloging System
offer some or all of the following benefits: multiple sources of supply, competitive prices,
increased standardization, and increased supply availability for other using activities. All AF
personnel will use the AF IMT 86. The AF IMT 86 is for internal Air Force use only and will
not be forwarded to any other service or agency. AFMC SCM-R Records Maintenance is
responsible for controlling, processing and following up on AF IMT 86 requests.
8.156. General Request Procedures.
8.156.1. Identifying and Researching Candidate Items. Identify candidate items for an AF IMT
86, according Para 8.261. Primary sources of candidates are SBSS management notices, such as
the I104, 034, F470, F471, F473 and F474. SBSS should be regularly generating these notices
for active supply accounts; investigate non-receipt of these management notices. Research
candidates to ensure appropriateness of an AF IMT 86 submission. Research includes, but is not
limited to: 1) contacting users to verify expected future demand and usage/application of the
item 2) obtaining required descriptive and technical information.
8.156.1.1. (Added-AMC) Customer Support Liaison, Records Maintenance function maintains
the AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action, control register. A locally automated
program may be used. The following is the minimum information required:
8.156.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Control number (base routing identifier, last position of current
calendar year and a 4-digit numeric serial number).
8.156.1.1.2. (Added-AMC) National Stock Number, part number or reference number.
8.156.1.1.3. (Added-AMC) Date of submission.
8.156.1.1.4. (Added-AMC) Reason code.
8.156.1.1.5. (Added-AMC) Follow-up date.
8.156.1.1.6. (Added-AMC) Remarks.
8.156.2. Preparation and Submission of AF IMT 86. Prepare the AF IMT 86 as follows:
8.156.2.1. Reason Code. Select a valid reason code, according to Para 8.261.
8.156.2.2. Federal Supply Class. Research the item using D043, FEDLOG, Customer
Assistance Handbook, and/or Cataloging Handbooks H2-1, H2-2, and H2-3.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1087

8.156.2.3. Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC). Assign a MMAC. For items
classified in FSG 14, 15, and 18 and FSC 2810, 2840, 2845, 4935, and 4960, assign a MMAC
according to the guidelines in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
8.156.2.4. AF IMT 86 Recipient. In general, submit AF IMTs 86 to the AFMC Cataloging and
Standardization Center (AFMC/A4IS). Use the FSC/MMAC and Para 8.262 to determine the
AF IMT 86 recipient.
8.156.2.5. AF IMT 86 Preparation. Prepare and submit the AF IMT 86 to AFMC/A4IS using
the D143C data system whenever possible. See Para 8.260 for D143C usage instructions.
AFMC/A4IS and the ALCs use D143C for processing and tracking all AF IMT 86 requests.
Hard copy (long) AF IMTs 86 must be submitted to activities other than AFMC/A4IS (see Para
8.262). (See Para 8.257 for preparation instructions.) Note: An automated AF IMT 86 (a
mechanical AF IMT 86 prepared using SBSS-generated screens) is available, but use is
discouraged.
8.156.2.6. Mail any additional technical data required to justify the request to DLA Information
Service, 74 Washington Ave N, Suite 7, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 or email:
dlacontactcenter.dla.mil Examples of additional data include technical order (TO) numbers with
figure and index, drawings, brochures, catalogs, or other identifying material. Note: When
using the hard copy AF IMT 86, attach and mail the technical data with the hard copy AF IMT
86.
8.156.2.7. General Process. Typically, the AF IMT 86 is forwarded to AFMC/A4IS.
AFMC/A4IS will review the request and forward it to the responsible AF cataloging activity,
typically an item manager (IM) or equipment specialist (ES) at an AFMC Air Logistics Center
(ALC). If the item's Integrated Materiel Manager (IMM) is non Air Force (for example, DLA,
GSA, or another military service), the Air Force IM or ES will first review the request. If
approved, the IM or ES will prepare a supply support request (SSR) and submit the SSR to the
other agency for review and consideration. Note: An AF IMT 86 initiated by a field or base
activity is only a request. Final authority for approval is the IMM/cataloging activity with
management responsibility for the end article/weapons system or Federal Supply Class involved.
8.156.2.8. Status/Completion Codes. D143C allows you at any time to determine the location
and status of your request on-line (see Para 8.258). AFMC/A4IS and the ALCs use D143C for
processing your AF IMT 86 request. You should also receive an ADRSSBBS (Response Format
for Short AF IMT 86 messages when status changes.
8.157. Exceptions to AF IMT 86 Submissions. Most procedural exceptions are noted in Para
8.257, Para 8.261, and Para 8.262.
8.158. Submitting Data Requests. There are four ways to submit a request for cataloging data.
You may submit a standard AF IMT 86, use the mechanical (short) AF IMT 86, use the
automated (short/long) AF IMT 86, or use the direct dial-up to the D143C system.
8.159. Mechanized (Short) AF IMT 86.
8.159.1. Definition and Formats. The mechanized AF IMT 86 is a data systems input which is
prepared according to this paragraph and submitted via the ADRSS/ADRSS II to the D143C
system at Wright-Patterson AFB located in Dayton, Ohio. AFMC/A4IS will access D143C
online to review the requests. Para 8.259 provides the instructions for preparing the ADRSS
header card. The mechanized format is prepared according to Para 8.253, Para 8.254, and Para
8.255. Use the short AF IMT 86 when the following occurs:
8.159.1.1. The I104 management notice is against a P number and the part number has fewer
than 33 positions.
1088                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014

8.159.1.2. You receive an 034 management notice as a result of processing a stock list change
input received through SNUD with phrase code N (Disposal) or source of supply code JCD
(Delete) and a requirement for the item exists.
8.159.1.3. BVD 3, 5, 6, or 8 inputs, Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC) Screening Results
are received through SNUD which indicates that the NSN is inactive or not an Air Force interest
item.
8.159.1.4. Indicative data changes are received through SNUD (acquisition advice code, unit of
issue) which are suspected to be incorrect. When ERRCDs are suspected to be incorrect, the
procedures outlined in paragraph 166 must be used.
8.159.2. File Management. When you prepare the mechanized AF IMT 86, duplicate all inputs
and place them in an active file in control number sequence. A base may duplicate an extra copy
of the inputs and maintain a separate file in NIIN sequence. The base can then use this file along
with the control log to check previous submissions, etc. All response inputs (TRIC BBS) will be
filed behind the original inputs. When you receive the AFMC completion input, record the date
received and pull all the inputs from the active file and transfer them to the completed file.
8.159.3. Reviews. Semiannually, the file control log will be reviewed and all completed
requests over 90 days will be destroyed. The completion date (that is, the date the completion
card was received) will be used to determine the age criteria. Note: The extra file in NIIN
sequence can be sorted in control number sequence and purged at this time.
8.160. Short AF IMT 86 Follow-up.
8.160.1. Notification. The D143C system located at WPAFB is the system which directly
receives all mechanized requests and generates responses to the initiating base for both the
mechanized and the hard copy requests. This system for processing catalog requests is used for
three reasons: 1) to see if a request has been received; 2) to track the request through its
processing life; and 3) to notify bases automatically of request action (including delays). The
system is programmed to immediately notify the initiator of receipt (an initial estimated
completion date (ECD) will be received with acknowledgment of receipt); however, there will be
approximately a two-week delay from the time the base mails the request to WPAFB and
acknowledgment is received by the initiator.
8.160.1.1. Suspension. The hard copy is manually suspended in the D143C by WPAFB
personnel shortly after receipt.
8.160.1.2. Tracking. The D143C will track all requests until completion and provide the
initiator with automatic notification of status changes through BBS response each time the
location of the request changes, each time the ECD is changed, and so on. Formats for BBS
responses are contained in Para 8.256 and the completion codes are contained in Para 8.258.
8.160.2. Follow-up Criteria and Procedures. A response should be received from the D143C
system within 30 days of submission, confirming the AF IMT 86 is in suspense.
8.160.2.1. When bases have not received initial notification within 30 days of submission, they
should exercise follow-up capability. If an unmatched response is received from the follow-up
and catalog action is still desired, the base must initiate another transaction with a new control
number.
8.160.2.2. If final action is not received within 45 days subsequent to the ECD, a follow-up
should be initiated. If no final action or revised ECD is received as a result of the follow-up,
additional follow-ups will be submitted in 30-day increments.
8.160.2.3. If after three follow-ups a final action or revised ECD has not been received, forward
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1089

a message to todd.newhart@wpafb.af.mil, DSN 674-0121, commercial (937) 904-0121. Be sure
to include the AF Form 86 control number, the FSC or NSN, the ECD, and the dates of the three
follow-ups.
8.161. Processing the Long AF IMT 86.
8.161.1. FSG and FSC Items. The hard (long) copy AF IMT 86 is a written document which is
mailed directly to the responsible cataloging activity. Items classified in FSG 14, 15, and 18 and
FSC 2810, 2840, 2845, 4935, and 4960 will be assigned a MMAC according to the guidelines in
AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.
8.161.2. Submission Requirements. Para 8.257 provides the required format. A hard copy
must be submitted when the following conditions exist:
8.161.2.1. A part number exceeds the number of positions allowed (32 positions) in the
mechanized formats (see Para 8.253).
8.161.2.2. An ERRC review is submitted. (Reason code 9) Note: When submitting a reason
code 9, request for ERRC review, the remarks must contain the proposed ERRC and rationale for
the suggested change. If the request is for verification only, and no change to the existing ERRC
is being proposed, the remarks block should reflect REQUEST VERIFICATION OF EXISTING
ERRC.
8.161.2.3. Additional data are to be attached to the AF IMT 86 (such as technical data, copies of
TOs, and the like) to provide justification for the request.
8.161.2.4. A reason code 3 or 4 is submitted.
8.161.2.5. A base activity does not have ADRSS capability.
8.161.2.6. A request is forwarded to any cataloging activity other than the AFMC.
8.162. Processing the Automated (Short/Long) AF IMT 86.
8.162.1. Preparing the automated short/long AF IMT 86. The automated short/ long AF IMT 86
input is initiated by calling #BZ/474, the AF IMT 86 menu, and selecting the required BZ input.
The image is submitted through SIFS to the D143C system at WPAFB, Ohio. The automated
format is prepared according to Para 8.253, Para 8.253, section B, Para 8.253, section C, Para
8.254, and Para 8.255 using the following screens.
8.162.1.1. #BZ/474 (AF IMT 86 menu) - Used to select desired BZ input.
8.162.1.2. #BZA(Short AF IMT 86-Record 1 and 2/475 - Program 418 will use the data input on
this screen to create the BZA1 and BZA2 screens (see Para 8.253).
8.162.1.3. #BZA1/476 - This screen contains the data that program 418 retrieved from the BZA
data input. (See Para 8.253 for input information.)
8.162.1.4. #BZA2/477 - This screen is automatically called by program 418 when the BZA1
screen is input. (See Para 8.253 for input information.)
8.162.1.5. #BZA3/487 - This screen contains the data for submitting the long AF IMT 86 for
reason codes 3, 4, or 9 items. (See section B, Para 8.253, section C, Para 8.257, and Para
8.261 for input information.)
8.162.1.6. #BZA4/488 - This screen contains the optional data for the long AF IMT 86. (See
Para 8.253, section C, Para 8.257, and Para 8.261 for input information.)
8.162.1.7. #BZB1 (CMD Review Request Using Short AF IMT 86)/478 - See Para 8.254 to
prepare the BZB1 image.
8.162.1.8. #BZB2/479 - See Para 8.255 to prepare the BZB2 image.
8.162.2. Printing and transmitting the short/long AF IMT 86. Once the image is transmitted, a
hard copy of the AF IMT 86 is printed, and the image is sent to the 2-hr-card queue. The SIFS
1090                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

outbound dispatcher program will consolidate these images in a gang unique file [gang
#]GV*GV418UD801 for non-DLATS routing to Battle Creek, Michigan.
8.162.3. Processing the BBS image through pseudo. See Para 8.256 for an explanation of
AFMC responses on BBS inbound. Program 418 will output a management notice (F038) for
offline action when SIFS passes the BBS image to pseudo for processing.
8.163. Canceling AF IMT 86. To request a cancellation of both long and short versions of AF
IMT 86, use the following procedure: 1) duplicate the original AF IMT 86 submitted; 2) print
the word DELETE across its face; and 3) mail the duplicate to AFMC/A4IS. AFMC/A4IS will
confirm the cancellation in a BBS response input with a completion code of Z in position 75 and
the word PURGE in position 76-80.
8.164. Base-Initiated AF IMT 86 Using the AF DLIS Editing And Routing System (D143C).
The AF DLIS Editing and Routing System (D143C) provides the LRS/ Materiel Management
Activity users the capability to enter requests for cataloging directly by usage of a dial-up
process (see Para 8.260). This method allows you to track your request and know its status
throughout the process. It will also provide a quicker response to your request because it will go
to a technician for immediate action when it is entered.

Section 8U-- Reparable Item Movement Control System (RIMCS)

8.165. Overview. The RIMCS is designed to ensure that items in need of repair are sent to the
nearest appropriate repair activity. It allows for documentation of all AF repair activities,
including items requiring special handling (exception phrase records) and the shipping program,
used for documentation of destinations for items needing repair. All of these points are covered
in this is section for input/output formats and special codes and data elements). The AFMC
SCM-R Records Maintenance Activity loads RIMCS data.
8.166. Aspects of the Control System.
8.166.1. Unserviceable Items. Instructions for disposition of XD/ND items will be forwarded to
each base by AFMC on BDR/BV8 inputs through SNUD.
8.166.2. Accurate Data. Data disseminated by AFMC.
8.166.3. Record Loading, Changing. The BDR or BV8 format is used to load, change, and
delete the following data on repair cycle records:
8.166.3.1. Reparable destination/disposition code
8.166.3.2. Priority designator for unserviceable shipments
8.166.3.3. Mark-for for unserviceable shipments
8.166.3.4. Project number for unserviceable shipments
8.167. Base Processing of BDR/BV8 Inputs.
8.167.1. Quick Handling. BDR or BV8 inputs received from AFMC should be input to the
computer as soon as received and not held up for input with other SNUD data.
8.167.2. Multiple Ship-To Account Codes. Inputs with more than one ship-to account code will
generate an F006 reject notice (see Ch 7). You will need to screen these inputs against DLM
4000.25-1 to determine the nearest ship-to point or the following link for shipping address for the
applicable DODAAC. Reference AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2. If the nearest ship-to account is in
positions 32-37, enter a 1 in position 77 and reprocess. If the account is in positions 38-40, enter
a 2 in position 77 and reprocess. If the nearest ship-to account is in positions 44-49, enter a 3 in
position 77 and reprocess.
8.168. Local Processing of BDR/BV8 Inputs.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1091

8.168.1. Locally Prepared Inputs. Locally prepared BDR or BV8 inputs will be in the same
format as inputs received from AFMC. The following is a list of four situations you might
encounter and the appropriate responses:
8.168.1.1. Shipping destination loaded. If the input reparable item movement control code
authorizes automatic shipment and the shipping destination record for the ship-to account is
loaded, the applicable repair cycle records will be changed to reflect 1) the ship-to account code,
2) the priority designator for unserviceable shipments, 3) the mark-for information, and 4) the
project number.
8.168.1.2. Shipping destination not loaded. If the input reparable item movement control code
authorizes automatic shipment and the shipping destination record for the ship-to account is
NOT loaded, the program will create a shell shipping destination record. It will then update the
applicable repair cycle records with 1) the ship-to account code, 2) the priority designator for
unserviceable shipments, 3) the mark-for information, and 4) the phrase F012 MGT
COMPLETE SHELL SHIP DESTINATION RECORD FOR (SHIP-TO-SRAN) on line three.
The RID/ship-to-account-code must be added to the RID/AAC record by input of RDC. (See
section 8W, this chapter, for RDC input format.)
8.168.1.3. Automatic shipment not authorized. If the input reparable item movement control
code does NOT authorize automatic shipment, the priority designator for shipments, the mark-for
information, and project fields will be blanked. DSP, RPT will be stored in the reparable
destination/disposition code field, depending on the input of reparable item movement control
code on the applicable repair cycle records.
8.169. Non-repair Cycle Item Processing. The computer will ignore BDR or BV8 inputs for
nonrepair cycle items during inline processing. The reparable item movement control system
(RIMCS) provides a “ship to" destination for most items assigned ERRC "XD1 "XD2" and
"XD3" which have a “BDR" RIMCS record. "XD" items may be assigned a RIMCS control code
which either directs the user to report an item to the inventory management specialist (IMS) for
disposition instructions or dispose of the item. A small percentage of "XF3" items and a small
number of "XB3" items are also in RIMCS.
8.170. Bases With Satellites. Under some conditions, reparable destination data on satellite
records may not be the same as the data on the base records. For example, a reparable item may
have to be returned to the support base before other disposition, or a satellite may be closer to a
different ship-to point than the support base.
8.171. Updating Records.
8.171.1. Automatic Updating. When BDR or BV8 inputs are input as received from AFMC, all
repair cycle records with the input stock number will be updated regardless of system designator.
8.171.2. Limiting Updating. To limit updating to certain records, BDR or BV8 inputs must have
the local control code in position 78 and/or the satellite system designator in 79-80 (see Para
8.263).
8.172. Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Program.
8.172.1. Code G. RIMCS control code G is assigned to identify NSNs that are under the RIW
program. The main purpose of RIMCS control code G is to ensure that all reparable assets for
the stock number are shipped to the manufacturer and not repaired at base or depot.
8.172.2. Code G Processing. RIMCS control code G is pushed to the base through the SNUD
system. When it is processed at base level, it will store the G in the RIW program code and
REPR-ITEM-DISP-FLG of the repair cycle record. It will also set the item record RIW program
1092                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

flag to a 1. Code G automatically removes base repair organization code and shop code from the
repair cycle record. This action will occur on all system designators for the input stock number.
8.172.3. Code G Termination. If AFMC pushes BDR or BV8 inputs to remove RIMCS control
code G designation from the repair cycle and item records, FRR inputs must be prepared and
used to enter the appropriate base repair organization and shop code.

Section 8V--Repair Cycle Record Update (FRR)

8.173. Overview. This section describes the use of the FRR input to load, change, delete, or
inquiry indicative and quantitative data on the repair cycle record.
8.174. Loading/Content/Purpose.
8.174.1. Loading. A repair cycle record is loaded automatically any time an item record with an
ERRCD of XD or XF is loaded. A separate repair cycle record is established for each eligible
item record with a different stock number or system designator.
8.174.2. Content.
8.174.2.1. Repair/maintenance. The repair cycle record is a record of repair and maintenance
actions taken. In most instances, updating of this material takes place under program control.
This occurs automatically when items are turned in and their replacements are requested or
issued.
8.174.2.2. Exception repair cycle. The exception repair cycle days field is to be used only when
the requirements specified AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4C, Repair are satisfied.
8.174.2.3. Designated base repair activity. The repair cycle record contains an organization and
shop code for designated repair activities. This field identifies the on-base activity that is
responsible for repairing the repair cycle asset. When this field is correctly loaded, all reparable
turn-ins and receipts will be sent to the designated base repair activity, unless the turn-in is from
the base repair activity. If an off-base centralized repair activity has been established, the
designated base repair activity should not be loaded. The base repair activity is loaded, changed,
or deleted with the FRR input by the LRS. The purpose of the FRR input is to load, change, or
delete exception repair cycle days and to adjust any of the repair cycle record balance fields by
adding to, subtracting from, or zeroing the field. The FRR input may also be used to upgrade the
designated (base) repair activity. CAUTION: Be careful when working with this input because
any changes in the repair cycle record fields may cause releveling to occur. When an FRR input
contains erroneous data, the computed demand level will be incorrect. In addition, use of zeros
in the repair cycle days field will cause the repair cycle quantity portion of the demand level to
become zero.
8.174.2.4. Two-level maintenance (2LM). This field is used to identify those items slated for
Agile Logistics (AL)/2LM requisitioning. The 2LM codes authorized are A, B, C, or D (see
AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for additional information).
8.175. Processing of Repair Cycle Fields.
8.175.1. Record Adjustments. You can adjust the repair cycle fields by using the appropriate
action code and quantity for balance fields. For all other fields, the data entered in the input is
what will be reflected on the record (see Para 8.265 and Para 8.266).
8.175.2. Editing. Prior to processing, the FRR input is internally edited to ensure it passes
program edits. A reject condition in any input field will cause the entire input to be rejected. To
ensure ease-of-use, the following conditions must be met.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1093

8.175.2.1. Input from a satellite terminal must have the same system designator (positions 6-7)
as the system designator assigned to the satellite.
8.175.2.2. Input action code must be A, S, or Z for any inputs affecting balance fields.
8.175.2.3. Input action quantity may not be zero or blank for action codes A or S. For action
code Z, the input action quantity field will be ignored.
8.175.2.4. When the input stock number is loaded in an ISG, all records containing the same
ISG number are updated for the input system designator. This applies ONLY to the org, shop,
SRAN, project code, ship priority, NRTS-1 indicator, and 2LM fields. All other fields will
update ONLY the repair cycle record requested in the input, based on system designator and
stock number.
8.175.2.5. The inquiry option provides the flexibility to view what is currently loaded on the
repair cycle record. This option can only be used in conjunction with screens #485 or #486.
Also, the INQUIRY ONLY fields on screen #485 cannot be changed with the FRR input. These
fields are updated by other programs and are provided for the sole purpose of displaying relevant
and commonly-used repair cycle data.
8.175.3. Editing of Action Quantity Field. During processing, each action quantity field is
edited as follows:
8.175.3.1. If the quantity to be added would cause decimal overflow, a 193 reject will be
produced indicating the field in error.
8.175.3.2. If the quantity to be subtracted would cause a negative balance, a 193 reject will be
produced indicating the field in error.

Section 8W--Routing Identifier Code (RIC) To Department Of Defense Address Activity
Code (DODAAC) Conversion Record Load/Change/Delete

8.176. Overview.
8.176.1. Conversion of RIC to DODAAC. This section explains how to convert a RIC to a
DODAAC conversion record. The uniform methods outlined here are used to convert the SBSS
RIC to the appropriate DODAAC, that is, the one used during tracer actions of the Military
Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures (MILSTAMP). These procedures apply to
all DoD components and participating federal agencies. The AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity is responsible for processing all DODAAC and RID transaction
processing.
8.176.2. Aim of Conversion. This record is used to automate the manual cross-reference RIC to
DODAAC file. It allows an RIC to be converted under program control to the appropriate
DODAAC. This record is NOT system designator oriented.
8.177. Restrictions.
8.177.1. Multiple RICs: Multiple Loading, Single Reference. The program allows multiple
RICs to be loaded to a DODAAC; for example, both RICs FHL and FHZ can be LOADED to
DODAAC FD2040. However, each RIC can refer to only one DODAAC. For instance, FHZ
cannot refer to DODAAC FD2040 and DODAAC FN2040.
8.177.2. Checking of Codes. Load only those codes that are valid and actively supported by the
computer support base or satellite.
8.177.3. Processes for Changing a RIC. If the RIC that refers to a specific DODAAC requires
change, delete the old RIC DODAAC conversion record and load the new record correctly. For
example, an FHZ might have to be changed to FHS for DODAAC FD2040. This processing is
1094                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

required because there is no change-to/from field for the RIC. The load is not restricted to a one-
for-one basis.
8.177.4. Location of RIC to DODAAC Table. The RIC that is applicable to the DODAAC table
may be found in DLM 4000.25-1.
8.178. Mandatory Entries. The following RIC/DODAAC conversion records are required to
support excess returns (FTR) to DLA storage sites:

Table 8.7. RIC/DODAAC Conversion Records.

SRT    SW0400                              SNT    SW3108


8.179. Warehouse Conversion to Supplementary Address. When you have a requisition
delivered to the Decentralized Support Element (DSE) and not to Central Receiving, use the 013
record to assign the FY DODAAC to the supplementary address that is assigned to the DSE.
When requisitions are to be delivered to the DSE, load a RIC to the DODAAC record by using
the first three positions of the warehouse location and the DODAAC assigned to the DSE. The
013 record will provide the requisition program the capability to assign the FY DODAAC as the
supplementary address.

Section 8X--Delivery Destination Record Load, Change, Or Delete (1DE)

8.180. Overview.
8.180.1. Section Summary. This section describes the purpose and use of the transaction
identification code (TRIC) 1DE, Delivery Destination Record Load, Change, or Delete.
8.180.2. Purpose of the Delivery Destination Record. The purpose of this input is to provide
personnel with the capability to load, change, or delete a delivery destination record. This record
contains stored information which the issue and due-out release programs access and then reflect
in the ship-to block of the DD Form 1348-1A. Loading this record identifies the specific
location for property delivery.
8.180.3. Use of the Delivery Destination Record. When the delivery destination record is used,
the date of last transaction is automatically updated. This provides personnel a means of
managing their records.
8.181. Processing of the 1DE Input. Delivery destination records should be loaded for all
organizations and shop codes. Loading a delivery destination record for a delivery destination
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1095

code should only be done when organizations have property delivered to locations other than the
location of the requester.
8.182. Selection Process of the Delivery Destination Record. When an issue or due-out
release is processed, the program first checks to see if it is AWP (Urgency Justification Code
AR/BR). If the item is AWP, then the program will select the AWP delivery destination from
the organization record. (You must ensure that a delivery destination code is loaded with a
delivery destination record for each AWP delivery destination on the organization record.) If it
is not an AWP item, then the program will check the delivery destination (positions 4-6). If the
delivery destination does not have a delivery destination record loaded, or it is blank, the
program will check the organization and shop code (positions 31-35). If the organization and
shop code do not have a delivery destination record loaded, then the program will check the
delivery destination from the applicable organization record. If that is blank, the program will
use the organization title from the applicable organization record.
8.183. Format of the Ship-To Block of The Document. The data on line one is taken from the
OCCR. The data on lines two and three are taken from the delivery destination record (1DE).
8.184. Loading a Delivery Destination Record. Use the 1DE format (Para 8.268) to load
either a delivery destination for the organization code or a delivery destination to be loaded
without an organization code. To load both types of destinations requires the input of two 1DEs
(you cannot load both with one input). When you load either type of delivery destination, you
can use positions 20 through 62 of the 1DE input for local use for on-base organizations,
positions 20-57 for off-base organizations. For example, you can load a separate delivery
destination record for equipment items and use positions 20 through 62 for the name and phone
numbers of the equipment/alternate custodians. Once this is accomplished, their names and
phone numbers will appear on all issue and due-out release documents.

Section 8Y--Exception Code Control (ECC) Codes, Management And Program

8.185. Exception Codes and Exception Code Control (ECC) Management. Exception codes
are assigned to item records and indicate exception processing is necessary when the following
actions are taken: disposing of excess property; requisitioning; shipment; and issues. To load
exception codes, the Stock Control Data Load, Change, and Delete (FCD) transaction is used.
For the FCD transaction format, see AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
8.186. Exception Codes. Exception codes are assigned to item records and maintained as
follows:
8.186.1. Stock Control must maintain an ECC image for each item assigned an exception code,
as specified by the tables of exceptions. Note: When the major command decides an ECC must
be maintained for an item, the major command writes the necessary procedures and include them
as a supplement to AFMAN 23-122.
8.186.2. Maintaining ECC Images. Stock Control maintains ECC images as locally determined.
At a minimum, the expiration date, requester’s name and organization, element responsible for
monitoring the ECC, reason, justification, or cross reference for supporting documentation, plus
any other information desired or directed by the major command will be in the ECC image file.
Include processing instructions if possible.

8.187.1.1.1. Creates text files of the FIL images.
8.187.1.1.2. Forward the images to Computer Operations for processing.
8.187.1.1.3. Corrects reject conditions and take action on management notices from Computer
Operations as necessary (see Ch 7).
8.187.1.1.4. Load SPS with item description on DD Forms 1348-6 for local purchase assets (see
section 8B).
8.187.1.1.5. Review the next day's D04 report for evidence of completed processing. Follow up
with Computer Operations on the images not processed.
8.187.1.2. Activities with Terminals.
8.187.1.2.1. Process the FIL images on the terminal.
8.187.1.2.2. Corrects reject conditions and take action on management notices as necessary (see
Ch 7).
8.187.1.2.3. Load SPS with item description on DD Forms 1348-6 for local purchase assets (see
section 8B).
8.188. Item Record Load Input (FIL).
8.188.1. Purpose. To establish an item record, repair cycle record, and cost record for budget
code 8, 9, and alpha with ERRC Xxx within the SBSS ADS. Budget code 8 cost record is used
for CSAG-S tracking. Budget code 9 and alpha with ERRC Xxx cost records are used for
Inventory Valuation by tracking the Moving Average Cost (MAC) of the inventory. (Para.
8.189. gives definitions of the data elements.)
8.188.2. Input Restrictions. Pseudo or any terminal based upon user-ID and password.
Note: When loading DLA items containing AAC J or Z, also prepare and process a BMC (Stock
List Change) to load the AAC to the item record. The BMC must be prepared immediately after
loading the item record (before releveling can process) so the 90 day EOQ (versus the normal
365 day) logic will be used.
8.188.3. Output. The following output images may be produced. Output SIFS control records
should be set up as indicated.

Notes:
1. NSN. This is the most common type of stock number in the SBSS. Positions 1-4 are the federal
supply class (FSC). Positions 5-13 are the NIIN.
2. NSN with a MMAC. The MMAC appears in positions 14 and 15. Adjunct records, such as dash
one (-1), dash two (-2), CANNOT be assigned to item records with an MMAC.
3. NSN with a Locally Assigned Unit of Issue, or Dash One (-1) Stock Number. The dash one (-1)
appears in positions 14 and 15. Use this format when the stock list unit of issue is too large for local
use. EXAMPLE: Stock number 5530011717705 identifies one type of plywood with a unit of issue
of package (PG), and the quantity per unit of issue is 12 sheets (SH). Therefore, the stock number for
the same item, but with a local unit of issue such as sheet, would be 5530011717705-1. You may also
use the dash one (-1) format when the stock list unit of issue is too small for local use. EXAMPLE:
For compressed gases, cylinder (CY) may be used as a local unit of issue, instead of cubic feet (CF),
to simplify issue and accounting. Remember to include the size of cylinder in the nomenclature field.
Avoid local units of issue that would require local repackaging. Before loading an item record with a
dash one (-1) stock number, you must first load an item record with the basic stock number, unit of
issue, price, etc. When using a dash one number to issue oil with unit of issue quart to the base fuel
station, assign IEX 4 to prevent automatic issue.
Note: The dash one (-1) format cannot be used on MILSTRIP requisitions. Therefore, Stock Control
must adjust the requisition quantity and correct the unit of issue before a MILSTRIP requisition can be
submitted.
4. Dash Two (-2) Stock Number. Dash two (-2) stock numbers for recapped tires must be valid NSN
in FSC 2530 and FSG 26. EXCEPTION: Do not assign dash two (-2) stock numbers to FSC 2620.
5. Dash Nine (-9) Stock Number. Dash nine (-9) item records are overflow adjunct records and are
normally loaded by program control. This format may be used only with valid NSN. The unit of
issue is always MX (one thousand times the basic unit of issue).
6. TCTO Kit (K) Number Assigned by AFMC. Positions 6-7 contain the TO series; 8-12 contain the
kit serial number; 13 contains the kit series; and 14-15 contain the materiel management code if
applicable.
7. Nonlisted (L) Number Assigned by a Base. The L number may be assigned only to items without a
part or reference number. The L appears in position 5. Positions 6-11 contain a six-digit
nonsignificant serial number from the non-NSN serial control register, and 12-15 contain the stock
record account code for the system designator of the item record being loaded. L and P numbers are
not used when type account is equal to P (fuels).
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                    1103


 8. Nonlisted (L) Number Assigned by a Major Command. This format is the same as a base-assigned
 L number (see note 7 above). However, in place of the base stock record account number in positions
 12-15, enter the major command code in position 12 and leave 13 and 14 blank unless a major
 command management code is to be placed there.
 9. Noncataloged (NC) Number Assigned by an ALC Item Manager. Pending Assignment of a NSN.
 Upon the load of a noncataloged stock number, load a part number (TRIC 1AA) using technical order,
 figure, or index. Position 7 is a one-position Air Logistics Center activity code which identifies the
 ALC assigning the NC number. (See Table 8.13). Positions 14 and 15 contain the materiel
 management code (MMAC) if applicable.




Table 8.13. Air Force/Contractor Activity Codes.

Code          Assigning Activities
C             Warner Robins ALC
E             Ogden ALC
F             Oklahoma ALC
J              AFMC Cryptological System Activity
W             Aerospace Fuels
Z             Contractor Support Weapon Systems (CSWS)
10. Nonlisted Stock (ND) Number Assigned by an Item Manager
Where No Further Recurring Demands Are Anticipated. Upon the
load of a nonlisted stock number, load a part number (TRIC 1AA)
using technical order figure or index to provide more efficient
means of identifying additional items that are requisitioned. (See
Para 8.190 for part number load format.) No NSN is assigned.
Position 13 is the single Air Logistics Center designator code,
normally the middle digit of the routing identifier code. (See
Table 8.13.) Positions 14 and 15 contain the MMAC if applicable.
11. Hazardous Waste. A unique SBSS item record will be used to
identify hazardous waste. The item record will consist of the
following elements: Stock Number (for example,
9150PHWF0100020). Positions 1-4 will contain the Federal
Supply Class (FSC) of the original or parent stock number from
which the waste was generated. If the original materiel does not
have a stock number assigned, for example, waste water or sludge,
use FSC 9999. Positions 5-7 will contain a constant PHW. The
HW signifies hazardous waste. Positions 8-11 will contain the
EPA hazardous waste number provided to the waste generating
activity by the environmental function. Under no circumstances
will LRS/Materiel Management Activity determine EPA
hazardous waste numbers unless LRS/Materiel Management
Activity is the generating activity. Positions 12-15 will contain the
four-digit contract line number (CLIN) from the disposal contract
1104                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP           29 JANUARY 2014


for the specific hazardous waste.
12. Part (P) Numbered Item When the Part Number Is Ten Digits
or Less. The letter P is entered in position 5. The part or reference
number begins in position 6 and progresses to the right. If the part
number duplicates a part number already loaded, use a P serialized
number (see note 12). If the stock number contains a P in the fifth
position, enter the CAGE or ZZZZZ in positions 123-18. Do NOT
use the part number when a valid NIIN has been assigned to the
item. For more information about part-numbered items, see
section 8B.
13. P Serialized Numbered Item When the Part Number Exceeds
Ten Digits or Duplicates an Existing Part Number. Positions 6-11
contain a base-assigned serial number from the non-NSN serial
control register. Positions 12-15 contain the stock record account
code for the system designator of the item record being loaded.
14. Dependent School(s) Stock Number. Cataloged items in this
category are published in Dependents Schools Standard
Nomenclature List (DSSNL) of Items Used by Overseas
Dependents Schools. Position 5 of the stock number is always S.
Position 6 designates grade level: 1 is used for grade levels 1
through 8, and 2 for grade levels 9 through 12. Position 7 is a
number identifying the SNL group. Position 8 is an alpha
character identifying the subject matter. Positions 9-11 contain the
item identification number.
15. Special Tools/Test Equipment (X) number assigned by AFMC
repair activities. This format is the same as a base-assigned L
number (see note 7 above) however X appears in position 5.
Positions 6-11 contain a six-digit nonsignificant serial number
from the non-NSN serial control register, and 12-15 contain the
stock record account code for the repair activity of the item record
being loaded.


8.189.6. System Designator (2 DIGIT-A/N, POSITIONS 23-24).
8.189.6.1. The input system designator must be loaded in the base constants-1 record. (See AF
23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3.)
8.189.6.2. Assign system designator 01 or A1 through A9 to all item records loaded with type
stock record account code K.
8.189.7. Unit of Issue (2 DIGIT-A, POSITIONS 25-26). The unit of issue is a two-letter
abbreviation that indicates the minimum quantity of an item that may be requisitioned, received,
stored, shipped or issued. These abbreviations are included in stock lists under the heading
UNIT OF ISSUE. Authorized codes are listed in Introduction to Consolidated Management List
(C-ML-AF). You may assign local units of issue using the dash one (-1) stock number format
(as described in note 3 above under Stock Numbers).
8.189.8. Unit Price (10 DIGIT-N, POSITIONS 90-99). The unit price is the cost of one unit of
issue of an item. The unit price is stated in dollars and cents for all items. EXCEPTION: Fuels
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1105

account items reflect dollars, cents, and mills (a mill is less than one cent). If the actual unit
price is less than one cent, you must use 0000000001 (nine zeros) in this system. Also, if the
actual unit price is one million dollars or more, you must use actual unit price. The unit price
from a FIL input is also stored on the 022-FILLER-2 field for budget code 9 stock numbers. For
MAP assets the unit price is 0000000000 (ten zeros).
8.189.9. Materiel Category/Source of Supply Code/Stockage Priority Code (SPC) (1 DIGIT-A,
POSITION 35).
8.189.9.1. If the type stock record account code is P (fuels), this code must be A, G, or L. (See
Para 8.198 for the correct code for each stock number.)
8.189.9.2. If the type stock record account code is E (equipment), this code will be E or blank.
An E will prevent automatic due-out release of the item. Stock Control or Equipment
Management will tell Research when to use an E.
8.189.9.3. If the type stock record account code is other than P or E and the ERRCD is XD or
XF, assign a maintenance priority code 4.
8.189.9.4. If the item is EOQ and the provisioning source code is P2, X1, X2, and XB, assign
SPC E. (See Para 8.197 for definitions of provisioning source codes.)
8.189.9.5. If none of the above apply and the ERRCD is not XD or XF, the computer will assign
SPC 5.
8.189.10. Type Stock Record Account Code (1 DIGIT-A, POSITION 42).
8.189.10.1. The type stock record account code identifies which type of management, activity, or
organization the stock record account is assigned to (for example, B for the base supplies
manager, E for the equipment manager, etc.). This code is in the second position of the SRAN.
See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, DODAAD information regarding the SRAN.
8.189.10.2. Program control will assign B or E (B for items coded expendable and E for items
coded nonexpendable) to the item record if the code on a FIL input is B, E, or blank. (This code
must be entered on FIL inputs for item records with other than B or E account; for example,
enter P for fuels account.)
8.189.11. Shelf Life Code (1 DIGIT-N, POSITION 43). When available, the shelf life code
should be loaded with this input, If you leave this input code blank, 0 will be internally assigned.
8.189.12. Quantity Unit Pack Code (1 DIGIT-A/N, POSITION 44).
8.189.12.1. The quantity unit pack code indicates the number of units normally contained in the
packaging container. The table below lists the QUP codes for the unit pack quantities. This
table is stored in the SBSS database as part of the Quantity Unit Pack Conversion Record and is
used by internal programs to automatically convert the one-digit QUP code to the three-digit unit
pack quantity. To load this table, use a File Miscellaneous Data Change trigger input and follow
directions given in section 8E. The table should be loaded only when directed to do so by
AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.
8.189.12.2. Initial item loads must contain the QUP listed in appropriate stock lists. The SNUD
will automatically provide follow-up corrections and updates. DO NOT change the QUP from
those provided through SNUD unless approved by the major command and the AFMC IM.
EXCEPTION: This policy does not apply to items coded local purchase.
8.189.12.3. If an item has a unit pack quantity not listed in the table below, use the code
identifying the quantity nearest to that of the item's unit pack quantity. For example, if an item's
unit of issue is gallons and if the item's normal container is 55 gallons in a drum, the QUP is M.
However, if the item's unit of issue is drum, the QUP is 1. When the QUP code is not entered on
the input, a 1 is internally assigned.

8.189.13. Budget Code (1 DIGIT-A/N, POSITION 45).
8.189.13.1. See Ch 7, reject 100 for ERRCD budget code/ source of supply compatibility,
except for local manufacture, which is explained below.
8.189.13.2. If the routing identifier code is JBD, JBE, or JBT, assign the ERRCD and budget
code as follows:
8.189.13.3. Stock Listed Items. Assign the ERRCD shown in the stock list and/or the SNUD.
In this case, consider NC and ND numbers stock listed.
8.189.13.3.1. Assign budget code 9 to ERRCD XB/XF items and to NF(x) items with a unit cost
of LESS than $250,000.
8.189.13.3.2. Assign budget code Z to NF(x) items with a unit cost of $250,000 or MORE and
which do not reflect an Air Force routing identifier code.
8.189.13.3.3. For other NF(x) and ERRCD XD/ND items, assign the alpha budget code shown
in the stock list.
8.189.13.4. Nonstock Listed Items. Assign an ERRCD/budget code equal to the highest
ERRCD applicable to any component of the manufactured items. If ERRCD XD(x) is assigned,
the alpha budget code of the highest component will be used.
8.189.13.4.1. Assign budget code 9 to supply items with type stock record account code B, when
ERRCD XB/XF has been assigned.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1107

8.189.13.4.2. Assign budget code 9 to equipment items with type stock record account code E,
when ERRCD NF(x) has been assigned and the unit cost is LESS than $250,000.
8.189.13.4.3. Assign budget code Z to equipment items with type stock record account code E,
when ERRCD NF(x) has been assigned and the unit cost is $250,000 or MORE, but ONLY
when the routing identifier code of the highest component is not Air Force.
8.189.13.5. For other NF(x) items and all ERRCD ND(x) items, assign the alpha budget code of
the highest component. However, assign the EMC based on the prime item.
8.189.14. Budget Code for Atomic Energy Detection System (AEDS) Items.
8.189.14.1. Assign budget code Z to AEDS items managed ONLY by AFTAC SBSS FB7048.
8.189.14.2. Assign budget code W if possible, otherwise any nonnumeric character other than Z
to AEDS items managed in locations other than FB7048.
8.189.14.3. The stock number must be a P serialized number with 7048 in the last four positions
or a P stock number; the ERRCD must be XD2; and the routing identifier code must be JBZ.
8.189.15. Demilitarization Code (1 DIGIT-A, POSITION 48). The demilitarization code
identifies demilitarization requirements which the DLADS must accomplish after transfer of
excess, reparable, or condemned property. The SNUD will provide appropriate DoD
demilitarization codes. If no code is to be loaded, leave the field blank and program control will
assign a code X.
8.189.16. Standard Deviation (1 DIGIT-N, POSITION 49). The standard deviation field is used
to compute safety levels. This field is normally a 1. If this field is left blank on an input,
program control will automatically load a 1. When this field is authorized by HQ USAF, you
may load a 2 or 3.
8.189.17. Exception Codes (1 DIGIT-A/N, POSITIONS 53, 54, 55, 56). Exception codes are
used to identify items which must be processed using special procedures, or to suppress
automatic action until the exception condition can be reviewed. Exception codes may be
assigned for excesses, issues, requisitions, and shipments.
8.189.18. Nomenclature (32 DIGIT-A/N, POSITIONS 57-88).
8.189.18.1. The nomenclature field contains descriptive data of the item being loaded. If
positions 57-88 contain invalid data elements (see Para 8.188) the phrase NO
NOMENCLATURE is automatically loaded. CAUTION: If position 57 is blank, the phrase NO
NOMENCLATURE is automatically loaded on the item record, but NO NOTICE IS
PROVIDED.
8.189.18.2. The nomenclature field will contain unique data under the following conditions:
8.189.18.2.1. For ammunition items (type stock record account code K) with an R application
code (reportable), enter the DODIC/AFAC in positions 1-4.
8.189.18.2.2. For part (P) numbers and nonlisted (L) numbered items, see Para 8.188, note 7.
8.189.18.2.3. For fuel items, enter the applicable grade code in positions 1-3 of the
nomenclature field. Enter the actual gallon conversion quantity in positions 5-7 when the unit of
issue is other than gallon (GL). EXAMPLE: If the unit of issue is drum (DR) and there are 55
gallons to a drum, enter 055 in positions 5-7 of the nomenclature field. (See Para 8.198 for a list
of valid grade codes and their applicable materiel category or source of supply codes.)
8.189.18.2.4. For field manufacture items (routing identifier codes JBD, JBE, JBI, and JBT),
enter SR or SA (sample required or sample available) in the first two positions of the
nomenclature field. You may enter SA when the manufacturing activity already has the
drawings, sample, etc.

8.191. Load Or Change Equipment Management Codes (EMC).
8.191.1. Purpose. To help you assign or change EMC on item records.
8.191.2. Code Assignments.
8.191.2.1. Item Record Loads (FIL) for NSNs.

Table 8.16. Load or Change Equipment Management Codes (EMC).

 Code      Items
 EMC 5     All vehicles identified by registration or serial number
 EMC 4     All other centrally procured (CP) items (PSC 5)
 EMC 3     All base funded (BF) items not assigned EMC 1
 EMC 1     All base funded NSNs assigned EMC 1 and all locally assigned (L or P)
           stock numbers, unless the item appears below


8.191.2.2. EMC 1 and 2 NSN Items. EMC 1 and EMC 2 NSN items may be changed; however,
they are system designator-oriented and will, therefore, require the use of a valid system
designator. Changing EMC codes on the item record will be processed by the AFMC SCM-R
Records Maintenance Activity.
8.191.2.3. Item Record Loads for EAID Substitutes. For item records loaded as EAID
substitutes, assign the EMC code based on the prime item. In these cases, the Research Unit will
coordinate the assignment of the EMC with the EMS.
8.191.2.4. EMC Challenge. Any AFEMS (C001) user can challenge the EMC assignment by
inputting into the AFEMS (C001) the EMC change request (IREC) on-line transaction. The
AFEMS (C001) will send an E-Mail message to HQ AFMC through the initiator's parent major
command to review and validate an EMC challenge request. An additional E-mail notice will be
provided to the initiator and evaluator advising them of the final disposition. AF IMT 86 will not
be used to challenge EMC codes. If notified by the initiator, AFMC SCM-R Records
Maintenance Activity will load an asterisk (*) in the first position of the item record
nomenclature field (NF2/ND2 only). Indicative data will remain the same. When you receive
verification of the management data, process an indicative data change if required and notify
EMS. Note: If position 7 is NOT a 1, and position 52 is equal to S or U of the BVE/BV4,
then the asterisk (*) will be removed during SNUD processing.
8.191.2.5. Items that Cannot Be Assigned EMC 1. Do not assign EMC 1 to items in the
following categories:
1110                                      AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014

cannot be assigned EMC1. 2. Portable buildings which are defined as a small, shed-type
structure with less than 300 square feet with no permanently installed Base Civil Engineer utility
hookups can be EMC 1. All others must be carried as EMC 3 on EAID records. 3. Land
Mobile Radios (LMR), Cellular telephones (except STU type), Video Teleconferencing
Equipment, and Facsimile Machines can be assigned EMC 1. FSCs 5810 and 5811 cannot be
assigned EMC 1.
8.192. Assignment Of Local Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Cost Designators.
8.192.1. Purpose. The following guidelines govern ERRC designator assignment to items of
supply that do not appear in USAF stock lists. Estimated unit prices on noncataloged items must
be as reasonable and logical as possible to ensure proper ERRC assignment.

Table 8.18. Non-NSN Items.

Block No.       Contents
(1)             Document Identifier Code. Left blank by initiating activity. Stock
                Control uses this code on requisitions submitted to source of supply.
(2)             Routing Identifier Code. Left blank by initiating activity. Research
                will determine and enter the routing identifier code (RIC) on the lower
                margin on the Remarks block.
(3)             CAGE Code and Part/Stock Number. Left blank by initiating activity
                Stock Control will enter the CAGE code and part number If the part
                number exceeds ten positions or the CAGE is unknown (ZZZZZ), this
                block will be left blank. If an NSN is known, but the Air Force is not
                a recorded user, the NSN will be entered in the remarks field (block
                21 below) to indicate that the Air Force is not a recorded user. For
                local purchase items, enter the stock number as it appears on the basic
                item record.
(4)             Unit of Issue. Left blank by initiating activity. Enter the proper unit
                of issue in the lower margin of the remarks block.
(5)             Quantity. To be completed by Stock Control from the accompanying
                AF IMT 2005.
(6)             Manufacturer's Code and Part Number. Self-explanatory
(7)             Manufacturer. Enter the manufacturer's name and address. If more
                than one, enter on the reverse side of the form.
(8)             Manufacturer's Catalog and Date. If applicable, enter commercial
                catalog number and date which identifies this item.
(9)             Technical Order Number. Enter technical order number and figure
                and index.
(10)            Technical Manual Number. Enter technical manual number and
                figure and index.

                characters are the most important for Stock Number Directory
                purposes. MIL-STD 12B abbreviations may be used. Also, common
                commercial terms should be used; that is, use identifiable purchase
                descriptions. If the description is too long for both block 12 and block
                21 (Remarks), use block 12 and a separate sheet and attach it.
                a. Use of off-the-shelf products. Unnecessary use of drawings/MILS
                specifications normally results in higher prices which may not be
                justifiable in view of mission requirements. Therefore, detailed
                drawings/blueprints or MIL standard specifications should not be used
                if commercial off-the-shelf products are acceptable and they cost less.
                b. Price. Include the unit price, if known, and an allowable tolerance.
                This data will be used by Base Contracting personnel to ensure that
                items with unacceptably high prices are not used. If the price is not
                known, enter an estimated unit price. Determine whether the
                customer's price estimates are reasonable by comparing them to those

                 for similar items already loaded in the account or listed in ML's. This
                 will ensure that proper ERRCD and budget code, as well as the proper
                 price, is assigned (according to Para. 8.192.).
                 c. Bench/mockup set. If the form is for a bench/mockup set, list all
                 major components and their unit prices in this field. Hazardous

                 manages a product safety program by ensuring local purchase items
                 meet safety requirements. LRS/Materiel Management Activity should
                 be responsive to the Base Safety Office in assisting them with such
                 items as, but not limited to: 1) providing access to procurement
                 records relating to a supplier whose products have a poor safety
                 history, or 2) passing purchase orders for a nominated range of
                 equipment, e.g., ladders, through Base Safety Office for review where
                 events indicate this is warranted. The using activity is responsible for
                 identifying safety standards, constraints, or hazards. The local Safety
                 Office may assist the organization if needed.


8.196. Identification Of Locally Purchased Hazardous Material.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                      1115

8.196.1. Purpose. According to Department of Defense Instruction 6050.5 and Federal Standard
313, items falling under the criteria listed below are possibly hazardous material and require
control to make sure that life and property are safe. The BES of the Base Medical Service
(BMS) must be notified with a DD Form 1348-6 when potentially hazardous material is being
procured. The DD Form 1348-6 must be forwarded to the BES before the requisition for the
material is submitted to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. If the DD Form 1348-6 has not
been sent to the BES prior to submission to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity, a copy of
the DD Form 1348-6 will be sent to the BES before the requisition is sent to Base Contracting.
In addition, all requisitions for potentially hazardous material must be identified as potentially
hazardous when sent to Base Contracting. Base Contracting will then request a material safety
data sheet for those items and forward it to the BES for filing. Items identified by BES as
containing ozone depleting chemicals (ODC) require an approved waiver prior to requisitioning
Note: Procedures identified above apply only if the Hazardous Material Management Program
identified in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management has not been established.
8.196.2. Identification. Demand Processing personnel will review all DD Forms 1348-6 to
determine if the item is a first demand and meets the criteria listed below. If these criteria are
met, this will be indicated with the phrase POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL in the
description block of the DD Form 1348-6.

8.202. Indicative Data Change (FIC).
8.202.1. Purpose. To change the following basic item record indicative data: 1) Stock Number,
2) ERRCD, 3) Routing Identifier Code, 4) Budget Code.
8.202.2. Input Restrictions. Based on the user-ID/password.
8.202.3. Output Products. Outputs. See section 8D for merging stock numbers. (See Para
8.203 or Para 8.203, section A for output formats.)
8.202.4. Entry Requirements. Separate inputs must be prepared for the two different types of
indicative data:
8.202.4.1. Routing Identifier Code, Budget Code, ERRCD changes.
8.202.4.2. Stock Number Change. Because those indicative data changes affected by FIC inputs
are not system-designator oriented, all records equal to the input stock number are changed.

Notes:
1. Leave blank unless used to clear 022 reject notice (see Ch 7).
2. Reason why code--change of item record stock number as a result of the following:

J -- Assigned under program control as the result of processing SNUD images.
K -- AF IMT 86 action.
L -- Local purchase status.
O -- MILSTRIP status.
P -- Correction of original error.
Q -- Assigned by program control only to TTPC 2W transactions created by FIC budget
code changes from V (vehicle).
R -- Directed by item manager other than through SNUD (i.e., letter or message).
Z -- Assigned externally when processing changes for chemical warfare defense
equipment (CWDE) assets only. Compatibility edits always apply to changes of the
RIC, budget code, and ERRCD. (This code is to be used for indicative data changes
only.)
3. Use when budget code changes from 9 to Z, or Z to 9, and only a specific system
designator is to be changed. Use in type stock record account code ground fuels items
when the routing identifier code changes to or from S9F, JBP, NAV, or ARM and only a
specific system designator is to be changed. A system designator is required for stock
number changes on items with RIC JB(X).
4. Leave blank if no change is required on that field of the item record.
5. If an EMC is required, enter ERRCD in first two positions and EMC in last positions;
that is, for an NF item to EMC 2, use NF2.
6. If ERRCD is entered in positions 29-31, then position 32 may not be blank. It must
contain an N for nonlocally determined ERRCD or a Y for locally determined ERRCD.
7. FIC image can only be processed to change the FSC (Positions 1-4) or the MMAC
(Positions 14-15) of the NSN for serialized control items. To change the NIIN (Positions

8.203. Warehouse Data Change Notice.
8.203.1. Warehouse Data Change Notice. To update stock balances and warehouse locations of
supplies. The program automatically produces a Warehouse Data Change Notice when it has
processed an indicative data change requiring other external actions. Stock numbers change
when a record balance and/or warehouse location exists. This document is not printed for NSN
changes when the change is only in the last two positions (stock number positions 14-15).

Notes:
1. See the applicable paragraph of section 8D, for proper use of budget code Z. Budget code Z
(authorized for equipment only) is assigned instead of budget code 9 when the unit price is $250,000 or
more. Since prices vary at different SBSS locales, AFMC will push items which may be either budget
code 9 or Z, depending upon location. In this case, AFMC (SNUD) will push budget code asterisk (*)
and program control will assign the proper budget code (9 or Z) as determined by unit price. Except as
specified in this chapter, the SBSS does not change these budget codes once they have been assigned.
D(xx) routing identifiers may be used with FSC 5800 when associated with FX3101 scheme materiel.

 2. Budget code/ERRCD is assigned to local/depot manufacturer items as specified in this chapter.
 3. Budget code Y is assigned to selected equipment items with a unit price of less than $250,000 that are
 centrally procured with MAJCOMs O&M funds.

8.206.2. Special Instructions.
8.206.2.1. Instead of blindly copying the first 32 positions of the stock list description, include
only meaningful information. Use the key element in the description. Usually this will be the
major noun. Abbreviations are inevitable, but avoid unusual ones. See MIL-STD-12D for
generally acceptable abbreviations. Note that for such consumables as hardware, lamps, wire,
containers, etc., size is most significant and must be included at the expense of description.
8.206.2.2. Remember that nomenclature helps people, not computers. In developing patterns for
description, ask the shop personnel of the major using activity for assistance. For example, Civil
Engineering personnel can provide valuable guidelines for items in FSG 55 and 56. The type or
model designator should be used in the nomenclature field for PCSP-CEM equipment, that is,
AN-USM-26 FREQ MTR. This nomenclature appears in bench stock listings, document
registers, Stock Number Directory, and any other output where description of the item is useful.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                       1137

As the 32 position field uses a considerable amount of the SBSS ADS database capacity, careful
selection of key elements is essential for its efficient use.
8.206.2.3. Many items have no significant units of issue, such as can, package, sheet, box, etc.
These allow supply depots to avoid breaking unit packs when filling base requisitions. However,
such units of issue are generally unsuitable for preparation of issue requests since they require a
stock list search for the appropriate quantity per unit of issue data. To avoid additional research,
the nomenclature field must include the quantity per unit issue for example, 144 per box, 12 oz
per can, 25 per package, etc. Items issued from the Base Service Store are excluded from this
requirement because their packaging is in plain sight of the customer.
8.206.2.4. For non-NSN items with part numbers, see section 8B.
8.206.2.5. Use type numbers whenever they are available, particularly for such items as electron
tubes, resistors, aircraft instruments, communication-electronic components, etc.
8.206.2.6. Include the frequency in the nomenclature for piezoelectric crystals.
8.206.2.7. As the DLIS patterns of description generally ignore size and type, bases should
therefore concentrate on improving DLIS item names in such FSG as 47, 53, 55, 59, etc., where
size and/or type is very important.
8.206.2.8. The nomenclature for TCTO kits (K in the fifth position of the stock number) contain
the letters TO in the first two positions, a blank in the third position, and the technical order in
the remaining 16 positions of the available nomenclature field (TO 1B-52F-634-A).
8.206.2.9. If the type stock record account code is P, enter the grade code in position 1-3 of the
nomenclature field and the actual gallon conversion quantity in positions 5-7 when the unit of
issue is other than gallon (GL). (See Para 8.189 for details.)
8.206.2.10. If the routing identifier code is JBD, JBE, JBI, or JBT, SA/SR will be in positions 1-
2 to identify field manufacture items.
8.207. Unit Of Issue/Unit Price Change Input (FCU).
8.207.1. Purpose. To change unit of issue, unit price, and/or quantity unit pack code.
8.207.1.1. Unit price may be changed by procurement status input through interface with this
FCU program.
8.207.1.2. Quantity unit pack codes are usually changed by FNL input (see section 8E), but may
also be changed with this input when convenient.
8.207.1.3. Price changes for budget code 8 (CSAG-S) items must be input using the format in
Para 8.210.
8.207.2. Input Restrictions. Based on the user-ID/password.
8.207.3. Input Format and Entry Requirements (Screen FCU/208).

 Notes:
 1. Under program control, a P will be input when processing was generated by input of a
 bulk issue request (BIR).
 2. Enter new or change-to data. Blank for fuels inputs. Unit of issue changes that come
 from SNUD will not update records when the RIC is JBB.
 3. Enter when reject notice indicates a nonstandard unit of issue. The program will
 ignore the quantity entered if there is an internal standard conversion factor or the
 conversion override indicator equals a Y (see Note 7 below). Blank for fuels inputs.
 4. Cannot to be blank on unit of issue changes.
 5. If the conversion override indicator is set to a Y, the Unit of Issue Conversion Record
 Table will be bypassed. FOR EXAMPLE: U/I PR to EA is programmed for a 1 to 2
 quantity conversion. The override will bypass this edit and change the quantity 1 to 1.
 6. When processing FCU against budget code 9 assets and the unit of issue changes, a
 new moving average cost (MAC) and total assets on hand are computed based on
 inventory valuation requirements. The program first computes the extended MAC by
 multiplying the 022-FILLER-1*022-FILLER-2. The unit of issue and prices are updated
 as they were before inventory valuation. After updates to details and to the item record,
 a new 022-FILLER-1 is stored based on the actual quantity from the 101-
 SERVICEABLE-BALANCE, plus the Quantity on Hand, and/or Deployed Quantities
 from the 218, 230, 232, 233, 234, 237, 238, 239, 240 and 241details. The sum of total
 assets are stored in the 022-FILLER-1 field. The extended MAC is then divided by the
 new 022-FILLER-1 field. The result is stored in the 022-FILLER-2 field. Note that
 price changes on the FCU input have no effect on computing a new inventory balance or
 a new MAC. Only the unit of issue change will affect the 022 COST-RECORD for
 FCU.


8.208. Warehouse Change Document.
8.208.1. Purpose. To produce the audit accountable document used by Materiel Management
Flight. The program produces a document for unit of issue changes when the item record
reflects a serviceable balance or a warehouse location. A warehouse change document will be
created for an unserviceable detail.

 Notes:
 1. TRIC MSD will normally be distributed from AFMC through SNUD to recorded users of
 the applicable stock number. If a reject condition occurs or manual processing is otherwise
 required, TRIC MSD will be used to change standard price, materiel cost recovery, latest
 acquisition cost, latest repair cost, carcass cost, etc., exchange price, unserviceable asset price,
 mark-up price or manager designator code for new item record loads, and TRIC MSD will also
 be used to change the same for existing stock numbers. TRIC MSD is the price list
 interrogation result of a 1SQ (option code 09) input. These inputs will be applicable to stock
 numbers that are budget code 8, have an ERRC of XD(x),XB(x), and XF(x).
 2. Must contain carcass cost if budget code 8.
 3. Direct Allocable Cost-LAC and LRC fields will be zero. AFMC no longer computes these
 costs.


8.211. Moving Average Cost Input (MVC).
8.211.1. Purpose. To load the moving average cost (MAC) for alpha budget code where the
ERRCD equals Xxx and budget code 8 stock numbers. A module of AFMC’s D035J system
will compute moving average cost and pass to the cataloging systems for Air Force managed
stock numbers. MAC for budget code 8 and supply type alpha budget code stock numbers will
be located in Increment F of D043 and in FEDLOG. Note: MAC for the majority of alpha
budget codes will be the 101-Unit-Price until such time as when appropriate systems can
compute the MAC. Also the user will not process FIC transactions to change a budget code
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1143

from 9 to either 8 or alpha and process an MVC in order to modify the MAC for a budget code 9
stock number and then process FICs to change the budget code back to 9. This process sends
false cap/decap transactions to the Standard Materiel Accounting System.

Notes:
1. Management notice 045 will be printed for these items.
2. If the input source of supply is JCA, then the appropriate MILSTRIP routing
identifier code will be assigned to the item record based on the input fund code, budget
code, and the FSC and MMAC record as follows:
Input Contains          FSC Record       MMAC Record                       Assign RIC
Fund Code LP            N/A              N/A                               JBB

Other than LP/9         N/A              AFMC Flag                         F(x)Z
3. If the input source of supply is JCD (Nonpublished), then the item record RIC will not
be changed. These items will be identified with the assignment of a numeric parts
preference code (last position) of 5.
4. These items will be identified on the item record with numeric parts preference code
(last position) of 3 to denote condemned items. The item record RIC will not be
changed.
5. Activities operating under the industrial funding concept must prepare an FIC to
change the routing identifier code from JBD to JBI. FIC formats are outlined in section
8D. This action is required to ensure proper funding action is taken.
6. If the source of supply is JGG with issue and fund code of OS, then routing identifier
code JBB is assigned to CONUS bases.




8.214. SNUD Periodic Output Format, (BM-) CMD Changes.

8.214.1. Purpose. To reinput invalid catalog management data (CMD) changes resulting in
rejects from SNUD processing.
8.214.2. Input Restrictions. BMx (except BME) inputs are routed by SIFS to the SNUD-
IMAGE-RECORD. These inputs are processed through pseudo, based on the effective date in
positions 8-31. Re-inputs, to correct error conditions, based on user-ID/password. Note:
When loading DLA items containing AAC J or Z, also prepare and process a BMC to load the
AAC to the item record. The BMC must be prepared immediately after loading the item record
(before releveling can process) so the 90 day EOQ (versus the normal 365 day) logic will be
used.

8.224. ISG/D043B Method Of Grouping.
8.224.1. Purpose. To illustrate the association between the AFMC D043B method of grouping
and the base level method. Examples are included to help you modify ISG to meet local
conditions.
8.224.2. Example 1. This example represents the changes made by the AFMC D043B ISG
Update processing (program NGV404). Part one represents the BVS/BDS inputs. These inputs
show the same information as contained in the SL-ISG. Part two is the ISG grouping for items
with ERRCD XD(x) or XF3. Part three is for equipment items. Part four is for ERRCD XB3
items. Groupings indicated illustrate ISG relationships, considering that management data in
section 8I (ISG order codes), is compatible. If these management data are not compatible with
the master, the item will be loaded to the base level ISG as a substitute instead of an
interchangeable.
8.224.2.1. Notice that the first position of the AFMC subgroup code is not used in base level
processing. The second position is stored as the item record ISG source code. The third position
is stored as the item record parts preference code.
8.224.2.2. An item record for the AFMC master item is loaded under program control when the
items in the group have ERRCD XD(x) or XF3.
8.224.2.3. Items with a numeric parts preference code are not loaded as the master items. If all
other items in the group--except the AFMC master--contain a numeric parts preference code, the
AFMC master will be loaded under program control.
8.224.2.4. Items in the base level ISG with a numeric parts preference code of 3 or 9 are
changed to substitute items. Demand data for these items are transferred to the replacing item
under program control.
8.224.2.5. Part One. The following table represents BVS/BDS inputs. The column heading
ITEM RECORD indicates whether an item record is in the SBSS database.

8.224.2.6. Part Two. The following table represents base level ISG relationships resulting from
processing program NGV404 (AFMC D043B ISG UPDATE) on the input in part one. The stock
numbers have ERRCD XD(x) or XF3. The least preferred stock number, which does not have a
numeric parts preference code and for which an item record is loaded, will be established as the
master item. Note: An item record is loaded under program control for the AFMC master item,
and the AFMC master is loaded to the base level ISG as the last interchangeable in the group.
RC is the item record relationship code, and OC is the item record order code.

8.224.2.7. Part Three. The following table represents base level ISG relationships resulting
from processing program NGV404 (AFMC D043B ISG Update) on the input in part one. The
stock numbers have ERRCD ND(x) or NF(x). The most preferred item currently loaded is made
the master item. Note: The AFMC master item is not normally loaded under program control
for equipment items; however, the master is loaded by the computer if no other item has the
requirements to be the master item. Abbreviations are the same as in part two.

8.224.6.3. Part Three. When the input D043B stock numbers are in several base level ISGs as
shown in part two, the program NGV404 will delete the input stock numbers from their group
and reload them into a new ISG. Any item in the same group as a deleted stock number will also
be transferred to the new ISG if it has compatible data and is not in another D043B group.
Specific examples of this transfer are illustrated as follows:
8.224.6.3.1. GROUP NUMBER 0001: The master/interchangeable relationship in this group
was established by substitute status. Stock number 1560-00-200-1716 is deleted and reloaded
into the new group. Because the other three stock numbers do not have an alpha character in
their order code, they are not in a D043B group. These three stock numbers are therefore deleted
and reloaded into the new group with the present relationship codes.
8.224.6.3.2. GROUP NUMBER 0002: All items in this D043B group were grouped by program
NGV404 processing. Stock number 1560-00-188-1816 is in the input D043B group and will be
deleted and regrouped into the new ISG. The other two stock numbers are also a D043B group,
and their current relationship will be maintained (in group 0002).

8.224.6.3.3. GROUP NUMBER 0003: Stock number 1560-00-121-1416 is in the input D043B
group, so the processing for these two stock numbers will be the same as given in group number
0001 above.
8.224.6.3.4. GROUP NUMBER 0004: Both items were related by program NGV404
processing and are also in the input D043B group. Both numbers will be deleted and reloaded
into the new group. The resulting base level ISG grouping is as follows: Note: ISG numbers
0001, 0003, and 0004 are blank; ISG number 0002 and the new group are structured.

8.231. Description Of Controlled Item Codes.
8.231.1. Assignment of Codes.
8.231.1.1. Purpose. Controlled inventory item codes are used for inventory items designated as
having characteristics that require they be identified, accounted for, secured, segregated, or
handled in a special manner to ensure their safeguard or integrity. See DoD 4100.39-M for
complete list and Controlled Inventory Item Code definitions.
8.231.1.2. Criteria.
8.231.1.2.1. Degree of control required. Controlled inventory item codes (CIIC) are ranked in
descending order (classified, sensitive, pilferable, local management) according to the degree of
control normally required for each item.
8.231.1.2.2. Maximum assignment warranted. The code assigned an item indicates the highest
degree of control required, when an assignment is necessary at all.
8.231.2. Change of Codes. Air Force item managers may reassign a code more suited to Air
Force management needs to items obtained from other services or DLA or GSA that were
previously assigned codes of J (items requiring special control to prevent pilferage but which do
not meet the definition of other pilferage codes) or U (unclassified items).
8.231.3. Codes and Explanations.
8.231.3.1. Classified Items. The codes for classified items indicate that the materiel requires
protection in the interest of national security.
8.231.3.2. Sensitive Items. The codes for sensitive items indicate that the materiel requires a
high degree of protection and control due to statutory requirements or regulations. Items coded
as sensitive include the following: narcotics and drug abuse items; precious metals; items that
are of high value, or of a highly technical or hazardous nature; and small arms, ammunition, and
explosives and demolition material.
8.231.3.3. Pilferable Items. The codes for pilferable items indicate that the materiel has a ready
resale value and civilian use or application and is, therefore, especially subject to theft. When
selecting items to be treated as pilferable, give consideration to the cost of providing controlled
storage and handling as opposed to the consequences of potential theft of the items.
8.231.3.4. Unclassified/Local Management Items. The asterisk (*) is assigned whenever local
management determines that items categorized as Unused. (unclassified) are subject to
unwarranted losses and thus require additional controls.
8.232. Transportation Data - Load, Change, Or Delete Input (BDT/BVT).
8.232.1. Purpose. To load, change, or delete transportation data on all item records with a stock
number equal to the input.
8.232.2. Input Restrictions. None.
8.232.3. Output. None.

Notes:
1. The organization code field cannot be blank, and it must be 100-999.
2. The following information applies:
a. L = Load
b. C = Change
c. D = Delete. A “D” will store a delete flag on the freeze/delete flag field on the 518
record. If there are no due-out details, then this record is deleted during processing of
program NGV946, Accounting and Finance (A&F) End-of-Fiscal-Year Closeout, or
monthly M03/NGV977 processing (see DFAS-DE 7077.10-M). When there are details
then a “P” will store on a delete flag on the freeze/delete flag field on the 518 record. Once
the details are gone it will be changed to a “D” during NGV946 and deleted.
d. I = Inquiry - This can only be used with the #458 screen. The screen will be filled with
appropriate data to review for changes if necessary.
3. Mandatory on load of new organization records. The organization identification code is
used to fetch 557 ROF record which must be loaded first. The 557 ROF record is loaded
by receipt of an XSE transaction from the AFEMS (C001) or creation of an XSE locally (if
directed to do so by the MAJCOM Equipment Management Flight). 4. This field cannot
be blank. The first position (position 22) cannot contain a blank or a special character.
5. May be blank or contain the authorized codes. The codes are 3, 6, 7, 8, A, B, D, G, K,
M, P, Q, R, S, T, and V. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for explanation.)
6. This field may be blank or contain numbers 1 through 5. If 1 through 5 is entered, a Y
must be in position 112 (FAD Override indicator).
7. This may be blank, or contain all alpha/numeric characters.
8. Authorized codes are R or *.
a. An “R” freezes the record for certain financial transaction inputs.
        b. An asterisk (*) deletes freeze flag.
9. This field may be blank or contain a 1 for organizations not authorized equipment.
10. This field may be blank or contain an “X” or “P”. An “X” will indicate DOR and ISU
transactions must go through local Cargo Movement for delivery. A “P” will identify off
base organizations that order through the LRS/Materiel Management Activity but their
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                      1187


property is not released/shipped through CMOS to the LRS/Transportation Activity.
Organizations with an off base flag “P” assigned will be recognized as off base accounts in
regards to delinquent document criteria.
11. The following information applies:
a. A “Y” places decimal zeros in the bench stock line items minimum reserve
authorization (MRA) 1 or A and bench stock line item fields on the organization cost
center record only if they are blank. Otherwise, a 169 reject notice occurs.
b. A “D” places blanks on the bench stock line items MRA 1 or A, and bench stock line
fields only if they contain decimal zeros. Otherwise, an F001 reject occurs.
c. An asterisk (*) places blanks on the bench stock line items MRA 1 or A and bench
stock line item fields, regardless of the data contained in these positions.
12. Authorized codes are 45 or 60.
13. May be blank or contain an address.
14. If the SBSS ALN and the ALN of Maint ADS are different, enter the ALN of the
Maint ADS.
15. Set to an “X”, it allows BSU images to be produced instead of DD Form 1348-1A for
on- and off-base organizations supported by a satellite account.
16. Used when there is an active Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) to
support this organization. Code must be a gang designation of a 1, 2, 3, or 4 if CAMS is
active, otherwise leave blank. This is used in conjunction with CAMS identification code.
The type organization code must be a 3, 7, 8, G, V, Q, or T. Type organization code 3
identifies Flying Hour supported organizations that are supported through Centralized
Asset Management.
17. The system designator of the PFMR (311 record) must match the system designator on
the FOR input. Otherwise, you will receive a 366 reject. Exception will be for B or C
system designators, which can be loaded to the 01 system designator's PFMR.
18. This field must contain the applicable cost center on initial load. Accounting and
Finance will provide the applicable cost center code.
19. May be blank or contain all alpha/numeric characters.
20. If type organization code is a 3, 7, 8, G, V, Q, or T, then enter Maint-Unit-Ident-Code
provided by CAMS. In CAMS, this is known as the unit ID. The CAMS-Gang-Nbr must
be set to a 1, 2, 3, or 4.
21. Enter a “Y” to override the FAD code loaded to the 518 record. This will allow an
organization record FAD code to be different from the ROF record. An “N” will not allow
a change to the FAD.
22. May contain a Q (AMC Forward Support Spares Flag), C (Defense Mapping Agency),
or M (ICBM Maintenance Activity); otherwise, leave blank.
23. An asterisk (*) will blank the appropriate data field. If an asterisk (*) is used in the
Bench Stock Consolidated Shop Code field, and other Bench Stock Consolidated Shop
Codes are associated with that Bench Stock Consolidated Organization Code, use it in both
fields. If other Bench Stock Consolidated Shop Codes are associated with that Bench
Stock Consolidated Organization Code, use an asterisk only in the Bench Stock
Consolidated Shop Code field.
24. An XSE input is used to update the major command code
25. Enter one of the following codes: M for CAMS, G for G081, and N for non-
maintenance organization.
1188                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014


26. This field updates the 518-COST-SYS-IND field for ORG-COST-CENTER-100-999
(518) record. This is a one-position alpha/numeric field with valid codes of A through Z
and 1 through 9. This indicator will be used to identify JOCAS transaction.
8. Enter a standardized MDS value from the list provided below. Note the standardized
MDS codes listed are for aircraft and missiles only. Activities with organization type
codes 3, 7 and G should apply the predominant aircraft or missile MDS if applicable. If
the primary MDS supported is not an aircraft or missile system, input COMMELE,
VEHICLE, or OTHER as the MDS code in the FOR transaction. For example, if
organization type code 7 or G applies but the activity cannot rationally be associated with
an aircraft or missile system, OTHER should be used as the MDS code for the
organization. Activities with type organization code Q (communications maintenance)
should enter COMMELE as the MDS if a specific aircraft or missile system MDS does not
apply. Organizations with type organization codes T or V (vehicle maintenance) should
enter VEHICLE as the MDS if a specific aircraft or missile system MDS does not apply.
Administrative support organizations (for example, personnel, finance) and MWR
(organization code R) should enter OTHER as the MDS code.
Note: MDS code inputs must be left justified. MDS inputs that are not left justified will be
rejected.
28. Data is required in both “Bench Stock Consolidated Organization Code” and the
“Bench Stock Consolidated Shop Code” field if either is used.
29. This field is a constant value; no data is entered. There are 11 spaces between ‘FLAG’
and the colon ‘:’.

Notes:
1. See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for information. Exception code O is authorized if R is in
position 65.
2. Code P will prompt a notice to be printed--but processing will continue. Code R will cause
reject of the input and will produce a printed notice. The exception notice code has no effect on
excess processing.
3. These codes indicate the type of exception phrase: E (excess), I (issue), R (requisition), and
S (shipment).
4. Action Code:
a. Use L for load and change; use D for delete.
b. Use I for Inquiry. When the exception code is not an override record, the Inquiry option will
return the exception record data to Screen FXR/157. When the exception code is a shipping
override record, the Inquiry will return the override record data to Screen FXRSHP/226. When
the exception code is a requisition override record, the Inquiry will return the override record
data to Screen FXRREQ/28. All exception code/override record inquiries may be processed
using Screen FXR/157. Only shipment exception code/override record inquiries may be
processed using FXRSHP/226. Similarly, only requisition exception code/override record
inquiries may be processed using FXRREQ/28.
5. If the purpose of the input is to load an exception phrase for the requisition override record,
positions 18-53 will be completed. Data entries will apply to the following positions:

18—Stock Replenishment Flag
19—Due-out Requisition Flag
20-22—Project Code
23-24—System Designator
25-8—Routing Identifier Code
28—Forward Supply Point Category Code

37-38—Priority Designator
39—Lateral Requisition Flag
40-41—Advice Code
42-51—Project Name
52—TEX code Blank, 7, or R
53—Signal Code.
a. If the MICAP source of supply override equals a Y, then the item record routing identifier
will be used.
b. If the urgency of need designator A source of supply override equals a Y, then the item
record routing identifier will be used.
6. The shipment exception phrase will be limited to 14 positions (pos. 18-31) when no shipment

 override is required. When a shipping override record is loaded, positions 18-52 will be
 completed. Data entries will apply to the following positions:
 18—Shipping Override Flag
 19—Maintenance Action Override Flag (see paragraph “a” and “d” below)
 20-25—Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) of IM to receive credit (see paragraph “e”
 below)
 26-8—Fund Code (see paragraph e below)
 28-30—Project Code (see paragraph “e” below)

 38-39—Priority Designator
 40-46—Mark-For (see paragraph “e” below)
 47-49—Routing Identifier Code of FB or FG account in positions 32-37. If positions 32-33 =
 FB or FG, then this field CANNOT be blank.
 50—Print Override Flag (see paragraph “b” and “d” below)
 51—Shipment Suspense Detail Override Flag (see paragraphs “c” and “d” below)
 52—Blank.
 a. Ship reparable to the centralized repair activity using maintenance action-taken codes
 (MATC) 1 through 7. If this flag is ON, reparables with MATC 1-7 will be shipped or reported
 to the activity specified by RIMCS--unless modified by TEX or SEX code. If a 1 is used, then
 positions 32-33 must be equal to FB or FG.
 b. Produce only one book of shipment documents.
 c. Shipment suspense detail records are not required for this ship-to SRAN. Shipped-but-not-
 credited detail records will continue to be created when appropriate.
 d. Enter a 1 to turn On this flag and an asterisk (*) to delete it.
 e. When no ship-to SRAN is used, the program will use ship-to SRAN assigned to the repair
 cycle record.

8.250. Type Cargo Code.
8.250.1. Purpose. To list TYPE CARGO CODES (one digit-alpha/numeric) which are
maintained on the item record. The code (as defined in DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation
Regulation located at http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii) indicates to the LRS/Transportation
Activity facilities the type of cargo being handled, so appropriate freighting and safety
precautions are adhered to. The code on an item record will remain blank until D035T updates
D043 and distributes the appropriate code(s) through SNUD (D071) using DIC BDT/BVS.
Phrase records must be loaded for all codes. Dual codes are authorized on item records (101-
CRGO-TYPE). When dual codes are used, the user programs will print both phrases on the
applicable output documents.

8.257. Hard Copy AF IMT 86 Preparation.
8.257.1. Purpose. To provide the applicable data to be used on the hard copy of long AF IMT
86. The activity responsible for preparing this document must make sure that ALL mandatory
data elements are recorded as required. If these data are not included, the AFMC Cataloging and
Standardization Center (AFMC/A4IS) may simply return the document unprocessed.
8.257.2. See Table 8.102. for control number information.
EXAMPLE: DPK80001 will be the first AF IMT 86 prepared by an initiating SBSS base
activity. DPK80002 will be assigned to the second AF IMT 86 prepared by the same initiating
activity, and so on.
Routing identifier codes as follows will identify AF IMTs 86 prepared by the ALC base activity
as applicable.
"FGB" (OO-FB2029)
"FHB" (OC-FB2039)
"FLB" (WR-FB2065)
Ecclesiastical
"FNF" HQ AFMC/HFC, WPAFB OH 45433
"FND" MORTUARY, AFMPC/MPCCM, Randolph AFB TX 78148
"FW(X)" MAJCOMs
AF IMTs 86 submitted by an activity whose routing identifier code begins with an F must reflect
an alpha character in column 8 of the control field. For example, FFB8002A would be assigned
the second AF IMT 86, prepared by the same activity, etc. The number of AF IMTs 86 is limited
to 999 with each alpha character; for example, FFB8001A through FFB8999A. Under this
condition, go to the next alpha character and begin with serial number 1; for example,
FFB80001B through FFB8999B and continue through the alphabet until the end of the calendar
number through the last work day of the calendar year for a period of 31 days subsequent to the
calendar year change over. The system will accept either the new year or previous year numeral
as part of the control number.

8.257.3. Reason Code. Circle the reason code that identifies the type of action being requested
(see Para 8.261).
8.257.4. To. Enter the office symbol for the HQ Cataloging and Standardization Center

8.260. Base 86 D143C Procedures.
8.260.1. Purpose. To provide users with the procedures for tracking requests for cataloging
using the Air Force FLIS Editing and Routing System (D143C).
8.260.2. Part I - Establishing a Base 86 Request In D143C.
8.260.2.1. Access to The D143C System. To access the D143C system, enter the necessary
information on the main menu.

Figure 8.2. D143 System Access.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                     1217




8.260.2.1.1. The top of the main menu tells you that you have accessed the Air Force DLIS Edit
and Routing System (D143C). At the selection prompt, enter 5 for base-initiated AF IMT 86.
8.260.2.1.2. The fields for ACTIVITY CODE (86), POSITION CODE (BASE), and your ID
CODE are automatically displayed. If you find the information displayed to be incorrect, contact
your D143C OPR with the correct information. Enter your name and DSN (formerly
AUTOVON). DO NOT include a dash (-) after your DSN prefix. This brings you to the Reason
Code Options Screen.

8.260.3. Option (Reason Code #, E To End). From this screen, enter the reason code number of
the request you wish to establish. Selection of a reason code brings you to your first input screen
for your individual request.
8.260.4. Screen Procedures. At this point there are some general hints you will need to
understand about your inputs.
8.260.4.1. OPTIONS: Options are listed at the bottom of each screen and may be used at any
time during the Base 86 process (initiation, coordination, review). Whether an option is
available to you or not is determined by what position you hold (IM, ES, CATM, CJ, etc.) and
where you are in the process. This is revealed to the system when you sign on. If you choose an
option that is not available to you, the system will simply not allow you to use it. You will have
to select another option. The following options are provided:
8.260.4.1.1. RMKS - This option is used to add remarks. RMKS is used to add remarks after
the request has been established in D143C. Anyone can add remarks (including the initiator).

Figure 8.4. Remarks Screen.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                29 JANUARY 2014                                        1219




8.260.4.1.2. D043A - This option is used to obtain a D043A screening from any screen
reflecting this as a choice. This can be done by anyone involved in the review of this document
and by the initiator. Selection of this option takes you directly to D043A.
8.260.4.1.3. EDIT - You must edit a screen you have input prior to moving on to the next
screen. The system will not allow you to continue if the edits for that screen are not passed. It is
at this point that you will be prompted to complete certain fields and/or use the appropriate
option screen.
8.260.4.1.4. CANC - This option is used to cancel a request. This can be done by the initiator
only and will cause the transaction to be reflected in the pending actions file in purge status.
This control number cannot be duplicated after it has been canceled.
8.260.4.1.5. COOR - After entering all of the available information and performing an edit on
your last screen, choose this option. This shows you where the request goes when released as
well as reflects pertinent information about the initiator and the request.

8.260.4.1.6. CS - This option is used to clear the screen. This option available on OS screens
only if you initiated use of that screen for that request.
8.260.4.2. Input Screen: The input screens have been tailored to the individual reason codes.
Different types of requests require different types of information to be included. Select input
screens from the options below.
8.260.4.2.1. In some cases, whether you use the input screens available to you or not will
depend on whether you have additional information to include that is not necessarily required.
The input screens to which data can be entered by the initiator are OS1, OS2 and OS3.
8.260.4.2.1.1. Optional Screen 1 (OS1) - This screen is for related manufacturer's data. It is
required for reason code 1 requests for which no CAGE code is entered and is optional any other
time. However, if used, you must reply to at least one line of information. It is helpful to
include this information even when it is not required.

Figure 8.6. Optional Screen 1.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1221




8.260.4.2.1.2. Optional Screen 2 (OS2) - This screen is for next higher assembly (NHA) and end
item (EI) information. It is required for some reason codes and optional for others. If you use it,
you must enter at least one line of information. It is helpful to include this information even
when it is not required.

Figure 8.7. Optional Screen 2.




8.260.4.2.1.3. Optional Screen 3 (OS3) - This screen is used to enter remarks. Only the initiator
can use OS3. It should be used to enter any additional information for which there is not already
a specific input field and which could be helpful in AFMC/A4IS 's or the ALC's review of the
request.
1222                                       AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014


Figure 8.8. Optional Screen 3.




Note: The difference between RMKS and OS3 is that OS3 is used during the initial input of the
request; RMKS can be used by anyone having access to the system after the request has been
established in D143C.Data entered in either RMKS or OS3 becomes a permanent part of the
history record and can be viewed by anyone having access to the system.
8.260.4.2.2. When using the input screens for specific reason codes, the input screens above may
become mandatory, in some cases. This is dependent upon how questions are answered or
whether or not a particular field has been filled with the requested information. Do not fill fields
on the reason code input screens for which you do not have the information. When in doubt,
leave it blank and see how the system reacts. The system is designed to prompt you to fill a field
or use the appropriate input screens in certain cases (that is, a blank TO field for a reason code 1
request for a component item will require the OS2 screen). In other instances, blank fields will
provoke no response from the system (that is, a blank MMAC field will not affect your input).
Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES will "Not Applicable" or "N/A" be used to fill a field. Please
ensure that all data entered into fields is meaningful to the request.


8.260.4.3. AF IMT 86 Control Number: The control number must be properly formatted in
order for the system to accept it:
8.260.4.3.1. The first three positions represents the routing identifier code (RIC) and must begin
with a D or an F. If it begins with a D (SBSS activities) then:
8.260.4.3.1.1. Position 2 must be alpha and position 3 must be alpha/numeric (for example, DU5
or DMQ).
8.260.4.3.1.2. The serial number (positions 5-8) must be four numeric (for example,
DMQ10234).
8.260.4.3.2. If it begins with an F (non-SBSS activities), then:
8.260.4.3.2.1. The RIC must be FLB, FGB, or FHB.
8.260.4.3.2.2. Positions 5-7 must be numeric and position 8 must be alpha (for example,
FPB1023A).
8.260.4.3.3. The fourth position of the control number must be the last position of the current
year (that is, 1 for 1991, 2 for 1992) (for example, DMQ10234 (1991) or DMQ20001 (1992)).

8.260.4.4. FSC. the FSC must be valid. In addition to being valid, the FSC must be one of
those for which AFMC/A4IS is the responsible cataloging activity or must fall into FSG 68 and
91 or in FSC 8120. All other FSGs and FSCs are listed as routing exceptions in section T,
paragraph 162d. These must continue to be mailed on long AF IMT 86 to the responsible
cataloging activities listed.
8.260.4.5. MMAC. MMAC must be valid (but may be left blank).
8.260.4.6. NSN:
8.260.4.6.1. Is separated by spaces, not dashes.
8.260.4.6.2. Must consist of all numeric. Do not enter P numbers, L numbers, or NC or ND
numbers in the NSN field. If this type of information is available, include on the OS3 (remarks)
screen.
8.260.4.7. ERRC. ERRC must be one position and valid. Do not enter a 3-digit ERRC
designator. A cross-reference of three-position to one-position ERRCs is provided below.

8.260.4.8. U/I. The U/I must be valid.
8.260.4.9. Unit Cost.
8.260.4.9.1. Must reflect dollars and cents with a decimal in between (for example, 35.17).
8.260.4.9.2. Requires that you answer Y(es) or N(o) to the ESTIMATED field.
8.260.4.10. Projected 180-day Quantity, Quantity on Hand and Quantity on Order. There fields
may be zero filled. However, the request is more likely to be approved if this information is
provided. Notes: 1. Be sure you provide quantities and not number of demands. If quantity
exceeds three positions, enter a high number (that is, 888) and put true quantity on the OS3
screen or in the RMKS. 2. Avoid use of 999 as this is viewed by AFMC/A4IS as a blank field.
8.260.5. Input Screen Information. Once you have selected a Reason Code, fill in the
information requested on the input screens. Don't forget to use the OS3 screen for any additional
information.
8.260.6. COOR Options. After entering all of the available information and performing an edit
on your last screen, choose the COOR option. This will take you to the Base 86 Coordination
Screen. This screen shows you where the request went as well as reflects pertinent information
about you (the initiator) and your request. Your entire input will become a permanent part of the
history record and can be viewed by anyone having access to the system.

8.260.7. Reason Code 1. Selecting this reason code brings you to the New NSN Assignment
Screen. The following are some specific things about this input that you need to know.

Figure 8.9. New NSN Assignment Screen.




8.260.7.1. Estimated Fields. The purpose of the Estimated field is to indicate whether or not the
price is estimated. Y (YES) or N (NO) are the only acceptable responses to this field.
8.260.7.2. Component Field. The purpose of the component field is to indicate whether the item
being requested is part of another item, such as a disk drive for a computer (answer would then
be Y for YES) or whether it is a stand-alone item, such as a paper shredder (answer would then
be N for NO).
8.260.7.2.1. If the answer is yes, the initiator must enter information in the technical
order/figure/index field or complete OS2.
8.260.7.2.2. If TO/figure/index is not available, the field may be left blank only if Optional
Screen 2 (OS2) is used. OS2 information should include information about the end item (EI)
and/or next higher assembly (NHA) of which the requested item is a part. Pertinent EI and NHA
information would include NSNs, reference numbers, model numbers, etc.
8.260.7.2.3. If the answer to the component question is NO, the Optional Screen 3 (OS3)
remarks screen becomes mandatory. For stand-alone items with no TO information, the usage
data (who uses it, how it is used, where it is used, what it is used for) must be entered on the OS3
remarks screen.
8.260.7.3. Technical data is not required for stock-list action, however, it is helpful and
sometimes furnished with a hard copy request. But a response to the Tech Data field is required.
Indicate whether this data is M(ailed), F(axed) or if N(o) data is furnished.
8.260.7.3.1. When data is to be mailed or faxed, check the COOR screen to verify which activity
will receive the request. Addresses and available FAX numbers are listed below.

    This reason code is similar to reason codes 2 and 6 in that the AF is requesting to become a
user of a non-AF used (or disposal type) NSN. It is used when the LRS/Materiel Management
Activity has ordered an AF used NSN and received a non-AF used NSN in its place. If it is an
acceptable substitute, the base requests to be added as a user of the non-AF used NSN. The first
NIIN entered should be the non-AF used NSN. The second one is entered in the Air Force used
NSN field and represents the NSN which was originally ordered.


8.260.15. Reason Code 9. Selecting this reason code brings you to the ERRC Data Review
Screen.

Figure 8.15. ERRC Data Review Screen.




8.260.16. Status of Requests. All requests will result in the ADRSS transmission of a BBS
notification with a two-digit completion/status code and a clear text message. However, you may
also look up the status of your request at any time by selecting option 8 (Pending/History File)
from the D143C Main Menu. This file will reflect, in the form of raw data, the location and
status of your request. Selecting option 8 will provide you with the most current information,
since all status changes are immediately reflected. Two-digit status codes are reflected in Para
8.258.
8.260.17. Disconnect from The D143C. If, during submission of a request, you are timed out or
cut off from the D143C system for any reason, your control number will immediately go into
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP                 29 JANUARY 2014                                        1229

purge status. This can be verified by checking the pending/history file (option 8). While in
purge status, the control number cannot be reused. However, it will be available for reuse the
following day.
8.260.18. Part II. Pending Actions/History Data File. This file consists of raw data about AF
IMT 86 requests. It reveals the path the requests have taken since being suspended in D143C, as
well as pertinent information about the status of the requests and the individuals at each activity
(base, AFMC/A4IS, and ALC) who have been involved with the submittal and review of the
requests. For base activities having direct access to D143C, this file should eliminate all follow-
up transactions submitted for the purpose of determining the latest status of requests or to
compensate for nonreceipt of BBS responses from the SBSS.
8.260.19. Access to The Pending Actions/History Data File. To access the Pending
Actions/History Data File enter 8 from the main menu screen. This brings you to the Pending
Action/History Data Screen. On this screen, enter the AF IMT 86 control number or the NIIN or
the CAGE code and reference number you wish to inquire about.

Figure 8.16. Pending Actions/History Data Screen.




8.260.19.1. Pending Action File. The option field at bottom of screen will default to CUR for
current file. After entering the above information, hit the return (enter) key. If the request is not
resident in the Pending Action File, a message will appear at the bottom of the screen indicating
that the request is not in the Pending Action File, and the option will default from CUR to HST.
Hitting the return key at this point accesses the History File. If the request is neither in current or
history, it was never suspended in D143C.

Figure 8.17. Pending Actions/History Data Screen.
1230                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP             29 JANUARY 2014




8.260.19.2. D143C Data Screen. If the request is resident in the Pending Action File, the raw
data for that request will be reflected on the D143C Data Screen.

Figure 8.18. D143C Data Screen.




8.260.19.3. D143C History List As Of (Date) Screen. When the screened item appears in the
History File, a screen entitled D143C History List As Of (Date) is displayed.

AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                     1231




8.260.19.3.1. At this point, you will need to enter the line number of the request you wish to
review in the option field below. When screening by NIIN or CAGE code/reference number, the
History File may reflect multiple requests. After selecting the line number, the raw data will be
reflected on the D143C Data Screen by selecting HST.

Figure 8.20. D143C History List As Of (Date) Screen.

8.260.20. Updating Records Maintenance. The data provided in this file can be very useful to
you in updating your Records Maintenance files and logs. Requesting status on a request will
simply be a matter of accessing the D143C and interpreting the raw data on the D143C Data
Screen rather than submitting a BZH (SBSS follow-up transaction) or a letter/message follow-up
to AFMC/A4IS. In order to interpret the raw data reflected, you need to know that the data is
reflected in the following three categories:
8.260.20.1. BZ - The first group of data identifies the initial input of the request into the D143C
system in the form of BZ_ transactions. The final letter of the BZ_ document identifier code
(DIC) is reflected on the far left. For example, the D143C Data Screen - HST reflects a BZ4,
BZF and BZR. These DICs and their formats and definitions are reflected in Para 8.253, Para
8.253, section B, Para 8.253, section C, Para 8.254, Para 8.255, and Para 8.256.
8.260.20.2. REM - The next group of data identifies remarks and completion/status coded
transactions. They are identified with 8CC. These are entered by selecting the RMKS option
after the request is suspense in the system or by selecting a two-digit completion/status code at
the COOR (for completion) or MSSG (for interim messages or statuses) screen. In the case of
COOR or MSSG, the 8CC generates a status to the base in the form of a BBS, which is also
reflected. D143C reflects this information as well as forwards the BBS with the two-digit
completion/status code to the initiating base via ADRSS. The definition of the two-digit
completion/status code is reflected in the 8CC which follows the BBS along with the identifying
information of the person who initiated the transaction (located above the text). See Para 8.256
for BBS formats. Remarks are displayed in descending order by date (newest to oldest). The
expected completion date (BBS with status code of BB) can be found at the bottom (first and
oldest entry) of the REM block.
8.260.20.3. CD - The last group of data identifies the coordination for the request. This category
reflects the activity code, position code, ID code, name and phone number of the initiator and
every workbench the transaction went through. The release date by each person (reviewer or
initiator) is also reflected. See Para 8.256 for coordination format both before and after review.
For requests still in process (found in Pending Actions File) an asterisk (*) is reflected next to the
current location of the request. This information is displayed in ascending order by date (oldest
to newest) with the asterisk (*) being reflected on the bottom line of this group of data. If the
control number is in the history file, REL (for release) will be reflected on the line of the person
who closed the request.
8.260.21. D143C Data Screen Options. The following options are available from the D143C
Data screen.
8.260.21.1. PLUS SIGN (+) - This option is used to view additional pages of data for a control
number from the Pending Actions/History File. It is displayed on the first page of data.
8.260.21.2. MINUS (DASH) SIGN (-) - This option is used to view previous pages of data on
the D143C Data Screen.         Note: D143C defaults to a minus (-) on other than the first page of
data when additional pages are not available and to a plus (+) when additional pages are
available.
8.260.21.3. DISP - The Base 86 input screens may be displayed at any time from the D143C
Data Screen. However, the information on these screens cannot be changed once they are edited
and suspended in D143C.
8.260.21.4. RMKS - Anyone viewing the Pending Actions/History Data File may add remarks
by selecting this option from the D143C Data Screen or from the displayed request. Only the
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP               29 JANUARY 2014                                       1233

person whose workbench has the request may take an action other than adding remarks. (Note:
Base activities do not have workbenches.)
8.260.21.5. D043A - A screening of the part number (reason code 1) or the NSN (reason codes 2
through 9) may be obtained at any time by selecting this option.
8.260.21.6. END - Select this option to exit the pending Actions/History Data File.
8.260.22. Enhancements/Benefits of The Pending Actions/History Data File. Prior to D143C
implementation, numerous follow-ups were submitted to AFMC/A4IS because of the
unreliability of receiving BBS responses through the SBSS BLAMES (Base Level Automatic
Message Extraction System). Some responses were received inconsistently while others weren't
received at all. In addition, limited space often made the responses hard to understand. By using
the Pending Actions/History Data File, you will:
8.260.22.1. Greatly reduce or even eliminate the labor-intensive practice of initiating
mechanized (BZH) and hard copy follow-ups.
8.260.22.2. Receive more complete and more understandable responses.
8.260.22.3. Be able to review any justifications provided for the decision made by reviewing the
REM (remarks) portion of the file.
8.260.22.4. Obtain the name and phone number of the final reviewer as well as others involved
in the review of the request.
8.260.23. BBS VIA ADRSS. Although you will have easy access to D143C on-line files, BBS
responses will continue to be transmitted via ADRSS. However, keep in mind that D143C Data
Screen is updated instantly, while data transmitted via ADRSS takes a few days to week to reach
you. Because of this, you may receive a BBS via ADRSS after the status has changed again in
D143C. When reviewing responses, be sure you check your dates to ensure that you are posting
the most current status.
8.260.24. Follow-ups. There may be times when follow-ups are necessary even though you are
able to review the status in D143C. For instance, when a control number has remained in an
open or interim status for a long period of time, you may want to follow-up to speed the
processing. This can be done in the following ways:
8.260.24.1. Using DSN Option. Review the CD portion of the D143C Data Screen for the last
name reflected with a phone number. If the request is located at AFMC/A4IS (activity TU), that
last line will have the asterisk (*) next to it and a phone extension only. Using the DSN prefix
and the extension reflected you can contact the AFMC/A4IS technician responsible for that
request. However, if the request is located at an activity other than TU, the asterisk (*) will be
reflected on the last line but the line before it will reflect a phone number of the person who
reviewed it last. This person can assist you in contacting the person currently responsible for the
review of your request (see Para 8.256).
8.260.24.2. Using RMKS Option. If you prefer not to call or cannot get through to the phone
number reflected, you can simply select the RMKS option and enter a message indicating that
you would like to follow-up on your request. Your remarks will automatically become a
permanent part of your request. Your name and phone number will be recorded in the REM
portion of the D143C Data Screen. The reviewer is obligated to review your remarks along with
the rest of the request.
8.260.25. Getting Assistance. If, after reviewing the D143C Data Screen, you are not satisfied
with the response or the action taken, contact the reviewer for an explanation. 401
SCMS/GUMB can provide assistance in this area if you are still not satisfied. Call DSN 674-
1234                                     AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014

0121, or commercial (937) 904-0121 contact the person reflected on the D143C Data Screen in
the CD portion with activity TU and position code of CJ.
8.261. Reason Code Assignment.
8.261.1. Purpose. A valid reason code for each AF IMT 86 must be assigned by the submitter.

Notes:
1. (Base Activities) Do not prepare an AF IMT 86 for an item that meets any of the
following conditions:
a. The base is submitting part number requisitions to an AFMC source.
b. The base has submitted an AF IMT 601, Equipment Action Request, to AFMC.
AFH23-123V2PT2_AMCSUP              29 JANUARY 2014                                       1235


c. The items have a local ERRCD as a result of project CONSTANT SHELTER
(chemical warfare defensive materiel). Inventory managers will automatically take
cataloging action under the above conditions.
2. Do not submit an AF IMT 86 for changes to MMACs. Submit a letter to the current
IM for IM review and consideration. If the IM requires assistance in their review, the
request(s) will be forwarded by the IM to HQ AFMC/XPX for final resolution.
3. Do not submit AF IMTs 86 on items coded in terminal status (that is, acquisition
advice code V or Y) in the medical commodity. To determine the appropriate
replacement or the reason for the terminal status, contact the local medical materiel
manager at the support FM account. For ALC generated AF IMTs 86, enter the
complete organizational symbol of the activity to whom the form is being forwarded for
action. When the form is being forwarded to an off-base activity, enter the complete
official mailing address.
4. Do not submit an AF IMT 86 if you have already submitted an AFTO Form 135,
Industrial Radiography Safety Checklist.


8.262. AF IMT 86 Exception Routings.
8.262.1. Purpose. To provide a listing of conditions and recipients other than AFMC/A4IS for
routing AF IMT 86. AFMC/A4IS is the usual recipient of the AF IMT 86, with the exceptions
listed below. Although it is intended that, in time, all recipients of AF IMTs 86 use the D143C,
not all recipients may when you submit yours. If the recipient is not accessible through the
D143C, the D143C will inform you. D143C will also list the recipient's name and address in
order for you to submit a hard copy AF IMT 86. Note: Do not submit an AF IMT 86 for items
in FSG 89. If you have a question about whether an item belongs in FSG 89 or about an item in
FSC 89, send a letter or message to D1AFMWRA/MWHBR for review. Identify the item and
include a description of it. If the request is valid and approved, D1AFMWRA/MWHBR will
send its recommendations to the DLA Troop Support, Philadelphia PA 19101, for action as
required. If DLA TROOP SUPPORT/STC disapproves the request, D1AFMWRA/MWHBR
will send a response to the initiator.
