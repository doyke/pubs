     STRP to focus training objectives, ensure standards are being met, select upgrade
     candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training.
        1.4.6.3.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (Quarterly
        for ARC) and maintain minutes for a minimum of two years. STRP minutes will be
        approved by the Sq/CC or Sq/DO and may be produced, distributed, and/or stored
        electronically by Sq/DOTs (or ARC OST, as applicable).
        1.4.6.3.2. STRP Format.       The STRP should review staff and crewmember
        management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
        programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
        current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
        upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
        level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include
        but are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification
        training (i.e., crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training
        (including performance during training and current certification status), future
        training (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current
        waivers, projected waivers, and continuation training status.
     1.4.6.4. Ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground, and continuation
     training programs. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal.
     1.4.6.5. Before each semi-annual training period, assign Flying Training Levels (FTL)
     and levels of qualifications (instructor, evaluator, etc.) to assigned (and attached)
     crewmembers (see Chapter 4).

     graduate questionnaires via AETC web-based survey system.                            See
     https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod/. Complete the questionnaire NLT 120-days after
     completion of Mission Certification Training (MCT).
     1.4.6.7. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
     crewmember. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on individual
     crewmember‘s experience and proficiency.
     1.4.6.8. Through the training staff, will review training and evaluation records of a newly
     assigned or attached crewmember and those crewmembers completing formal training, to
     determine the necessary training required to complete/certify the individual as Basic
     Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR) status.

     A2.3).
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                    13


      1.4.6.9. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for unit-assigned Flight
      Surgeons.
      1.4.6.10. Execute unit-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction.
      1.4.6.11. Ensure Flight Commanders (Flt/CCs) or Squadron Training Flight (Sq/DOT)
      representatives monitor/check the quality of training being accomplished and identify any
      training deficiencies. Advise the Sq/CC of additional training needs.
   1.4.7. ATS Contractor. The KC-135 ATS contractor is responsible for academic and ATD
   instruction at KC-135 the R-model formal school at Altus AFB or specialized training at all
   KC-135 training sites. This responsibility is defined exclusively in the KC-135 ATS contract
   Performance Work Statement (PWS) and includes developing, updating and publishing
   courseware, formal school syllabi for AETC, maintain ATS facilities, maintenance and
   operation of all assigned ATD, etc. according to the KC-135 ATS contract (see Chapter 6).
   1.4.8. Formal School, Non-ATS. See requirements in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
   1.4.9. SIMCERT Status. KC-135 Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs) receive periodic
   SIMCERTs to gain/maintain Level C+ Certification. KC-135 Boom Operator Weapons
   Systems Trainer (BOWST) gain/maintain ARASQ Level 1 Certification. Each simulator has
   unique conditions and maintenance actions that require the device to gain/lose/regain
   certification by Det 2 AMCAOS. These actions have a direct impact on flight events
   creditable in the ATD (Table 4.4, Table 4.5, and Table 4.6).
      1.4.9.1. Units who require currency updates should check with their host ATD site
      manager for latest status.
      1.4.9.2. ATD Motion Requirements. For crewmembers to log flying training events
      motion systems must be used unless otherwise specified (see Chapter 4 tables for
      simulator creditable events). KC-135 OFTs modified with motion systems are capable of
      dramatic change in pitch and roll sufficient to cause occupants to be injured (if not
      secured). When training or conducting tours aboard the ATD equipped with motion
      systems, if motion is applied, all parties aboard will occupy a seat and wear the seatbelt;
      the Instructor Operator Station (IOS) will have a certified operator (see paragraph
      5.6.5). If the amount of people in the ATD exceeds the amount of seats or a certified
      operator is not aboard, do not use motion.
1.5. Waiver Authority.
   1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this instruction. Report
   deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
   who, in turn, should notify the OPR (lead command) for follow-on action if necessary. Units
   reporting deviations and exceptions will maintain copies of reported deviations/exceptions
   for two years. Waiver requests will include supporting rationale, the training start date, a
   summary of the unit‘s training plan, and estimated completion date.
   1.5.2. Unless specified in this instruction, MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent level) is the
   designated waiver authority for specific aircrew training requirements in this instruction that
   are not governed by AFI 11-202 Volume 1 or other AFIs.

 NOTE:
 For formal training waiver requests, units will submit requests through MAJCOM channels.
 MAJCOMs will in turn submit requests to AETC/A3Z for approval. Associate Units will keep Host
 OG/CC advised on the status of waivers initiated.
1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense Regulation, DoD 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of misuse when planning and executing local or off-
       station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures, for off-
       station training flight requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 AOC Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and tasked units will
   jointly identify and take maximum advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate
   continuation training items which may be conveniently suited to concurrent operational
   mission segments. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission
   effectiveness and the crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor
   of like specialty. See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-135
   Volume 3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2.
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program for all formal training courses leading to
qualification (or re-qualification) should be dedicated to that training program on a full-time
basis. In-unit training will begin no later than 45-days (90-days for ARC) after reporting or
being attached to a new duty station or unit. When conducting in-unit training, the commander
should relieve students of duties not directly related to training.
   1.7.1. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (training
   event directly contributing to qualification and upgrade) has begun or 45-days (90-days
   ARC) after being attached or assigned to the unit upon completion of the formal school
   course, whichever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). Examples of
   significant training events include: Computer-Based Training (CBT), Part Task Trainer
   (PTT), ATD event, ground training, flight, etc. MPD pilot upgrade to Aircraft Commander
   time limit begins upon Sq/CC direction to begin completion of the events in paragraph 5.3.5
   which leads to AC qualification and certification. Training time ends with the successful
   syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. Sq/CC may extend training time up to 60-days (120-days ARC) through a
   Memorandum For Record (MFR) or waiver website documentation in training folder; no
   notification to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is required. Extensions exceeding 60-days

ground training limitations IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3 designates AETC/A3R to manage
   the KC-135 PFT process in coordination with KC-135 lead and user commands. The PFT
   balances available formal training quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacities and
   course requirements on a Fiscal Year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT
   requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff. When requested, MAJCOM
   training staff will forward projections to AF/A3O for inclusion into the Graduate Program
   Requirements Document (GPRD). AETC/A3R will determine training capacity and report
   shortfall in the GPRD to AF/A3O.
       1.14.1.1. AF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to consider training
       capacity, MAJCOM training requests, and pipeline aircrew training students from which
       AF/A3O will produce the Graduate Program Guidance Letter (GPGL). AETC/A3R
       publishes the annual PFT based on the GPGL.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       the KC-135 formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made
       on quota management documents. AETC/A3R will publish the quota management
       documents on AETC PFT/Flying Hours/Metrics Programs CoP.
1.15. Information Management. Related mobility aircrew training information, including the
HQ AMC Orientation Tour / Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC), KC-135

   1.15.8. NGB/A3TM CoP contains specific information, links, waiver, and other features.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR) IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator Skill Levels. CEAs are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying
Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew qualifications
are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. Flight evaluations result in an AF Form 8,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2. After an AF Form 8 is
completed for the applicable flight evaluation, the crewmember is qualified to perform all duties
assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight
examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from OJT trainer or certifier designation
and are reflected in AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix
(standardization and evaluation flight examiner).
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC's
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201 Volume 1, Air Force Training Program, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC), and AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. This policy is mandatory for all
AMC units. All other units follow MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) guidance.
   1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
   requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep
   for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the
   Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual
   Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
   Programmed Flying Training (PFT) conference.
       1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS: Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to
       appropriate MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 SEP for the following fiscal year.
       The Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
       requirements) will be internally coordinated by MAJCOM Functional managers and
       submitted to Air Staff via the annual Graduate Program Requirements Document
       (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual Programmed Flying Training (PFT)
       conference.
   1.18.2. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class
   number to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any
   internal processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior
   to CSD will be offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices
   should reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to
   ensure training notification, ADSC acknowledgement statement, and orders were properly
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                 21


  issued. Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
  A3TF.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
     1.18.2.1. All course prerequisites should be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to
     allow for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate
     candidate for each allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 - 45
     days prior to CSD, notify AMC/A3TF with the alternate's information. If the primary
     becomes unavailable within 30 days of CSD, contact your host MPF formal training
     section to locally substitute the alternate IAW AMCI 36-2204 - provide a copy of the
     local substitution letter to AMC/A3TF.
     1.18.2.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted (they must also be
     identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data
     to AMC/A3TF.
  1.18.3. When submitting local upgrade requests, use the AMC/A3TF waiver website:
  https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.
     1.18.3.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted normally
     incurs an ADSC, insure required counseling and AF Form 63 is completed prior to start
     of training. Contact your local MPF Formal Training office for additional guidance.
     MILPDS training RIPs will automatically generate ADSC requirements.
  1.18.4. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  days prior to CSD.
  1.18.5. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained.
  Forward an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24
  hours of CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation
  from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AMC.A3T@us.af.mil and courtesy copy A3T.QuotaManagement@amc.af.mil.
  1.18.6. HQ AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC. Active duty units will be given priority over
  ARC units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC crews established in paragraph
  5.3.4.3. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing per class without the GRACC
  scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30 days prior to CSD.
  AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to CSD for units to confirm the names
  and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will be available 14 days prior to CSD
  and units will be notified. Cancellations must be received NLT four duty days prior to CSD
  to avoid a no-show. AMC/A3TF will not accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD.
  Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit.
  No-shows will be handled IAW this paragraph. Questions regarding GRACC scheduling can
  be referred to AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.
  1.18.7. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
22                                                         AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


  jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices
  exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This
  policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in-synch with each
  other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary
  and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.
  1.18.8. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
  OSS/OST training offices will forward all requests to the AMC quota manager for
  coordination with other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when
  considering this option.
  1.18.9. Senior Officer Training coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
  AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management
  office, AMC/A3TF, and AETC/A3R. Questions regarding Senior Officer training Course,
  availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to AMC/A3TF at DSN 779-3577. No formal
  actions to schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or AF/DPG in
  conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This
chapter specifies the minimum training requirements for initial qualification, re-qualification,
conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses. The primary method for initial
qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.
When a formal training course (quota) is not available, units may request a waiver to their
MAJCOM to conduct a secondary method of training. Secondary method includes the
completion of the appropriate formal training course--academic only with follow-on flying
training conducted in-unit. As a last resort, request a waiver to complete a formal training course
in-unit using the appropriate syllabus, formal school courseware, and simulator training. In the
waiver request (Figure 1.1) the unit must describe the proposed alternative training solution and
training schedule (see paragraph 1.5.5).
2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification
prerequisites IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and the course syllabus. See Chapter 6 for formal
IQT course listing and prerequisites in Table 5.1.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and this instruction. During formal training, aircrews
may complete (and receive credit) for Mobility Training and Ancillary Training events in Table
4.2. See the appropriate formal training course syllabus.
   2.3.1. If events in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at the FTU, they must be completed at the
   gaining unit. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation indicating
   completion of items in Table 2.1 using standard ARMS Event Identifiers. If in-unit training
   is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, unit is responsible for ensuring all
   requirements are completed.
   2.3.2. Completion of initial SERE schools, combat (SS20) or ECAC (SS19) and water
   (SS32) IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations,
   and initial aircrew flight equipment training (during formal school) will establish the follow-
   on due dates of training (based on the date first completing the course) for recurring survival
   and aircrew flight equipment training requirements.

NOTES:
1. If not accomplished during formal training.
2. Not required for BMC, BAQ crewmembers or SOC graduates not on aircrew mobility status (includes
senior officers and staff officers maintaining BAQ).
3. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required event is accomplished. Flight
physicals become due the 366th day after the previous physical and expire after the 455th day or as
indicated on the AF Form 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address
waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will
exceed 455 days.
4. Initial training is called S-V80-A (CST), S-V88-AL (ECAC) or S-V90-A (WST) IAW AFI 16-1301
(see paragraph 2.3.2.). This training is not accomplished at the FTU, but should be completed before
member arrives at the gaining unit. If the member arrives at the gaining unit without this training, it
should be scheduled as soon as practical. If assigned Flight Surgeon has completed S-V80-A, log SS20
and not SS19.
5. G002 is required with each Permanent Change of Station (PCS) IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft
Operations and Movement on the Ground.
6. IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for
accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.
7. All crewmembers will complete VT01; however, this only affects mission ready status for units
collocated with a VTRAT device. Non-collocated units must accomplish within 6 months of being
declared MR.
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                     25


2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
instructor aircrew members will provide the training to create an initial cadre. In some instances,
it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of crewmember personnel for whom specific
training qualification requirements may be waived upon request. The following conditions will
apply to the management of initial cadre crewmember qualification:
   2.5.1. Tasked MAJCOM, in-coordination with lead and training command, will develop a
   training plan for unit conversions.
       2.5.1.1. The training plan should include provisions to form a nucleus of crewmembers
       to include instructor and flight examiners (initial cadre).
       2.5.1.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held,
       e.g. C-17 Mission Pilot (MP) to KC-135 Evaluator Pilot (EP), unless previously qualified
       in the conversion aircraft.
   2.5.2. Units with unique aircraft modification (e.g., KC-135RT, etc.) or missions (e.g.,
   SOAR, Receiver Air Refueling, etc.) will develop and maintain in-unit difference training
   programs for assigned/attached crewmembers, if not available, as described in paragraph
   5.6. Units will submit these training programs to the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or
   equivalent) for approval. Use the appropriate ARMS events in Table 2.2 and include details
   in local supplement or OGI.
       2.5.2.1. Difference Certification. Sq/CC will complete crewmember certification when
       difference training is complete and an evaluation is not required. When applicable,
       annotate ―Q0XX Difference Certification‖ (see paragraph 1.8 and applicable events in
       Chapter 7). Away from home station, the assigned unit will complete an AF Form 4324
       and the individual will hand-carry to their host unit.
   2.5.3. In-unit Difference Training. Difference training assumes the student is qualified in the
   ‗X‘C-135 (e.g., OC-135, RC-135, etc.). A formal course may be appropriate (e.g., TX3) or
   units may develop a Difference Qualification Training (DQT) program based on available
   training resources (e.g., simulator, CBT, workbooks) and guide in Table 2.2.
   MAJCOM/A3X staff is approval authority for DQT on case-by-case only.

4. Accomplish if not already qualified/certified.
5. Required for SOAR-certified BO only.
6. Reference paragraph 5.6.4.3. for event requirements.
7. If equipped.

2.6. Multiple Qualification. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualification in
different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL-A currency requirements in each
aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7).
   2.6.1. KC-135R and T-model aircraft are considered the same MDS and do not meet
   multiple qualification criteria in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies senior
officer qualification requirements. SOC graduates will be assigned FTL-E for continuation
training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see paragraph
4.3.2.5). KC-135 R-model SOC is available on ETCA.
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and with OG/CC approval, senior
   officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
   qualification. The unit OSS/OST is responsible for determining training requirements based
   on the senior officer‘s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system.
   AMC/A3T or appropriate MAJCOM A3T (or equivalent) will approve the proposed training
   plan prior to execution.
   2.7.2. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
   FTL-A continuation training requirements.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log
time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph
3.5 for training requirements.
   2.8.1. Flight surgeons assigned to unit will complete all items in Table 4.3 for initial
   qualification. Complete flight surgeon testing on AFDL web based training.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (unless multiple
qualification has been approved prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first. The duration of
unqualified time is from the date the aircrew member became unqualified until the specific
retraining start date. For ADSCs related to aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. For additional
 28                                                         AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


requalification training limits and requirements, see AFI 11-202 Volume 1. RQT accomplished
at the FTU will follow the appropriate ATS course syllabus (see Table 6.1).
   2.9.1. KC-135 Instructor Requalification. Former KC-135 Instructors who are:
       2.9.1.1. Current and qualified in the KC-135, see paragraph 5.4.
       2.9.1.2. Unqualified for up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to
       51 months at the end of any active flying assignment may accomplish an in-unit training
       program (see paragraph 5.4) or TX3 course. A flight evaluation is required IAW AFI
       11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2, KC-135 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
       Crewmembers may simultaneously requalify as an Instructor during in-unit training or
       while attending TX3 course with approved waiver.
       2.9.1.3. Unqualified 39 or more months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or 51 or
       more months at the end of any active flying assignment, up to 8 Years, will complete
       TX2 course and a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2KC-135
       Volume 2. Crewmembers may simultaneously requalify as an Instructor while attending
       TX2 course with approved waiver.
       2.9.1.4. Unqualified for over 8 Years will complete TX1 course and a flight evaluation
       IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2. Crewmembers may not
       simultaneously requalify as Instructor.
   2.9.2. Requalification and Instructor training may be conducted simultaneously. Units
   conducting simultaneous requalification and instructor training must compare the formal
   requalification course syllabus, instructor course syllabus, and Table 2.3 to develop an
   individual training plan. The plan must include all phases of training and an appropriate
   (suitable) substitute (e.g. CBT, IBT, simulators, number of flights, etc.).
       2.9.2.1. For simultaneous requalification at the FTU, the gaining unit‘s Sq/CC will
       submit requests to the 97 TRS prior to the training start date. The FTU may decide not to
       qualify the individual to instructor status based on performance or resources.
       2.9.2.2. See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2 for simultaneous Instructor re-qualification
       training and evaluation requirements.

NOTES:
1. Student will complete the most recent web-based pre-attendance instructor course if the
individual has been unqualified or removed from KC-135 instructor status over 39-months.
Complete the course, including testing, before the flight evaluation.
2. For collocated units, accomplish in the ATD only.
3. Receiver qualified pilots only.
4. If not already qualified/certified.
5. Reference paragraph 5.6.4.3. for event requirements.
6. If equipped.
7. Assumes Basic Navigator requalification. SOAR-assigned units will develop/maintain a
SOAR training program (see paragraph 2.10.2.).

2.10. Navigator Training. Navigator training includes three training phases:
   2.10.1. Basic Navigator. KC-135 unit level staff navigator who may perform in-flight duties
   not including rendezvous (RDVZ). These basic Navigator duties are limited to system
   operation, communication, and crew coordination. Units may also maintain a local training
   program for initial and requalification training that focus on FMS-3 (B-Kit) operations,
   Checklist procedures, CRM and communication training. The maximum level of
   qualification is BMC (FTL-C or FTL-E). See ground and continuation training requirements
   in Chapter 4.
       2.10.1.1. Basic Navigators may fly any sortie with an FMS-3 suite installed. The BMC
       basic navigator may fly without an instructor of same specialty, once qualified. A BMC
       navigator may deploy and fly as a staff navigator (mission planning cell, scheduler, etc.).
       When used, basic navigator will complete requirements in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2.
       BMC basic navigator will comply with Theater Deployment Requirements (e.g.,
       CONOPS, etc.).
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                              31


     2.10.1.2. Basic Navigators non-current (FTL-E) may fly with an IN or IP to regain their
     currency (M010) with a FMS-3 Navigator Suite installed.
  2.10.2. SOAR Navigator. KC-135 Navigators complement designated SOAR units as
  additional crewmember. SOAR navigator training is conducted in-unit by 22 ARW,
  McConnell AFB. SOAR Navigators will be basic-qualified and will maintain MR status for
  the SOAR mission (USAFWS SOAR Navigators are not required to maintain MR status).
  See ground and continuation training requirements in Chapter 4.
     2.10.2.1. SOAR Navigators may fly any sortie with an FMS-3 suite installed.
     2.10.2.2. SOAR Navigators non-current in SOAR RV (S036) must fly with a current
     SOAR IN to regain currency. Non-SOAR sorties may still be accomplished while non-
     current in only S036.
  2.10.3. Instructor Navigator. See Table 5.3 for minimum flying time requirements. When
  selected for upgrade, complete course prerequisites (see paragraph 5.4.2.2). The CBT or
  web-based lessons (and testing) are a baseline program followed by completion of the
  appropriate in-unit developed instructor training and evaluation. Units will develop
  additional training requirements to meet requirements in paragraph 5.4.

                                          Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
conventional and/or OPLAN-8010 mission certification training (MCT). All crewmembers will
complete initial/re-qualification training prior to becoming mission ready (MR). Except where
specifically stated, units conducting initial/requalification training and MCT may arrange
mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to use flying training hours
effectively. Crewmembers will be mission ready (MR) before entry in special mission
certification or upgrade training unless noted in Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 or unless the mission
training is specifically directed as pre-MCT (i.e., SOAR and AAR certification). Special mission
certifications run concurrent with MCT will not delay MCT completion. Crewmembers in MCT
may participate in exercises.
   3.1.1. Conventional certification must be completed prior to crewmembers deploying. If
   operational requirements exist, conventional certification and OPLAN-8010 certification
   may be conducted separately. If OPLAN-8010 certification is not conducted in conjunction
   with conventional certification, the crewmember will complete OPLAN-8010 certification as
   soon as conditions permit (return from TDY, obtain appropriate clearance, etc.)
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Qualification and Certification Training. See paragraph 1.7
and Table 1.2 for In-Unit Training Time Limitations. A crewmember will be MR after
completion of all ground training and flying training requirements, review and certification by
Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R&C) Board IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and appropriate
supplement. Completion of ground training requirements in Table 3.1. and flying training
requirements in Table 3.2. will result in a crewmember being declared MR – Conventional.
Aircraft Commander conventional certification requires Sq/CC approval through the R&C Board
according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.
   3.2.1. MR – Conventional certified AC Initial Qualification (TX1 or TX2) graduates will be
   counted as a MR pilot for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as an FPL, on any crew,
   including operational missions, upon completion of MCT. TX1 or TX2 graduates are not
   considered a MR AC and may not fly as the A-code (Pilot-In-Command) until formally
   certified by the Sq/CC, see paragraph 5.3 for AC upgrade requirements.
   3.2.2. Crewmembers in MCT (who are current and qualified), may fly without an Instructor
   of like specialty on CONUS only training sorties. OCONUS units may allow NMR
   crewmembers to fly local, routine, and non-contingency overseas sorties in their respective
   theater. NMR ACs may perform AC duties under supervision of an IP.
   3.2.3. For units with an OPLAN-8010 commitment, complete the appropriate training events
   in Table 3.3 and IAW AMCI 10-450, Support of Nuclear Planning and Operations.
   Completion will result in a crewmember being declared MR – OPLAN-8010. Certification
   will include a mission briefing to the Wg/CC or designated representative.
       3.2.3.1. Units with an OPLAN-8010 commitment will have 100 percent of crewmembers
       OPLAN-8010 certified (not required for basic or SOAR navigators). Complete events in
       Table 3.3 before Q010, OPLAN-8010 certification (see paragraph 3.1.1 for exceptions).
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                  33


      3.2.3.2. OPLAN-8010 certification is not required for crewmembers attached for the
      purposes of maintaining flying currency and expertise (i.e., MAJCOM HQ and NAF
      assigned crewmembers).
      3.2.3.3. Q010 is not required for formal school instructors unless specified in MAJCOM
      supplement.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will complete applicable events in
Table 3.1, as well as any events not accomplished at the FTU in Table 2.1. For units with
OPLAN-8010, complete all applicable ground events in Table 3.3. MCT is not applicable for
senior officers or staff officers who maintain BAQ (except basic Navigator) and may be
accomplished concurrently with other training programs or courses.
   3.3.1. Local training and CONUS missions may be flown before completing all events
   except as noted in Table 3.1.
   3.3.2. If required, complete FTU proficiency (P) events (not accomplished at formal school
   course) before MR.
   3.3.3. MR crewmembers transferring between units (or BMC crewmembers transferring to a
   BMC unit) will require unit-specific MR or syllabus training events (and events in which
   they may have lost currency during the change-of-station).
   3.3.4. Ground training events accomplished during MCT establishes the crewmember‘s due
   dates for subsequent continuation training. Completion of S-V80-A, S-V88-AL, S-V90-A
   according to AFI 16-1301 and initial aircrew flight equipment training (during formal school)
   will establish the follow-on due dates of training (based on the date first completing the

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure each crewmember receives
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. KC-135 crewmembers are assigned to the following status:
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS),
   operational tasking, and deployments a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available
   and qualified in the squadron‘s mission (will have completed qualification and mission
   certification training for the applicable crew position in this AFI).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   continuation training. NMR crewmembers cannot deploy.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission ready (NMR) crewmember assigned
   to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), USAFEC, Contingency Response
   Wing (CRW), Contingency Response Group (CRG), formal school, or Direct Reporting Unit
   (DRU), who has satisfactorily completed mission certification training, does not maintain
   MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command‘s or unit‘s operational mission.
   Basic (non-SOAR) Navigators should be assigned BMC.
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission
       and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.
       4.2.3.2. Formal School (AETC) and USAFWS BMC crewmembers are qualified to
       conduct all aspects of their respective training mission in accordance to their training
       syllabi. AETC instructors must be qualified in the training/unit mission before
       performing instructor duties. Current and qualified formal school instructors maintain
       MR status if they complete the appropriate events in Chapter 4 (events exempted by
       note).
       4.2.3.3. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified and performing instructor or evaluator
       duties.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements                                                                            in
   AFI 11-202 Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground
   and semi-annual flying continuation tables in Chapter 4.
4.3. Training Levels.
40                                                        AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


  4.3.1. Sq/CC will assign FTLs to assigned (and attached) crewmembers (see paragraph
  1.4.6). Establish FTL assignments on experience and aircraft proficiency.
     4.3.1.1. NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM staff, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC),
     USAFEC, CRW, CRG, formal school, USAFWS, or direct reporting unit (DRU), are
     normally categorized as BMC and assigned FTL-A or -E. Basic (non-SOAR) navigators
     are assigned FTL-C or -E.
     4.3.1.2. MAJCOM staff and/or NAF instructor/flight evaluators may fly unsupervised
     when maintaining FTL-A and applicable ground training in Table 4.1. BMC MAJCOM
     instructors or evaluators assigned overseas or in the CONUS may fly unsupervised on
     routine, non-contingency sorties in their respective theaters. Lead Command evaluators
     may fly unsupervised in any theater when maintaining FTL-A and applicable training in
     Table 4.1 and 4.2.
     4.3.1.3. Formal school and USAFWS instructors are exempt from a series of training
     events (e.g., G182, G190, LL04, P280, Q016, SS02, and SS03) unless specified in
     MAJCOM supplement.
  4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTLs).
     4.3.2.1. FTL-A Highly Experienced Crewmembers. (As a guide, crewmembers having
     10 or more years of operational flying experience) This may include MR or NMR
     MAJCOM headquarters staff and 618 AOC (TACC) personnel; formal schoolhouse
     instructors; NAF personnel; USAFEC instructors, Wg/CC, OG/CC, and Sq/CC,
     Operations Officers, crewmembers assigned to OG evaluation positions, and Instructors
     assigned primarily to staff duties. Sq/CC may assign highly experienced MR line
     crewmembers to FTL-A.
     4.3.2.2. FTL-B Experienced, MR Crewmember. (As a guide, crewmembers having
     between 5-10 years of operational flying experience).
     4.3.2.3. FTL-C MR Crewmember or BAQ Crewmember pursuing MR status after initial
     qualification training. (As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational
     flying experience) Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers to FTL-C.
     4.3.2.4. FTL-D No longer used.
     4.3.2.5. FTL-E — BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. May include senior officers,
     MAJCOM, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC) staff, and attached flyers who are not maintaining
     MR or instructor status. FTL-E requirements are insufficient for MR status and
     crewmembers assigned to FTL-E will fly with an Instructor of like specialty at all times
     (see paragraph 1.10.4). BMC Basic Navigators see paragraph 2.10.1. FTL-E aircrew
     are encouraged to complete all available continuation training events.
     4.3.2.6. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a
     crewmember to a level requiring fewer events. Exception: Units associating FTLs with
     crew positions may change FTLs after upgrade is complete (i.e., Instructor upgrade).
     BAQ crewmembers may be placed into a different FTL any time after attaining MR
     status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.

  training where the aviator receives periodic continuation training. Separate levels are no
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                    41


   longer used. All crewmembers will follow the frequency listed for their crew position in
   Table 4.1 (see notes for applicable exceptions).
4.4. Training Events/Tables. ARMS training event identifiers and event descriptions are listed
in Chapter 7. The unit may designate Unit Defined Events (UDE) as a ―X‖ event (i.e., X020)
and will include local ―X‖ event identifiers in OG/CC level guidance (see paragraph 7.22).
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit required events accomplished on training
   missions (i.e., MCT, local requalification training, and local training sorties), operational
   missions and satisfactory qualification evaluations toward the crewmembers currency and
   continuation training requirements. Event completion establishes a subsequent due date.
   Use date of last satisfactory evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying training
   currency events that were trained during an ATS formal course. Pilots may credit G261,
   G262, G263, and G264 upon satisfactory completion of the formal course evaluation (use the
   evaluation date as the date of accomplishment). ATS courses are listed in Table 6.1 (see
   paragraph 4.8 for proration).
       4.4.1.1. Credit all AC Upgrade and Instructor course training event accomplishments
       toward continuation training requirements for the crew position in which the individual is
       currently qualifying, including upgrade training done in the left seat and pre- (or post)
       Instructor course pilot training done in the right seat.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training events items
   graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2) until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and Flight Examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total continuation training requirements per event while
   instructing or evaluating when the events requirement is 2 or more. Exception: Instructor
   and Flight Examiner Pilots may not credit takeoff or landings flown by another pilot.
   Instructor and Flight Examiner Boom Operators may not credit R070, R073, R100, R120,
   R125, R130, R140, R150, R155, R165 accomplished by another Boom Operator. Boom
   Operators may credit P270, P271, and P300 accomplished by another Boom Operator while
   observing, instructing, or evaluating.
   4.4.5. ARMS. Record all training events in ARMS (with the appropriate exemptions, notes,
   and adjustment in the course descriptions).
       4.4.5.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
       consolidated under one ARMS entry.
       4.4.5.2. Use one ARMS entry for combined training events.
       4.4.5.3. Input all one-time events and events required for Permanent Change-of-Station
       (PCS) in the ARMS database.
       4.4.5.4. Flying events accomplished in the simulator as allowed in Tables 4.4, 4.5, and
       4.6.will be coded with an ―S‖ prefix in ARMS. All simulator accomplishments must be
       documented and tracked in ARMS.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
 42                                                           AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual
   crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to
   ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1,
   Table 4.2, and Table 4.3.
       4.5.2.1. For Pilots, Navigators, and Boom Operators, failure to accomplish events in
       Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status. See paragraph 4.9 for exceptions and for
       regaining mission ready status.
       4.5.2.2. For Pilots, Navigators and Boom Operators, failure to complete mobility training
       in Table 4.2 does not lead to non-mission ready status, but may restrict member from
       certain missions. Mobility training items for attached personnel (i.e., MAJCOM, NAF,
       USAFEC, etc.) are not required to be tracked at unit of attachment unless deploying with
       attached unit. These individuals mobility requirements will be determined and tracked by
       assigned unit‘s Unit Deployment Manager (UDM).
       4.5.2.3. Crewmembers attached to units (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAFEC, etc.) may
       accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
       crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
       attachment (ARMS office).
       4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing alert duty may accomplish ground training that does
       not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment. Specify requirements
       and or restriction in MAJCOM supplement and local supplement or OGI.
       4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3. Note 2 indicates mobility
       events; failure to accomplish these events does not lead to non-mission ready status, but
       may restrict member from certain missions. Failure to complete all other events leads to
       non-mission ready status. See paragraph 4.9 for exceptions and for regaining mission
       ready status.

NOTES:
1. Failure to accomplish recurring ground events will result in ―do not fly status‖ until the
training is accomplished. See the appropriate event descriptions.
2. Not required for BMC or BAQ aircrew unless specified in this AFI (e.g. Basic Navigator see
paragraph 2.10.).
3. Only required for units with OPLAN-8010 requirements or as directed by MAJCOM. For
USAFE/PACAF, currency is (As Required) for G030 and G040.
4. The OG/CC is not the waiver authority for this event. Consult the reference directive for this
event to determine the appropriate waiver authority.
5. Special Operations Air Refueling (SOAR)-certified crewmembers only.
6. Credit during initial, upgrade, and re-qualification training to establish a reference date.
7. Crewmembers on active flying status must complete IRC every fourth quarter after
completion IAW AFMAN 11-210. This course is not linked with the IRC examination which is
to be completed in the check cycle.
8. Local sorties not requiring this event may be accomplished while non-current for this event
(see paragraph 4.9.3.1.). Crewmembers are not NMR for local sorties not requiring this event.
9. As Required for BMC crewmembers.
10. OPLAN 8010 only. Crewmembers that go NMR for this event must receive training for the
current quarter as well as training from the previous quarter. Crewmembers that are delinquent
in this event for consecutive quarters will be decertified from the OPLAN 8010 mission and
must receive initial OPLAN 8010 certification training, as described in Table 3.3. and
paragraph 3.2.3.
11. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember‘s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no longer a need to assign and track
these training events in the training module of ARMS.
12. Required after one-time Q033 MPRS Certification.
13. Not required MAJCOM HQ or NAF assigned crewmembers.
14. Individual will not fly until required event is accomplished. Flight phys4.icals become due
366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF
Form 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or
individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed
455 days.
15. AFI 11-2(MDS) Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. Refer
to reference publications for current ancillary training frequencies.
16. OG/CC may approve an extension of six months.
17. OG/CC may specify an alternate frequency for Tactics training, but not more than annual.
18. If overdue, may not fly sorties in a datalink environment.
19. Dual log with G240.
20. Initial VTRAT (VT01) is a prerequisite to VT05.
21. If collocated, VT05 must be accomplished in the VTRAT device. If not collocated with a

   4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Use Table 4.4, Table 4.5, and Table
   4.6. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
       4.5.3.1. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Flight events creditable in the ATD are
       listed in Table 4.4, Table 4.5 and Table 4.6 (see paragraph 4.4.5.4 for ARMS
       tracking). Both continuation training events and other events are listed.
          4.5.3.1.1. ATS contract instructor‘s supervision meets the requirements for
          continuation training events requiring instructor or direct instructor supervision.
 46                                                          AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


       4.5.3.2. As a minimum, senior officer and all other crewmembers maintaining BMC or
       BAQ status in the KC-135 will maintain FTL-E. Senior officers on MR status will
       comply with Table 4.4, Table 4.5. This requirement also applies to additional aircraft in
       which a senior officer may be qualified (see multiple qualification). Attached aviators
       may conduct flight training at other locations; however, interfly agreements and other
       documentation (ie…ITS, AF Form 1042, and other Go/No-Go documentation) may be
       required. See AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3 for passenger carrying
       restrictions.
       4.5.3.3. Each MAJCOM provides flying-hours to each wing as training, test, and ferry
       hours or organizational and maintenance (O & M) hours. Allocated flying hours are
       based on FTL-C, and are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient hours to
       accomplish all continuation flying training requirements with percentage of completion
       aboard flight simulators.
       4.5.3.4. Mission Oriented, Proficiency, and Phase simulator profiles (G240, G250, and
       G261-G264) will be flown in the same manner as the aircraft, to include the wear and use
       of professional gear (headsets, gloves, etc.).
          4.5.3.4.1. Simulator profiles will be scheduled as ground events in the primary
          scheduling program (GDSS II, GTIMS, PEX, etc.) and event cancellation authority
          will reside with the OG/CC (or designated representative).
          4.5.3.4.2. Simulator training pre-requisites (i.e., CBT, profile courseware/workbook,
          etc.) must be completed prior to the simulator start time or the training will be
          cancelled. Exception: ARC members should accomplish pre-requisites prior to Phase
          simulators, but the event will not be cancelled if a required CBT is not accomplished.
4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight Surgeons require one sortie
in any qualified MDS every 60 days (see paragraph 4.9.1.1.5 for regaining mission ready
status). Reference Table 4.3 for Flight Surgeon ground and flight continuation training
requirements.
   4.6.1. Any Flight Surgeon logging time in this MDS as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
   assigned Flight Surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they
   are granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning
   ASC 8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The
   AC or their designated crewmember must also give the FS a briefing on oxygen equipment
   and egress procedures prior to flight. Note: Initial Qualification requirements (in Chapters 2
   and 3) only apply to a Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
       4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
       following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS19 (S-V88-AL) or SS20 (S-
       V80-A), and G120.
       4.6.1.2. Notify the MAJCOM/SG when Flight Surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or
       annual requirements. MAJCOMs establish procedures to assess continued active flying
       authorization. Place a copy of the MAJCOM/SG notification in the member‘s flight
       training folder.

leadership role in Aerospace Medicine, and Flight Surgeons undergoing training in the USAF
Residency in Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.
3. The OG/CC is not the waiver authority for this event. Consult the reference directive for
this event to determine the appropriate waiver authority.
4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.
5. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the
455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required
frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined
by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.
6. AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. Refer
to reference publications for current ancillary training frequencies. Every effort will be made
to ensure Primary and Secondary passports do not expire within 6 months of each other. See
event description in Chapter 7 for additional information.
7. S-V80-A establishes an initial training completion date for SS02, SS03, and SS20. S-V88-
AL establishes an initial training completion date for SS02, SS03, and SS19.
8. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum requirements in
primary unit aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90 days.
9. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per
single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie requirements.
Exception: Credit ARC Flight Surgeons with a maximum of two sorties for separate flights
performed in a single calendar day, provided the interval between flights does not exceed 60
days and a minimum of 6 missions are flown each 6 months (see AFI 11-202 Volume 1 Table
1).
10. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight
duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.
11. To maintain currency, time between flights must not be more than 60 days. Notify the
MAJCOM/SG when time between flights exceeds 60 days. MAJCOMs establish procedures
for flight surgeons to regain flying currency.
12. Frequency in cited reference is annual while MAF aircrews standardize at 180 days.

NOTES:
1. Not required for BMC aircrew unless specified in MAJCOM Supplement.
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                    51


2. Not required for formal school or USAFWS instructors unless specified in MAJCOM
supplement.
3. SOAR-certified pilots only.
4. Receiver qualified pilots only. Loss of currency (R010, R013) or failure to complete semi-
annual volume requirement (R010, R013, R020, R035, R040, and R050) does not result in a loss
of mission ready status. Crewmembers may continue to participate unsupervised in all missions
not requiring receiver AAR; they may not deploy as a receiver-SOAR crewmember (i.e., filling a
receiver-SOAR requirement) until the event is accomplished or currency is regained.
5. OG/CC may substitute CONUS operational sorties for overseas sorties when tanker/airlift
requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for accomplishing the overseas sortie
requirement. Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not permitted.
6. Crewmembers are not NMR for local sorties not requiring this event. Local sorties may be
accomplished while non-current or for failure to complete semi-annual training for this event
(see paragraph 4.9.3.1.).
7. Required for OPLAN-8010 MR crewmembers only (may be combined with P271).
8. Collocated units must accomplish event in the simulator. Non-collocated units will
accomplish P040, P170, and P180 requirements semi-annually and will attempt to accomplish as
many simulated engine out training requirements as possible in the simulator, unless specified by
MAJCOM/A3.
9. Multiple aircraft qualified pilots, will accomplish one event quarterly in each aircraft model
qualified (qualified/maintaining currency in two MDS model aircraft, e.g., KC-135R and RC-
135W). KC-135 R and -T model aircraft are considered the same MDS (see paragraph 1.12.1.).
10. OG/CC may authorize 90-Day currency extension for night events to compensate for
climatic adjustments (long-daylight periods in summer). OG/CC may authorize pro-ration of
night events for the period 1 April through 30 September.
11. Typically accomplished with F020.
12. Motion not required to receive credit using simulator.
13. Initial M030 must be accomplished 180 days after completion of MCT.
14. Event 100% creditable in visual system replacement OFTs that are certified by AMC.
15. Currency requirement for touch and go certified AC only (not applicable to IP or EP).
16. N/A for units permanently based overseas.
17. FTL-C MPDs should conduct this event quarterly.
18. ATD link to another ATD required for credit if not accomplished in aircraft. Do not dual
log F030 with an F020 if accomplished in the ATD (since linked ATD is not needed for F030).
19. Dual log R010 when accomplishing R013.
20. Pilots may log event complete if accomplishing PF or PNF duties.
21. May be accomplished in an OFT after initial training in aircraft.
22. Required upon completion of certification/qualification (Block 40, RNAV/GPS).
23. Must be accomplished with at least one qualified AC on the crew; may only be logged as PF
or PNF. Exception: ARC may substitute an FTL-A FPQ for an AC, if needed.
24. Dual log G230.
25. All pilots (i.e., EP, IP, MP, FP) will log left and right seat takeoffs and landings to ensure
balanced exposure of the entire pilot crew force.
26. Not required for pilots assigned to MAJCOM HQ, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), and USAFEC
27. Units collocated with a simulator should perform this event in the simulator but may
accomplish in the aircraft during operational or continuation training missions on a non-
 52                                                           AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


interference basis.
28. For training, LAHSD and LAHSA may only be accomplished in the simulator (Exception:
509 WPS / KC-135 Weapons Instructor Course).
29. Individuals who have been deployed for an entire quarter or more (i.e., 1 Jan thru 31 Mar)
are considered current for this event until 45 days after return to home station.
30. Loss of currency does not result in a loss of mission ready status.
31. N/A for AETC and non-collocated units.
32. Event currency is Semi-Annual for non-collocated units.

NOTES:
1. Instructors may receive credit when observing, instructing, or performing evaluator duties.
2. Requirement is for FTL-A, B, and C Boom Operators to attend one of the G261-264 series
simulators Annually. FTL-E aircrew are not required to complete Phase Simulators, but are
allowed and encouraged to.
3. Not required for formal schoolhouse or USAFWS instructors unless specified in MAJCOM
supplement.
4. Required for OPLAN-8010 MR crewmembers only (may be combined with P271).
5. Required for SOAR-certified Boom Operators only.
6. OG/CC may authorize 90-day currency extension for night events for climatic adjustments
(long-daylight periods in summer). OG/CC may prorate night events for the period 1 Apr
through 30 Sep.
7. Complete in the aircraft if simulator is not available.
8. MPRS certified Boom Operators only. A Boom Operator non-current in M051 MPRS Sortie
will not be considered NMR for this event. Crewmembers may continue to participate
unsupervised in all missions not requiring MPRS operations. Crewmembers may deploy, but not
as a MPRS certified crewmember until currency is regained with a MPRS certified Instructor
Boom Operator (IBO).
9. Boom Operators assigned to MAJCOM, NAF, USAFEC, CRW, CRG, or formal schoolhouse
R150 currency is 1 per 365-days with no frequency requirements.
10. Dual log G230.
11. Only 3 R120 (Contact) and 2 R140 (Tanker Manual Contact) may be credited per BOWST
session.
12. Not required for BMC aircrew unless specified in MAJCOM Supplement.
13. Should be performed in the simulator but may be accomplished in the aircraft during
operational or continuation training missions on a non-interference basis.
14. Event currency is Annual for non-collocated ARC Boom Operators.
15. Not required for formal schoolhouse instructors.
16. Every effort will be made to ensure G983-G988 are each accomplished triennially.
17. Crewmembers are not NMR for local sorties not requiring this event. Local sorties may be
accomplished while non-current or for failure to complete semi-annual training for this event
(see paragraph 4.9.3.1).
4.7. Ancillary Training.
   4.7.1. Definition. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to mission
   accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-
   2KC-135 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.
   IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and AFI 36-2201 Air Force Training Program, the source AFIs,
   provide training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver has been authorized.
   See UDM representative to ensure compliance with additional USAF personnel training
   requirements. Some USAF ancillary training requirements may be accessed and tracked via
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                     55


   the Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS). UDMs have access to ADLS training
   records.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when contingency precludes training for
certain mission events (PACAF and USAFE: also contingency operations from home station).
This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same crewmember for
consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: Number of Months Available
   times the Event Volume divided by Number of Months in the Training Period. Round down
   to nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual was
   available for less than 15 days during the SA period.
       4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.7 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15-cumulative days. Combining non-consecutive periods of
       contingency alert is allowed for proration purposes.
       4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
       available) during the training period. Time available starts 45 days after sign-in or on the
       date of actual accomplishment of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract
       previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
       4.8.1.3. OG/OGT, OSS/OST or Sq/DOT (as applicable) will maintain training proration
       letter for a period of two years (commanders may increase this frequency as required).
       Non-collocated squadrons and detachments will forward proration letter to the unit for
       inclusion in the unit‘s records.
   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.

Table 4.7. Individual Availability.

        ≥166                   6
4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Place individuals on supervised status and
declare them NMR if they fail to maintain flying currencies, fail to complete semi-annual flying
continuation training requirements or ground continuation training requirements. See AFI 11-
2KC-135V3 paragraph 2.3 for flight authorization PIC codes. The following guidance applies:
56                                                          AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


  4.9.1. Flight Training Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in
  the flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semi-
  annual, or annually) within which an event must be accomplished. A currency event must be
  accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency.
     4.9.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals in one or more currency events in
     supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions
     requiring that event. Crewmembers are ―non-current‖ the day after event currency
     expires (i.e., a crewmember who accomplished a monthly currency event on 5 September,
     becomes non-current on 1 November).
         4.9.1.1.1. A Pilot non-current in Takeoff (P010, P020, P040), Landings (P170, P180,
         P190), Approaches (P070), or Landing, Night (unaided) (P192) will not fly
         unsupervised on any sortie.
         4.9.1.1.2. Pilots non-current in N010 Tanker RV do not require direct IP supervision.
         4.9.1.1.3. A Navigator who is non-current may be supervised by an IP and may
         regain currency by the same IP (Except SOAR RV).
         4.9.1.1.4. A Boom Operator non-current in M051 MPRS Sortie will not be
         considered NMR for this event. Boom Operators may continue to participate
         unsupervised in all missions not requiring MPRS operations. Boom Operators may
         deploy, but not as a MPRS certified crewmember until currency is regained with a
         MPRS certified IBO.
         4.9.1.1.5. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
         Command Surgeon of Flight Surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties (AMC
         units send notification to AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC). Flight Surgeons that
         exceed 60 days between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems
         conducted by a member of the flight crew designated by the AC prior to the flight to
         regain flying currency.
             4.9.1.1.5.1. The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the
             AMC/SGP memo or other approved form (e.g., AF Form 1522, locally generated
             form/memo/etc.). Note: Documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The
             Flight Surgeon must submit this documentation to the local Squadron/Host
             Aviation Resource Manager (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return
             to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM
             will place the documentation in the Flight Surgeon‘s training folder.
             4.9.1.1.5.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight
             will result in the loss of ability to log primary Flight Surgeon time.
         4.9.1.1.6. For all other non-current events, place individuals in supervised training
         status for that event and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event. The
         crewmember cannot deploy until currency is regained (see paragraph 1.10.3.1).
         Example: If the individual is non-current for tanker air refueling, the individual may
         fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties which are not scheduled for and do not
         accomplish tanker air refueling. OCONUS MAJCOM may allow individuals to fly
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                 57


        local, routine, and non-contingency mission in their respective theater as specified in
        local supplement, OGI or MAJCOM supplement.
     4.9.1.2. Regaining Currency.
        4.9.1.2.1. Loss of Currency up to 6-Months. Crewmembers maintain their current
        training level and no training folder is required. Crewmember must demonstrate
        proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while
        under supervision of an Air Force or ATS instructor for simulator creditable events
        (see paragraph 1.10.3.1 and paragraph 1.10.5.1).
        4.9.1.2.2. Loss of Currency exceeding 6-Months.           Crewmember is declared
        Unqualified for a loss of currency for events in Table 4.3, Table 4.4, Table 4.5, and
        Table 4.6.     Unqualified crewmembers cannot log flight training events. The
        crewmember will complete Sq/CC directed requalification training for the overdue
        events. Subsequent evaluations and ARMS documentation requirements will be IAW
        AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2 and AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
            4.9.1.2.2.1. Boom Operators non-current in M051 MPRS Sortie in excess of 6
            months will not be considered unqualified and require re-accomplishment of
            A006 MPRS Ground Training prior to attempting flight requirements that re-
            establish currency.
            4.9.1.2.2.2. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require
            completion of LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a
            certified aircrew instructor prior to the next flight.
  4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-Annual Flying Training Events.
     4.9.2.1. The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training
     period. For individuals who fail to accomplish training requirements, the Sq/CC will
     either declare them NMR for that event or request an OG/CC Waiver for the requirement
     (paragraph 1.5.7).
        4.9.2.1.1. If the OG/CC issues a waiver and the waiver is not complied with, then
        declare the individual NMR for failure to complete semi-annual flying training
        events. Supervised status is required for that event (crewmember flies with an
        instructor of like specialty) until Sq/CC directed re-training is accomplished, and the
        crewmember cannot deploy until Sq/CC directed re-training is accomplished. An AF
        Form 4022 is not required; training may be documented on the NMR letter.
        4.9.2.1.2. If individual placed on NMR status, the individual must complete all
        delinquent training events under instructor supervision to regain MR status for those
        delinquent events. An AF Form 4022 is not required (see paragraph 4.4.3).
     4.9.2.2. Pilots non-current in Data Link (M007) still maintain MR status, may fly in a
     non-Data Link mode, and may still deploy OCONUS.
        4.9.2.2.1. If a Pilot or Navigator is delinquent in M007, the crewmember will
        accomplish refresher data link CBTs, review aircraft normal/abnormal data link
        operations/procedures, and review appropriate data link courseware.
 58                                                         AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


      4.9.2.3. Notify the MAJCOM/SG when Flight Surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or
      annual sortie requirements. MAJCOMs establish procedures to assess continued active
      flying authorization. Place a copy of the MAJCOM/SG notification in the members
      flight training folder.
      4.9.2.4. Waivers for Flight Training Events. The Sq/CC will send waiver requests for
      Failure-to-Complete training to the OG/CC for endorsement, per paragraph 1.5.7.
   4.9.3. Ground Training Events.
      4.9.3.1. Failure to Complete. Individuals who fail to complete ground training
      requirements are declared NMR. The crewmember cannot deploy until training is
      accomplished (Exception: Noncurrent crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local,
      routine, and CONUS missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground
      training event). Crewmembers NMR in OPLAN-8010 ground training events (G030,
      G040, G041B or Q010) remain MR-conventional. Units will attempt to return NMR
      OPLAN-8010 crewmembers to MR status as soon as practical.
          4.9.3.1.1. An individual NMR for failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training
          (G182) may fly unsupervised on local training missions only with Sq/CC approval
          until training is completed.
      4.9.3.2. Waivers for Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
      ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3
      according to paragraph 1.5.7. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
      individual crewmember‘s experience and proficiency level; waivers will not be based on
      a crewmember‘s availability. The OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of
      the waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity.
      This waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not
      degrade mission accomplishment.
   4.9.4. With OG/CC concurrence, make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards
   the new training period.
   4.9.5. OG/OGT, OSS/OST or Sq/DOT (as applicable) will maintain NMR and Waiver
   records for a minimum of two years. Non-collocated squadrons and detachments will
   forward NMR and Waiver records to the parent unit for inclusion in the parent units records.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS Or TDY By Members On Active Flying Status. AFI 11-
202 Volume 1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying Status. AFI 11-202 Volume 1
specifies requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies
requirements while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies retraining restriction before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade.
   5.1.1. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum prerequisites for entry into
   upgrade programs (this includes all Table 5.1 flying hour requirements).

 NOTES:
 1. Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a
 military pilot including SUPT ―student‖ and ―other‖ time (but does not include time in another
 aircrew specialty). Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.
 2. 100 KC-135 hours PAA required before R&C to perform AC duties.
 3. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-17, C-5, etc.), use TX2; MPD Phase II
 guide is not required. Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), use TX1;
 accomplish MPD Phase II guide in-unit.
5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (TX1 or TX2) formal
training courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates in
certification as an Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three phases:
MPD Phase I (V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will be dual-
seat qualified and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.
MPD pilots are not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.
   5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots being mentored and provided
   with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
   based on performance and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an

5.3. MPD Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as
   V280 and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
   completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
   5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter Phase I of
   continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which
   focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems
   knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD should not have additional
   squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe
   and learn from their aircrew leadership.
      5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
      right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
      train in the right seat during MOST and Phase sims and may occupy the left or right seats
      for Proficiency sims (and available proficiency time at the end of a MOST or Phase sim).
      Phase I MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for
      ARC) after becoming mission ready.
      5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
      months from the training start date (as defined in paragraph 1.7.1), have a minimum of
      200 PAA (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these
      requirements are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP.
      (Note: MPD pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue
      under the previous GRACC workbook for up to 6 months beyond the release date of this
      AFI at Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with all other requirements in this paragraph).
      For FAIP/OSA or non-mobility weapon system pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft,
      completion of V280 is not required; however, V281 and V282 are required.
   5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
   which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
   management required for Aircraft Commander certification.
      5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
      in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
      (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
      pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
      skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.
      5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II
      MPD pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD
      Phase II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II
      MPD pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD
      pilots require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready
      certification and prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF
      crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or non- mobility weapon system pilots).
62                                                           AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


     5.3.4.3. HQ AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-
     depth look at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity
     to interact with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by
     Aircraft Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal
     Aircraft Commander upgrade training (ACU or PCO). GRACC is mandatory for AMC
     pilots and highly encouraged for PACAF, USAFE, and ARC mobility forces pilots
     upgrading to Aircraft Commander. GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon
     systems. For AMC pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander
     certification. If unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may schedule
     attendance up to 90 days after certification; beyond 90 days requires OG/CC approval
     (see paragraph 1.18.6 for scheduling details). Additional information is available via
     ETCA (see paragraph 1.15.7).
  5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU) or Pilot Checkout (PCO).
  After the Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time
  begins and the upgrade candidate will begin applicable ACU or PCO training events, as
  required (see Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limitations). Prior to starting training, the
  training office will open and maintain an AF Form 4022 until the upgrade candidate is
  certified as an Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a pilots
  training progress may combine those into a single training folder at the unit‘s discretion.
  MAJCOM approved training guides are authorized.
     5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
     Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
     direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight. Two Aircraft Commander
     candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP supervision in the simulator, as
     required.
     5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
     prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
         5.3.5.2.1. Formation Lead Certification (Q011). Proficiency as formation lead must
         be demonstrated (see paragraph 5.6.1). If simulator is used for Lead Certification,
         reference 5.6.1.2.2 for DMO requirements.
         5.3.5.2.2. Golf Day (Q028), Heavy Receivers (KC-10, C-5, C-17, E-4, or B-2).
         Demonstrate proficiency, as applicable. Units may credit this event if previously
         accomplished to proficiency during MCT or during Phase II if accomplished with an
         IP and documented on an AF Form 4023 or approved TG equivalent; ensure
         documentation is included in ACU training folder.
         5.3.5.2.3. Hazardous cargo (G182). Accomplish CBT.
         5.3.5.2.4. Oceanic Training (M030). Oceanic mission will place emphasis on AC
         duties, oceanic crossing procedures, as well as enroute and mission management
         training objectives. For USAFE, an overnight mission must be accomplished. IP led
         G160 will be completed in preparation for M030. IP supervised current and qualified
         MPD pilots will not be considered NMR for this event and may fly OCONUS for the
         purposes of oceanic training. Units may credit this event during MPD Phase II if
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                         63


           accomplished with an IP and documented on an AF Form 4023 or approved TG
           equivalent; ensure documentation is included in ACU training folder.
           5.3.5.2.5. Demonstrate proficiency in Simulated Engine Failure events, Pattern work,
           Touch & Go‘s, Tactics, and CRM.
           5.3.5.2.6. Aircraft Commander candidates must accomplish Mission Certification
           Training events listed in Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 prior to certification unless
           identified by note.
   5.3.6. Evaluation and Certification. Accomplish an Operational Mission Evaluation
   (OME) according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2, if required. ACU or PCO culminates with
   a Sq/CC‘s R&C Board recommendation.

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The KC-135 ATS is contractor-provided aircrew training system. The ATS
contractor provides qualification and continuation training courseware, academic instruction,
ATD operation/instruction and training facility management. The USAF provides all flight
instruction.
   6.1.1. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet government standards. USAF
   personnel validate training, conduct all flight training aboard the KC-135, and administer all
   evaluations according to AFI 11-202 Volume 2.
   6.1.2. Reports. For initial qualification training, the KC-135 ATS includes a post-training
   feedback system that elicits information and comments in critique format from students,
   supervisors, and evaluators. The program seeks to collect data to monitor the training while
   seeking to continually improve, update, and refine the ATS.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
   6.2.1. Purpose. The KC-135 ATS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, ground and
   flight training phases. The system provides qualification, upgrade, and continuation training
   to attain and maintain the appropriate qualification for KC-135 pilots, navigators, and Boom
   Operators.
   6.2.2. Goal. The ATS program goal is to optimize aircrew training through the integrated
   use of academics, ATD, and flight-line KC-135 aircraft instruction. The KC-135 ATS has
   performance requirements in a Performance Work Statement (PWS) and system
   specification. The ATS follows the AF-sponsored ISD process according to AFI 36-2201,
   Air Force Training Program; developing (and maintaining) a Master Task Listing (MTL),
   Evaluation Standards of Document (ESD), Objective Media Analysis Report (OMAR), and
   Media Selection Syllabus Report (MSSR) products (approved by AMC/A3T). These
   products help define each course content, standards, and training media selected for each task
   and objective.
   6.2.3. Responsibilities.
       6.2.3.1. ATS Contractor (see paragraph 1.4.7) will co-host a quarterly KC-135 ATS
       System Review Board (SRB) to outline the ATS program including currency,
       applicability, and effectiveness. Publish meeting minutes and monitor suspense‘s
       (specified in the ATS contract).
          6.2.3.1.1. ATS contractor maintains the OFT, WST, BOPTT, BOWST, CPT, CLT,
          GIPTT, NPT and other devices or training aids, to enhance flight training programs.
          Schedule lessons and ATD profile as well as a conduct mission overview and debrief
          (by the ATS instructor) for each lesson. Provide all necessary data to complete the
          ATD profile or assigned task.
          6.2.3.1.2. The ATS contractor ensures instructors provide an environment for
          simulator training that is as realistic, as possible. Attention will be directed to crew
          coordination throughout all phases of flight. Crews will use equipment in the trainer
78                                                           AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


        the same as in the aircraft. This shall include communications, personal, and
        emergency equipment. Correct communications phraseology; techniques; checklist
        usage and regimentation; and instrument, flight, and AAR procedures will be stressed
        at all times. Realistic aircraft systems and NAVAID failures and malfunctions will be
        included in a logical and timely manner.
        6.2.3.1.3. Conduct a post lesson critique to reinforce the desired learning outcomes.
        6.2.3.1.4. Provide comments on the recurring training documentation. The intent of
        these comments is to provide meaningful feedback to the appropriate levels of
        supervision (Air Force and contractor) on the student‘s continuation training. In
        those rare cases where the student requires more training than the time available,
        exhibits less than required preparation, or displays an attitude problem, the Instructor
        must provide immediate documentation/feedback to the student‘s unit through
        appropriate channels.
        6.2.3.1.5. Provide all students with a training critique.
     6.2.3.2. AMC/A3T (see paragraph 1.4.1). AMC/A3TK ATS Manager provides overall
     management authority for KC-135 ATS contract training through the AF Training
     Systems Product Group (AFMC ASC/WNSPA).

           6.2.3.6.3. Review ETCA course description and requirements for requesting,
           allocating, scheduling, and confirming attendance for formal training courses. Close
           coordination with the MAJCOM formal school quota managers (for AMC AD use
           AMC/A3TF) is imperative to ensure effective utilization of training slots and
           contractor resources.
       6.2.3.7. KC-135 ATS Syllabi.
           6.2.3.7.1. The ATS contractor develops and maintains the appropriate course syllabi
           with approval by Training Command (paragraph 1.4.2) or AMC/A3T. Each
           syllabus is the blueprint for each KC-135 ATS course in a format standardized by
           AETC. The format is also adopted for AMC managed courses (e.g., BNQ at
           McConnell AFB).
           6.2.3.7.2. ATS contractor will produce each course syllabus and is therefore
           responsible for curriculum development described in the KC-135 ATS Contract
           Performance Work Statement (PWS) and System Specification (SPEC). The ATS
           Contractor will review syllabi annually and update, as required in coordination with

NOTES:
1. Course duration/content is subject to change, see course syllabus for details.
2. AC requalification includes pilots previously qualified in the KC-135.
3. These courses have proficiency advancement option that allows for accelerated completion of
the flying portion of the training.
4. Pilot course for senior officers (O-6 selectees and above) who will fly under instructor
supervision.
5. Instructor upgrade is available in-unit only (see paragraph 5.4.2.2)
6.5. Lesson Objectives. Use lesson objectives as a reference to establish training and
evaluation standards. The KC-135 ATS use the Master Task List (MTL) and the Evaluation
Standards Document (MTL/ESD) available on the ATS Contractor website (see paragraph
1.15.5).
   6.5.1. MTL and ESD Purpose. MTL and ESD provide the basis for ATS courseware
   development, and are a principle source for evaluation criteria (validate MDS crewmember
   performance).
       6.5.1.1. Courseware development and instructors training KC-135 crewmembers may
       use criteria from the MTL and ESD to help determine the ability of an individual to meet
       performance levels required to be mission-qualified. For evaluation, use AFI 11-2KC-
       135 Volume 2 criteria.
       6.5.1.2. Conduct the Air Force evaluation to ESD standards, in a timely manner
       subsequent to the trainee‘s completion of the ground-based or flight training (to guarantee
       standards).
   6.5.2. Crew resource management (CRM) training. The KC-135 ATS incorporates CRM
   principles during all phases of training including initial and continuation training to meet
   requirements of AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. A
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                    81


   CRM facilitator course is also available, upon request. Instructors use AF Form 4031, CRM
   Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation, for CRM skills training IAW AFI 11-290.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. (See paragraph 1.16). Any time during a trainee‘s
ATS ground instruction for formal school or unit-level continuation training, the ATS instructor
considers training progress is unsatisfactory, lack of preparation or participation, etc., the ATS
contractor will notify the unit training manager.
   6.6.1. Failure to Progress. If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements,
   the command accomplishing the training will conduct a Progress Review (PR). The PR can
   recommend continuation in training or AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
   Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges, action, e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to
   the individual‘s unit commander. The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to
   progress according to the ATS contract (see Chapter 6.)
       6.6.1.1. Failure to Complete Training. If crewmember fails to complete a formal course,
       the formal school (ATS contractor will notify AMC/A3TK for training deficiencies at
       McConnell AFB) will send a recommendation of action to the individual‘s unit. The
       recommendation will specify if the student should complete training in-unit, return to the
       formal school to complete training, or be referred to the AF personnel system for
       reassignment.
6.7. Courseware Changes. (See paragraph 1.3.1). While completing CBT, the user may also
submit a comment or proposed change at the point of instruction using a ―Control C‖ input. See
CBT on-screen instructions on the opening to each CBT lesson. The inputs are consolidated as
part of the CBT centralized reporting function. ATS contractor, in coordination with 97
TRS/TRK (if applicable) will monitor ―Control C‖ inputs for consideration of future courseware
updates.
6.8. Scheduling.
   6.8.1. AMC/A3TK ATS Manager, through KC-135 ATS Contracting office and training
   group (AFMC ASC/WNSPA), will determine FY ATS formal school and continuation
   training requirements (throughput) for all ATS courses. PFT reflects the planned annual
   formal school throughput based on Air Force requirements, formal school and ATD
   capacities, and contract authorizations. ATD simulator scheduling at formal school is
   managed by 97 TRS, Altus AFB in coordination with the ATS Contractor, Training
   Management System (TMS) scheduling office.
   6.8.2. Units with collocated ATS facility schedule directly with the local ATS site. Units
   without an ATS facility have been designated (by AMC/A3TK ATS Manager) to ―QUEEN
   BEE‖ ATS facilities. While an ATD undergoes conversions or hardware modifications the
   ATS management team or ATS contractor may request the host or QUEEN BEE unit
   aircrews divert to sites with available training capacity. The ATS contractors‘ TMS office at
   Altus AFB and AMC/A3TK orchestrate the annual scheduling of KC-135 pilots and QUEEN
   BEE sites in coordination with 507 ASSC/GFLC.
   6.8.3. Cancellation of ATS Formal School Course Quota. Units will notify their
   MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) staff (AMC AD call AMC/A3TF) within 45 days before class
   start date if a quota cancellation or no-fill is pending. All formal school quota cancellations
   must be made no later than 30 days prior to class start date to enable the quota to be
 82                                                          AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


   reallocated (see ETCA, paragraph 1.15.7, for additional information). For cancellations at
   McConnell AFB, notify MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) staff immediately and site scheduler
   as early as possible to permit reallocation/rescheduling. Short notice cancellation of one
   student may result in the delay/cancellation of the paired pilot.
6.9. Administration.
   6.9.1. General. Recurring academic and ATD training ensures required subject training
   materials are presented in a realistic manner on a programmed/phased basis.
   6.9.2. Objective. Ensure all crewmembers maintain the proficiency to safely operate the
   KC-135 aircraft and effectively perform the assigned mission. Crewmembers will use the
   ATD to enhance the training areas (e.g., windshear/microburst training, low visibility
   approaches, systems knowledge, emergency/abnormal procedures, and degraded navigation
   systems).
6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectations.
   6.10.1. Self-Study. Each crewmember is responsible for their adequate preparation before
   reporting for each ATD profile. Review the mission profile, pre-course study material,
   associated normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures, and applicable aircraft systems.
   Each pilot must review the applicable portions of the flight publications and answer review
   exercises questions located in the OFT or BOWST profile.
   6.10.2. Pre-mission. The ATS instructor will conduct a pre-mission briefing before each
   OFT or BOWST profile and cover the mission overview, academic session overview (if
   applicable), systems, aircraft loading, performance data, route-of-flight, communications,
   takeoff weather, simulator discrepancies, and ATD emergency egress. Also include mission
   objectives, special procedures specific (required) training items, scheduled systems and
   performance training, CRM, and any additional area of emphasis. Prior to executing the
   scheduled training event, the designated crewmember should conduct a mission briefing
   covering AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3 required briefing items.
   6.10.3. Mission. The crew and ATS instructor will fly the ATD profile to maximum extent
   possible. For proper pacing, it is imperative the pilot team cope with simulated emergencies
   while continuing to fly the aircraft. Limit ―freezing the ATD‖ to meet training objectives.
   6.10.4. Post-mission. The ATS instructor will critique the crew‘s performance during each
   phase of the mission. Several ATDs are equipped with TDAPPS, a dual-screen simulator
   mission playback system. Complete post-mission documentation IAW Technical Order 00-
   20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and
   Procedures, to include AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
   Documentation, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance and
   ARMS products. Send requests or recommendations for additional training to the unit
   training manager. Accomplish additional training as soon as practical, schedule permitting.
6.11. Browsing Training Products. KC-135 crewmembers are encouraged to browse any and
all lessons existing within the ATS. This is particularly applicable to those personnel preparing
to enter upgrade courses, subject to the following restrictions:
   6.11.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
   6.11.2. All browser requests will be coordinated with the ATS training supervisor.
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                     83


   6.11.3. Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for remediation. Remediation
   will be scheduled by coordinating with the ATS contractor. Browsing a lesson does not
   enable the trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in
   lessons for review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the
   remediation.
6.12. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.
   6.12.1. ATS contractor provides opportunities for Air Force flight instructor to observe
   trainee progress in ATD. Likewise, KC-135 ATS simulator instructors may observe students
   during flight training according to AFI 11-401 and the terms and conditions of the current
   KC-135 ATS contract.
6.13. KC-135 ATS Facility Tours.
   6.13.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for KC-135 ATS facility tours with
   the contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours before the planned event.
   This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air Force option time
   may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis and will
   not displace scheduled training events.
   6.13.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
   conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
   The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.
6.14. Aircrew Evaluation.
   6.14.1. General. The Air Force examiner‘s decision as to the ability of the aircrew
   member‘s ability to meet qualification levels as set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and AFI
   11-2KC-135 Volume 2 shall be final and will not be subject to question by the contractor.
   An AF Form 8 will be completed for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.

                                         Attachment 2
                       AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, electronic training folders, and
aircrew training guides. These forms are prescribed in AFI 11-2C5 Volume 1, C5 Aircrew
Training.
   A2.1.1. Create an AF Form 4022 Aircrew Training Folder for ETCA formal training courses
   (formal school or in-unit), mission certification, special qualification and certification (if
   simulator or flight is required, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification,
   requalification training (formal school or in-unit), AC upgrade training, and all corrective
   action or additional training requiring a simulator or flight (if directed by the squadron
   commander). (see AMC/A3T CoP, Universal Aircrew Training, for examples of AF Form
   4022, 4023, 4024, 4025). Exception: WIC Instructors and students will follow the
   documentation directed by USAFWS. MCT requirements may be tracked with Cadre
   Instructor (CIC) when accomplished simultaneously and do not require a separate AF Form
   4022.
       A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
       corrective action or additional training is limited (e.g., if no simulator or flight is
       required). If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who evaluated the aircrew
       member‘s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training deficiency on AF
       Form 4023 or the electronic training folder. Use the existing AF Form 4022 for end-of-
       course evaluations that result in additional training.
       A2.1.1.2. At the unit‘s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more
       than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF
       Form 4022; for example, a MPD pilot upgrading to AC may have the upgrade, mission
       qualification, and formation lead training combined in one folder.
       A2.1.1.3. Electronic Training Folders and forms are authorized. MAJCOM approved
       Unit Developed Electronic Training Folder programs are authorized as long as it
       complies with Attachment 2 of this section and AF Forms 4023, 4024 and 4025 are used.
       Overprints cannot alter the original form. Altering of AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025
       are not authorized without AMC/A3TA approval. Electronic Training Folders and
       reports not reproduced on paper for inclusion in the AF Form 4022, must be stored in 2
       places (a primary and a backup) for at least one year. After one year, training offices
       should retain a copy of the AF Form 4025 in a permanent record and provide the
       crewmember with a copy of the electronic training folder. AF Form 4025s should be sent
       with the members Flight Records Folder upon change of station for the receiving training
       office to hold on file.
          A2.1.1.3.1. Electronic versions must be password protected to ensure data integrity
          (individual will have read only access to their files).
AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012                                                                 139


         A2.1.1.3.2. Digital signatures are authorized using ―//signed//‖ plus the individuals
         name.
  A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 or electronic training folder with all
  training records to the trainee‘s gaining unit. This may be done electronically at the gaining
  unit‘s request. Sq/CC will review formal school training records and enter appropriate
  comments and signature on the training guide progress record, electronic training folder or
  AF Form 4023. Exception: WIC training folders will be maintained IAW USAFWS
  direction at the 509 WPS.
  A2.1.3. The unit (typically squadron-level) will maintain the training folders for assigned
  personnel in a location readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The
  trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
  A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF Forms 4023
  and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously
  accomplished or those in which crewmembers require additional training, will be noted for
  possible inclusion during the current training period. Sq/CC or Sq/DO will review active
  training folders quarterly, and Flt/CCs or Sq training representatives will conduct a monthly
  review. Annotate monthly and quarterly reviews on AF Form 4023 or in the training guide.
  Quarterly reviews fulfill the requirement for monthly reviews for the month the review was
  completed. Note: Due to the frequency of review, and brief course length at the FTU, the 97
  OG/CC will determine the requirement to review student training documentation.
  A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, place hard copy of the AF Form 4025 in the
  individual‘s flight training folder. Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the individuals FEF
  only if directed by the appropriate guidance (e.g., AFI 11-202 Volume 2/MAJCOM
  Supplement, AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2). After one year, training offices should retain a
  copy of the AF Form 4025 in a permanent record and return the AF Form 4022 to the
  crewmember. AF Form 4025s should be sent with the members Flight Records Folder upon
  change of station for the receiving training office to hold on file. Document in ARMS per
  applicable event and paragraph 1.8.
  A2.1.6. For ATS and formal school courses. If training guides are not provided by the ATS,
  use AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025.
  A2.1.7. For purposes of training documentation, Academic Training (AT) will be considered
  FTU classroom training only. Ground Training (GT) will be considered all training
  conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or ATD. All G series ground
  training referenced in this AFI will be referenced as (GT).
  A2.1.8. AF Forms 4324 or AF Forms 1522 will be used as a "source document" for
  recording various aircrew certifications. Completed/original AF 4324s and/ or AF Forms
  1522 (with Sq/CC signature) will be kept on file in the unit ARMS office for the duration of
  the aircrew member's assignment and released to the member upon reassignment. AF Forms
  4324, applicable items in Section 1 and Section 2, will be used to document new aircrew
  certifications that require award of specific ARMS "Q" code identifiers and associated
  training profiles. Specifically, block 22 will contain the following minimum information:
  "Q" code (i.e., QXXX), Certification Name (i.e., "MPRS"), and date of certification. AF
  Forms 1522s may be used in lieu of AF Forms 4324 to document new aircrew certifications
 140                                                          AFI11-2KC-135V1 4 JUNE 2012


   that require award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers that do not require assignment of
   associated training profiles. Forward completed forms to the unit ARMS section for
   processing. For all certifications and qualifications, the Sq/CC must sign the document. If
   using an AF Form 1522, the Sq/CC must print and sign their name.
A2.2. Instructions for AF Form 4022. This folder is constructed of hard stock paper. The
inside cover includes tables for documenting training. AF Forms 4023, 4024, 4025, training
guides, and additional information (waivers, etc.) will be attached through the centered holes of
the folder. Obtain a folder through the AF publications system. Electronic training folders may
be used at the unit‘s discretion (see paragraph A2.1.1.3). Note: Formal school instructors are
not required to complete the following sections of the AF Form 4022: ground training summary,
written evaluations, and flying training summary if this information is tracked by other means.

     status AF Forms 4022. The Sq/CC or Sq/DO will review active status AF Forms 4022 at
     least once each quarter. Document reviews on an AF Form 4023. The reviewer will
     annotate ―monthly review‖ or ―quarterly review,‖ as applicable, in the training period
     block. Operations review will be annotated, and if required, a separate entry in the
     training record including comments on the student‘s progress will be made. Initial
     reviews by Sq/CC‘s fulfill the requirement for the monthly and quarterly review for the
     month and quarter the review was completed.
     A2.3.4.2. Monthly reviews are not required for formal school courses except in
     documented cases of unsatisfactory progress. In this case, the training Flt/CC‘s initials
     on the AF Form 4023 or training guide satisfies this requirement. ATS personnel will
     review the student‘s records and ensure all required training is completed prior to
     entering flight training. If problems are encountered during the flying phase, the
     squadron will conduct reviews necessary to document unsatisfactory progress.
     A2.3.4.3. When the trainee attains sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites
     for upgrade, the instructor will recommend an evaluation and state: ―Recommend
     evaluation for (crew position)‖ on the training progress record. Trainees will not be
     recommended for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete or requires
     corrective action. Exception: MPD Pilot ATS progress reviews (evaluations) may be
     administered with open areas in the TG.

       A2.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only
       subsequent grades allowed for that event are either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when
       a maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
       ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an associated remark on AF Form 4023 explanation in the student‘s
       training folder. The overall grade is at the instructor‘s discretion. For regression, the
       student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in order to be
       recommended for an evaluation (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).
       Regression rules only apply to the training program that the student is currently enrolled
       in (i.e., an IQT graduate that starts MCT at their new assignment may be graded ―S‖ on
       any training event that has not been previously graded ―P‖).
A2.5. Instructions for AF FORM 4025.
   A2.5.1. For each training program complete a summary and close-out report, upon
   completion of the defined final training program events, including: Evaluation, IP ―sign-off‖
   and Sq/CC certification. This form summarizes the individual‘s strengths, weaknesses,
   overall performance, and other pertinent information. Strengths and weaknesses should be a
   ―Trend‖ (i.e., noted on at least two training reports). A copy of this report will be filed in the
   crewmembers training folder after completion of training (see paragraph A2.1.5).
   A2.5.2. Sq/CC, Sq/DO or training Flt/CC will ensure the comments on AF Form 4025 do
   not reflect personal opinions or biases. All comments must be supported by information
   contained in the AF Forms 4023 and 4024 as applicable. At formal schools, the instructor
   will accomplish the AF Form 4025, Sq/CC signature is optional. Digital signatures are
   authorized. After one year, training offices should retain a copy of the AF Form 4025 in a
   permanent record and return the AF Form 4022 to the crewmember.
A2.6. Aircrew Training Guides (TG).
   A2.6.1. The FTU ATS contractor will develop a TG. Units may also produce TGs, but must
   coordinate development through appropriate MAJCOM for approval.
   A2.6.2. Initiating TG. Training and resource management personnel in each unit will initiate
   a TG on crewmembers prior to their entering any phase of qualification training. These TG
   will be inserted in AF Form 4022 and may be used in lieu of AF Forms 4023 and 4024. An
   original AF Form 4023 and 4024 are optional if a MAJCOM coordinated training guide is
   used to record training. Overprints cannot alter the original AF Forms 4023, 4024 and 4025.
   Altering these forms is not authorized without AMC/A3TA approval.
   A2.6.3. Use of TG. Specific instructions for annotating training are included in each TG.
   TGs will be placed in an AF Form 4022 and maintained IAW paragraph A2.1.1.

     student will review the TG and initial the training progress record prior to the next
     training period.
     A2.6.3.2. Complete the training progress record portion of the TG in sufficient detail to
     specify areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended
     specific study areas for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training
     period.
     A2.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart
     (e.g., AC for MPD pilots, etc.) will accomplish required training for those areas not
     requiring an instructor. Annotate applicable training information in the TG.
     A2.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed
     and additional training is required, the training Flt/CC will annotate deficient areas on
     reproduced pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record. Place the mini-TG
     in the AF Form 4022 and used to document completion of additional training.
     A2.6.3.5. At the conclusion of training, when all requirements of the TG are met, fill-out
     an AF Form 4025 IAW paragraph A2.5. Maintain TG and associated AF Form 4025 in

  A2.6.4. Review Procedures:
     A2.6.4.1. Instructors and students will review the TG after each training period and
     discuss training accomplished, problem areas, and immediate goals. To ensure
     documentation flow does not delay training, once flight training begins, ATS instructors
     are not required to review the training folder, and may forward
     subsequent training reports to the flightline unit training representative electronically
     (electronic signatures authorized), who will review and insert the report into the
     student‘s AF Form 4022. Except in cases of unsatisfactory student performance, ATS
     training reports do not require student or instructor review prior to the next flight training
     period.
     A2.6.4.2. The training Flt/CC or a training flight representative will conduct a monthly
     review of TGs. This review will be indicated by entering initials and date in the review
     block of the TG.
     A2.6.4.3. The Sq/CC or Sq/DO will review active TGs at least once each calendar
     quarter and before an evaluation. This review will be a separate entry on the TG and will
     include comments on weak areas and upgrade potential. Indicate review by signing the
     instructor-trainer block of the training progress record, and enter ―quarterly review‖ in
     the training period identifier block.
