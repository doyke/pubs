                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. The DoD Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Program. DoDD 3222.3 contains the
policy and responsibilities for management and implementation of the DoD E3 Program to ensure mutual
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and effective E3 control among ground, air, sea, and space-based
electronic and electrical systems, subsystems, and equipment, and with the existing natural and man-made
electromagnetic environment (EME). It assigns the Under Secretary for Intelligence to require the
National Security Agency (NSA) Director to be the focal point for E3 control with respect to (ISR sites
and platforms. DoD Directive 3222.5 provides policy and guidelines for implementing EMC management
program at SIGINT sites, and AF Supplement 1 to DoD 3222.3 assigns AF ISR Agency as the Service
Cryptologic Element to implement E3 policies, technical guidelines, and mitigation efforts for Air Force
ISR sites and platforms.
    1.1.1. NSA/CSS Policy 2-5 provides guidance on the responsibilities of United States SIGINT Sys-
    tem elements, and technical guidance for the control of electromagnetic interference (EMI). NSA
    Spectrum Assurance Services, S33152, provides policy, plans, reporting process, advice and technical
    guidance concerning EMC relative to SIGINT sites and electronics equipment. NSA/CSS Policy 2-5
    directs the SCEs to establish and maintain EMC point of contact. Within the AF, this responsibility is
    assigned to AF ISR Agency/A4MY.
    1.1.2. For AF non-SIGINT activities and systems, DoDD 3222.3_AFPD 33-5 applies. For guidance
    on AF spectrum management issues reference AFI 33-118. AF ISR Agency Spectrum Management is
    assigned to the Operations Branch (AF ISR Agency/A6NO). For guidance on Meaconning, Intrusion,
    Jamming, and Interference (MIJI), spectrum management, and resolution of frequency conflicts, AFI
    10-707 applies. For E3 health hazard assistance contact the 311th Human Systems Wing, or see
    AFOSH STD 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Safety Program, (August 1, 1997). All AF ISR
    Agency unit EMC personnel are required to have the applicable E3 documents cited above.

1.2. The AF ISR Agency EMC Philosophy. The AF ISR Agency E3 program concentrates on preven-
tative actions to maintain EMC. The cost and effort in preventative measures are much less than the effort
to eliminate the EMC problem after it occurs. The effort to reduce EMI/RFI problems often takes years
and most often result in the inability to completely eliminate the problem. Initially, field sites are selected
in areas that have low noise levels. Over the years, the noise levels rise due to encroachment from indus-
trial and residential development in the surrounding areas, and the proliferation of transmitting devices in
both the civil sector and government and military organizations. Once this encroachment is allowed to
take place, the site can never be restored to its original low noise levels. The EMC personnel at the sites
are crucial to the overall E3 program to provide early information on projects that encroach on the sites
hearability. In the case of airborne sensors, the immediate electromagnetic environment travels with the
platform and must be controlled if the low noise sensors are to operate effectively. Every unit person is
tasked to be vigilant and report activity, development plans, and possible sources of interference.

  force, system, or platform when performing its assigned mission in its intended operational environ-
  ment.
  1.3.2. E3. The impact of the EME on the operational capability of military forces, equipment, sys-
  tems, and platforms. It encompasses all electromagnetic disciplines, including EMC and electromag-
  netic interference (EMI); electromagnetic vulnerability (EMV); electromagnetic pulse (EMP);
  electrostatic discharge (ESD); hazards of electromagnetic radiation to personnel (HERP), ordnance
  (HERO), and fuels (volatile materials) (HERF); and natural phenomena effects of lightning and pre-
  cipitation static.
  1.3.3. EMC. The ability of systems, equipment, and devices that utilize the electromagnetic spectrum
  to operate in their intended operational environments without suffering unacceptable degradation or
  causing unintentional degradation because of electromagnetic radiation or response. It involves the
  application of sound electromagnetic spectrum management; system, equipment, and device design
  configuration that ensures interference-free operation; and clear concepts and doctrines that maximize
  operational effectiveness.
  1.3.4. EMI. Any electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or otherwise degrades or lim-
  its the effective performance of electronics and electrical equipment. It can be induced intentionally,
  as in some forms of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious emissions and
  responses, intermodulation products, and the like.
  1.3.5. Sensitive Antenna Sites. Antenna sites that have functions requiring a very low noise environ-
  ment.

                                                Chapter 3

                           AF ISR AGENCY UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Wing.
    3.1.1. Wing Logistics functions will:
       3.1.1.1. Act as Wing focal point concerning E3 incidents for subordinate units.
       3.1.1.2. Consolidate funding requests needed to resolve E3 issues beyond the capabilities of the
       field sites. Forward consolidated requirements to AF ISR Agency/A4MY.
       3.1.1.3. Ensure field units comply with E3 programs during staff assistance visits/ inspections;
       provide guidance and training as needed.

3.2. AF ISR Agency Fixed Ground Units.
    3.2.1. Electromagnetic emissions at or near AF ISR Agency designated sensitive antenna sites can
    have an especially significant impact on the missions conducted at these locations. As such, effective
    control measures must be in place to monitor, identify and mitigate the detrimental impact of these
    emissions. Ground units collocated at these sites must be kept abreast of changes occurring or planned
    which impact the electromagnetic environment.
       3.2.1.1. Communications and real property facilities and assets are a primary source of interfer-
       ence due to power lines, electronic and radio equipment, and other emitters associated with these
       types of operations. AF ISR Agency field units must take steps to acquaint themselves with Base
       Civil Engineering and communications projects that impact the electromagnetic environment near
       their site. Methods to accomplish this may include participation in base facilities utilization and
       planning meetings, base communications planning and requirements meetings and through inclu-
       sion of field unit needs in applicable service support agreements. Projects which may have a detri-
       mental effect on the SIGINT mission shall be reported to AF ISR Agency/A4MY
       (AFISRA.A4M2@lackland.af.mil) in a timely manner so action can be taken to ensure EMC in
       the early stage of the project.
       3.2.1.2. Most EMI/RFI problems are caused by on-base or nearby emitters or noise sources. The
       unit EMC committee and the EMI/RFI team at each AF ISR Agency field station serve as the
       unit’s first line of defense in identifying and resolving sources of interference. All unit personnel
       shall report EMC problems to the EMC committee for investigation and verification prior to
       requesting action by higher headquarter.
       3.2.1.3. Reporting of EMC threats is vital to the AF ISR Agency E3 program. The E3 program is
       designed to resolve EMC threats before they become EMC problems that cause loss of mission.
       The E3 community has a very formal structure to deal with EMC-related problems. The E3 single
       point of contact provides a rapid means of providing immediate support to the resolution of prob-
       lems.
    3.2.2. All major AF ISR Agency Fixed Ground Unit designated sensitive antenna site shall provide an
    effective EMC program comprised of the following functions:
       3.2.2.1. Appoint a formal EMC committee. See Chapter 4.
AFISRAI33-501 2 JANUARY 2008                                                                             9


      3.2.2.2. Establish an EMI/RFI team. See Chapter 5.
   3.2.3. All major AF ISR Agency Fixed Ground Units shall ensure compliance to NSA/CSS Policy
   2-5 and Attachment 2 E3 technical guidance for the installation and operation of systems and equip-
   ment at designated sites. Existing facility not in compliance shall be modified to meet the mission of
   the facility.

3.3. AF ISR Agency Airborne Units
   3.3.1. AF ISR Agency airborne mission systems have become diverse and quite complex. In most
   cases, AF ISR Agency does not own or maintain the airborne sensors which are often far removed
   from the airborne-related ground stations they serve. AF ISR Agency, as the user of the system, is in
   the unique position of being able to evaluate the mission capability of the overall system and, there-
   fore, has the EMC monitoring responsibility for the entire system.
   3.3.2. Airborne SIGINT sensors detection range is based on Es > En where Es (electric field in dB?V/
   m) is the signal from the distant transmitter and En is the local environmental noise measured from the
   sensor’s antenna. A more sensitive sensor is not necessarily more effective or has greater radio range
   if the environmental noise of the platform is much greater than the target signal. For an airborne plat-
   form, system noise floor is generated by emissions from electromechanical and electronic devices
   within the platform, and natural sources. A high noise floor reduces its radio range or “hearability” to
   a few kilometers.
   3.3.3. EMI/RFI problems arise when new aircraft and/or mission equipment are incompatible with
   the operational EME. High-speed digital systems in close proximity with low noise RF systems, cou-
   pled with aircraft weight restrictions, create unique EMC design problems. EMI/RFI problems usually
   manifest themselves as a rise in system noise coupled with a loss of system sensitivity. Digital signals
   with rapid-rise times often produce large discrete signals that mimic results that nearby transmitters
   produce at ground sites. Common and differential mode conducted noise can leach into SIGINT
   antennas, receivers and processors through aircraft power ground and airframe. Systems engineering
   is critical in ensuring EMC is achieved when new or modified equipment are integrated into the air-
   borne platform. Airborne ground station shall report EMI/RFI incidents to AF ISR Agency/A4MY
   and the platform and sensor custodians for resolution. Prompt reporting of early symptoms of EMI,
   and reporting during the mitigation effort are essential.
   3.3.4. To maintain EMC at airborne-related ground stations, AF ISR Agency units must develop a
   local EMC committee much like the EMC committees for the larger AF ISR Agency fixed ground
   field sites. The committee is chaired by the highest-ranking maintenance officer with representatives
   from unit operations and representatives from other organizations performing sensor maintenance,
   modifications and testing. The EMC group will meet at least on a quarterly basis with more frequent
   meetings during periods of EMI/RFI mitigation efforts and provide field data to the headquarters to
   support higher-level mitigation efforts. The base frequency manager will be an "Ad Hoc" member to
   this committee.
   3.3.5. Establish and maintain a program to enable operators to quickly report EMI/RFI.
   3.3.6. Units assigned to the 55 WG have only an EMC reporting responsibility. Units will identify a
   unit POC to AF ISR Agency/A4MY who is responsible for reporting interference problems.

3.4. AF ISR Agency Expeditionary Units (does not include ground stations linked to airborne sen-
sors).
     3.4.1. Expeditionary units shall have personnel knowledgeable in EMC/EMI/RFI matters, and a com-
     plement of basic measurement equipment to assist in the selection of deployment sites, or manage
     noise problems during deployments.
     3.4.2. Expeditionary units, if garrisoned with or near a larger AF ISR Agency fixed-ground station,
     may participate in the EMC/RFI/EMI activities of the large fixed unit.
     3.4.3. Formal EMC committee is not required, but a reporting authority within the unit staff is
     required to file EMI/RFI interference reports during deployments.

                                      THE EMC COMMITTEE

4.1. Role and Organization.
   4.1.1. The committee is established as an aid to the unit commander. It provides technical advice, acts
   on all EMI/RFI matters, and immediately reports any serious problems to AF ISR Agency/A4MY that
   adversely impact the unit's mission. The committee functions as a local working group to investigate
   and work EMC problems or threats, and provides a single source of reporting to the headquarters.
   4.1.2. The committee consists of an appointed presiding officer, recorder, site projects office and
   other members from the staff elements who can help identify on going mission or infrastructure
   projects and resolve EMI/RFI problems (include key representatives from appropriate host-tenant
   units, base frequency manager, and unit civil engineering liaison). The presiding officer is normally
   the highest ranking individual from the maintenance or logistics function. The vice presiding officer is
   from the maintenance, logistics, or operations function, and the recorder is normally the person with
   the ability to conduct meetings, brief problems and progress, and prepare accurate minutes of the
   meetings. The recorder also prepares other EMI/RFI correspondence and reports.

4.2. Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. Meets at least once each quarter. Meetings are also scheduled as needed to review base plan-
   ning construction progress, budget, or on-going incidents.
   4.2.2. Forwards a copy of the minutes to AF ISR Agency/A4MY, within 5 working days after the
   EMC meeting, with information copies to each parent unit and to NSA/CSS S33152. Attachment 3
   shows the suggested format for the minutes and sample items covered by the discussions.
   4.2.3. Sets up local procedures for detecting, reporting and correcting EMI/RFI issues. Use AF ISR
   Agency Form 78, Electromagnetic Interference Log, to record EMI/RFI data identified by the EMI/
   RFI locator team.
   4.2.4. Sets up local preventive actions (see Chapter 7).
   4.2.5. Assists AF ISR Agency/A4MY E3 technical-survey teams. An EMI/RFI team member will be
   available during surveys to provide access to antenna and equipment areas, and arrange other logistics
   support.

                                         THE EMI/RFI TEAM

5.1. Role and Organization.
   5.1.1. AF ISR Agency fixed ground units will organize, equip, train, and maintain an EMI/RFI team
   to detect, locate, and eliminate sources of interference. The team will be available on very short notice
   through established procedures to respond to EMI/RFI problems. Procedures must provide for imme-
   diate reaction on a 24-hours basis.
   5.1.2. The team consists of a minimum of two (preferably three at larger sites) qualified electronics
   journeyman technicians who are familiar with the measurement equipment to be used. Members will
   have a background in radio maintenance having an AFSC 2E1X3 or equivalent. One member of the
   team will have a valid driver’s license, and a vehicle will be available for team use.
       5.1.2.1. EMI/RFI Team members shall be proficient in identifying and locating power line noise
       using RFI noise locating equipment.
       5.1.2.2. EMI/RFI Team shall ensure a noise survey is conducted quarterly to verify environmental
       noise levels, team member noise locating equipment proficiency, and training of new EMI/RFI
       Team members. A training log should be kept listing names of qualified technicians and training
       dates.
   5.1.3. The EMI/RFI team provides valuable EMI/RFI expertise to the EMC committee and the com-
   mander. Specialized training in RF direction finding (DF) is provided to the EMI/RFI team in order to
   provide a high degree of expertise. Careful selection of personnel who are interested in EMI/RFI work
   is essential to a successful EMC program.

5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. Conducts surveys to locate and determine the extent and probable cause of EMI/RFI problems.
   Use AF ISR Agency Form 78, Electromagnetic Interference Log, to record EMI/RFI data identified.
   5.2.2. Applies the proper corrective action within team capability and authority. Forwards action
   beyond the team’s capability or authority to AF ISR Agency/A4MY.
   5.2.3. Checks the degree of effectiveness of corrective actions.
   5.2.4. Performs other actions deemed necessary or as directed by management.
   5.2.5. Reports all interference and corrective actions to the EMC committee.
   5.2.6. Participates in AF ISR Agency sponsored EMC technical surveys and other related EMC sup-
   port and assistance.

                                       PREVENTIVE ACTION

7.1. General
   7.1.1. EMI/RFI problems, such as strong signals or severe noise, usually originate from local sources
   and require local actions. AF ISR Agency/A4MY provides an EMC technical survey of all major AF
   ISR Agency ground sites at least every 2 years. This survey provides data to assess the operational
   capability of the site. Major impacts to mission capability are usually the result of manmade noise,
   very often a poorly maintained base power system. The monitoring of the manmade noise at the site is
   the responsibility of the EMI/RFI team. AF ISR Agency unit responsibility is not limited to protecting
   current missions but to the protection of total-mission capability. Signal hearability only provides use-
   ful assessment of current missions and does not provide data to assess mission requirements of a site.
   This can only be achieved through an engineering assessment based on the data collected on the site
   systems and the environment. Unit vigilance and timely reaction can usually prevent potentially seri-
   ous losses of mission capability.
   7.1.2. Proper master planning is required for control of electronics interference. All AF ISR Agency
   fixed ground units shall be represented on the base installation planning boards and related functions
   that could possibly impact (cause EMI/RFI, signal degradation or noise) AF ISR systems. Some con-
   siderations are: zoning; EMI/RFI-suppressed lighting and power-distribution systems; proper separa-
   tion and frequency assignments for government radio transmitters; Armed Forces Radio and
   Television Service (AFRTS), Military Affiliated Radio System (MARS), and amateur radio stations;
   proper antenna clearance criteria (from obstruction and noise sources); base facilities projects such as
   power systems, construction and demolition of buildings, construction of pipelines and water towers,
   etcetera.
   7.1.3. All additions and relocations of equipment at designated sensitive sites shall be evaluated for
   EMC impact according to Attachment 1 technical guidelines. As a minimum this evaluation is per-
   formed by the local EMI/RFI team and approved by the unit EMC committee. When addition or relo-
   cation of equipment does not meet the separation distance requirement of Attachment 1, waiver
   procedure is required (Attachment 3).

7.2. Transmitters.
   7.2.1. Because on-base or nearby transmitters significantly threaten the AF ISR ground missions,
   each AF ISR Agency ground station must protect the local-frequency spectrum and explore every
   source of information about proposed transmitter facilities (new), or changes to existing transmitters.
   7.2.2. Transmitting facilities often operate on frequencies that could interfere with receiving signals
   essential to the AF ISR Agency mission. Installing the transmitting facility in another equally suitable
   location, operating in another band (“S” instead of “X,” “UHF” instead of VHF), or operating on
   slightly different frequencies can avoid or reduce interference. Early reporting makes such changes
   much easier in the planning stage. An AF ISR field station does not have national or international pro-
   tection from interfering signals produced by authorized transmitting facilities. However, when the
   mission of the AF ISR field station is more important to the national interest than the mission of the
   interfering transmitting facility, the appropriate actions may be to move, change the frequency, or shut
   down the interfering transmitter.
16                                                                   AFISRAI33-501 2 JANUARY 2008


     7.2.3. When a transmitting facility is under the control of an AF ISR Agency unit, the AF ISR unit
     ensures that the transmitters cause the least possible interference to the assigned missions. When a
     new transmitting facility is requested, the unit will:
        7.2.3.1. Specify that only minimum-power output is used.
        7.2.3.2. Avoid the frequencies (or frequency bands) critical to mission assignments. Consider the
        frequency bandpass of the RF preamplifiers and multicouplers and the effect of intermodulation
        and harmonics of the proposed transmitting frequency.
        7.2.3.3. Forward technical data to AF ISR Agency/A4MY for detailed engineering analysis and
        coordination.
        7.2.3.4. Proposals to build new transmitter should also be coordinated with the base civil engineer
        and the environmental protection committee AFI 32-7061 for evaluation for its environmental
        impact and the issuance of a CATEX (categorical exclusion) or draft environmental impact state-
        ment.
     7.2.4. When an AF ISR Agency unit learns of a proposed change in construction of a transmitting
     facility under US control that may cause interference to assigned missions, the AF ISR unit will
     immediately notify AF ISR Agency/A4MY and send copies of the notification to intermediate organi-
     zations and NSACSS/S33152. Include the known frequency bands threatened and the problems
     expected. Establish working-level liaison with the agencies concerned to protect the AF ISR mission.
     If the liaison established by the threatened AF ISR unit is unsuccessful in resolving the frequency allo-
     cation of interference problem, AF ISR Agency/A4MY will negotiate with the other appropriate US
     agencies.
     7.2.5. Potential or actual problems caused by transmitting facilities under foreign control must be
     handled at the diplomatic level or as directed by international agreement with the host country. When
     directed by AF ISR Agency, local AF ISR unit responsibilities are usually limited to providing techni-
     cal information and assistance to US representatives negotiating with the foreign government.
     7.2.6. The AF ISR Agency unit:
        7.2.6.1. Closely monitors and controls the activities of other nearby tenants, operations such as
        AFRTS, MARS, base contracts, and inter-base radio, and stays informed of plans for new trans-
        mitting facilities in the local area.
        7.2.6.2. Stay current on frequency authorizations for the local base area to learn of new transmit-
        ting systems. Coordinate in advance with AF ISR Agency/A4MY and AF ISR Agency/A6NO on
        any frequency request for local transmitters (tactical or non-tactical).
        7.2.6.3. Compile a list of the local on base and nearby transmitters with associated contact points
        of personnel to permit quicker resolution of EMC/EMI/RFI problems will transmitters malfunc-
        tion and produce interference. This list will include operating frequency, power output, location,
        type of modulation, and other data applying to the facility. A plot of these transmitters on a con-
        tour map of the area would help to locate offending emitters.

7.3. Vehicle Control.
     7.3.1. Automobiles and other vehicles (both private and government owned) can be sources of EMI/
     RFI if not properly controlled. Vehicle interference often originates in the ignition system but is not
AFISRAI33-501 2 JANUARY 2008                                                                                 17


   necessarily limited to this source. The entire electrical system is a potential threat, and control is a pre-
   ventive measure.
   7.3.2. Fixed ground stations will establish “no vehicle zones” in areas where it is necessary to control
   EMI/RFI. Only emergency vehicles would normally be allowed in the prohibited zone. Construction
   and maintenance vehicles (and machinery) will also be controlled to limit access to essential tasks,
   and even then, special restrictions may be necessary.
   7.3.3. At Circular Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) sites, control of vehicle traffic around the
   antenna is essential. Vehicle traffic causes damage to the buried cables in addition to the EMI threat.
   7.3.4. When permitted by the base layout and host tenant agreement, establish a vehicle-testing pro-
   gram to prevent defective vehicles from operating on base near the antennas.

7.4. Base Power System Control.
   7.4.1. Faulty hardware in the base power system results in the generation of manmade noise which is
   generally broadband in nature. This is the primary source of interference in the 2-30 megahertz (MHz)
   frequency range. This EMI relates to a reduction of the system's mission capability throughout the
   high frequency (HF) range because it affects the system noise figure. Frequencies from the power sys-
   tem have been documented well beyond 2 GHZ. These highly impulsive signals can disrupt systems
   such as Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communications (UHF SATCOM) links by competing with
   low power satellite signals.
   7.4.2. The EMI/RFI team schedules regular EMI sweeps of the power system and takes action to get
   defective hardware replaced. This involves getting BCE to provide a line crew to assist in locating the
   specific hardware that is defective, with actions to correct the problem. The base-support agreement
   for power-line maintenance is reviewed at least every 2 years to ensure timely response to power-sys-
   tem faults.
   7.4.3. Problems in the base-power system that the EMI/RFI team cannot correct will be elevated to
   the headquarters immediately as the continuing deterioration of the system results in more time con-
   suming efforts to mitigate.

                                        CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

8.1. Locating and Identifying EMI/RFI.
     8.1.1. When interference occurs even though all apparent preventive measures have been taken, pos-
     itive and immediate actions are necessary to identify the offender. Detecting unwanted interference is
     normally simple but is often ignored because no reporting procedures exist. Each unit will implement
     adequate procedures to ensure that interference is reported promptly to the unit EMI/RFI focal point.
     8.1.2. When unwanted interference is reported, it will be identified without delay. This identification
     will usually involve the EMI/RFI team. Operating under local procedures, the EMI/RFI team will
     identify the source of interference and take steps to mitigate the problem. A periodic report on the res-
     olution or the progress to correct the problem will be made to the unit EMC committee. Resolution
     and progress to higher authority will be documented in the published EMC committee minutes.

8.2. Mitigation of EMI/RFI.
     8.2.1. Corrective action of EMC problems with airborne sensors not owned or maintained by AF ISR
     Agency is handled differently than AF ISR Agency-owned mission systems. AF ISR Agency must
     approach the problem as the user of a service and must depend on the servicing Agency to provide
     corrective action. The AF ISR Agency role is to provide the servicing Agency an evaluation of the
     impact to the AF ISR mission and the effectiveness of any mitigation process to correct EMC prob-
     lems. This is usually quite complex and requires AF ISR Agency to report on the ability of the system
     to perform a particular mission and the long-term goal to evaluate the system’s ability to meet an oper-
     ational requirement. The reporting of the ability of the system to perform a day-to-day mission is the
     responsibility of the AF ISR field unit and can be evaluated by hearability tests. The evaluation of the
     system to meet an operational requirement entails system testing and evaluation by professional EMC
     engineers and is the responsibility of the headquarters staff.
     8.2.2. Protection of critical AF ISR Agency missions requires that procedures be set up for emergency
     actions to correct interference caused by local transmitters in the area. This is especially important
     when an AF ISR unit operates on a host air base that includes radar, navigational aids, and etcetera.
     AF ISR units will usually detect faulty or unintended transmitter operation that causes adverse EMI/
     RFI that result in AF ISR mission degradation. For example, emergency action will be initiated when
     a transmitter malfunctions and causes spurious radiation (such as overmodulation), spurious
     responses, or excessive harmonic radiation, or when a mission is assigned on or near the legal operat-
     ing frequency of a local transmitter. If possible, specify emergency action procedures and keep them
     on file. Procedures will include POCs and their telephone numbers, technical factors (frequency,
     power, etc.), geographical data (location, distance, etc.), responsible Agency and their mission, etcet-
     era. Keep this data for each local US transmitter in the area that could interfere with mission accom-
     plishment. Try local contacts first. Report unsuccessful corrective emergency actions to AF ISR
     Agency/A4MY for further investigation.
     8.2.3. Corrective actions requiring civil engineering support (such as power-line hardware) will be
     initiated through the unit civil engineering representative on the EMC committee. Form 332, Base
     Civil Engineering Work Request, is filled and submitted to initiate the corrective action.
AFISRAI33-501 2 JANUARY 2008                                                                   19


  8.2.4. Corrective actions requiring frequency changes or transmitter relocations will be worked
  through the base frequency manager on the EMC committee. An exception is the Armed Forces
  Broadcast Services. Their frequency approvals are not obtained through normal military frequency
  approval sources. Problems with AFBS facilities will be forwarded to AF ISR Agency/A4MY for res-
  olution.

     ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (EMC) OF DEVICES AND FACILITIES1
Scope: This Attachment 1 provides criteria for the installation and operation of systems and equipment in
the vicinity of designated sites.


Unintentional Emission Limits: Systems and equipment installed and operated near designated sites
shall meet the limits for electric field noise shown in Figure A2.1. and conducted noise in Figure A2.2.
The requirement is met when electric field emissions at the receiver antenna(s) are at or below the limit
shown in Figure A2.1., and the conducted noise emission is below the limit shown in Figure A2.2. Com-
pliance shall be verified by measured data when the system and equipment are operated in normal operat-
ing modes.

Figure A2.1. Electric Field Noise Limit for Designated
Sites




Figure A2.1. shows the noise electric field limit in dB?V/m at 3 kHz bandwidth, which must be main-
tained to not degrade the performance of equipment using sensitive antennas. The curve represents a limit
at or below which noise would not be measurable or detectable using a zero decibels isotropic (dBi)

antenna gain. Figure A2.1. is based on a sensor (land based, mobile, airborne or sea based) operating in a
quiet site.2

Figure A2.2. Conducted Noise Limit vs. Separation Distance




Separation Distances: Electronic and electrical systems and equipment normally are designed to meet
some commercial or military standard or specification, which limits unintentional electromagnetic emis-
sions. These standards usually state the maximum allowable electric field in µV/m when measured at spe-
cific distances from the equipment or device in question. Table A2.1. indicates typical safe distances at
which compatibility with designated sites can be achieved for the standards listed.

designated sites, the unintentional radiated and conducted emissions shall be controlled to acceptable lev-
els by using shielding techniques, filtering, and other appropriate EMI control design measures. This
instruction does not address occupational, health and safety standards. See AFOSH STD 48-9, Radio Fre-
quency Radiation (RFR) Safety Program, (August 1, 1997)
