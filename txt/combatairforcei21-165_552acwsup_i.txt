SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been significantly updated and should be reviewed in its entirety. The
importance of the annual flying hour program development has been addressed, as well as the
need to understand look-back and standard business rules. Furthermore, the 20 hour overfly of
the flying hour program will no longer be authorized without ACC/A3 approval. In addition,
annual attrition has been revised to include 4 years of historical data and application on locally
generated flying hour templates in support of developing the annual plan. Further, this
instruction places responsibility on AMXS/MXS flight chiefs to compute and forward manpower
requirements to MMA for incorporation into the annual plan. This instruction adjusts the

                                            Chapter 1

                               MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY

1.1. Scheduling. Aircraft flying and maintenance scheduling is a planned, methodical approach
to achieving maintenance and flying goals. The weekly flying and maintenance schedule directly
dictates the workload of a major portion of wing personnel from flightline mechanics to dining
facility personnel. The wing flying-hour program is directly tied to wing funding and the
readiness of aircrews and aircraft to perform their war-time mission. This is one of the most
important documents the wing produces so the right resources must be dedicated to producing an
effective and efficient plan. Units that do not have a wing flying-hour program must make every
effort to follow the guidelines set forth to achieve aircrew readiness and maintain fleet health.
Lack of a flying hour program does not preclude a unit from developing a sound long range plan.
1.2. Scheduler. In some wings, operations scheduling is an additional duty for a lieutenant or
captain. Optimally, Operations Schedulers should be assigned to the function for a minimum of
1 year. Remember, these are the wing experts at building the plan and everything they do directly
impacts the operations (ops) tempo of the wing. Committing personnel for at least a year will
improve consistency and the opportunity to meet the flying-hour program while efficiently
executing the mission, increasing effective pilot training and reducing turbulence for the wing.
1.3. Collocate. Communication and understanding the impact of program decisions can be
better understood when operations and maintenance schedulers are collocated. This option is a
proven method but care must be exercised to ensure that collocation does not interfere with their
respective functions and organizational/leadership structure.
1.4. Annual Plan. The annual plan is the most important element of the flying-hour program.
With smart planning, programming and updating of the immediate (in-year) and long-range (out-
year) programs, the difficulties of managing this program can be reduced. Time and energy
invested in building a solid annual plan can return big dividends to wing personnel.
Unfortunately, too often many wing operations and maintenance schedulers do not fully
understand the program and do not invest the time to do it right the first time. This is a result of
lack of appropriate exposure and directive instructions (AFI/ACCIs), familiarization and position
experience. As a result, many programs are developed and submitted without proper planning or
foresight. Programs that are not developed with careful planning and foresight waste an
inordinate amount of resources in preparation and may cause the unit to fall short of meeting
their flying-hour goals.
1.5. Planning. The more planning factors that can be built into the flying schedule, the more
stability you will have to meet the operations and maintenance workload. Additionally,
maintenance schedulers can target maintenance resources and use them more efficiently to
reduce the variation within the scheduling process. It is critical that Plans, Scheduling and
Documentation (PS&D) along with maintenance analysis, validate the monthly maintenance,
personnel and facility capability study then cross-check this with the flying-hour program to
ensure the program is supportable. If the unit’s mission cannot be supported within the unit’s
organic capacity limitations, then changes must be made to ensure successful execution. Always
be mindful that resources (personnel, aircraft, and equipment) are not over-tasked. When
capability is exceeded, notify squadron and group senior leadership so the plan can be adjusted to
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                             7


meet objectives. Remember, failure by the schedulers to make appropriate inputs and properly
project capabilities could force the wing or squadron to try to execute an unsupportable program.
1.6. Deployments. As the program is developed, schedulers should always consider the time
required to prepare for deployments. Scheduling normal flying or surges in the days immediately
preceding a deployment/temporary duty (TDY) may impact the ability of maintenance personnel
to prepare the aircraft appropriately. Personnel need time to prepare for deployments (pre-
deployment briefs, out-processing and personal business). Furthermore, resuming normal
operations too quickly after returning to home station is a sure way to deplete your resources,
wear down your personnel and fail to meet your programmed goals.
1.7. Unscheduled Events. Solid planning is the key to success, but unexpected events can
influence or cause turbulence to the scheduling process. For example, poor winter weather has
forced units to heavily weight their programs toward the good weather months via planned
attrition. However, weather being what it is--unpredictable; it may not materialize as planned. If
this occurs, units are then faced with a dilemma; maintain the sortie utilization (UTE) plan as is
or overfly the program. The recommended solution is to take advantage of the unexpected
"good" weather and fly. However, care must be exercised not to exceed the maintenance
capability for the sake of getting ahead. If you overfly or underfly the approved program by
more than 10 percent, then units must consider reflowing the balance of their flying program.
1.8. Overflys. In developing the reflow, care must also be exercised to ensure sufficient
sorties/hours remain in the months from which the sorties/hours are removed. This will ensure
unit tasking and operational training requirements are met. Banking "extra" sorties and hours
prior to the summer months will possibly allow more latitude in leave scheduling and offer
personnel some downtime. Schedulers should understand the look back capability that operators
have to help them understand the limitations of banking sorties. Finally, "Overflys" of
programmed sorties and hours must be coordinated fully between your OG and MXG.
1.9. Planning Impacts. It is imperative maintenance schedulers understand and appreciate
operational requirements and how they impact planning efforts. The operations scheduler must
understand and appreciate how his/her decisions will impact, not just maintenance, but all wing
agencies supporting the mission. For example, a single configuration change can take 2 to 4
hours and as many as six people. This change will have a definite impact on maintenance’s
ability to manage work shifts, repair aircraft and perform preventive maintenance.
1.10. Program Changes. The point of contact for changes that impact the overall yearly flying
program is Operations and Training Division (ACC/A3T). All changes that impact the overall
programmed hours or sorties must be approved by ACC/A3T. If the changes do not affect the
overall program, a copy of the reflow must be provided to ACC/A3T to ensure that the correct
numbers are being reported at the local, MAJCOM and Air Staff level.
1.11. Surges. Although not as common in recent years, one method for generating a high
number of sorties and hours is a sortie surge. Surges, if properly planned and executed, can
potentially lessen the impact of "summer" high sortie UTE rates due to the restrictive nature of
the "winter" operating environment. That is, by surging, a large portion of the required monthly
program can be accomplished in a short period of time. In turn, this allows for a significantly
lower UTE rate for the remainder of the month. At the same time, carefully executed surges can
have a positive effect on unit esprit de corps. Following are some tested basic principles that go a
long way toward developing a successful surge program.
 8                                              CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


     1.11.1. Surges must never be treated nor executed as a casual or "spur of the moment" event.
     Surges should be built into a unit's annual flying program and advertised base-wide. In turn,
     the program should include target sortie goals, planned dates and backup dates. Future
     planning does several things. First, the entire base is aware that something non routine is
     going to occur at a point in time and they need to plan and program their activities
     accordingly. Second, the maintenance community, by knowing when surges are
     programmed, can ensure the force is properly managed so that preventative maintenance
     actions are properly scheduled and the aircraft phase/inspection flow is managed in
     preparation for the surge. Third, personnel resources can be managed to ensure maximum
     availability of the maintenance force to support the surge.
     1.11.2. Surges are a significant base event and, as such, can be disruptive to base activities.
     Therefore, the surge must be worth the effort. In this light, short-notice, 1-day surges are
     often, counterproductive. The extensive preparation beforehand, and recovery afterwards,
     often outweighs the advantages of a 1-day surge. It is often impossible to justify the effort for
     a "surge" that produces very little in return. On the other hand, a lot of energy is expended to
     ensure local generated exercises are successful. A surge falls into the same category and
     requires the same planning effort to be successful.
     1.11.3. Be aware that sortie surges can have a negative impact on your training program and
     your hourly program. Sortie durations are normally shortened to facilitate the surge and as
     such aircrew training benefits often drop in relation to the sortie duration. Finally, with the
     focus on efficient use of flying hours surges are less common, however there is still a benefit
     to executing a well thought out surge as long as the cost is understood by operations and
     maintenance.
1.12. Utilization (UTE). In units tasked to fly out an annual flying-hour program, UTE is
instrumental in ensuring success. UTE is a measure of performance--the goal the wing is trying
to achieve. To ensure success, you must publish the program and make sure the people
understand it. You must also track program progress by squadron and reward the people when
the goal is reached. Remember, do not chase flying-hours. Track the ASD. It is the link between
sorties and flying hours.
1.13. So what should you do?
     1.13.1. Plan what you fly and fly what you plan.
     1.13.2. Agree on the basics and write it down: Standard flying window, Rules of
     Engagement (ROE) for surges, night flying, Cross Country (XC) sorties, weekend duty, quiet
     hours, training days, standard configurations, minimum/standard turn times, XC ROE, crew
     ready/step minimums, standard turn times, quick turn times, etc.
     1.13.3. Establish/publish and designate required approval authority for AF Form 2407,
     Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination, scheduling changes (If it is too easy to change
     the schedule, it will not be built right the first time).
     1.13.4. Aircraft should rarely be “added”. If aircraft are added because maintenance cannot
     provide enough front lines, something else is wrong and most likely the problem is being
     compounded. There is a domino effect: How many more aircraft will you add to the “broke”
     pile before you call “knock it off?”
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                             9


   1.13.5. Closely monitor the flying window. The window drives shift scheduling, but be
   aware, operations and maintenance are not the only agencies involved in sortie generation.
   Petrol, Oils, and Lubricants (POL), Air Traffic Control (ATC), Weather and many others will
   assist in the effort. Supervision must cover the entire flying window and then some. The
   length of the flying window determines effectiveness of maintenance “fix” shift. Turbulence
   in the flying window equals stress on the flightline--keep it consistent throughout the week.
   Combining a late start today with an early start tomorrow hurts maintenance efforts!
   1.13.6. It is vital in the management of the isochronal inspection concept. This
   communication ensures aircraft are available for their scheduled dock input and available to
   meet mission requirements.
   1.13.7. Ensure your maintenance schedulers are consolidating aircraft -6 maintenance
   inspections, time changes, and Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) requirements as
   much as possible to maximize aircraft availability and reduce excessive maintenance
   downtime.
   1.13.8. Insist on a well-crafted short- and long-term plan. A unit cannot plan what they do
   not know. Conversely, a unit that fails to plan--plans to fail. In tanker and airlift units,
   scheduling flexibility is the key to success with adherence to sound maintenance
   management and policy.
   1.13.9. Do not reconfigure aircraft between turns/go’s unless there is an overwhelming need
   to do so. Work with your operations counterpart to fly the same configuration for the entire
   week, if possible. Reconfiguring drains manpower from troubleshooting, repairing,
   inspecting, servicing, launching and recovering.
   1.13.10. Do not allow weekend duty to become routine. Weekend duty should be based on
   standard business rules and aircraft should not be worked unless there is no other option to
   replace a Monday flyer. It has become common for XCs to return on a weekend, however
   the cost to maintenance must always be understood if the plan is to resume flying the first
   normal duty day after return. Remember, to return on a weekend you must call multiple
   people in from a variety of base agencies to support the return and recovery.
   1.13.11. Review the next weeks flying window length. It should be looked at from both the
   squadron and wing perspective.
1.14. You may have problems if some of the following are evident within your program:
   1.14.1. The “lead operations scheduler” changes too frequently (i.e., week-to-week or
   month-to-month).
   1.14.2. AF Form 2407 is approved by whoever is around.
   1.14.3. Late landings or early take-offs are the norm.
   1.14.4. You are reconfiguring instead of servicing in the turn unless circumstances dictate.
   1.14.5. Fix rates down, deviations are up, ground aborts and cannibalization rate are on the
   rise.
   1.14.6. No attention given to the number of hours required and the number of jets that can be
   phased in a given month.

   1.14.7. Flying shift is fixing aircraft.
   1.14.8. Major/numerous changes to next week's flying.
   1.14.9. The maintenance schedule does not receive the same attention as the flying schedule.
   1.14.10. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness is 100% but there are many overdue
   inspections.
   1.14.11. Weekend duty is the norm rather than the exception.
   1.14.12. Technicians do not know what time they are coming to work tomorrow.
   1.14.13. Everyone believes they know scheduling and the TTP is used as justification.
1.15. Approach. It is imperative you know your schedulers and their backgrounds and you
understand and monitor their programs. Remember, this is not an art or science, just a planned
approach to mission accomplishment. Balance is the key to managing mission requirements with
maintenance capabilities.

                                           Chapter 2

                       GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY AND POLICY

2.1. Responsibilities. Commanders at all levels are responsible for compliance with this
instruction.
2.2. Policy. This instruction provides procedures and audit methods for units to develop their
flying and maintenance scheduling program and analyze their effectiveness. It is intended to be
a local tool for operations and maintenance activities to use in support of their programs.
Reviewing reasons for deviating from the flying and maintenance schedule will allow wing
commanders (WG/CC) and staff to evaluate unit flying program and scheduling procedures.
Higher Headquarters (HHQ) management attention is directed to those areas beyond a unit's
control.
2.3. Objectives. This instruction allows units the flexibility to meet mission requirements
through effective flying and maintenance scheduling. Scheduling evaluation procedures
provides an audit trail to identify problems in flying and maintenance schedules. The primary
purpose of unit scheduling assessment is to evaluate the effectiveness of the unit's flying
program in support of combat capability.
2.4. Applicability. This publication is applicable to all CAF units possessing or supporting
CAF aircraft, including contractor maintained aircraft.
2.5. Reporting Requirements. Units will use the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
reporting procedures or the Maintenance Information System (MIS) supporting that weapon’s
platform. This includes contractor-maintained, wing assigned aircraft. In the event that the
contractor is not obligated to utilize the MIS, the MXG commander is responsible to ensure all
reporting procedures are followed. MAF units deployed to a combatant command reporting
through CAF will continue to use G081 for tracking and scheduling deployed assets or
equipment.
2.6. Standards. Standards and goals assist commanders in assessing the effectiveness of unit
performance. The CAF aircraft maintenance scheduling effectiveness standard is 95 percent.
There are two aircraft flying scheduling effectiveness (FSE) standards developed by HQ
ACC/A4QJ, approved by HQ ACC/A4, and provided to the user each September. Overall FSE
rate is measured using recorded deviation data as outlined in Chapter 4. Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) FSE rate includes deviations only in the maintenance and operations
categories.
2.7. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication rests with HQ ACC/A4Q. ACC waiver
requests are submitted by the WG/CC with USAFE or PACAF A4Q coordination if applicable.
See Attachment 2, Waiver/Change Request Format.
2.8. Standardization. Wings will develop a supplement to this instruction standardizing
scheduling practices for the wing and each assigned mission design series (MDS). Minimum
topics will include standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hour policies, cross
country take-offs and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, etc. In addition, include
local schedule input and publishing deadlines along with any wing unique requirements.

  2.8.1. (Added-552ACW) Standardization. The following guidelines standardize scheduling
  practices in the 552 ACW.
     2.8.1.1. (Added-552ACW) Standardized Flying Window.
     2.8.1.2. (Added-552ACW) Aircraft takeoffs will not normally be scheduled earlier than

     group level representative, designated in writing by group commander.
     2.8.1.3. (Added-552ACW) Aircraft landings will not normally be scheduled later than
     1700L on the last workday of the week without OG/CC and MXG/CC concurrence or
     group level representative, designated in writing by group commander. If a Training Day
     or Safety Day is scheduled, the preceding day will be considered the last workday of the
     week.
     2.8.1.4. (Added-552ACW) With the exception of Reserve UTA weekend flying
     activity, no weekend, holiday, or productivity day launches or recoveries should be
     scheduled without prior MXG/CC and OG/CC coordination.
     2.8.1.5. (Added-552ACW) With the exception of para 2.8.1.2, 2.8.1.3, and 2.8.1.4, 552
     ACW normal flying window is Monday – Friday 0600L-2300L.
  2.8.2. (Added-552ACW) Sortie Surge Rules. (Added) Planned surges will involve all
  operational squadrons and be discussed at scheduling meetings.
  2.8.3. (Added-552ACW) Cross-Country Sorties.
     2.8.3.1. (Added-552ACW) Planned cross country (XC) sorties will be posted on the
     monthly calendar and incorporated into the weekly planning process. All XC sorties will
     be counted in the planned sortie total for the day. (Example: 7 scheduled lines; 5 are
     local training and 2 are XC)
     2.8.3.2. (Added-552ACW) 513th ACG weekend XC sorties will be incorporated into
     weekly flying schedule and briefed at scheduling meetings.
        2.8.3.2.1. (Added-552ACW) Departures and returns outside normal flying window
        will be pre-approved by the 552 MXG/CC and 552 OG/CCs at the weekly MXG/OG
        scheduling meeting.
        2.8.3.2.2. (Added-552ACW) XC returns will not be scheduled as turn aircraft later
        the same day.
  2.8.4. (Added-552ACW) Daily Flying Guidance.
     2.8.4.1. (Added-552ACW) Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 3-3, Aircraft
     Maintenance, Section 5, Flying and Scheduling states commitment levels should be based
     on possessed aircraft, not to exceed Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA).Common rule of
     thumb for the E-3 is 60% of aircraft are committed to the schedule for primes and spares
     when 0 aircraft are deployed or off-station. Forward Operating Locations will drive
     reconsideration for sorties flown at home station. Availability example: 23 possessed
     aircraft x 60% commitment rate = 13.8 total aircraft available for both primes and spares.
     2.8.4.2. (Added-552ACW) Spare aircraft utilization will be coordinated between the
     applicable Red/White Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) Production Superintendent and
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                          13


       552 OG/CD. 552 OG/CD will provide priority to AMU Production Superintendent on
       which sortie will get the spare.
       2.8.4.3. (Added-552ACW) Crew Ready / Crew Show prior to scheduled takeoff.
       2.8.4.4. (Added-552ACW) Deconflict launch and landing times by 30 minutes during
       cold weather operations
   2.8.5. (Added-552ACW) Quiet Hour Policy

   2.8.6. (Added-552ACW) Normal turn times. Turn-time is the period between the scheduled
   land time of an aircraft until its next scheduled takeoff. Normal turn time for missions after
   engines shut down is 10 hours.
       2.8.6.1. (Added-552ACW) Quick-turn authorization is required whenever the turn time
       is less than 8 hours. 552 MXG/CC or 552 MXG/CD are the approval authority. If
       neither is available via personal contact or telephone, quick-turn approval is delegated to
       the 552 AMXS/CC.
   2.8.7. (Added-552ACW) Wing Unique Requirements.
       2.8.7.1. (Added-552ACW) Standard ramp fuel load is 90K pounds.
   2.8.8. (Added-552ACW) Deployed Aircraft Guidance.
       2.8.8.1. (Added-552ACW) 552 AMXS will not exceed one full maintenance crew
       TDY/deployment per month to locations other than contingency operations. Based on
       HHQ tasking, maintenance support for additional concurrent or overlapping TDYs /
       deployments / exercises will be coordinated and approved by MXG/CD and OG/CD.
       2.8.8.2. (Added-552ACW) Each off-station aircraft and associated maintenance crew
       reduces home station sortie generation capability. AMXS/MXA will provide OG with
       maintenance capability to support TDY/deployed operations. AMXS will be provided a
       minimum of seven seats upon request on any deploying E-3 aircraft for enroute
       maintenance support.
2.9. Airframe Capability and Scheduling. To ensure accurate projection of operations and
maintenance capacity, units will compute airframe capabilities using only the number of Primary
Aircraft Inventory (PAI) aircraft; do not include Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) or Attrition
Reserve aircraft (AR). Operational and training schedules will be based on the capability of PAI
aircraft to execute the schedule. The OG/CC and MXG/CC will ensure BAI and AR aircraft are
not computed when building the flying program.
2.10. Alert Aircraft. Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) officer in charge (OIC) and Production
Superintendent will ensure aircraft entering or coming off alert are managed to avoid Hangar
Queen candidacy as a result of extended idle alert periods. Maintenance Management Analysis
(MMA) will review sortie performance and reliability trends of aircraft coming off
alert/immediate response (IR) and present performance analysis to affected AMU maintenance
operations and MOF maintenance operations.
2.11. Electronic Publishing. Plans and schedules may be published via electronic means (e.g.,
web pages, share point sites or E-mail) provided operations security is not compromised. Normal

                                            Chapter 3

             FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

3.1. Flying and Maintenance Planning Cycle. The objective of the flying and maintenance
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program (FHP) consistent with operational
requirements (AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management) and maintenance capabilities.
These procedures enhance operations and maintenance interface. The flying and maintenance
planning cycle begins with the annual allocation of flying hours. For additional information on
flying hour allocation and planning procedures for CAF units refer to AFI 11-102. Maintenance
schedulers must understand operational needs to determine supportability and operations
schedulers must consider maintenance capabilities. Maintenance and Operations schedulers will
develop a proposed annual flying plan balancing both operational requirements and maintenance
capabilities. The annual plan, detailed by month, will evaluate the capability of maintenance to
support the annual flying hour program. The plan will be coordinated and consolidated by OSS
Current Operations Flight operations scheduling and forwarded to the current operations flight
commander, AMXS/CC and Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO), Munitions
Officer/Munitions Control, MOS/CC, MOF/CC and MOF PS&D. The printed wing plan will
include an assessment of the wing’s ability to execute the flying hour program. The plan will be
presented to the OG and MXG CCs for approval before being approved by the WG/CC. Commit
the fewest number of aircraft possible to meet programmed UTE rate standards and goals. The
annual plan is further refined into quarterly/monthly operations and maintenance plans and then
into weekly schedules using the guidelines contained in the following sub-paragraphs.
   3.1.1. The number and length of sorties are of prime consideration in planning to meet
   programmed UTE rate standards/goals based on Flying Hour Program Development to
   support the operational course syllabus.
   3.1.2. Principal areas of concern are in the overall flying schedules. For mission
   accomplishment and improved efficiency, the following must be considered: maximize crew
   training on all flights, plan alternate missions when possible, ensure configurations and fuel
   loads are accurate, establish launch and recovery patterns, and utilize historical attrition data.
3.2. The Proposed Flying Hour Program Requirements.
   3.2.1. Proposed FHP Process. The Proposed FHP process initiates funding and a unit’s FHP
   for the next fiscal year. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO lead the development of their Wing’s
   Proposed FHP. It’s critical that all operational requirements are reviewed and weighed
   against maintenance capability factors. Units will ensure thorough coordination with all
   assigned squadrons and aircraft maintenance units prior to ACC submission.
       3.2.1.1. Developing the Proposed FHP response: MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will
       ensure the Proposed FHP process is initiated NLT 15 March. MOF PS&D will request
       that MMA accomplish an airframe, personnel, and facility capabilities assessment using
       locally generated templates; there are no ACC approved templates. The capabilities are
       due back to MOF PS&D no later than the last workday of March. This process identifies
       operational requirements and maintenance capability for the next fiscal year. Units will
       perform the following steps prior to submitting their Flying Hour Program to ACC/A3T.
16                                         CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


     3.2.1.2. MOF MMA will develop an initial airframe, personnel and facility capability
     study.
     3.2.1.3. MOF PS&D will refine the initial MMA airframe capability by applying
     projected maintenance requirements to the historical data. MOF PS&D will provide
     copies of the capability study to each Operating Squadron (OS) operations scheduling
     AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO and to MXS/CC/MOO.
     3.2.1.4. NLT 5 duty-days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
     OSS/OSO will provide MOF PS&D a copy of “Proposed FHP” message and a
     breakdown of operational requirements to include at a minimum the following data:
        3.2.1.4.1. O&M days
        3.2.1.4.2. Sorties/hours (hourly & Sortie) required (programmed)
        3.2.1.4.3. Sorties/hours Scheduled (programmed + attrition provided by MMA and
        based on 4 years of historical data)
        3.2.1.4.4. Average sorties per O&M day
        3.2.1.4.5. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
        MOF PS&D will provide Proposed FHP maintenance capability projections in a
        monthly format to OS operations officer, AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO.
        Projections include “Proposed FHP” operational requirements, an assessment of
        maintenance’s ability to support the monthly contract requirements, and an overall
        assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual flying hour
        program.
     3.2.1.5. NLT 25 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message, MOF
     PS&D will gather the AMXS and OS coordinated responses to the Proposed FHP
     message and forward them to OSS Current Operations Flight operations scheduling
     section for consolidation into a comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of the
     following items by OS/AMU:
     3.2.1.6. Utilization (UTE) rates.
        3.2.1.6.1. Hourly UTE (HUTE) rates are the number of hours an aircraft must fly per
        month in order to meet the annual requirement. HUTE rates will be computed by
        month for the entire fiscal year for contracted (required) hours and scheduled hours.
        The HUTE rate equals the number of hours per month divided by the number of
        Primary Mission Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (PMAI) aircraft.
        3.2.1.6.2. Sortie UTE (SUTE) rates are the number of sorties an aircraft must fly per
        month in order to meet the annual requirement. SUTE rates will be computed by
        month for the entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties.
        The SUTE rate equals the number of sorties per month divided by the number of
        PMAI aircraft.
            3.2.1.6.2.1. Aircraft Authorizations:
                3.2.1.6.2.1.1. HQ USAF specifies the PMAI for each unit in the USAF
                Programs: PA, Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours.

     3.2.1.6.2.1.2. Units projected to possess less aircraft than authorized may be assigned a
     revised PMAI or Chargeable Aircraft Authorization (CHRG) for UTE and flying hour
     computations. The CHRG will be displayed for each applicable unit in allocation
     messages.
     3.2.1.7. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day. Compute the number of sorties (hours)
     required per O&M day to meet the operational requirement using the formula: Number
     of sorties (hours) required divided by number of O&M days in a given month. Sorties
     (hours) per day will be computed by month for each operational squadron/AMU.
     3.2.1.8. Monthly scheduled sorties. Compute monthly scheduled sortie requirements
     using the formula: (Number of sorties or hours required) divided by (1 minus the
     attrition factor). Example: 1,000 sorties or hours required divided by (1 minus 0.15)
     equals 1,177 sorties or hours to schedule. Remember to round any part up to the next
     whole sortie.
     3.2.1.9. Phase/Periodic/Isochronal (ISO) inspection dock capability. Compute the
     number of Phases/Periodic/ISO inspections to be accomplished in order to meet
     operational requirements for each AMU, by month, for the entire fiscal year. Compute
     dock capability using the formula (number of O&M days) divided by (number of
     PH/PE/ISO days) multiplied by (number of available docks) multiplied by (inspection
     cycle).
     3.2.1.10. MOF/PS&D will compute and provide the phase/ISO dock capability
     projection.   This projection will be reviewed with AMXS and MXS supervision.
     Compute dock capability using the formula (number of O&M days) divided by (number
     of PH/PE/ISO days) multiplied by (number of available docks) multiplied by (inspection
     cycle) an example (20 O&M days/5 day phases X 1 phase dock X 400 hour inspection
     cycle = 1600 hours). This number correlates to how many airframe inspection hours
     maintenance can support in a given month.
     3.2.1.11. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
     MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO will co-chair a Proposed FHP meeting with all required
     agencies. Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, MSG (i.e.
     Fuels) and OS. Capability studies and operational requirements will be discussed and
     reviewed. Any maintenance, operational, or support shortfall will be noted and briefed to
     the MXG, OG and MSG CCs.
        3.2.1.11.1. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO will compile the airframe, personnel, and
        facility capability studies, operational requirements (paragraph 3.2.1.4), and any
        noted shortfall. A package will be prepared and briefed to group commanders
        (OG/MXG/MSG) prior to Wing/CC final approval. Once approved, the OG and
        MXG will provide ACC/A3T/A4Q a coordinated “Proposed FHP” response message.
        The message will depict the operational requirements by month for the next fiscal
        year and provide an overall capability statement of the unit’s ability to meet the plan.
        Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be noted and explained.
        3.2.1.11.2. NLT 35 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP”
        message, once compiled, packages will be presented to the MSG, OG and MXG/CCs
        (or equivalents) before being presented to the WG/CC for final approval. MOF

           PS&D will review the comprehensive package submitted to OSS Current Operations
           Flight operations scheduling section and provide feedback to AMU OIC/NCOIC,
           AMXS/CC/MOO and MXG/CC if required. Final assessments of maintenance
           capabilities to support the operations "Proposed FHP" projections are then sent to
           ACC/A3TB and ACC/A4Q. The “Proposed FHP” response message is due to
           ACC/A3T NLT the “Propose FHP” message suspense date.
3.3. COMBAT AIR FORCES (CAF) Baseline Allocation Message. Once COMACC
approves a unit’s Proposed FHP response, the CAF Baseline Allocation message will become the
contract between CAF (ACC) and the unit. This message will be forwarded to the unit NLT 1
Sep each year and will be the basis for the unit’s annual flying and maintenance planning
process.
Note: Except for emergencies or HHQ tasking at year-end (e.g., hurricane evacuations or air
sovereignty scrambles), UNIT FLYING HOUR PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE
OVERFLOWN WITHOUT ACC/A3 APPROVAL. Unit commanders are not required to
"zero out" their annual flying hour program at the end of the fiscal year. The last flying day of
the year should be planned and flown as a normal flying day keeping in mind that the program
cannot be overflown.
3.4. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. The annual planning cycle develops the wings
maintenance and operation plan to support/sustain the FHP established by the CAF Baseline
Allocation message. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO leads the development of their wing’s annual
plan. Both maintenance and operations are required to refine their requirements and re-evaluate
their capability to support the FHP. It is critical that all factors are considered and operational
requirements are balanced with maintenance capability throughout the year. MOF/PS&D will
identify all major maintenance impacting airframe availability using IMDS/MIS products, such
as Time Distribution Index (TDI), Planning Requirements (PRA), and Workable TCTO Report
background products to determine long-range maintenance requirements. MOF/ PS&D & MMA
will review capability studies for accuracy. OSS/OSO will validate O&M days and their
requirements for accuracy.
   3.4.1. Developing the Annual Plan: MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will ensure the annual
   planning process is initiated NLT 15 March and their Final Flying Hour Program (Proposed
   FHP response) message is submitted to ACC/A3T/A4Q NLT the “Propose FHP” message
   suspense date. Units will ensure the following steps prior to submitting their final Flying
   Hour Program (Annual plan).
   3.4.2. MOF/PS&D and MMA build and validate all capability studies which includes
   airframe, personnel, facility and phase/ISO dock projections. AMXS/MXS Flight chiefs will
   compile personnel data and forward to MMA for inclusion into the personnel capability
   portion of the study. The studies will be reviewed and analyzed with AMXS and MXS
   supervision. Capability shortfalls will be noted and briefed to the MXG/CC.
       3.4.2.1. MOF/MMA will provide updated attrition factors to MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO
       using a minimum of 4 years of historical local data. If a unit does not have 4 years of
       historical data to compute attrition, contact ACC/A4QJ for further guidance.
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                           19


      3.4.2.2. MOF/PS&D will provide all known major maintenance which includes but is
      not limited to: Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), Phase/ISO, Refurbishment, and
      major modification schedules.
      3.4.2.3. MOF PS&D will calculate and provide an average aircraft availability per month
      and projected UTE rate.
      3.4.2.4. OSS/OSO will validate their monthly breakdown of hours and sorties (based on
      RAP/contingency/curriculum requirements) in the baseline allocation message and
      provide maintenance the following planning factors:
          3.4.2.4.1. TDYs (if known).
          3.4.2.4.2. Exercises (if known).
          3.4.2.4.3. Safety, training, UTE, family, and all non-O&M days.
          3.4.2.4.4. O&M days.
          3.4.2.4.5. Sorties/hours required (programmed). Yearly requirement broken out by
          month.
          3.4.2.4.6. Sorties/hours Scheduled (programmed + attrition). Attrition is based on 4
          years of historical data provided by MOF/MMA unless operations empirical data
          exists. Yearly requirement broken out by month
          3.4.2.4.7. Average sorties per O&M day.
          3.4.2.4.8. Suggested turn pattern.
          3.4.2.4.9. Configuration/munition requirements.
   3.4.3. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
   MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will chair an annual planning meeting with all required agencies.
   Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, OS and MSG (i.e., Fuels
   servicing). Capability studies, operational requirements and planning factors will be
   reviewed and validated during this meeting. Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be
   noted and briefed to the MXG/CC and OG/CC.
   3.4.4. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
   MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will prepare and brief the wing’s annual maintenance and flying
   hour program to the group commanders (MXG/OG/MSG) prior to Wing/CC approval. Once
   Wing/CC approved, the OG and MXG will provide ACC/A3T/A4QJ a coordinated final
   Flying Hour Program message. The message will depict the operational requirements by
   month for the next fiscal year and provide an overall capability statement of the unit’s ability
   to meet the plan. Note: If maintenance or operational capability does not exist to meet
   peacetime operational requirements due to split peacetime/AEF operations, or if an
   operational event impacts a unit’s ability to execute, the unit has the option to revise their
   Flying Hour Program. This can be accomplished when submitting their annual plan or they
   can reflow sorties/hours quarterly, as required. Changes to the total hours/sorties on the CAF
   Baseline allocation message require justification by the unit.
3.5. Quarterly Scheduling:
 20                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


   3.5.1. Quarterly scheduling starts with the operational requirement for flying hours, UTE
   rate, airframe availability, alert, and other related scheduling data. The OS operations officer
   provides these requirements to AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control NCOIC/Munitions OIC
   and PS&D NLT the first weekly scheduling meeting the month prior to the effective quarter.
   AMU supervision and the OS operations officer discuss the requirements and identify any
   LIMFACs at the scheduling meeting before the quarter being scheduled. Launch/recovery
   blocks, sortie flow timing, etc., are established based on training ranges (TR) and air
   refueling (AR) allocations.
   3.5.2. Schedulers ensure quarterly plans are as detailed and accurate as possible at the time
   of preparation. Forecast and monitor requirements for the current and next 2 months. Include
   known special missions, depot maintenance input and output schedules, higher headquarters
   commitments, and lateral command support requirements.
      3.5.2.1. Use the following priority to determine which objectives to support if a lack of
      resources prevents meeting requirements:
          3.5.2.1.1. Alert Commitments.
          3.5.2.1.2. Higher-headquarters directed missions.
          3.5.2.1.3. Training.
   3.5.3. The OG/CC and MXG/CC jointly chair a quarterly meeting (calendar quarter, Oct -
   Dec, Jan - Mar, Apr - Jun, Jul - Sep) NLT the monthly meeting (can be held in conjunction
   with) prior to the effective quarter and may be held in conjunction with the weekly
   scheduling meeting. The intent of the quarterly meeting is to ensure both operations and
   maintenance are continuing to look past the current month not to add an additional meeting.
   A rolling 3-month plan briefed each month meets the intent of the quarterly scheduling
   process. OSS Current Operations Flight operations scheduling compiles, coordinates, and
   briefs the quarterly plan to include operational requirements, support capability, and
   difficulties expected. Once an approved quarterly plan is established, OSS Current
   Operations Flight operations scheduling will forward a copy to OS, AMXS, MOS, OG, and
   MXG/CCs along with all scheduling agencies. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed
   by both maintenance and operations. When changes to the quarterly plan are required to
   achieve the unit objectives, make necessary adjustments to the monthly and weekly plans
   while keeping within unit capabilities.
3.6. Monthly Scheduling:
   3.6.1. Monthly plans refine quarterly requirements. Forecast and monitor requirements for
   the current and next 2 months. Include predictable maintenance factors based on historical
   data along with other inputs, such as flow times for maintenance, turnaround times and parts
   replacement schedules from the long-range plan. Additionally, include all known operational
   events (e.g., exercises, deployments, and surges) to determine maintenance capability to meet
   operational requirements.
      3.6.1.1. Long-range maintenance plans will be developed in as much detail as possible.
      All maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single long-range plan using AF
      Form 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, or computer generated
      product. As a minimum, the long-range plan shows the current month and the next 2
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                          21


     months’ known flying and maintenance requirements. Known maintenance requirements
     are defined as any maintenance event that impacts aircraft availability and maintenance
     events requiring management attention to ensure smooth flow of scheduling/completion.
     Maintenance events should be consolidated during a single down period to the
     greatest extent possible. As a minimum, include calendar inspections that prevent
     operational utilization for that day(s) flying schedule, calendar time change items,
     TCTOs in workable status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft, and
     aircraft ISO/PE/Phase inspections. The expectation is not to generate locally developed
     codes to identify each different special inspection, TCI, and TCTO but to clearly identify
     what scheduled action prevents operational use. Document this on the AF Form 2401 or
     computer generated product. Other maintenance requirements, such as engine changes,
     hourly requirements, inspections, training aircraft and cannibalization aircraft will be
     posted as they become known or planned. Add Alternate Mission Equipment (AME)
     inspections to the long-range plan if the aircraft is scheduled to stay in that configuration
     to ensure the inspections are included in the monthly and weekly schedules. Refine
     monthly and weekly schedules to ensure the quarterly plan objectives are met.
     3.6.1.2. (Added-552ACW) Monthly Scheduling. All agencies will submit their monthly
     schedule inputs to Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) for consolidation and
     coordination.
  3.6.2. The OS operations officers and AMU OIC/NCOIC will review their applicable
  portion of the monthly and weekly schedule prior to submission to MOF PS&D. To optimize
  aircraft and munitions support, MXS, AMXS and OS commanders will ensure the number of
  aircraft committed to the schedule and/or munitions configurations are minimized and
  standardized. Use the following sequence of actions to ensure monthly planning results in a
  contracted flying schedule. The monthly planning process is as follows:
     3.6.2.1. NLT the first weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the OPS
     officer provides AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control/Munitions officer and AMU PS&D
     with the estimated operational needs for the following month in as much detail as
     possible. Include known take-off times, landing times, the flying hour window and
     munitions configurations. If the take-off and landing times are unknown, block turn
     patterns are required.
     3.6.2.2. NLT the third weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the AMU
     OIC/NCOIC tells the OPS officer whether requirements can be met or limitations exist
     which may prevent successful fulfillment of requirements. MUNS control NCOIC/
     Munitions officer tells the OPS officer whether munitions requirements can be met or
     limitations exist. Make adjustments to the proposed monthly flying and maintenance plan
     to satisfy maintenance and operational requirements.
     3.6.2.3. NLT the last weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the preceding month,
     operations and maintenance formalize next month’s plan prior to presenting it to the
     WG/CC for approval.
     3.6.2.4. (Added-552ACW) The monthly schedule will be briefed to the wing
     commander or designated representative at the third wing scheduling meeting of the
     month (usually on Friday in conjunction with the weekly scheduling meeting). All
     agencies which have inputs will provide final products to 552d Maintenance Operations
 22                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       Flight (MOF) PS&D NLT 1600L Thursday (Wednesday in the event Friday is a holiday).
       The monthly scheduling meeting may be held in conjunction with the weekly scheduling
       meeting.
   3.6.3. During the monthly meeting, OS scheduling outlines past accomplishments, status of
   flying goals, problems encountered, and detailed needs for the next month.
       3.6.3.1. AMU/AMXS outline projected maintenance capability, and aircraft/equipment
       availability. MUNS control NCOIC/Munitions officer outlines projected munitions
       supportability.
       3.6.3.2. Operational requirements and maintenance capability scheduling conflicts that
       are not solvable by planned alternatives will be arbitrated by the group and wing
       commanders to decide what portion of the schedule will be executed.
   3.6.4. All agencies will submit their monthly plan inputs to MOF PS&D before presentation
   to the WG/CC. When the proposed monthly flying schedule contract is agreed upon and
   approved by the WG/CC, it is included as a portion of the monthly flying and maintenance
   schedule. The monthly flying and maintenance schedule is published/distributed NLT 5 duty
   days prior to the beginning of the effective month. Automated methods are acceptable
   (ensure security requirements are met).
   3.6.5. The sortie/flying hour contract specifies the number of sorties and hours required to be
   flown. The contract is the final resolved product between operational requirements and
   maintenance capabilities. The total forecasted attrition factor will be considered and added to
   the required sorties to ensure fulfillment of the contract. The annual required sorties for the
   month, plus the historical attrition factor (note paragraph 8.1: MXG approved revised
   attrition is also permitted), is the basis for the development of the monthly flying and
   maintenance schedules. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are
   figured against the contract. The monthly flying schedule will reflect the number of sorties
   contracted, the number of attrition sorties added, and the number of sorties scheduled for
   each unit.
Note: The calendar in Table 3.1. is an example month and represents when group and wing
level quarterly, monthly, and weekly scheduling meetings should be held. The calendar also
illustrates when maintenance and operations requirements must be met. Each unit may hold
scheduling meetings at times during the week/month convenient to the organization, as
long as the timelines in this instruction are met.
   3.6.6. Included in the monthly flying and maintenance schedule are:
       3.6.6.1. A detailed monthly operations utilization calendar which specifies total aircraft
       flying hours, total sorties and missions, alert requirements, and scheduled sortie or
       mission requirements, daily turn plans for each MDS by squadron, group, or wing.
       3.6.6.2. Maintenance workload requirements.
       3.6.6.3. Transient work schedule, if applicable.
       3.6.6.4. Aircraft scheduled inspections, deployments, TCTOs, engine changes, time
       changes, contract or depot maintenance, washes, corrosion control, training aircraft, and
       alert commitments. It is not mandatory for the letter "F" (F2, F3, etc…) to be printed on
       the AF Form 2401 or computer generated form to reflect the number of sorties each
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                       23


     aircraft is scheduled to fly. If the unit does not use this option, the schedulers must
     ensure that prime and spare aircraft are available to support the scheduled requirements.
     As a minimum, automated Forms must reflect all required entries and standardized
     for each MDS.
     3.6.6.5. Support equipment (SE) scheduled inspections, contract or depot maintenance,
     TCTOs, time changes, washes, and corrosion control.
     3.6.6.6. Avionics and other off-equipment maintenance to include scheduled inspections,
     TCTOs, assembly or repair operations.
     3.6.6.7. Engine in-shop inspections, time changes and all other maintenance needs.
     3.6.6.8. Munitions, photo, electronic countermeasures and other mission loading or
     configuration requirements, including ammunition changes.
     3.6.6.9. Total ordnance requirements for aircraft support listed by quantity and type.
     Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The types and
     quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do not exceed
     AFI 11-212, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training, authorized allowances."
     3.6.6.10. Tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons and war reserve materiel scheduled
     inspections, TCTOs, assembly, or repair operations.
     3.6.6.11. Quality Assurance (QA) scheduled inspections listed by type and quantity
     unless published separately by QA.
     3.6.6.12. If known as confirmed requirements, include special activities, such as
     commander's calls, group TDYs, unit physical training program, UTA weekends and
     other unit formations.
     3.6.6.13. Monthly training schedules (i.e. FTD, MTF), if not published separately.
     3.6.6.14. Detailed support requirements, as applicable, including:
        3.6.6.14.1. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) servicing.
        3.6.6.14.2. Supply requirements.
        3.6.6.14.3. Food service requirements.
        3.6.6.14.4. Fire department requirements.
        3.6.6.14.5. Security requirements.

3.7. Weekly Scheduling:
   3.7.1. Weekly scheduling is the final refinement to the monthly plan and results in the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Its execution is measured by the procedures
   outlined in this instruction. The OS operations officer, AMU OIC/NCOIC, and AMXS
   Maintenance Operations review the proposed weekly flying and maintenance schedule with
   OS, AMXS, MXS and MUNS Control/Munitions officer prior to presenting it to the
   OG/MXG commanders. The group approved schedule will be submitted to the MOF PS&D
   for consolidation prior to submission to the wing commander. MOF PS&D reviews the
   schedules for adequate utilization of aircraft and proper scheduling of maintenance
   requirements. Weekly scheduling meetings will be conducted at the group and wing level as
   follows:
      3.7.1.1. The OG/CC and MXG/CC, or their designated representatives, will chair the
      group meeting to consolidate and review proposed flying and maintenance plans. The
      OG and MXG will review the past week's accomplishments, negotiate alternatives, and
      approve refinements to the coming week's schedule.
      3.7.1.2. The WG/CC will chair a weekly scheduling meeting at which the OG and
      MXG/CCs will present the flying and maintenance plan for approval; the MSG/CC will
      also attend this meeting. MOF PS&D ensures a completed (paper or electronic) copy is
      submitted to the WG/CC (or equivalent) at the weekly scheduling meeting.
          3.7.1.2.1. At the scheduling meeting, evaluate the past week’s accomplishments, to
          include Flying and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness, maintenance scheduling
          challenges and refinements to the coming week's schedule.
          3.7.1.2.2. (Added-552ACW) Weekly Scheduling. At a minimum, the AMU OIC /
          Chief, Lead Air Operations Specialist or representative, Squadron Ops Scheduling
          Officer or representative, and 552 MOF/MXOOP must attend the OG/MXG
          scheduling meeting.
   3.7.2. NLT 2 duty days before the weekly scheduling meeting, the flying squadron
   operations officer gives the AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMU PS&D, EMS/CMS/MXS maintenance
   operations and MUNS Control/Munitions Officer the following information:
      3.7.2.1. Aircraft take-off and landing times.
      3.7.2.2. Configuration requirements.
      3.7.2.3. Munitions requirements by quantity and type.
      3.7.2.4. Fuel loads.
      3.7.2.5. Special or peculiar mission support requirements.
      3.7.2.6. Alert requirements.
      3.7.2.7. Exercise vulnerability.
      3.7.2.8. Deployments.
      3.7.2.9. Off base sorties.
      3.7.2.10. On-equipment training requirements.
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                         27


       3.7.2.11. Other special requirements.
       3.7.2.12. Nuclear munitions maintenance schedule.
Note: When one maintenance unit supports more than one flying unit at a base, the OS
operations officers will consolidate and de-conflict those requirements and submit a single
operational requirement to maintenance. This will ensure operational requirements do not
exceed aircraft availability and maintenance capability.
   3.7.3. Operations and maintenance schedulers discuss weekly needs and arrive at an
   acceptable, coordinated schedule for group commanders' review.
   3.7.4. OG/CC and MXG/CC present the proposed flying schedule to the WG/CC for
   approval. If an agreement cannot be reached before the weekly scheduling meeting, the
   problem is referred to the WG/CC for decision. Once approved and signed by the WG/CC,
   OG/CC, and MXG/CC, the flying schedule is the final planning guide for both operations
   and maintenance and is a contract and every effort will be made to execute the schedule as
   printed.
   3.7.5. MOF PS&D ensures distribution of the schedule to each appropriate activity and
   workcenter NLT 1200L Friday. Units conducting night flying operations should distribute
   the schedule as soon as possible but NLT 1400L Friday. Automated methods are acceptable
   (ensure security requirements are met). Once printed in the weekly flying and maintenance
   schedule, the aircraft or equipment is made available to meet that schedule. MOF PS&D
   records maintenance scheduling deviations and forwards computations to MMA weekly for
   publication in the monthly maintenance summary as outlined in Chapter 5. The
   maintenance operations center (MOC) reports flying scheduling deviations.
       3.7.5.1. (Added-552ACW) To meet the 1200L Friday (Thursday in the event Friday is
       a holiday. 1400L if conducting night flying operations) distribution deadline the
       following timeline should be adhered to:
       3.7.5.2. (Added-552ACW) OSS scheduling should have the basic sorties loaded into
       the scheduling software application used for the weekly schedule by 1600L Monday of
       the preceding week.
       3.7.5.3. (Added-552ACW) By 1600L Thursday (Wednesday in the event Friday is a
       holiday); all agencies which have inputs to the schedule will provide final products to
       MOF PS&D for inclusion into the weekly schedule.
       3.7.5.4. (Added-552ACW) By 1200L Friday (Thursday in the event Friday is a holiday)
       MOF PS&D will print, distribute, and load on the web page the following week’s
       schedule.
   3.7.6. Units publish a weekly schedule for normal home base operations, deployments, (to
   include a printed schedule at the deployed locations, weapons training or detached site), and
   planned sortie surges. Units operating by daily ATOs will publish a schedule IAW
   paragraph 3.7 and filed as a weekly schedule after execution. Included in the weekly flying
   and maintenance schedule are:
       3.7.6.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
       take-off and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations,
       fuel loads and special equipment requirements.
 28                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       3.7.6.2. Spare aircraft requirements are based on projected aircraft first sortie logistics
       losses. Spare requirements are computed and printed by day for each unit in the weekly
       flying and maintenance schedule. See Chapter 8 for factors used to determine spares.
       3.7.6.3. Scheduled maintenance actions by aircraft and equipment serial number to
       include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
       washes or corrosion control, documents review, deferred discrepancies and hours
       remaining to phase/ISO. A job control number/event ID will be printed in the weekly
       flying schedule for each scheduled maintenance event.
       3.7.6.4. Required pre-inspection and other maintenance meeting schedules
       (Phase/Isochronal inspections, Contract Field Team (CFT)/Depot Field Team (DFT) etc)
       to include minimum attendees.
       3.7.6.5. Wash facility use.
       3.7.6.6. Training requirements plus aircraft and equipment in support of these
       requirements.
       3.7.6.7. Aerospace Ground Equipment inspection/maintenance schedule by type, serial
       number or identification.
       3.7.6.8. Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The
       types and quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do
       not exceed AFI 11-212 authorized allowances." This statement eliminates the need for
       submitting certificates of authorization when ordering munitions to support the flying
       schedule.
       3.7.6.9. A list of new or revised publications, T.O. indexes, inspection work cards,
       checklists and -6 codebooks, including release/change dates. Automated systems will be
       used, if available.
Note: The AF Form 2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, is used as
a summary of the week. The AF Form 2403, Weekly Aircraft Utilization/ Maintenance
Schedule, is more finite in the depiction of aircraft utilization and maintenance. Electronic
versions or computer generated product of the above forms are authorized. Whatever forms are
used, all requirements must be entered. Weekly schedules may be published electronically
provided local security requirements are met.
3.8. Changes to the Weekly Schedule:
   3.8.1. Types:
       3.8.1.1. Para Change - Pen-and-Ink. The pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is not intended
       to be used as a tool to extend the scheduling process by another day. Pen-and-ink
       changes made to next week’s schedule, submitted to the MOC by 1600 hours Friday prior
       to the affected week, or at the daily maintenance scheduling/production meeting,
       whichever occurs first are authorized (exception: NLT 2 hours after the last landing
       during printed wing night flying weeks). They are non-reportable and become part of the
       printed weekly flying schedule. An AF Form 2407 (either hard copy or electronic
       version) is required stating the changes are pen-and-ink. AF Form 2407s that fail to meet
       these deadlines will not be considered pen-and-ink. Note: The intent of the pen-and-ink
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                            29


     AF Form 2407 is to correct minor errors and not complete revisions of the previously
     Wing/CC approved schedule.
         3.8.1.1.1. Unit Training Assembly (UTA) Weekends. During scheduled UTA
         Weekend flying for classic Association units are allowed to accomplish pen-and-inks
         on the last scheduled fly-day (Saturday or Sunday). Approved pen-and-ink changes
         will be made to next week’s schedule prior to 1600 hours local or 2 hours after the
         last landing during scheduled/published night flying.
     3.8.1.2. Approved pen-and ink changes are non-reportable and become part of the
     printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule. An AF Form 2407 or electronic
     substitution is required stating the changes are pen-and-ink.
     3.8.1.3. Tail Number Swaps.         Tail number swaps should be used to prevent
     reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of work hours when the primary aircraft is
     not mission-capable by its scheduled take-off time. Every effort is made to make the
     aircraft tail number swaps at the daily maintenance production meeting the day prior to
     the aircraft scheduled flight and entered on the AF Form 2407. All tail number swaps
     made at the daily maintenance production meeting are entered on an AF Form 2407 for
     audit and analysis purposes.
     3.8.1.4. Configuration. Configurations will be finalized at the daily maintenance
     production meeting and documented on an AF Form 2407. To prevent excessive
     expenditures of work hours, configuration changes made after the daily maintenance
     production meeting and prior to the first crew ready time the next day, require an AF
     Form 2407 coordinated through the required agencies.
  3.8.2. Procedures. The initiator of AF Form 2407 will include the specific reason for each
  change. Any change to the printed schedule will require an AF Form 2407 with the
  following exceptions:
     3.8.2.1. A change to the original printed take-off or landing time of 15 minutes or less.
     3.8.2.2. A change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace.
     3.8.2.3. Any change arising after the first crew ready time for the affected AMU for that
     day unless adding aircraft or sorties, or expanding the flying window.
     3.8.2.4. Changes made during the daily maintenance production meeting also require an
     AF Form 2407. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF Form 2407 and
     coordinates it through the affected production superintendent, AMU OIC/NCOIC,
     AMXS maintenance operations, operations squadron operations officer, operations
     group, Munitions Control, maintenance group, and wing staff agencies, as applicable
     (i.e., MOC, PS&D, etc..). Coordinate changes affecting munitions requirements with
     Munitions Control to ensure proposed munitions changes can be met. The requested
     changes should be coordinated prior to the daily maintenance production meeting to
     allow sufficient time to determine supportability of the change.
     3.8.2.5. Changes arising after the first crew ready time for the remainder of the flying
     day, such as tail number swaps, do not require an AF Form 2407; however, these changes
     will be coordinated by telephone or radio with all affected agencies. EXCEPTION:
     Any aircraft, sortie added to the flying schedule and any sortie duration changes
 30                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       that extends flying or landing beyond the flying hour window will be coordinated
       using an AF Form 2407.
       3.8.2.6. After coordination, a copy of the AF Form 2407 is filed in the MOC. The MOC
       will ensure MMA receives all AF Form 2407s for deviation accounting. AF Forms 2407
       will be disposed of IAW RDS.
       3.8.2.7. MOF PS&D will input all pen-and-ink changes in IMDS/MIS operational events
       subsystem using procedures in AFCSM 21-565V2, Operational Event Subsystem. After
       the Friday daily maintenance production meeting, MOC will input all changes (non-pen-
       and-ink). Maintenance Debrief will input utilization data for all sorties considered "flown
       as scheduled" (i.e. FCF/OCF, X/C returns, surge second and subsequent goes). Any AF
       Form 2407 coordinated changes made after pen-and-inks have been made and posted to
       IMDS/MIS by MOF PS&D will be input by MOC into the Maintenance Information
       System (MIS).
Note: Use of the AF Form 2407 does not negate the recording of deviations.
   3.8.3. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. All AF Form 2407 changes that add aircraft
   and/or sorties or increase the flying window require both OG and MXG commander (or
   group level representative, designated in writing by group commander) approval. All other
   AF Form 2407 changes will be approved by the affected squadron commander(s) (or
   designated representative). The MOC will coordinate higher headquarters directed taskings
   that require immediate execution. Electronic coordination is acceptable provided receipt is
   acknowledged and the sender enters the name of the person notified and the date/time on the
   AF Form 2407.
       3.8.3.1. Pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 also require OG and MXG approval. The group
       approved pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is required because pen-and-ink AF Form 2407
       change the schedule/contract signed at the weekly scheduling meeting and becomes the
       new basis for deviation recording.
       3.8.3.2. (Added-552ACW) Changes to the Weekly Schedule. The agency requesting
       the change initiates the AF Form 2407 and coordinates it through the applicable
       production superintendent, affected agencies, Squadron Operations Officer, AMU
       OIC/Chief, AMXS Operations Officer/Chief, MXS Operations Officer/Chief, and
       MXG/OG for approval, if required, before being submitted to 552 MOF/MXOOP. 552
       MOF/MXOOP is responsible for submitting the finalized changes to the MOC. The AF
       Form 2407 must include detailed explanation for all changes. List scheduled
       maintenance events that are affected (cancelled or delayed).
          3.8.3.2.1. (Added-552ACW) All daily AF Forms 2407 changes will be available for
          signature to applicable MOF PS&D NLT 1500L.
          3.8.3.2.2. (Added-552ACW) Signed AF Forms 2407 will be provided to 552
          OSS/OSOL NLT 1600L for the Daily Schedule.
          3.8.3.2.3. (Added-552ACW) Requests for fuel load changes after 1600L must be
          approved by respective flying squadron DO and AMU OIC. This coordination may
          be verbal, but must be followed by an AF Form 2407 routed through all applicable
          agencies.

                                            Chapter 4

                     FLYING SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS (FSE)

4.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying schedule deviations and provides formulas for
computing FSE. FSE is a tool to identify those processes within the wing’s control that can be
improved to help drive down turbulence for both the operator and maintainer.
   4.1.1. A cornerstone of successful flying scheduling and execution is an understanding of
   how the schedule is executed versus how it was planned to be executed. These differences in
   scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase of the scheduling
   process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be recorded so that follow-up analysis
   can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without deviation data, this
   analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning of the process
   that will in the end, improve unit's flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting
   deviations to the weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each
   deviation. Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being
   assigned to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will
   be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the
   parties involved to arrive at a unit position. The OS, AMU OIC/AMXS and MOF operations
   officers or enlisted equivalents, will monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this
   publication. When conflicts arise, leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest
   level. All deviations will be recorded as described in this publication.
   4.1.2. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE). This leading indicator is a measure of how
   well the unit planned and executed the weekly flying schedule. The flying scheduled
   developed by tail number is the baseline upon which the FSE is derived by comparing each
   day’s deviations. Deviations that decrease the FSE from 100% include: Scheduled sorties
   not flown because of maintenance, supply, operations; adds, deletes, and ground aborts;
   scheduled sorties that take-off more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off; scheduled
   sorties that take-off more than 15 minutes after their scheduled take-off time. Disruptions to
   the flying schedule can cause turmoil on the flightline, send a ripple effect throughout other
   agencies, and adversely impact scheduled maintenance actions.
4.2. Requirements. Flying scheduling effectiveness computation and deviation recording are
required for all CAF assigned aircraft. Reporting procedures are contained in Chapter 7 of this
publication.
4.3. Flying Schedule Deviations.
   4.3.1. Schedule deviations apply to the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule,
   even though a coordinated change is accomplished using an AF Form 2407. When a unit
   coordinates a change to the printed weekly flying schedule, using an AF Form 2407, the unit
   is informing everyone of the changed information and deviations will be recorded as
   appropriate. Multiple deviations against a single line entry will not count towards FSE
   except for (a) additions that air or ground abort, (b) additions that cancel, (c) added
   aircraft/sorties that take-off late, and (d) late take-offs that air abort. The AFTO Form
   781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the official source document for take-
   off and landing data. For all deviations, the person recording the deviations in IMDS/MIS
 32                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


   will provide a detailed explanation in the remarks section and a Job Control Number/Event
   ID in IMDS (screen 350) or MIS for all maintenance CX, GAA, GAB, GAC (as defined in
   4.3.2), AA, AI, and FE (as defined in 4.3.3) . Flying schedule deviations fall into one of the
   following categories:
   4.3.2. Ground Deviations. Ground deviations are events occurring before aircraft take-off.
   All ground deviations are recorded in IMDS/MIS and used in flying scheduling effectiveness
   calculations unless otherwise noted. Specific ground deviations are:
      4.3.2.1. Ground Abort (GA). A aircraft that cannot take off due to maintenance. A third
      alpha character is added to further define the deviation:
          4.3.2.1.1. (GAA) . Ground abort, before engine start, maintenance.

          4.3.2.1.3. (GAC) . Ground abort, after taxi, maintenance.
      4.3.2.2. Addition (AD). A sortie or aircraft added to the schedule not previously printed
      on the weekly schedule, will be recorded against the agency (OP, MX, HQ) requesting
      the additional sortie or aircraft. Sorties added to the schedule will be used in Total
      Sorties Scheduled for Flying Scheduling Effectiveness computation. Aircraft added to
      the schedule will not be used as a part of the Total Sorties Scheduled for Flying
      Scheduling Effectiveness computation; however, aircraft adds (i.e. added spares) will be
      captured in the FSE Calculated-Deviations computation.
          4.3.2.2.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check Flights (OCF)
          whose primary purpose is to perform maintenance checks are not addition deviations
          but will be coordinated using AF Form 2407. FCF/OCF sorties and sorties
          originating off-station without home-unit support will be considered "flown as
          scheduled” without recording deviations. FCF “chase” aircraft, when accompanying
          FCF/OCF training or checkout sortie for single seat MDS only (i.e. A-10) will be
          considered “flown as scheduled” without recording deviations. The FCF “chase” is
          for FCF qualified operator to conduct and/or evaluate training/checkout only.
Note: All additions will be coordinated using the AF Form 2407 and approved IAW paragraph
3.8.3.
      4.3.2.3. Cancellation (CX). An aircraft or sortie removed from the printed schedule for
      any reason prior to crew show. For hard line sorties (sorties supporting other defense
      customers), cancellations occur when it is determined the originally scheduled
      mission cannot be met. For training sorties, if the sortie can launch and recover during
      the squadron’s flying window and perform its original mission, a cancellation is not
      recorded. If any sortie does not launch within the late take-off criteria, a late take-off is
      recorded.
      4.3.2.4. Early Take-off (ET). An early take-off is a scheduled sortie launching more than
      30 minutes prior to the published take-off time. EXCEPTION: Do not record early
      take-off deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
      4.3.2.5. Late Take-off (LT). A late take-off occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
      airborne more than 15 minutes after the scheduled take-off time. If the printed tail
      number is a ground abort and is replaced with a spare that takes off late, only the late

       take-off is computed in FSE. Another example is if an aircraft landed late, after the
       published landing time, and subsequently takes off late due to insufficient time to turn the
       aircraft, the late take-off deviation is recorded to the original cause for the late landing,
       such as, operations. Commanders must consider the impact when a sortie takes off late
       and the aircraft is scheduled to turn to another sortie that day. It may be best to shorten
       the sortie duration after a late take-off and land at the scheduled landing time, rather than
       fly the scheduled duration, due to a higher priority mission later in the day.
           4.3.2.5.1. EXCEPTION: RQ-4, U-2, C-130 series, C-135 series, E-3, E-4, E-8, and
           B-1 weapon systems will use 30 minutes for late take-off.
       4.3.2.6. Spare (SP). A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed schedule to be used in
       case a scheduled primary aircraft cannot fly its scheduled sortie. Spare aircraft can also
       include aircraft that are scheduled to fly in sorties later in the day, have aborted from an
       earlier sortie, have flown earlier or released after FCF/OCF. Do not count printed spares
       flown in scheduled lines as deviations when computing FSE.
       4.3.2.7. Tail Number Swap (TS). Tail swaps are changes to the printed flying schedule
       involving aircraft tail numbers printed on that day's schedule. Tail swaps may be made
       up to crew show time. Tail swaps made after crew show are recorded as spare. The
       MOC must be notified of all tail swaps and record all tail swaps in IMDS/MIS. Do not
       count Tail Number Swaps as deviations when computing FSE. Below are specific
       examples of tail swaps:
           4.3.2.7.1. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers with printed spare aircraft.
           4.3.2.7.2. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to different printed line numbers.
           4.3.2.7.3. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to any previously flown aircraft.
           For example, tail swaps are allowed for aircraft after release from OCF/FCF or XC
           return aircraft.
   4.3.3. Air Deviations. Air deviations are events occurring after take-off. They are recorded
   in IMDS/MIS but are not included in FSE calculations. Ground deviations take precedence
   over air deviations. Air deviations fall into the following categories:
       4.3.3.1. Air Abort (AA). An air abort is an aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its
       mission for any reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown against the flying hour
       program when reporting total sorties flown, but may not be considered a successful sortie
       based on mission effectiveness by operations to meet RAP/training/contingency
       requirements. Air aborts will be coded to the agency or condition that caused the aborted
       mission.
Note: Effective mission decisions will be made by operations; however, a non-effective mission
decision by operations does not necessarily mean an air abort occurred as defined in ACCI 21-
118. For example, if one planned mission task out of a planned five tasks is not completed or
operations flies an alternate mission (adversary, drone, etc..) and does not return the aircraft
immediately to maintenance, the sortie should not be coded as an air abort if operations later
determines, based on the original mission profile, the sortie was non-effective. The Air Abort
rate is a maintenance indicator and as a measure of re-work (sorties reflown).

        4.3.3.2. Air Abort, IFE (AI). An air aborted aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an
        in-flight emergency declared by the aircrew.
        4.3.3.3. Early Landing (EL). An early landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
        minutes before the scheduled landing time. Early Landing deviations are not used when
        computing FSE.
        4.3.3.4. IFE (FE). An aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-flight emergency
        declared by the aircrew after the mission is accomplished.
        4.3.3.5. Late Landing (LL). A late landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 15
        minutes after the scheduled landing time. If the sortie originated on time, record any
        subsequent late take-off or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If
        the extended sortie did not originate on time, record any subsequent sortie deviation
        against the agency that caused the original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE
        calculations.
   4.3.4. Ground Aborts. A ground abort by itself is not a deviation from the flying schedule,
   but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off. A ground abort is an event after
   crew show time preventing a “crew ready” aircraft from becoming airborne. Ground aborts
   will be recorded to the responsible agency or condition that caused the aircraft to abort.
   Ground aborts are categorized as GAA, GAB, GAC, operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy,
   other, etc. For maintenance ground aborts do not use cause code MTx, only use GAA, GAB,
   or GAC. For example, if an aircraft ground aborts and the sortie is not replaced by a spare,
   the lost sortie is a deviation towards FSE. Ground aborts on FCFs or OCFs will be recorded
   in IMDS/MIS, but not used when computing FSE.
        4.3.4.1. If a ground aborted aircraft is replaced by a spare, and the spare can meet the
        mission requirements, the original aircraft will be coded as a “spare ground abort.”
        Note: This is not used in computing FSE.
        4.3.4.2. If the original aborted aircraft is launched on the original scheduled mission, but
        exceeds the 15-minute late take-off criteria, the sortie will be recorded as a late take-off.
        4.3.4.3. If the aircraft lands, takes fuel via the hot pits, incurs an NMC condition after
        completion of hot pit refueling (receptacle disconnected) and can no longer continue, a
        ground abort is recorded.
        4.3.4.4. If an aircraft ground aborts and is replaced by a spare and the spare ground
        aborts causing the sortie not to be flown, both ground aborts will be counted in the
        overall ground abort rate, the lost sortie will be considered cancelled and included as the
        deviation in FSE. The first ground abort would not be used in computing FSE.

4.4. Deviation Causes. Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. See guidance in
paragraph 4.1.1. to resolve questions concerning assigning deviations between maintenance and
operations. Deviations will be assigned one of the following causes:
 38                                           CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


   4.4.1. Maintenance (MT_). Deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or for actions taken for maintenance consideration.
   4.4.2. Operations (OP_). Deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions, mission
   changes causing an early/late take-off, or cancellation including substitution/aircrew illness
   (including short notice aircrew physical/mental disqualification), and over-stressing the
   aircraft. OP_ are also deviations resulting from unit controlled operations factors including
   those caused by mission/load planning, life support, intelligence, base operations, range
   scheduling, and passengers.
   4.4.3. Supply (SU_). Deviations resulting from a Partially Mission Capable Supply or Not
   Mission Capable Supply condition or for late Supply or POL delivery. See AFMAN 23-110,
   USAF Supply Manual.
Note: The actual time required for installation will be considered.
   4.4.4. Higher Headquarters (HHQ). Deviations resulting from a higher headquarters tasking
   including closing of low level routes/ranges or external customer driven mission change.
   When an aircraft that was scheduled for a higher headquarters directed alert or off-base
   mission is replaced by a spare refer to paragraph 6.5 for unit options.
   4.4.5. Weather (WX). Deviations resulting from weather conditions such as sorties canceled
   because of severe weather conditions. For example, if an aircraft taxied to the end of runway
   and the wing commander cancels all flying due to weather, the deviation is a weather abort.
   Sorties/Aircraft cancelled prior to crew show are weather cancels.
   4.4.6. Sympathy (SY). Deviations occurring when a flight of two or more aircraft, under the
   command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
   cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Flights
   engaged in Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics training that are delayed by the other flight will
   record the delay as sympathy. Sorties, which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations
   on the same day, will be recorded as sympathy additions. Sorties lost caused by the aircraft's
   scheduled mated tanker/receiver/mission event will be recorded as sympathy. Examples of
   mission events are: loss of release times, tanker support, Minimum Interval Take-Off
   causing take-off delay or cancellation, deviations caused by another unit’s or command’s
   support should be coded as SY deviations.
Note: Deviations caused by aircraft/missions earlier scheduled lines will be assigned to the
cause of the earlier deviation, not SY.
   4.4.7. Air Traffic Control (AT). Deviations resulting from air traffic control problems (for
   example, flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway
   change, or runway closure).
   4.4.8. Other (OT). Deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
   causes listed. OT may include:
       4.4.8.1. Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests
       or evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E),
       Development Testing and Evaluation (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and
       Evaluation (IOT&E).
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                         39


       4.4.8.2. Unusual circumstances such as bird strikes, damage during air refueling, and
       unscheduled alert swap out.
       4.4.8.3. Equipment, non-CAF. Deviations caused by National Airborne Operations
       Center or Air Intelligence Agency or Air Force Material Command equipment, and other
       non-CAF support and equipment.
   4.4.9. Utilization Day (UTE).      Commander's authorized management deletions IAW
   paragraph 4.5.3
   4.4.10. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (XEH).            Deviations resulting from higher
   headquarters directed exercises, including alarm/force protection conditions.
   4.4.11. Exercise, Local (XEL). Deviations resulting from wing/unit directed exercises,
   including alarm/force protection conditions.
4.5. Scheduling Exceptions:
   4.5.1. Limited Number of Possessed Aircraft. AMUs with 11 or fewer possessed aircraft of
   a particular MDS, or 50% of their possessed aircraft deployed, are authorized to schedule tail
   numbers daily. Units may consider alert/IR aircraft and aircraft in possession code PJ or PR
   as non-possessed when applying the 11 or less rules. Units will print aircraft tail numbers in
   the weekly schedule. Aircraft tail numbers may be changed at the daily maintenance
   production meeting using AF Form 2407 without recording deviations (sorties added or
   canceled are chargeable). Immediately following the daily maintenance production
   meeting, the selected aircraft tail numbers for the next day’s flying schedule will be entered
   in IMDS/MIS. Once tail numbers are selected at the daily maintenance production meeting,
   normal deviations will be recorded. Although aircraft tail numbers may be changed at the
   daily meeting, maintenance and flying scheduling effectiveness is measured against the
   printed weekly schedule. Aircraft tail number changes will be chargeable against FSE
   after tail numbers are confirmed during the daily maintenance production meeting.
Note: No additional sorties may be added under this scheduling option without addition
deviation rules being applied as applicable in paragraph 4.3.2.1.
   4.5.2. Adverse Weather. Units may add sorties to the flying schedule to make up for
   weather losses. Sorties will only be added to the schedule when the planned weather attrition
   for the month, prorated daily, has been exceeded for that month. The number of sorties
   added will not exceed the difference between the planned weather attrition and actual
   weather losses. Sorties added for weather that do not exceed prorated weather attrition, are
   not included in OP-MT-FES-Rate. (EXAMPLE: Planned weather attrition for the month
   equals 30 sorties. On the 10th O&M day of the month (of 20) a unit’s weather losses are
   already 30 sorties. The unit may add 15 sorties (weather “adds”). The maintenance schedule
   and the ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements must be carefully
   considered before adding sorties. Under no circumstances will the number of sorties added
   for weather exceed the difference between actual weather losses and the prorated expected
   weather losses for the month. (See Chapter 8 for example of computing weather attrition for
   the flying schedule).
   4.5.3. Achievement of Utilization (UTE) Rate. Utilization management is accomplished
   throughout the month. Attrition should be closely monitored and a determination to adjust
 40                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


   the number of sorties required should be made before each weekly schedule is developed.
   This practice ensures an even sortie flow, eliminates excessive maintenance actions and
   limits the number of sorties canceled. The OG/CC is responsible for the flying program and,
   in coordination with the MXG/CC, can add or cancel sorties anytime during the month.
   However, flying scheduling effectiveness will be recorded when changing the weekly
   schedule. The OG/CC, in coordination with MXG/CC and MSG/CC, is encouraged to
   modify or cancel all or part of the schedule when they are reasonably assured the UTE rate
   goal for the month will be met. Sorties may be cancelled for UTE management during the
   last five O&M days of the month and will be recorded as "UTE." Sorties cancelled for UTE
   are not included in FSE. See AFI 11-102 ACCSUP for UTE rate development policy.
   4.5.4. Achievement of Student Training Goals (TF coded and Flying Training Units only).
   The squadron commander may, when an OS has achieved its monthly training goal, adjust
   the weekly printed flying schedule. Mission take-off times, configurations, etc., may be
   changed without incurring deviations. All changes will be made at the daily maintenance
   production meeting and will be documented on an AF Form 2407. Once the schedule has
   been changed, normal deviation reporting applies. This option allows units the flexibility to
   maximize use of those sorties originally scheduled for student training.
   4.5.5. Year End Closeout. During the last 15 O&M days of the fiscal year, units are
   permitted to selectively add/cancel scheduled sorties to manage the end-of-year flying hour
   closeout. These additions/cancellations will be recorded as "UTE." This provision is
   intended to help units gradually close out end-of-year flying without creating hangar queen
   aircraft and unintentionally exceeding the UTE rate. Sorties cancelled for UTE are not
   included in FSE. However, sorties requiring munitions support should be evenly distributed
   throughout the fiscal year to preclude a high demand for munitions support during the month
   of September. IAW AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, semi-
   annual inventories must be started and finished in the months of March and September.
4.6. Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generations are conducted to exercise the
wing’s ability to meet to the unit's combat sortie generation tasking under current war plans and
contingency operations.
   4.6.1. For scheduled combat sortie generations, publish the weekly flying schedule as a
   normal schedule. On the days the unit plans to exercise annotate scheduled exercise on the
   flying schedule and AF Form 2402, AF Form 2403 or electronic version. If an unannounced
   exercise is initiated, the remainder of the printed weekly schedule may be canceled and may
   be deleted from IMDS/MIS by the AMU PS&D.
   4.6.2. Combat sortie generation will usually include operations using Air Tasking Orders.
   See paragraph 4.7 for ATO procedures.
   4.6.3. When a scramble launch scenario is used, a launch "window" will be established for
   each line number or block of line numbers. Normal deviations will be assessed against all
   sorties.
   4.6.4. Sorties lost due to required scenario responses such as chemical warfare condition
   black, airfield attacks, etc., will be recorded as "XEH or XEL."
   4.6.5. If more sorties are flown than line numbers printed, those sorties will be considered
   flown as scheduled.
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                          41


   4.6.6. Once the objectives established by higher headquarters or the commander have been
   met, the remainder of that day's schedule may be canceled/deleted from IMDS/MIS by the
   MOF PS&D.
   4.6.7. At the termination of the combat sortie generation, the unit's originally printed weekly
   flying schedule may be revised, canceled, or replaced with a new weekly schedule without
   recording deviations. If revised or replaced, the flying schedule must be coordinated before
   resuming normal operations. Normal deviation reporting procedures will apply once
   finalized.
4.7. Air Tasking Order. The Air Tasking Order (ATO) can contain mission numbers, on-status
time/time on target and configurations. A daily flying schedule, including aircraft tail numbers
for the first lines and spares, will be finalized and confirmed to operations and the maintenance
operations center not later than 2 hours prior to the first on-status/take-off time. The new
published schedule derived from the ATO, is applicable to all affected organizations and no AF
Form 2407 is required to implement the new schedule. All changes after the new schedule has
been published, up to the first unit crew show time, will be documented and coordinated on an
AF Form 2407. Unlike a planned sortie surge, early and late take-offs are recorded on second
and subsequent sorties, unless an ops change is made to the ATO. Normal deviations will be
recorded against all sorties using the new published schedule derived from the ATO.
Note: All sorties (to include exercise ATOs published via SIPR net) launched under
“Classified ATOs” will be considered flown as scheduled. Classified ATO lines that are
missed will be recorded as cancels in the MIS. Cancellations will be loaded into the MIS
once the sortie is declared cancelled regardless of actual scheduled take-off time and
ground aborts will be recorded in MIS.
   4.7.1. Alert Sorties. Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise,
   active air or practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule
   will be considered sorties flown as scheduled. Ground aborts will be recorded in MIS
   however no deviation is recorded against FSE, but the ground abort is recorded in MIS.
4.8. Unscheduled Tasking. When a unit is tasked with an unscheduled higher headquarters
tasking or self-initiated tasking (mobility exercises or weather evacuations), or other services
tasking which significantly impacts the printed weekly flying schedule, the printed schedule may
be revised or deleted from IMDS/MIS by MOF PS&D and replaced with a new weekly schedule
without recording deviations. For weather evacuations, the schedule will be cancelled in
IMDS/MIS, not deleted, so the data is available for historical attrition.
   4.8.1. If the schedule is revised or canceled and reprinted, the following procedures will be
   used:
       4.8.1.1. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed once the
       revised/reprinted schedule has been finalized. The revised schedule will be finalized a
       minimum of 2 hours before the first scheduled launch.
       4.8.1.2. Once the tasking terminates, the original schedule may be used or it may be
       revised for the tasking period, as required. If the schedule is revised, the coordinated
       schedule must be completed prior to resuming normal operations. Normal deviation
       reporting is used once the revised or reprinted schedule is finalized.
 42                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       4.8.1.3. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed after a take-off time is
       established to a tasking by higher headquarters or other services.
   4.8.2. If the unscheduled tasking has an adverse impact on the monthly UTE rate goal, the
   commander has the option to adjust the monthly sortie UTE rate goal.
   4.8.3. An unscheduled tasking or actual combat operations may include use of an ATO.
   Deviations for all aircraft will be recorded IAW this instruction. For AMC aircraft assigned
   to a CENTAF AOR/CAF base for contingency support, deviations will be reported IAW
   AMC guidance.
4.9. Test and Evaluation. Wings responsible for the scheduling of OT&E, DT&E, or IOT&E
aircraft are authorized to deviate from the published schedule for aircraft, which are engaged in
these programs without incurring a deviation. They may adjust, formalize the test requirements,
and select aircraft tail numbers up to 12 hours before the first scheduled OT&E/DT&E/IOT&E
launch of the day. Deviations will be recorded based on the adjusted daily test schedule and as
prescribed in this publication.
4.10. Scheduling Options to Maximize Sortie Production.
   4.10.1. Planned Sortie Surge. Units may plan to produce sorties at a higher than normal
   rate. A unit may also use a planned sortie surge when the rest of the unit is deployed to a
   different location. A planned sortie surge is not considered a combat sortie generation or an
   unscheduled tasking. It should be conducted in a manner that takes full advantage of training
   opportunities inherent in a period of increased operations and maintenance activity. The
   number of sorties will be determined by training objectives and established by the OS and
   AMXS commanders. Printed sortie surge rates will exceed the daily sortie rate (average
   contracted sortie per O&M day based on the applicable monthly sortie/flying hour contract)
   of the unit by at least 50 percent, but not less than the contract required sorties scheduled on
   the monthly contract/plan. For example, if a unit normally flies 22 sorties in a day, to qualify
   for a surge, that same unit would schedule at least 33 sorties for the surge day. The statement
   "Sortie Surge" must be printed in the remarks section of the affected day’s flying schedule to
   add sorties without incurring deviations. This option is for surge operations only; units will
   NOT use this option solely to provide take-of and land flexibility.
       4.10.1.1. Surge scheduling scenarios should task maintenance and flying organizations
       realistically. For example, flat lining a surge is often not a feasible option. For example,
       scheduling a 12-ship to reach 60 sorties by turning the same 12 aircraft to fly 5 goes (12-
       ship turned 5 times) is often an unfeasible plan. Units should plan to get the maximum
       number of sorties possible from each aircraft committed to the schedule.
           4.10.1.1.1. Units should be cognizant of historical break rates and spare constraints
           when scheduling surges. Spares are quickly used up during surges and once spares
           are exhausted the capability to meet surge goals is severely limited.
       4.10.1.2. Extreme care must be exercised to avoid creating a backlog of unscheduled
       maintenance actions when scheduling sortie surges.
       4.10.1.3. Aircraft tail numbers, take-off times, line numbers, and configurations will be
       printed in the weekly schedule for each aircraft’s first sorties of each day. Include the
       statement "sortie surge" in the remarks section for each affected day.
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                           43


      4.10.1.4. Only line numbers are required on the weekly schedule for subsequent sorties
      (i.e., the total number of sorties/line numbers the unit intends to fly). Other data such as
      take-off times, configurations, and missions may be printed as required by the unit. To
      the greatest extent possible, the day prior, units should try to confirm subsequent sorties
      NLT the daily maintenance production meeting.
          4.10.1.4.1. However, early and late take-offs are not recorded on second and
          subsequent sorties. For all other deviations, normal deviation reporting applies.
      4.10.1.5. If more sorties are flown than what was intended (i.e., line numbers printed),
      these sorties will be considered flown as scheduled. All line numbers printed in the
      weekly schedule must be flown or normal deviation will be applied.
   4.10.2. Continuation Sortie. A continuation sortie is a sortie containing scheduled
   operations stops. Maintenance provides support limited to chocking the aircraft and
   fire/safety observer and the aircraft engines/Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) must remain
   running. EXCEPTION: C-130 aircraft, engines may be shut down to upload/download
   aircrew. Continuation sorties are designed to accommodate training events, optimize aircraft
   use and minimize maintenance manpower expenditure. Continuation sorties will be clearly
   identified in the published weekly flying schedule. This scheduling option is intended to
   allow the exchange of aircrew/passengers with minimal maintenance participation and
   aircraft possession does not return to maintenance. The initial crew on the sortie will brief
   the follow-on crew at the aircraft. Units may add continuation sorties onto scheduled sorties
   to make up for sorties lost earlier in the same week without recording deviations. Do not
   include these added continuation sorties in FSE unless there were no lost sorties earlier in the
   week. If no sorties were lost in the same week, the added continuation sortie will be an
   “add” deviation in FSE. Note: No maintenance or servicing is performed during the stop.
   Returning the aircraft to maintenance terminates the continuation sortie. This scheduling
   option is not applicable to fighter and attack aircraft.
   4.10.3. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). The ERCC sortie is used to optimize
   aircraft use. It involves turnaround of an aircraft incorporating partial or full crew change
   between two separate sorties. The difference between ERCC and continuation sorties is
   minor maintenance and servicing can be performed between sorties and since each is a
   separate sortie, deviations apply to each sortie. An aircraft is scheduled to fly an ERCC
   sortie in the published weekly schedule, upon landing, crew members are changed at the
   aircraft with at least one engine running. Minimum ground time should be scheduled
   between sorties. The crew of the first sortie must brief the crew of the second sortie at the
   aircraft. Other aircraft on the published flying schedule or previously flown aircraft not on
   the flying schedule (OCF, FCF, adds) can be tail swapped into the second sortie. For
   example, if two aircraft are scheduled to land at approximately the same time, either aircraft
   could ERCC to the later sortie. EXCEPTION: C-130 aircraft, engines may be shut down to
   upload/download aircrew. Note: This scheduling option is not applicable to fighter and
   attack aircraft.

                   MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

5.1. Purpose. Maintenance Schedule Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading indicator that
measures the unit’s ability to plan and complete scheduled maintenance events (i.e. inspections,
periodic maintenance, etc.) and scheduled use of maintenance resources (Static/IR/Alert Prep,
Training Aircraft, etc.) on-time per the maintenance plan. ACC goal for MSE is 95 percent. A
low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing a high rate of turbulence on the flightline or in
the back shops. This indicator is primarily used as reliability indicator for maintenance managers
assessing the unit’s capacity to execute the scheduled maintenance plan.
   5.1.1. A cornerstone of successful maintenance scheduling and execution is an
   understanding of how the schedule is executed versus how it was scheduled to be executed.
   These differences in scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase
   of the scheduling process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be recorded so that
   follow-up analysis can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without
   deviation data, analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning
   of the process to continually improve the scheduling and execution process that leads to
   improved unit flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting deviations to the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each deviation.
   Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being assigned
   to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will be
   assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the parties
   involved to arrive at a unit position. The squadron operations officer and the AMU
   OIC/AMXS maintenance operations, along with MOF maintenance operations, will monitor
   deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When conflicts arise,
   leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations will be
   recorded as described in this publication.
5.2. Computations:
   5.2.1. Compute the aircraft MSE using scheduled maintenance events in the printed weekly
   schedule. In order to make this data valuable it is important that the integrity of the data be
   maintained. The IMDS/MIS database will be used to determine whether or not the
   maintenance actions were completed on time. For example, if a maintenance event is
   scheduled in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule for Monday through Wednesday,
   IMDS/MIS must show completed before Thursday for credit. For maintenance events
   extending into the next week, credit for completion is based on the last day of the scheduled
   event (to 2400 on the last day of the scheduled event). Note: Periodic, Phase and ISO
   inspection completion will be measured using the completion date of the inspection as noted
   on the maintenance page. AMXS and MXS supervision will standardize the scheduled
   duration of the inspection for each MDS based upon the work card deck and fix phase critical
   path data determined from 4 years of IMDS/MIS historical data provided by MMA and
   Phase/ISO supervision assessments. Standardized durations will be documented and
   forwarded to MOF PS&D.

  5.2.1. (552ACW) 1 (Added) Computations. The approved MIS/IMDS is used to determine
  if scheduled maintenance events were completed on-time.
     5.2.1.1. (Added-552ACW) Computations. The approved MIS/IMDS is used to
     determine if scheduled maintenance events were completed on-time.
  5.2.2. The MXG/CCs may select additional areas (such as Aerospace Ground Equipment,
  Avionics Intermediate Shop, Alternate Mission Equipment, static, training aircraft etc.) for
  local scheduling effectiveness tracking. The unit will establish standards for these additions.
  When reported to HHQ these locally selected areas will not be included in aircraft MSE
  rates.
  5.2.3. MOF PS&D will implement procedures for reviewing and recording scheduled
  maintenance actions daily, forward this data to maintenance analysis weekly for computation
  and publication. Daily review will be accomplished by MOF PS&D and will not be
  delegated.
  5.2.3. (552ACW) 1 (Added) MOF PS&D will review all scheduled maintenance from the
  weekly flying schedule by checking IMDS screen #122 (QMS) daily and verify
  unaccomplished items at the daily 1530L production meeting. Incomplete scheduled
  maintenance actions are coded as “missed events” if not completed on scheduled day in
  IMDS.
     5.2.3.1. (Added-552ACW) MOF PS&D will review all scheduled maintenance from
     the weekly flying schedule by checking IMDS screen #122 (QMS) daily and verify
     unaccomplished items at the daily 1530L production meeting. Incomplete scheduled
     maintenance actions are coded as “missed events” if not completed on scheduled day in
     IMDS.
     5.2.3.2. (Added-552ACW) Upon completion of the week, MOF PS&D will gather all
     data for scheduled maintenance, with reasons for noncompliance and calculate
     maintenance scheduling effectiveness. This computation will be forwarded to
     Maintenance Data Systems Analysis, 552 MXG, 552 AMXS Supervision, Red/White
     AMU supervision, 552 MXS, and any other agency with scheduled maintenance to
     include Operations. Completed Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE) will be
     filed in MOF PS&D for the applicable flying-hour year.
  5.2.4. When a unit is tasked with a combat sortie generation, unscheduled tasking,
  unannounced exercise/real world contingency, or HHQ exercise that significantly impacts the
  printed weekly maintenance schedule, the plan may be revised or reprinted without incurring
  deviations. Utilizing MSE deviation Table 5.1, normal deviation reporting procedures will be
  followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized. The unaccomplished portion of the
  original maintenance schedule that was revised will not be included in the scheduling
  effectiveness formula.
     5.2.4.1. Units may revise or reprint the following day’s or remainder of that week’s
     maintenance schedule to compensate for adverse weather. This adjustment should be
     used only in extreme cases and recorded on an AF Form 2407. Once changed, normal
     deviation reporting procedures will apply.

   5.2.5. Squadron commanders will coordinate to cancel and reschedule maintenance actions
   to coincide with the portion of the flying schedule that was canceled after the unit or OS has
   achieved the UTE rate goal for the month. These canceled maintenance actions will not be
   included in MSE computations.

Table 5.1. MSE Deviations and Functions
DEVIATION                     FUNCTION
Maintenance (MX)              Actions canceled to adding aircraft to the flying schedule,
                              lack of manpower, equipment or as a result of
                              mismanagement.
Operations (OP)               Actions cancelled or not completed on-time for operational
                              considerations or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying

                              This also includes maintenance events not completed due to
                              operations group actions. For example, Life Support Section
                              not completing scheduled maintenance as published in the
                              wing weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
Higher headquarters           Actions canceled or not completed as a result of higher
(HHQ)                         headquarters tasking from outside of the wing.
Weather (WX)                  Actions canceled or not completed as a result of weather
                              conditions.
Supply (SU)                   Deviations that result from verified parts back order

Other (OT).                   Aircraft impounded after publication of the weekly schedule,
                              unscheduled major maintenance where the scheduled
                              maintenance action cannot be accomplished because of tech
                              data restrictions, aircraft off base and unable to return or as a
                              result of Productivity/Utilization Goal Days
Low Observable (LO)           Scheduled maintenance events not accomplished specifically
                              because LO restoration exceeded the original ETIC; actions
                              not completed due to inaccessibility or not power capable
EXCEPTION: Any scheduled maintenance for an aircraft that is possessed by
depot/PDM/CFT/DFT, that is not complied with because the aircraft is not released for
possession as scheduled to the owning unit does not count toward MSE computations.

                                           Chapter 6

               DEPLOYED OPERATIONS AND OFF-STATION SORTIES

6.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes rules and procedures used in planning, executing,
evaluating, and reporting of unit flying and maintenance schedules at deployed locations where
unit maintenance is provided. Sorties flown at deployed locations where no parent unit
maintenance is provided are considered off-station sorties. If parent unit support is deployed,
this is considered the same as home station support and normal deviation reporting applies.
Limited launch support is not considered parent unit maintenance.
6.2. General. Normal deviation reporting applies to deployed operations except as noted in this
chapter. Data from deployed operations will be transmitted or forwarded back to home station
and included in unit totals IAW ACCI 21-118.
6.3. Scheduling. In addition to the procedures for home station scheduling and reporting,
deployed units will use the following procedures when developing a weekly flying schedule and
reporting deviations:
   6.3.1. Separate block(s) of sortie sequence numbers will be assigned for deployment
   location(s).
   6.3.2. When a spare aircraft is launched for a scheduled deployment to a Forward Operating
   Location (FOL), the options in paragraph 6.5.1 apply to the home station and deployment
   location flying and maintenance schedules.
   6.3.3. Additions and cancellations at deployed locations, which are required to
   accomplish specific aircrew training requirements and make optimum use of available
   range time, are considered flown as scheduled. This does not relieve operations and
   maintenance from developing a viable and realistic flying schedule at the deployed location.
   The primary purpose of this flexibility is to allow the unit to make up non-effective sorties to
   ensure accomplishment of the deployment training plan. Procedures for changing the weekly
   schedule in Chapter 2 apply to deployment location flying and maintenance schedules.
   Additions and cancellations caused by ineffective planning are recorded.
   6.3.4. When operating at a deployed location using a daily ATO, follow procedures outlined
   in paragraph 3.7 of this instruction.
6.4. Deployed Daily Activity Report. Required information for deployed ACC units will be
transmitted to home station IAW applicable unit deployment plans. If required, refer to ACCI
21-118, Chapters 3 - 5 for further guidance.
6.5. Off-Station Sorties. Off - station sorties are those sorties flown from other than home
station and parent unit maintenance is not provided (e.g., cross-country sorties). Units will
publish sorties planned while off station. Take-off and landing times may be TBD when
supporting another unit and the specific times are unknown at the time of publishing. The
following paragraphs outline the rules that apply to higher headquarters alert or off-station
sorties:
   6.5.1. When a spare is launched to the off-station/cross country location in place of the
   originally intended aircraft, one of the following options applies.
 50                                            CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       6.5.1.1. Option 1. The originally scheduled prime aircraft, which remained on base, may
       fly the sorties of the departed aircraft for the remainder of the week without recording
       FSE deviations. However, maintenance scheduling effectiveness is based on the
       published weekly schedule.
       6.5.1.2. Option 2. The sorties may be tail-swapped with a printed spare aircraft on each
       day's schedule.
   6.5.2. When an aircraft is off-station and cannot return to home station for its scheduled
   sortie, a deviation will be recorded for the reason the aircraft was unable to return. The
   reasons will be specific, i.e., maintenance, operations, weather, etc.
Note: If the off-station aircraft can fly its scheduled mission from its location, no deviation is
recorded.
6.6. Deployed MOF PS&D Support Operations.
   6.6.1. NLT 7 days after arrival of a new units arrival, MOF PS&D Superintendent will visit
   all decentralized scheduling activities and provide technical assistance as needed.
   6.6.2. Units will follow home station guidance.
   6.6.3. Homestation AVDOs will perform AVDO duties on deployed aircraft unless the
   possession changes to the deployed location. With homestation AVDO approval, CENTAF
   MOF PS&D will make MIS inventory/status transactions and coordinate message
   requirements with homestation AVDOs. If possession changes, CENTAF, MOF PS&D will
   perform all AVDO duties.
   6.6.4. Units will use CAF/MAF supplement to AFI 21-101 and CAFI 21-165 to develop
   weekly schedules and for FSE/MSE reporting.
   6.6.5. When deploying or deployed to the CENTAF AOR, units in addition to CAFI 21-165
   guidance will also follow AFI 21-101_USCENTAFSUP1 pre-deployment and deployment
   guidance.
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                         51


                                          Chapter 7

                 FLYING SCHEDULING REPORTING PROCEDURES

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides instructions on flying scheduling reporting procedures.
The flying schedule must be loaded in IMDS/MIS to track scheduling and deviation data. Once
loaded, the IMDS Daily Mission Schedule background report (IMDS screen 361) or proposed
maintenance plan background report (IMDS screen 361) provides detailed base-level retrieval of
flying and maintenance schedule retrieved from IMDS. IMDS/MIS will also be used to provide
higher headquarters reporting of aircraft utilization.
7.2. Responsibilities:
   7.2.1. The MXG/CC will ensure procedures are established to verify the accuracy of all
   scheduling and deviation data.
   7.2.2. MOF PS&D section will publish the weekly flying schedule IAW Chapter 3 of this
   publication on AF Forms 2400 series or computer generated products. The MOF PS&D will
   load the weekly flying schedule into IMDS/MIS by 1600L Friday (exception: 2 hours after
   the squadrons last landing during printed wing night flying weeks) for the following week
   using the procedures in AFCSM 21-565V2. Refer to paragraph 4.5.1 of this instruction for
   daily tail number scheduling procedures.
   7.2.3. The MOC will review the on-line IMDS debriefed sortie recap, screen 174, and the
   IMDS background products daily Accomplishment Utilization Report (Screen 362),
   Deviation Detail Listing (Screen 181), Deviation Summary Inquiry (Screen 173) and
   Uncompleted Operational Events (Screen 719), daily to ensure accuracy of deviation
   reporting. The MOC will also review Uncompleted Operational Events, IMDS screen 719,
   daily to ensure uncompleted sortie lines are deleted using Operational Events Delete IMDS
   screen 883, if necessary after coordination with debrief section and MOF PS&D. The MOC
   will record additions, cancellations before crew show, late and early take-offs and landings,
   and Tail Swaps in IMDS as deviations occur.
       7.2.3.1. The debrief section will record aborts and in-flight emergency incidents in
       IMDS during the IMDS automated debriefing process. After a primary aircraft ground
       aborts and is replaced by a spare, debrief sections will ensure that the deviation code is
       recorded as a Spare deviation with the appropriate cause code {SP/GAA (GAB, GAC)}
       against the original aircraft; debrief sections will not record the deviation as a Ground
       Abort {GA/GAA (GAB, GAC)} against the original aircraft that was replaced by a spare.
       Analysis will count SP/GAA (GAB, GAC) as one ground abort deviation but will not
       count this against FSE (see paragraphs 4.3.2.5 and 4.3.4). For all other spare and ground
       abort deviations procedures debrief will follow procedures in paragraph 4.3 Weapons
       systems not utilizing IMDS will use the applicable MIS to make appropriate inputs and to
       retrieve required data.
       7.2.3.2. The MOC will coordinate with both the flying squadron and AMU on all
       changes and deviations to the daily flying schedule to assist in determining correct
       debriefing status codes. The MOC will provide sortie sequence numbers and sortie
       numbers to the squadron/AMU for all additions and cross-country sorties. Sortie
       numbers assigned to a specific tail number must be in sequential order (for example sortie
 52                                          CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


       number 101 must be used on a specific tail number before sortie number 102). Unique
       sortie sequence numbers will be developed for deployed sorties.
    7.2.4. The following instructions apply to IMDS screen 474, Cause Code Table; 342,
    Operational Event Cancellation; 343, Operational Event Tail Number Swap/Tail Number
    Spare; and 350, Deviation, Start/Stop/Correction Abort/Delete. The Ground Deviation Code
    block cannot be blank. Enter one of the following codes or one of the ground deviation
    codes in AFCSM 21-565V2:

N           Non-chargeable Deviation for FSE, see paragraph 4.11

    7.2.6. Cause Code. Enter one of the following codes to indicate the reason for a deviation or
    the agency, which caused a deviation. These codes must be entered into the IMDS Cause
    Code table as outlined in AFCSM 21-565V2. The maintenance indicator block is left blank
    when loading the following Cause Codes. For maintenance ground aborts do not use cause

                                  ATTRITION AND SPARES

8.1. Attrition. Attrition factors represent historical percentage of scheduled sorties lost to
causes outside unit control. Maintenance and Operations schedulers add attrition sorties to
monthly contracts to ensure mission goals are met. Units may make a conscious decision, with
HQ ACC/A4QJ approval, to use different attrition factors from statistical attrition rates
calculated by MMA.
   8.1.1. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for unit capability shortfalls, they are added to the
   contract to mitigate scheduling turbulence to facilitate that unit’s mission goals are met.
   Attrition sorties are planned for based on historical sortie losses captured and measured by
   MMA. The monthly flying and maintenance plan will clearly identify attrition sorties for
   planning purposes and can be applied to the contract sorties daily, weekly or monthly to
   project scheduled sortie requirements. It is important to maintain consistency in application
   to minimize fluctuations in required sorties. If attrition is less or more than planned,
   adjustments to the weekly flying and maintenance schedule will be made to prevent over-
   extending maintenance or exceeding the unit’s contract. A sortie lost will normally be flown
   in the same month the loss occurred. If at the end of a quarter combined losses exceed
   attrition figures, the OG and MXG/CCs will negotiate a resolution to the shortfall.
   8.1.2. The factors used to compute attrition will be MXx, OPx, SUx, WXx, ATx, SYx, OTx,
   EXH, EXL, and HQx cancels. Include unspared ground aborts when computing Mx cancels.
   Attrition and spare factors will be computed for and applied to each flying squadron.
   Monthly statistical attrition anomalies should be identified, documented and factored out of
   attrition calculations if necessary. MMA will compute attrition factors monthly for each
   OS/AMU and provide the results to MOF PS&D and OSS Current Operations. During the
   annual “Proposed FHP”, MMA will provide attrition factors by month for the entire next
   fiscal year.
Note: Attrition and spare factors need not be developed for test and evaluation (CB) possession
identifier coded aircraft.
8.2. Attrition Factor Application:
   8.2.1. Attrition computation is based on unit historical data from previous similar flying
   months. For example, when computing attrition for Jan 12, use historical data for Jan 11, Jan
   10, Jan 09, Jan 08, etc. Use minimum of 4 years of historical data ensuring seasonal
   variations are considered to determine a basis for attrition. When computing attrition, use the
   total sorties lost in a particular category. Do not use the difference between the sorties lost
   and those sorties added to make up for the losses. The formula for computing the attrition
   factor is Historical Sorties Lost divided by Historical Sorties Scheduled.

OT Cancels                               .01
AT Cancels:                              .01
SY Cancels:                              .01
EXH Cancels:                             .00
EXL Cancels:                             .01
HQ Cancels:                              .01
Cancels attrition factor:                .09
WX Cancels:                              .03
Total attrition factor:                  .12
Overall attrition factor is .12 or 12%

Table 8.2. Sample Application of Total Attrition Factor:
Sorties Required                         1000
Subtract attrition factor from 1:        (1-.12) =.88
Divide                                   1000 by .88
Required sorties to schedule 1,136.36, round up to 1137.
Based on historical attrition of .12%, the unit can expect to lose 137 sorties to meet the required
1000 sorties.

8.3. Prorated Weather Attrition:
    8.3.1. Computation. Weather attrition sorties will only be used when sorties are lost because
    of weather. Weather attrition sorties will not be carried over into another month. Using the
    weather attrition factor, compute the number of anticipated sortie losses for weather. Divide
    the number of weather losses by the O&M days. This will determine the prorated weather
    attrition.

Table 8.3. Sample Application of Prorated Weather Attrition Factor:
Sorties Required                                        500
Subtract the weather attrition factor from 1            (1-.03) =.97
Divide 500 by .97                                       500/.97
Equals Required Sorties to Schedule                     516
Minus Sorties Required                                  500
Expected Weather Losses                                 16
 56                                           CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014


Divide 16 by O&M Days (20 for this exercise)          16/20
Expected Sortie Losses per O&M Day            .75
A unit would expect.75 sorties lost each O&M day in the month for weather. Thus, a total of 16
sortie losses (.75 sorties x 20 O&M days) would be expected for that month. Whenever weather
losses exceed the total projected weather losses (number of O&M days to date x.75, round up to
the next whole number), a unit may add sorties not to exceed the difference between the sorties
lost due to weather and the total projected weather losses. For example on the 11th O&M day of
the month, a unit lost a total of 15 sorties to-date due to weather. The expected prorated weather
sorties lost to-date is 9 (1.55 .75 times 11 equal 8.25, round up). The unit also added 2 weather
sorties earlier in the month. The unit could add up to 4 sorties (15 sorties lost to date due to
weather minus 9 prorated losses minus 2 weather adds equals 4 weather adds available).

8.4. Spares. The spare requirements will not exceed 20 percent (30 percent for training units
owning TF coded aircraft) of aircraft committed to the flying schedule, rounded up to the next
whole aircraft. Note: During Planned Sortie Surges the MXG/CC determines the amount of
spares that will be committed. However, leadership must consider health of the fleet when
authorizing scheduled spares above 40 percent.
Note: Units should be cognizant of their historical break rates and spare constraints when
scheduling surges. Spares can be quickly used during surges and once spares are exhausted the
capability to meet surge goals is severely limited.
   8.4.1. MMA computes annual spare aircraft requirements by month, using historical aircraft
   first sortie logistics losses and provides this information to the MOF PS&D for use in
   computing spare aircraft requirements. Spare computation is based on unit historical data
   from previous similar flying months. For example, when computing spares for Jan 06, use
   historical data for Jan 05, Jan 04, Jan 03, Jan 02, Jan 01, etc. Use a minimum of 4 years
   historical data to ensure seasonal variations are included to determine a basis. The formula
   for computing spare factors is Historical First Sortie Deletions/Cancellation divided by
   historical first sorties scheduled.
       8.4.1.1. A first sortie is defined as a sortie flown by an aircraft that has not previously
       flown for the day (0001-2400 flying period). For example, if 8 aircraft are committed to
       the schedule and there are 14 total sorties scheduled, the first 8 sortie line numbers (i.e.,
       101-108) should reflect all 8 committed aircraft tail numbers before they are re-scheduled
       (turned) against the last 6 (i.e., 109-114). This would be reflected as an 8 x 6 and will not
       be reflected as a 6 x 8 because of scheduled take-off times. Additionally lines are listed
       in sequential order with take-off times that reflect this order.
           8.4.1.1.1. Operations may define first sorties or turns by mission profile, take-off
           times, but for the purposes of this instruction the sortie turn pattern is defined against
           initial aircraft flown and scheduled turns of the same or a portion of the same aircraft.

1st Sortie Ground Aborts                             .05
Spare factor                                         .18 or 18%
A sample figure of 12 first sorties is used in the following computation:
Spare aircraft required equals 1st sorties scheduled times the spare factor and rounded up to the
next whole number.
12 x .18 = 2.16       Spares Required is 3

   8.4.2. The computed spare requirement may be adjusted to compensate for multiple
   configurations and syllabus constraints. When additional spares are added for multiple
   configurations, units will not exceed one spare per configuration.
       8.4.2.1. Additional spares are authorized to support higher headquarters taskings and
       special missions (if required by the tasking).
       8.4.2.2. At least one spare aircraft is authorized per MDS for each flying day.
       8.4.2.3. Unmanned Aerial Systems training missions are authorized an additional spare
       to support increased aircrew training requirements due to crew size ratio.

Terms
Active Associate—ARC/ANG component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon
system or systems; shares with one or more AD units.
Addition—An increase in sorties or aircraft added to the printed weekly flying schedule.
Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission.
Air Deviation Code—A deviation from the scheduled sortie flight plan occurring after aircraft
take-off.
Alert Sorties—Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise, active air or
practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule will be
considered sorties scheduled and flown as scheduled.
Attrition—Losses expected based on historical data. Sorties added by maintenance scheduling
to a unit's sortie contract to allow for expected losses due to maintenance, operations, supply, air
traffic control, sympathy, HHQ, other cancels, and weather cancels as computed IAW
Attachment 2. If attrition is less or more than planned, adjustments to the schedule should be
made to prevent overextending maintenance and/or to stay within the unit's sortie flying hour
program. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are additive to the
contract to ensure mission goals are met. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the week/month
the loss occurred. If at the end of a quarter, losses exceed attrition figures, the OG/MXG CCs
will come to an agreement on how the shortfall will be corrected.
Attrition Reserve—Reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. Attrition reserve aircraft are those aircraft required
to replace primary aircraft inventory losses in a given year projected over the life span of the
weapons system. These aircraft are distributed to operational and training units to evenly spread
life cycle fatigue and ensure all aircraft receive periodic systems upgrades and modifications.
Assigned attrition reserves are occasionally realigned to maintain fleet balance.

Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft above the PMAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections and repair without reduction of aircraft
available for operational missions.
Cancellation—An aircraft or sortie that is removed from the printed schedule for any reason.
Change—A recompilation of a unit's month-by-month flying hour plan, this is required when
the unit's flying hour allocation changes.
Chargeable Aircraft (CHRG ACFT)—The number of aircraft against which units should build
their flying programs and against which the UTE will be measured. Chargeable aircraft will
equal PAA, but in cases where the number of possessed aircraft is forecast to be significantly
different than PAA, HQ ACC/A3/A4 and the C2ISR Agency will assign a chargeable aircraft
number.
Classic Associate— AD component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon system or
systems; shares with one or more ARC/ANG units.
Combat Sortie Generation—A process by which aircraft are generated in a minimum time,
during peacetime or wartime, through concurrent operations that may include refueling,
munitions loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and -6 inspection and other servicing
requirements. These exercises test a wing’s ability to meet current war plans and contingency
operations.
Continuation Sortie—A scheduled sortie containing scheduled operation stops. When a crew
completes their training/mission and performs an operation stop, the engines/APU remains
running and maintenance does not service the aircraft. The aircraft can subsequently be
launched without the participation of maintenance personnel, except for a fire/safety observer.
The prime purpose is to on/off load crew members. EXCEPTION: For safety, C-130 aircraft,
engines may be shut down to upload/download personnel. Note: N/A to fighter and attack
aircraft.
Crew Ready—An aircraft that has been properly inspected, fueled, required weapons loaded,
necessary maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight
of the day) and the tail number passed to operations. Note: Units will develop and publish
specific crew ready times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the OG/CC and MXG/CC.
Crew Show—The time that the aircrew arrives at the aircraft.
Deployed Sorties—Sorties launched away from home base or isolated areas at home base, with
parent-unit maintenance provided. For the purpose of this instruction deployed sorties are
considered home station sorties.
Daily Maintenance Production Meeting—Meeting required by AFI 21-101 and CAF Sup to
review the previous day’s accomplishments, verify aircraft and equipment utilization and
scheduled maintenance requirements for the current and next day, establish work priorities, and
coordinate schedule changes.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly flying schedule.
Early Landing—Scheduled sorties landing more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled landing
time. Do not record early landing deviations for hot pit turn sorties launched more than 15
CAFI21-165_552ACWSUP_I 8 JANUARY 2014                                                           65


minutes prior to the scheduled take-off time. Early landing deviations are not included in FSE
calculations.
Early Take-off—Scheduled sorties launched more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off.
Note: Do not record early take-off deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization's
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities. Exercises are a planned sortie
surge, a combat sortie generation, or an unscheduled tasking. Operational readiness inspections
and wing directed operational readiness evaluations are combat sortie generations.
Extended Sortie—Scheduled sorties that land more than 15 minutes past the scheduled landing
time. If the extended sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or deletion
against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not originate on time,
record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the original delay.
External Customer—Outside the control of the operational wing, a user of aircraft sorties that
dictates, either partially or wholly, flying schedule execution (e.g., Joint Airborne Air
Transportability Training (JA/ATT) users, Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) users or
channel mission users.
Ferry Sortie—Those sorties flown to transfer an aircraft to or from a maintenance facility or to a
new assignment, including inter-command, inter-unit transfers.
Flown as Scheduled Sortie—A sortie flown by a specific aircraft on the date and time indicated
on the printed weekly schedule, and those aircraft that are defined as "flown as scheduled"
elsewhere in this instruction.
Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE) Rate—The FSE rate is the percentage of sorties flown
as scheduled. This rate determines how efficiently the planned/printed flying schedule was
executed. It also indicates unit turmoil caused by flying schedule deviations.
FSE Maintenance/Operations (MX/OPS) Deviation Rate—The number of maintenance and
operations deviations divided by adjusted sorties scheduled multiplied by 100. Reflects the
number of deviations within unit control. The MX/OPS deviation rate is a subset of FSE. Only
count the MX/OPS deviations used to compute the FSE rate.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc… The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off.
Higher Headquarters—A controlling agency above wing level.
Home Station Sortie—Sorties launched from the home base or deployed locations where parent
unit maintenance is provided.
Hot Pit Turn—Refueling aircraft with engines running between sorties at a designated location
with approved equipment IAW T.O. 00-25-172. Hot pit refueling provides minimum aircraft
turnaround time and reduces fueling personnel and equipment support requirements.

Immediate Response Aircraft—Mission capable aircraft postured to meet short-notice taskings
which allow flexibility in meeting required Designed Operational Capability (DOC) timing.
In-Flight Emergency (IFE)—An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or emergency that
results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. (Not a deviation, but will be recorded IAW
Chapter 6.).
Tail Swap—Tail number swaps made to the daily flying schedule IAW paragraph 4.3.2.6.
Aircraft tail swaps are swaps between printed aircraft on the same day, between printed aircraft
and spare aircraft on the same day or between printed aircraft and aircraft that have previously
flown that day (cross country return, OCF, FCF, etc.) The term is synonymous with the
previously used term “Interchange.”
Late Landing—Aircraft landing 15 minutes past its scheduled landing time. Does not apply to
continuation sorties. If the sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or
cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not
originate on time, record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the
original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE calculations.
Late Take-off—Scheduled sortie launched more than 15 minutes after scheduled take-off time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness—A measurement used to determine what percent of the
scheduled maintenance actions were actually completed as scheduled in the weekly flying
schedule.
Mission, Design, and Series (MDS)—An acronym for aircraft mission, design, and series. For
example: F015C, etc.
Off-Station Sorties—Sorties flown away from home base (cross-country) and parent unit
maintenance is not provided. This includes aircraft that divert or break off-station and parent
unit maintenance is sent to repair and launch the aircraft. Note: Off-station sorties are
considered flown as scheduled. Deviations incurred are not used in scheduling effectiveness or
abort rate computations.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Operations and Maintenance Day (O&M)—Monday through Friday, not including federal
holidays or command directed family days.
Pen-and-Ink Changes—Changes made to next week's flying schedule on AF Form 2407 after
the WG/CC has signed the schedule and NLT 1600 hours local Friday. Exception: Pen-and-Ink
changes are allowed 2 hours after the squadron's last landing during printed wing night
flying weeks.
Planned Sortie Surge—A scheduling option where a unit may plan to produce sorties at a
higher than normal rate. To qualify as a surge, the number of planned sorties will exceed the
normal daily sortie rate by at least 50 percent. This will be based on the monthly daily sortie rate
as determined by Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF) PS&D.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft under a wing commander's operational control and responsibility

Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—-Aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft
authorization (includes PDAI, PMAI, POAI, PTAI). PMAI will not change except when
approved by HQ USAF.
Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI)—Formerly CB or Test. Aircraft
assigned primarily for the test of the aircraft or its components for purposes of research,
development, test and evaluation, operational test and evaluation, or support for testing
programs.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Formerly CC/CA PAA Coded Aircraft. Aircraft
assigned to a unit for performance of its wartime mission.
Primary Other Aircraft Inventory (POAI)—Formerly ZA, ZB. Aircraft required for special
missions not elsewhere classified.
Primary Training Aircraft Inventory (PTAI)—-Formerly TF. Aircraft required primarily for
technical and specialized training for crew personnel or leading to aircrew qualification.
Program Element (PE)—-The PE is the smallest unit of military output controlled at the DOD
level. It is identified by a six-digit alphanumeric program element code (PEC). The sixth
character, “F", identifies the PE with the Air Force.
Program Element Code (PEC)—The six digit alphanumeric code used to identify the Program
Element (see definition above).
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)—Continuation training regulated under the AFI 11-2 MDS
specific series for training of aircrews assigned to units primarily flying fighter, bomber, and
LDHD PMAI. The ACC flying hour program centers around unit RAP tasking orders and the
associated flying hours derived using the flying hour program models.
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying schedule
and confirmed on the daily flying schedule. Incentive flights are considered scheduled sorties
and published in the weekly schedule. Functional Check Flights and Operational Check Flights
are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the weekly schedule.
Sortie—A sortie begins when an aircraft becomes airborne or takes off vertically from rest at
any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns to the surface except
for continuation sorties.
Sortie Contract—A written agreement between operations and maintenance and approved by
the WG/CC. It specifies the number of sorties and hours to be flown.
Spare Aircraft—An aircraft specifically designated on the flying schedule to replace aircraft
that cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft that have been canceled, aborted, flown an
earlier sortie, scheduled in a later sortie, or an aircraft that has been released after FCF/OCF. Do
not count "Printed Spares" used as deviations when computing FSE.
Spare Ground Abort—-Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne, but is replaced by a spare that meets the mission requirement. Spare ground
aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC). The difference between a ground
abort and a spare ground abort is the scheduled line is accomplished, where the ground abort is

not. A spare ground abort is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as late take-off.
Spare ground aborts do not count towards FSE.
Total Active Inventory (TAI)—Aircraft assigned to operating forces for mission, training, test,
or maintenance functions (includes primary aircraft inventory, backup aircraft inventory,
attrition, and reconstitution reserve).
Training Goal—-The unit's completion of a formal course training syllabus and/or phase of
instruction (TF coded units only).
Unscheduled Tasking—Tasking in which initial notification occurs after publication of the
weekly schedule.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—A planned period when guard or reserve personnel
participate in training duty, instruction, or test alert. For the purposes of this instruction, one
UTA is considered a single Saturday through Sunday weekend. This is an authorized and
scheduled training assembly lasting at a minimum of 4 hours. This assembly is mandatory for all
troop program unit members. (AR 135-91).
Regularly scheduled unit training assembly (RSUTA)—-Training time treated as a UTA or
MUTA for which pay and retirement point credit are authorized. (AR 140-1).
UTE Remaining—A measurement of the UTE required to accomplish a unit's remaining flying
hours with assigned aircraft over the remaining months of the fiscal year.
Utilization Rate (UTE)—For ACC aircraft, the UTE is expressed in the number of sorties flown
per aircraft per month.
Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule—The schedule, agreed to by operations and
maintenance, and signed by the OG/MXG/WG/CCs, to support the unit's flying and maintenance
requirements. In this publication it is referred to as the "flying schedule."
