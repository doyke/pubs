SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revision
includes renaming the product number from LUKEAFBI 23-301 to LUKEAFBI 90-301.
Updates formatting as well.
1. Introduction. Luke AFB and all its geographically separated units consume significant
amounts of energy in support of the national defense policy. Restrictive budgets and potential
pollution of the environment requires Luke AFB to establish policies for responsible
management, control, metering, and use of energy.

2. Goals. The overall goal of the Luke AFB energy management program is to comply with
federally mandated energy reduction goals while maintaining working environments conductive
to high productivity. The federal and Air Force mandated goals that Luke AFB must comply
with are:
     2.1. Reduce facility energy intensity 3% per year relative to a FY03 baseline.
     2.2. Reduce potable water intensity 2% per year relative to a FY07 baseline.
     2.3. Reduce industrial, landscaping and agricultural water consumption 2% per year relative
     to a FY10 baseline.
     2.4. Increase renewable energy use to 25% by 2025.
     2.5. Install advanced utility meters by 2016 in facilities where economically feasible.
     2.6. For all new construction and renovations over $2.5M, provide solar generated hot water
     for 30% of domestic hot water requirement.
     2.7. Conduct energy audits every 4 years to meet federal energy requirements.
     2.8. Conduct annual Energy Awareness Month; for Luke AFB this will be observed in the
     month of April.
     2.9. Conduct annual energy security review to determine the installations vulnerability to
     energy interruptions. This review will be completed in February each year. The 56 FW/XP
     will lead a team composed of representatives from 56 FW/AT, 56 RMO, 56 FW/SE, 56
     OSS/OSAA, 56 MXG/MOS, 56 CES/CEA, 56 CES/CEO, 56 CES/CEP, 56 CES/CEX, 56
     CES/CEF, 56 SFS/S3, 56 CS/SCX, 56 AMS/SGP, 944 CES/CEO and 56 LRS/LGRF.
     2.10. For all new construction and renovations over $2.5M, ensure sustainable designs and
     construction meet LEED Silver standards.
     2.11. Reduce fossil fuels usage in new facilities to eliminate consumption by 2030.
     2.12. Reduce motor vehicle petroleum consumption 2% per year relative to a FY05 baseline.
     2.13. Increase the purchase of alternative fuel, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles when
     commercially available.
     2.14. Increase alternative fuel consumption by at least 10% annually.

     3.4. Facility Managers (FM).
        3.4.1. Will work with their respective commanders, utilize AFI 90-1701, and consult
        with the 56 CES/CEAO energy optimization staff to implement energy conservation
        measures in their assigned facilities.
        3.4.2. Must attend the annual Facility Manager Training session.
        3.4.3. Must provide 56 CES/CEOI twice per year (March and October) with an updated
        occupancy schedule for each assigned facility.
        3.4.4. Must encourage and inform employees of the following standards:
            3.4.4.1. Turn off and/or unplug lights, office equipment, appliances and computer
            equipment (such as monitors, printers, scanners, etc.) during unoccupied hours.

            where approved.
            3.4.4.5. Report all water leaks, running toilets/faucets/showers immediately to the 56
            CES service desk at 896-7083, and following up to ensure the problem is resolved.
            3.4.4.6. Identify personally owned refrigerators, microwaves, televisions, extra
            lighting sources and other appliances and electronic equipment deemed energy
            excessive. These appliances are unauthorized without an approved waiver signed by

            Energy Star certified.
            3.4.4.7. Create a facility energy reduction plan to be posted in each facility.
4. Energy Conservation Policy.
     4.1. Facility temperature policy: Commanders will ensure their facilities comply with the
     following temperature set-points. 56 CES/CEO will use the Environmental Management
     Control System (EMCS) to remotely monitor and control temperature set-points in equipped
     buildings.
        4.1.1. The temperature range for occupied administrative space (e.g., office buildings);
        cooling is 78°F, heating is 68°F.
        4.1.2. The minimum temperature for unoccupied space (e.g., maintenance areas, storage
        areas); cooling is 84°F, heating is 55°F.
        4.1.3. Waivers to the temperature set-points must be approved by the EMSG chair. AFI,
        technical order, or other official guidance will exempt units from having to request
        EMSG waiver. For example, AFMAN 32-1094 requires lower temperatures for PMEL
        calibration lab/testing areas. Facilities without this guidance will be required to obtain
        annual waivers, unless 56 CES can determine the issue is caused by system problems. 56
        CES/CEA will maintain a list of these facilities and ensure projects are submitted to fix
        the situation. Waivers will have to be re-justified annually.
LUKEAFBI90-301 5 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 5


       4.1.4. Requests will be routed through the facility manager. All facility waivers must be
       signed by the requesting commander and submitted to the 56 CES/CC for review at the
       EMSG.
       4.1.5. All waiver requests shall include supporting documentation (AFI, medical,
       technical specifications, etc). 56 CES/CEAO will report the increased utility cost and
       energy consumption to the EMSG.
   4.2. Lighting.
       4.2.1. Interior Lighting.
            4.2.1.1. The interior lighting levels specified in Table 4.1. represent the range for
            Luke AFB work areas. It should be understood that these levels are guidelines
            established by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and represent the average
            light levels within the occupied space. When designing a modification to or new
            installation of lighting, the listed minimum level shall be considered in the design
            review process.
