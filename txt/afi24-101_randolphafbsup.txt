                             PASSENGER ANTI-HIJACKING BRIEF

Introduction. Good morning or afternoon, my name is XXXX and I will be giving you an anti-
hijacking briefing. Commanders at all levels have been tasked to ensure preventative measures
are taken to minimize access to aircraft by potential hijackers. For this reason, all passengers
boarding DoD military aircraft are briefed on “what is considered a federal crime and what are
considered prohibited items aboard an aircraft.”

1. First of all, it is a federal crime to:

   a. Carry concealed weapons aboard an aircraft.

   b. Interfere with flight crews (including flight attendants).

   c. Transport explosives aboard aircraft.

   d. Attempt to seize or actually seize aircraft by threats, force, or violence.

   e. Possess or use narcotic drugs, including marijuana, aboard the aircraft.

   f. Convey false information concerning the above criminal acts.

2. Your prohibited items include, but are not limited to, the following:

   a. Black powder, blasting caps, detonating fuses, dynamite, explosive projectiles, flares,
unauthorized ammunition, or any other explosives. Included are visible refillable fuel and
butane lighters.

   b. All caustic or corrosive materials must be transported IAW provisions of TM 38-250, AFR
71-4, CFR 49, and the International Air Transport Association’s dangerous goods regulations.

   c. Personal knives, scissors, or any objects with blades over 3" may not be carried in the
passenger compartment of the aircraft. Planeload commanders will secure all oversize knives
before boarding the aircraft.

3. Air Force policy is to prevent entry of unauthorized weapons or explosives into the defense
transportation system. Personnel involved in all phases of passenger processing operations must
be keenly aware of any unusual conduct of persons in the processing facility, and alert to the
possibility of concealed explosive devices or weapons. Report unattended baggage found in the
facility to security forces. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the anti-hijacking of DoD
military or military contractor aircraft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the
aircraft.
