1. Purpose of Training Evaluation. Training evaluation provides the basis for determining the
quality of training. Evaluations are conducted as a part of the Instructional System Development
process to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the training program. Refer to AFI 36-
2201, AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development, and AFH 36-2235, Volume 9,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems: Application to Technical Training, for
additional guidance.
2. Training Evaluation Program (TEP):
     2.1. Each training group will establish a TEP to provide a medium for collecting relevant
     course data that can be used to identify training improvement opportunities. The TEP will
     include, as a minimum, internal feedback (paragraph 3) and external feedback (paragraph 4).
     Technical training group TEPs will include a TA program (paragraph 6). BMT TEP will
     include a standardization and evaluation program instead of a TA program. The TEP will
     identify and track metrics (paragraph 7) which show the quality of training support provided
AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010                                                                  5


   and effectiveness of training methodology. Note: Due to unique mission requirements, the
   517 TRG is only required to establish procedures for a limited TA Program in a supplement
   to this instruction. The AU Eaker Center is exempt from the TA Program requirement.
   2.2. Where installed and operational, use the Technical Training Management System
   (TTMS) for all unclassified formal technical and BMT training related functions to include
   course development and delivery, instructor and student management, resource management,
   and course evaluation. For courses containing classified information, enter all unclassified
   course information necessary to complete adequate student accounting when developing
   courses in the TTMS course development software. Use automated products produced by
   TTMS, if available. Forms generated electronically by these systems may be used in lieu of
   prescribed forms.
3. Internal Feedback. Internal feedback is a self-evaluation to determine if training
accomplishes the instructional objectives effectively. It helps commanders, supervisors, and
instructors improve course and unit support; identifies outstanding instructors, facilities, and
equipment; and allows students to attain a sense of participation and responsibility for improving
training programs.
   3.1. Program Requirements. Each training group will establish an internal feedback
   program. The program will include, as a minimum, such areas as student feedback,
   measurement review, elimination and washback trend analysis, and instructional review.
   AETCI 36-2203, Technical and Basic Military Training Development, contains minimum
   requirements for measurement and instructional review. AETCI 36-2215, Technical and
   Basic Military Training Administration, contains minimum requirements for elimination and
   washback trend analysis.
   3.2. Student Feedback. Each training group will establish a student feedback program. At
   a minimum, each training squadron and faculty development flight (or equivalent unit) will
   participate in the program. The program is intended to obtain constructive comments on
   training, training environment, and base support. To standardize the collection of end-of-
   course (EOC) feedback for resident courses to include training detachments, technical
   training groups will use the TTMS EOC, if available, or the sample survey at Attachment 2.
   (See TTMS EOC Handbook for additional system procedures.) Training groups may modify
   the survey at Attachment 2 to meet their individual needs (for example, add questions).
   However, to standardize data collection, the survey must contain (as a minimum) the same
   questions with the supporting rating scale in Attachment 2. AETC Form 736, Student
   Feedback, may also be used to obtain student feedback. Note: Courses using motivational
   training (MT) must document the use of MT in the Remarks section of the AETC Form 449,
   Course Chart. Technical training courses using MT will add the following question to
   resident technical training EOC student feedback surveys for these courses: Did
   motivational training used in the course improve your motivation? BMT will add the
   following two questions for MT to the BMT EOC: Did your MTI(s) use push-ups, flutter
   kicks, or four count squat thrusts as motivation? and Did the motivation exercises help
   you to become more motivated or help to correct my deficiencies? (AETC Form 449 is
   prescribed in AETCI 36-2203. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
6                                                           AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010


       3.2.1. Commanders will appoint student feedback monitors, in writing, to manage the
       program. Training groups will establish procedures for maintaining, tracking, and
       follow-up of student feedback to ensure responses are timely and appropriate. Note:
       Each training group serviced by a HQ AFRC/A1K liaison office must also include
       procedures for forwarding student feedback received pertaining to their liaison offices.
       As a minimum, when AETC Forms 736 are submitted by students attending AETC
       technical training courses regarding quality of service received by HQ AFRC/A1K
       liaison offices, the training group will forward the forms to HQ AFRC/A1K for review
       and necessary action. The forms can be mailed to HQ AFRC/A1K, 155 2d Street, Robins
       AFB GA 31098-1635, or faxed to Defense Switching Network (DSN) 497-0370.
       3.2.2. Each course will include a briefing on the student feedback program as part of the
       orientation unit and allow time in each class prior to graduation, for students to
       participate in a course critique, as required in AETCI 36-2203. Encourage all students to
       submit feedback on any aspect of training at any time to identify opportunities for
       training or support improvement.            Feedback monitors will ensure replies to
       students/classes are provided when requested. When possible, use EOC feedback to
       summarize recommendations from graduating students.
    3.3. Type 6 Student Feedback. To standardize the collection of EOC student feedback for
    Type 6 distance learning (DL) courses, training groups will use the sample survey at
    Attachment 3. Training groups may modify the survey at Attachment 3 to meet their
    individual needs (for example, add questions, use paper or electronic format). However, to
    standardize data collection, the survey must contain (as a minimum) the same questions with
    the supporting rating scale in Attachment 3. Type 6 courses may use any available method
    (on-line, electronic, and paper) to collect EOC student feedback data. For web-based Type 6
    surveys, training groups will include the web site in Type 6 course materials and courseware.
       3.3.1. Training groups will establish procedures for maintaining, tracking, and follow-up
       of Type 6 student feedback to ensure responses are timely and appropriate. As a
       minimum, forward any specific questions rated disagree or strongly disagree to the
       appropriate training manager. Process any request for a response the same as a customer
       service information process (CSIP) inquiry.
       3.3.2. Training groups will prepare a semi-annual report on Type 6 student feedback,
       using the report format at Attachment 4. (Note: If there are several Type 6 course
       reports, a cover memo signed by the training group commander will suffice in lieu of the
       commander signing every individual report.) TRGs will post the report to the AETC
       Technical       and       Basic     Military     Training      Evaluation       CoP       at
       https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AE-ED-00-53
       not later than 15 August for the period of January through June and 15 February for the
       period July through December and notify HQ AETC/A3T, A3PV, and 2 AF/TTOC it is
       available for review. Reports must include data collected on the 25 mandatory questions
       and on any additional questions the group may have added to the feedback survey.
       Report data by course and include, as a minimum, the number of graduates in the
       reporting period, the number of graduates responding, the number of questions with an
       overall rating of less than 90 percent, a summary of findings with corrective actions taken
       or planned, and an attachment with the percentage of graduates who responded to each
       possible response to the questions. EXCEPTION: Questions 11 through 15 are exempt
AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010                                                                 7


       from the 90 percent rule because AETC schoolhouses have no direct control over these
       items for units outside of AETC. However, data, comments, and any applicable
       corrective actions must be annotated. (Refer to AFI 36-2201, Attachment 17, for Type 6
       DL POC responsibilities to follow-up and provide status of discrepancies falling under
       receive site’s purview.) Note: This report is exempt from the Reports Control Symbol
       (RCS) requirements according to AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports
       Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force
       Information Collections, paragraph 2.11.12.
       3.3.3. HQ 2 AF/TTOC will monitor Type 6 DL student feedback reports for trends and
       assist training groups in resolving issues, as necessary. 2 AF/TTOC will ensure trends
       outside 2 AF’s span of control are forwarded to the HQ AETC/A3T training pipeline
       manager (TPM) for assistance in resolving, with a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/A3PV.
4. External Feedback. External feedback provides an indication of the graduate’s ability to
perform tasks required in the career field. In addition, external feedback may indicate the need
to revise training standards or courses to improve training quality, add technology, and/or
identify skills and knowledge where training might be reduced or increased. All training
standard changes are made according to AFI 36-2201 and AETCI 36-2203.
   4.1. Feedback Procedures. Each training group will establish an external feedback
   program. Areas such as occupational analysis reports (OAR), subject-matter expert (SME)
   feedback, field interviews (FI), CSIP, Graduate Assessment Surveys (GAS), field evaluation
   questionnaires (FEQ), and field evaluation questionnaire summaries (FEQS) should be used
   as appropriate. Note: Due to unique mission requirements, IAAFA and BMT are waived
   from using OARs, CSIP, GASs, FEQs, and FEQSs. Instead, IAAFA and BMT will establish
   procedures for an external evaluation program in a supplement to this instruction. The BMT
   program will include the Airman Performance Survey (APS). Upon request from
   AETC/A3PV, training groups will provide information for post graduate surveys (GAS,
   FEQ, etc.) to submit a request required to obtain a survey control number (SCN) IAW AFI
   38-501, Air Force Survey Program. Information requested normally consists of a list of
   projected courses with applicable target survey population for a specific time period.
   4.2. Occupational Analysis Reports (OAR). AETCI 36-2601, Occupational Analysis
   Program, contains policy on OARs. Review OARs to compare the current career field
   education and training plan (CFETP) or course training standard (CTS) with feedback from
   the field. Feedback from SMEs who attend utilization and training workshops (U&TW) and
   results of the specialty knowledge test/career development course (SKT/CDC) compatibility
   critique helps ensure course content is current.
   4.3. Field Interview (FI). FIs provide data on both currency and effectiveness of courses.
   When planning onsite visits, evaluators/interviewers should contact the base education and
   training manager at each selected installation to coordinate plans for the FIs. Interviews
   should not conflict with planned inspections and exercises at onsite locations.
   Evaluators/interviewers should interview course training personnel in the career fields being
   evaluated prior to conducting FIs to gain an understanding of any existing or unique career
   field peculiarities. Samples of FI guides (for supervisors and graduates) are at Attachment 5.
   Any specific request for information or clarification contained on a FI response that cannot
8                                                          AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010


    be immediately answered by the interviewer will be processed the same as a CSIP inquiry or
    if necessary, within 5 workdays after return from TDY.
       4.3.1. Third party interviews, such as those by education and training managers, course
       personnel, or interviews conducted by any other technologically advanced means of
       direct communication may also be used. A copy of the FI guides should be available for
       use in third party interviews and feedback obtained should be sent to the training group
       evaluation office. The same procedures for answering requests for information or
       clarification as listed in paragraph 4.3 will be used.
       4.3.2. Training groups will establish procedures to route FI feedback to appropriate
       offices and implement follow-up procedures to ensure concerns or problems identified
       are tracked and corrected.
    4.4. Customer Service Information Process (CSIP). The CSIP consists of the customer
    service information line (CSIL) and any other written method by which the field
    communicates to a training group to ask questions or express concerns or problems with
    training received. Groups will establish a tracking mechanism to monitor use and follow-up
    action of CSIP inquiries and implement procedures to ensure problems identified are tracked
    and corrected. As a minimum, the tracking mechanism should include date of inquiry, how
    the inquiry was received, and satisfaction results. Track the field's concern using a locally
    developed template similar to Attachment 6.
       4.4.1. The CSIL is a telephone system by which any field user can communicate directly
       with the appropriate training group concerning training issues. Each training group will
       establish a dedicated phone line for such purposes and will acquire and install an
       answering machine for non-duty hour service of the line. Groups will contact the caller
       to obtain all relevant information necessary to effectively answer the caller's inquiry.
       4.4.2. Each training group will provide answers to inquiries as soon as possible, but not
       later than 5 workdays after contact with the caller or receipt of written inquiry. Each
       group will establish routing procedures to ensure the person most qualified to answer the
       inquiry prepares the reply. If a phone answer is appropriate, the person preparing the
       answer will call the requestor with the reply. Answers to significant training issues (such
       as changing course content, proficiency level, or length of a training program) or
       problems will be in writing. The group evaluation office will review the written replies
       and keep copies of these replies. Copies will also be sent to the appropriate Air Force
       career field manager (CFM), major command (MAJCOM) Air Force specialty (AFS)
       functional manager, AETC TPM, and 2AF/TTOC.
       4.4.3. To enhance customer satisfaction, send a customer satisfaction survey to the
       originators of inquiries to significant training issues. (A sample is at Attachment 7.)
    4.5. Graduate Assessment Surveys (GAS). Use the GAS to gather customer feedback on
    Air Force enlisted and officer graduates (to include Air Force Reserve Command [AFRC]
    and Air National Guard [ANG]) of initial skill Types 3, 5, 8, 9, A, B, and C courses (AB/OB
    in 3d and 4th position of course number).
AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010                                                               9


     4.5.1. Training groups will use TTMS to send notification to complete a GAS to the
     gaining base’s education and training manager for distribution to a graduate’s supervisor
     or trainer or directly to the graduate’s supervisor (whatever route is most efficient)
     approximately 90 calendar days after the graduation month. (See TTMS GAS Handbook
     for additional system procedures.) For courses experiencing extenuating circumstances
     affecting collecting usable graduate data (for example, unique assignments delaying
     graduates from performing on the job or a backlog of obtaining security clearances), the
     timeframe may be extended up to 120 calendar days after the graduation month.
     Document the reasons for extending the 90-day timeframe and send copies of the
     documentation to HQ AETC/A3PV and 2 AF/TTOC. The enlisted and officer GAS will
     contain the core questions as reflected in each of the samples at Attachment 8. The
     notification will include a request to reply within 30 calendar days. Note: Due to unique
     requirements, the ANG and AF Reserve will be allowed 90 days to complete the GAS for
     their personnel.
     4.5.2. GAS are considered overdue if not received 30 calendar days after mailing for
     active duty and 90 calendar days after mailing for AF Reserve and ANG. Training
     groups will establish follow-up procedures to maximize the number of surveys returned.
     Conduct a minimum of two follow-ups on a maximum of a 30 calendar day cycle for all
     GAS not completed. Retrieve and store data in a format that allows retrieval by course,
     Air Force specialty code (AFSC), date, and MAJCOM.
     4.5.3. Training groups will prepare a quarterly (fiscal year) summary on GAS. GAS
     summaries will not contain Privacy Act information. TRGs will post the GAS Summary
     to the AETC Technical and Basic Military Training Evaluation CoP at
     https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=AE-ED-00-53
     no later than 45 days following the quarter (for example, 15 May for the January – March
     quarter) and notify HQ AETC/A3T, 2 AF/TTOC, and the appropriate CFM it is available
     for review. Note: This report is exempt from the RCS requirements according to AFI 33-
     324, paragraph 2.11.12.
     4.5.4. Training groups will establish procedures for tracking and follow-up of GASs to
     ensure concerns or problems identified are corrected. As a minimum, surveys indicating
     less than meets standard ratings on questions 1 through 6 require follow-up if enough
     information from supervisor inputs are incomplete or inconclusive. GASs containing
     comments on question 7 will be forwarded to the appropriate CFM. Any specific request
     for information or clarification on a GAS response will be processed the same as a CSIP
     inquiry.
  4.6. Field Evaluation Questionnaire (FEQ) and Field Evaluation Questionnaire
  Summary (FEQS). FEQs are designed to solicit feedback from supervisors and/or
  graduates to determine if graduates were trained as specified in the training standard. FEQSs
  summarize questionnaire results. Upon request from AETC/A3P, training groups will
  provide specific FEQ information, annually or as necessary, to submit a request required to
  obtain a survey control number (SCN) IAW AFI 36-2601, Air Force Survey Program.
  Information requested normally consists of a list of projected courses with applicable target
  survey population for a specific time period.
10                                                        AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010


     4.6.1. When scheduling field evaluations, give priority to courses where there is a
     concern about training. Training groups will complete field evaluations on initial skill
     AFSC awarding and mandatory 7-skill level craftsman courses (to include Type 6) a
     minimum of every 2 years (from the date the last FEQS report was signed), or within 1
     year prior to a forecasted U&TW (if the forecasted U&TW date is published in time to
     complete an FEQS). Medical training involving a Phase I (Type 3) course and a Phase II
     (Type 5) course may combine the results of both courses into one FEQS. Evaluate other
     courses when there is a concern about training. When an initial skill or mandatory 7-skill
     level course is brought on line for the first time or has undergone a major revision as
     defined in AETCI 36-2203, start a field evaluation using graduates two to three classes
     following completion of validation.
        4.6.1.1. The Chief of Training Evaluation Office is the approval authority for
        exceptions to the 2-year requirement for a field evaluation. Some reasons for
        extending the evaluation cycle may include a major revision to the training standard
        or a lack of sample size for the questionnaire.
        4.6.1.2. Training groups will document any extensions to the 2-year requirement and
        coordinate with the training manager. Include reasons for the extension, the date the
        last field evaluation was completed, and a revised evaluation date in the
        documentation. Forward copies of the documentation of an approved extension to the
        applicable CFM, AETC TPM, and 2 AF/TTOC.
     4.6.2. Develop FEQs according to Attachment 10 to simplify completion by the
     customer. When questionnaires are being developed, request inputs from the CFM
     through the AETC TPM and course personnel. (Coordination at the U&TW may fulfill
     this requirement.) As a minimum, include questions concerning the ability of graduates
     to perform those tasks deemed critical and/or core to the career field.
     4.6.3. Supervisors are the preferred source for evaluating recent graduates of initial skill
     courses. Survey graduates when a supervisory survey would not provide adequate
     feedback. When both graduate and supervisor data are gathered, present the data for each
     separately. In supervisor questionnaires, ask for an overall rating of graduates' job
     performance. In graduate questionnaires, ask for a rating of overall training provided.
     4.6.4. Use Table 1 to determine the minimum number of questionnaires required. When
     applicable, use a representative sample of students from each MAJCOM, to include
     ANG, AFRC, and sister services.
     4.6.5. Use the most direct route to the graduate’s supervisor when requesting he or she
     complete an FEQ. This may mean routing through the base education and training
     manager. In order to achieve an adequate sample size, use one of the following methods:
        4.6.5.1. Shotgun. Send an FEQ completion request to supervisors of graduates
        and/or graduates who have been in the field from 4 to 6 months at the same time.
        When using this method, data should be extractable by length of time. (For example,
        if mailing in June, send requests to those who graduated between January and
        March.)
AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010                                                              11


        4.6.5.2. Sequential. Send an FEQ completion request each month to graduates
        and/or supervisors of graduates who have been in the field for 4 months. Continue to
        send out mailings until a large enough sample is achieved to represent the career
        field. (For example, mail surveys in June for March graduates, in July for April
        graduates, in August for May graduates, etc.)
     4.6.6. Conduct follow-up actions with the base education and training manager, force
     support squadron commander or equivalent if needed to reach the minimum confidence
     level. Achieving the desired confidence level is critical for evaluation, validity, and
     support of conclusions and actions in the FEQS. Note: If a problem area is identified that
     needs immediate attention, forward to the responsible training squadron for action. Do
     not use the criteria in paragraph 4.6.8 for this purpose.
        4.6.6.1. When analyzing data, pay particular attention to those items deemed critical
        to the career field. If a critical item falls below the minimum adequacy criteria
        described in paragraph 4.6.8, carefully scrutinize the criteria to determine the cause.
        Make every effort to work with course personnel, training managers, AETC TPMs,
        CFMs, and other SMEs to determine the cause and the best course of action.
        Consider conducting a thorough analysis of the method of delivery, sequence of
        training, test results, washback rates, etc. Also consider conducting telephone
        interviews with supervisors of more recent graduates. When the desired confidence
        level is achieved, analyze the data received to identify possible problem areas and
        summarize using the format at Attachment 11.
        4.6.6.2. When the desired confidence level is not attainable, analyze the data received
        to identify possible problem areas and summarize using the format at Attachment 11,
        specifically stating that the confidence level was not obtainable.
     4.6.7. Using the format in Attachment 11 as a guide, report results of the FEQs, analysis,
     and summary of corrective actions taken or planned for all items not meeting the training
     adequacy or utilization criteria described in paragraph 4.6.8. This format may vary to
     accommodate local needs, but it must be signed by the training group commander. As an
     attachment to the FEQS, identify the items failing to meet either adequacy or utilization
     criteria. Consider all applicable feedback data, both internal and external, when
     preparing the FEQS. Any specific request for information or clarification related to
     training provided contained on a questionnaire comment sheet will be processed the same
     as a CSIP inquiry. Note: This report is exempt from the RCS requirements according to
     AFI 33-324, paragraph 2.11.12.
     4.6.8. When the minimum required confidence level is achieved, training is considered
     adequate on a training standard item when 90 percent of usable surveys rate the training
     at or above the required level. Items falling below 50 percent utilization should be
     reviewed for retention, deletion, or alternate mode of training.

 1. Here is an example of how to use this table. If sample course production is 500 and 95 percent is
 the desired confidence level, then 222 usable questionnaires are required. This figure is 85 percent
 of the questionnaires to be mailed out. The number of questionnaires to be mailed is computed as
 follows: (Refer to AFHB 36-2235, Volume 9, for more information.)
  85%        222        222 x 100
  100%      =      X = 85        = 261 (number of questionnaires to mail)
 2. Sample size numbers represent required usable returned questionnaires. For evaluation of
 courses with 100 or fewer graduates during the sampling period, an 80 percent confidence level is
 required. For courses with 101 through 180 graduates, a 90 percent confidence level is required.
 For courses with 181 or more graduates, a 95 percent confidence level is required.



5. HQ 2 AF Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Program. HQ 2 AF will establish a
Stan/Eval program that focuses on subordinate units’ effectiveness in providing graduates who

       5.1.4. BMT Stan/Eval will:
           5.1.4.1. Establish procedures for the BMT Stan/Eval program in a supplement to this
           instruction to evaluate BMT-unique activities and programs.
           5.1.4.2. Provide via E-mail a trend analysis report semiannually, by 31 January
           (covering 1 Jul XX – 31 Dec XX of previous year) and 31 July (covering 1 Jan XX –
           30 Jun XX of current year), IAW format prescribed in the BMT supplement to
           AETCI 36-2201 to 2 AF/TTOC Workflow. Trend analysis is a study of common
           problems observed in organization evaluations and identification of causes and
           solutions applicable across organizations.      Therefore, in the "Recommended
           Improvement Areas" and "Deficiencies" categories, identify the trend, number of
           cases cited (or percentage of total deficiencies) and problems encountered in
           correcting deficiencies, correlate trends with problems cited in previous trend
           analyses, and provide a root cause analysis. Note: This report is exempt from the
           RCS requirements according to AFI 33-324. Identify Best Practices, Strengths,
           Recommended Improvement Areas and Deficiencies (with deficiency codes), as
           defined in AFI 90-201. Best Practices must be validated IAW AFH 38-210 before

       instructor utilization, (2) proficiency, and training (including degreed faculty progress,
       faculty documentation, and motivational training, if applicable), (3) trainee
       administration and scheduling, (4) training development and training management, (5)
       feedback programs, and (6) TA evaluations. Motivational training practices and military
       training will also be evaluated, where applicable. Commanders’ programs evaluated
       include, but are not limited to, (1) resource management, (2) regulatory policy/guidance
AETCI36-2201 13 September 2010                                                                   15


     issues, (3) self-inspection, (4) safety, (5) security, (6) family care plan, (7) leave program,
     (8) unit INTRO (sponsorship), and (9) fitness.
     5.2.2. Conduct evaluations to collect the facts (positive and negative), and validate
     deficiencies.
        5.2.2.1. Validation. 2 AF Stan/Eval will use a validation process that provides the
        evaluated unit the opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential
        deficiencies identified during the evaluation as well as coordinate with the
        appropriate MAJCOM staff functional on all critical and significant deficiencies
        identified during the evaluation. Evaluators will validate all potential deficiencies at
        the lowest appropriate unit and MAJCOM staff functional level and resolve any
        policy interpretation differences with the appropriate staff functional/OPR. All
        validated deficiencies will be documented in the report.
        5.2.2.2. During the evaluation, 2 AF Stan/Eval team chief/leads and team members
        will provide status updates to the unit functional leads upon completion of the
        evaluated area. These validation sessions typically cover evaluated areas, general
        observations, positive areas noted, and potential problem areas, but will not cover
        ratings. This provides the evaluated units an opportunity to clarify issues noted. If a
        significant disagreement on policy/procedures occurs during validation sessions, the 2
        AF Stan/Eval team member will coordinate with the higher headquarters (HHQ)
        functional for clarification. The HHQ functional will provide a written response to the
        2 AF Stan/Eval evaluator (E-mail is valid) by the last duty day of the evaluation to
        confirm clarification. By the end of the evaluation, commanders should have a
        complete understanding of all the facts. 2 AF Stan/Eval team chief/lead will provide
        daily updates to senior leaders covering previous days’ results.
     5.2.3. Publish a report as required by the 2 AF/CC and suspense inspected activities
     based on the criteria in AETC Supplement 1 to AFI 90-201.

     days of transmittal letter for final report.
     5.2.5. Evaluation Write-ups. Reports will only include write-ups categorized as
     Strengths, Deficiencies, and Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA). RIAs will not be
     used to document procedural deviations or non-compliance; they are only used to
     recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
        5.2.5.1. Deficiency write-ups will:
            5.2.5.1.1. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
            5.2.5.1.2. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as
            necessary to clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written
            description alone should be adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective
            action planning.
            5.2.5.1.3. Be assigned a deficiency severity of Critical, Significant, or Minor.

COMMENTS: Q1: Field: Supervisor was concerned with the airman’s attitude. After a slow start
with upgrade training, airman is doing well. School: Airman was a rope and student of the month so
he was highly motivated. Q1: Field: Airman consistently failed to show up for work on time. School:
This problem was noted during technical training. Q1: Field: Airman entered work center not meeting
weight standards. School: New procedures in place. Q1 & Q2: Field: Airman has been counseled for
coming in late to work. He did not know how to use hand tools. School: The importance of being on
time and reliable is and will continue to be stressed by instructors and MTLs. We teach how to use
hand tools in class and lab.

                FIELD EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT

A10.1. Factors to Consider When Designing Questionnaires for the USAF Graduate
Evaluation Program. When evaluators construct the field evaluation questionnaire, the
following three major areas should be considered:
   A10.1.1. Obtaining Data to Meet the Objectives of Field Evaluation. The objective of
   every evaluation project is to determine if graduates are adequately trained to perform the
   tasks taught in the course and required in the field. Word the questionnaire so it can be
   understood and answered with relative ease. Extensive background questions may also be
   used to permit meaningful analysis of data received. Behavioral statements and questions of
   observable performance should be used where possible. Emphasis should be on tasks taught
   in the course. Limit questions on knowledge-level objectives to a minimum. When
   developing the initial FEQ, emphasis should be on surveying major training standard items or
   headings rather than on surveying individual training standard items. Individual items may
   be surveyed in a subsequent survey if there are indicators of a problem in a particular area.
   A10.1.2. Providing      Sufficient    Instructions      to   Ensure     Completion        of
   Questionnaires. State the purpose of the survey, authority under which it is conducted,
   suspense date for completion (and return if mailed), and to whom questions can be referred.
   Provide information on the importance of the survey and the mechanics of how to fill out the
   questionnaire.
   A10.1.3. Designing Questionnaires for the AETC Graduate Evaluation Data
   System. Design questionnaires for use with a standardized computer analysis program.
   Written comments can also be obtained from the respondent by providing a remarks section
   on the questionnaire.
A10.2. First Question on Both Questionnaires. If the questionnaire cannot be completed, this
question will ask the respondent to indicate why. This question is mandatory. He or she will
pick an answer from the following choices:
Supervisor Questionnaire                                   Graduate Questionnaire
0 - Working in another AFSC (explain on remarks sheet)     0 - Working in another AFSC
1 - Discharge                                              1 - Awaiting security clearance
2 - Member does not meet standards of conduct              2 - Working in another duty position
3 - No security clearance                                  3 - Attending additional formal training
4 - Transferred/reassigned                                 4 - Medically disqualified
5 - Not assigned/assignment canceled                       5 - Working in Quality Control
6 - Disqualified under Personnel Reliability Program       6 - Working in Job/Production Control
7 - Medically disqualified                                 7 - Other (explain on remarks sheet)
8 - Other (explain on remarks sheet)

A10.3. Rating Scale. The FEQ is used to determine if graduates were trained as specified in the
training standard. In order to meet this objective, the rating scale should mirror the training
standard proficiency requirements as closely as possible. When surveying supervisors, use the
task performance proficiency code descriptions (for example, Extremely Limited, Partially
Proficient, etc.) whenever possible. Limit the use of satisfaction levels to only those FEQs that
the proficiency code does not apply to or when surveying graduates about the training they
received.
A10.4. Last Question on the Supervisor’s Questionnaire. Include a question that asks the
supervisor to rate the graduate’s overall preparation for the job. For example, ―Based on your
responses to (items one through the last question relating to the STS/CTS), please provide an
overall rating of how well the course (list course name) prepared the graduate to perform
assigned duties as an apprentice (enter job title).‖ Note: Use a rating scale similar to the one
used for the GAS.
A10.5. Last Question on the Graduate’s Questionnaire. Include a question that asks the
graduate to rate the overall training provided. For example, ―How would you rate the overall
training provided?‖ Note: Use a rating scale similar to the one used for the GAS.

      (2) Field Evaluation Questionnaire (FEQ) Data:
Example
In 2010, from 1 Jan – 20 Jun, there were a total of XX courses that met the requirement for an
FEQ to be accomplished. Of those XX courses, XX FEQs were mailed or completed, XX
waivers were approved and XX courses did not require an FEQ in the year. Requirements for
the waivers on the courses ranged from courses being in revision to courses labeled low flow.
In those courses where tasks did not meet the XX % adequacy criterion, corrective actions were
identified and discussed at the appropriate U&TW. By comparison, in 2009, from 1 Jul – 31
Dec, there were XX courses that met the requirements for FEQs to be accomplished. Of those
XX courses, XX FEQs were conducted, XX waivers were approved and XX courses did not
require an FEQ to be accomplished in that year.
      (3) Field Interview:
Example
Four field interview visits were conducted this reporting period at twelve locations, interviewing
XXX graduates and XXX supervisors. From these interviews, XX percent of the graduates and
XX percent of the supervisors rated ―base name‖ training at satisfactory or higher. During these
visits, interviews were conducted with graduates and their supervisors/trainers, and discussions
were held with senior unit leadership to ask for recommendations to improve the quality of
graduates coming from ―base name‖. These trips also provided the opportunity to reconnect
with base and unit training managers to facilitate more FEQ and GAS returns.

                  Totals                                     XX               XX
     (4) Student feedback data (to include Type 6):
Example
The ## TRG administered XX,XXX Training Assessment Surveys (TAS) or EOC on-line
surveys to graduates from 1 Jan – 30 Jun in CY10. The group had an overall satisfaction rating
of XX .X percent. The TAS identified several intermittent problems in the courses which
enabled the developers to take corrective actions. The quality of training equipment being used
in the ―course name‖ Apprentice Course received numerous negative comments and presented a
negative trend for this course. A Special Equipment Survey was developed and implemented.
The special equipment survey identified the specific equipment in question which enabled course
personnel to take corrective action. Numerous monthly feedback comments identified problems
with the old existing dormitories. New dormitories were built at the ―base name‖ Training
Annex and on main base, which greatly improved the feedback about the dormitories. The area
of MTL helpfulness has shown negative trends during this reporting period for different
squadrons. However, when these trends appeared, squadrons took aggressive actions to improve
or change the operating procedures of their Military Training Flights and MTLs.
Base Support of Training Survey (BSTS): There were XX,XXX surveys administered with a satisfaction rating of
XX .X percent. The monthly BSTS report is used for the base Balanced Scorecard. The group commander was
proactive in helping resolve issues and improve the services provided to the students by communicating on a
personal level with base organizational commanders.
   b. If HHQ or commander-directed inspections are conducted, identify Best Practices,
   Strengths, Recommended Improvement Areas, and Deficiencies (with deficiency codes), as
   defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities, in the following categories as applicable:
     (1) Training Development:
Example
BEST PRACTICE: Utilized an Excel spreadsheet to automate the AETC Form 668 to track
high miss test items. Automatically highlights items with a XX percent or more miss rate per
class. Encompasses separate tabbed areas for instructor, instructor supervisor, and TDE
comments and review. Use of this product facilitated a one-stop-shop approach to quick and
accurate tracking and reporting of high miss test items.

MINOR TREND: Student Feedback Program. (TR3.1; LS1.1) Student Feedback program
required attention in two of the four units evaluated. The majority of errors noted were due to a
lack of attention to detail. Root Cause Analysis determined personnel were adequately trained,
and guidance was sufficient, however, closer supervision was required.
(DEFICIENCY) Student Feedback program in three courses required attention. Appointment
letters inaccurate. Monitors not comparing training feedback submissions with course
graduation rosters/course control documents to ensure end-of-course feedbacks conducted as
scheduled. Feedbacks not accomplished, not maintained on file/destroyed as required, not routed
properly, and not received by squadron monitor or Training Evaluations.
      (2) Current AETC CIIs:
Example
TREND: Fitness Program Documentation (TR3.2; LS1.1). A trend in poor fitness program
documentation led to serious issues with late test dates and tracking of personnel who scored
poor or marginal on the fitness evaluation. This issue was further compounded by late
administration of fitness screening questionnaires, late entry of test scores into the Air Force
Fitness Management System, as well as lack of understanding of all program requirements.
Thorough staff assistance visits by the base program manager helped to highlight fixes needed.
Root cause analysis determined personnel were inadequately trained and lacked sufficient
supervision and oversight.
