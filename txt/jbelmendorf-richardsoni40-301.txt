       provide in home evaluations, assessments, or treatment. A Treatment Manager may enter

       course of the investigation. Photos will be taken as soon as possible, or appropriate,
       before external evidence of injuries subside or to document damage or neglect of physical
       property. Photographs taken at the scene or of the victim will be processed through 673
       ABW/PA and released to the appropriate investigative agency, and photographs taken
       will also be made available to the Family Advocacy Office through this agency (AFOSI
       or SFS).
