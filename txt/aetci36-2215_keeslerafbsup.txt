SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Parent instruction AETCI 36-2215, Technical and Basic Military Training Administration, is a
new instruction substantially revised and renamed from Training Administration. Role-based
responsibilities and guidance on the training requirements process are now included in the parent
instruction vs. this supplement. This document is substantially revised and must be completely
reviewed.
10.2.2.1. (Added) Squadron MTLs will validate the BMT shipping list and forward the
compiled final report to 81 TRG/MTO and the registrar (81 TRSS/TSRE org box). Squadron
MTLs will also update TTMS Student Record Custom Tab Housing Field for students that reside
in a squadron other than the squadron where they are currently being trained, if applicable. In
the event that a student is housed in a squadron other than the assigned training squadron, the
MTL responsible for their housing will enter and update all applicable TTMS Student
Management codes as required.
10.2.2.2. (Added) The registrar’s office will consolidate and forward the squadron shipping list
to Student Processing Center (SPC), squadron chief MTL and TMs.
10.2.7. Officer course IS is responsible for ensuring ZP and awaiting training status codes are
entered in TTMS Student Management.
10.3. NPS students reclassified from different technical training locations will not receive a ZP
status code upon arrival. MTL will record an awaiting training status code if the student is not
immediately entered into training.
11.3.1. After the force gain action is complete, the student is entered into training. On the
following duty day, the TM verifies the training line number (TLN) has an “S-dash” number
visible on the class start/grad roster in TTMS; if no “S-dash” appears contact the registrar.
12.2.1. Course instructor supervisors will report discrepancies in the TTMS class
start/graduation roster to the TM.
12.2.2. MTLs will enter awaiting training status codes in TTMS Student Management of all
NPS enlisted students transitioning to follow-on courses at Keesler, if needed. MTLs and ISs
will coordinate to ensure student accountability between courses. ISs will enter awaiting training
status codes in TTMS Student Management of all students transitioning from officer course of
initial entry (COIE) to follow-on courses at Keesler, if needed.
12.5.1. Use Keesler AFB Form 10, Appointment Slip, to document and notify the student's MTL
of assignment to Special Individualized Assistance (SIA) outside the normal training day.

Table 12.13., Item 3. The course TM is the approving official for extensions to completion time
for Type 6 courses.
