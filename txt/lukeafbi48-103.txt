for the inspection of aircraft arriving from an origin outside the Continental United States

will be given by Security Forces personnel to all crew and passengers. This is necessary to
prevent the introduction of diseases requiring quarantine or arthropod vectors of medical
importance into the United States and to prevent the spread of economic pests. This instruction
applies to all personnel assigned or attached to Luke Air Force Base to include Air Force
Reserve Command and to Air National Guard Units. Refer recommended changes and questions
