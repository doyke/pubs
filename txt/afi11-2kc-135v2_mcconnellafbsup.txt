AFI 11-2KC-135V2, dated 26 May 2010 is supplemented. This supplement implements local
evaluation criteria for the operation of 22 ARW KC-135 aircraft in order to safely and effectively
execute the wing’s worldwide mobility missions. This supplement is used in conjunction with
AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program, and associated supplements.
This instruction is applicable to all aircrews assigned or attached to 22 OG and does not apply to
the 931 ARG (AFRC). Forward all recommended changes to this supplement to 22 OG/OGV.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and should be reviewed in its entirety. Major
changes include 2.2.1 which provides guidance on SIM INSTM/QUAL evaluations; 2.5.2 which
provides guidance on Operational Mission Evaluations (OME); 2.3.3 provides guidance on re-
alignment of Navigator QUAL with INIT MSN evaluations; Navigator (ARR) certification
requirements removed; AF Form 3862s are maintained on the OGV SharePoint and are no longer
maintained in this supplement.
1.9.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). The evaluator will administer the EPE prior
to evaluation debrief. The EPE will consist of a scenario-based emergency situation and general
knowledge questions in addition to the required three-engine requirements. The EPE will be
consistent with the type of evaluation and experience level of the examinee. For all Pilot
evaluations, the EPE shall be conducted in the simulator in conjunction with the QUAL/INSTM

portion of the evaluation. A list of example EPE topics will be maintained on the OGV
SharePoint.
1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. Current evaluation worksheets
are available on the OGV SharePoint. All AFI 11-2KC-135V2 and local requirements are
included. AMC and local SIIs will be evaluated. Flight examiners will verify and annotate
current SIIs in the section provided and gather trend information accordingly.
2.1. Evaluation Requirements. Table 2.1 defines ground requisites for each type of
evaluation. Paragraphs 2.2, 3.3 and 4.4 further outline pilot, navigator and boom operator
evaluation requirements, respectively.

     NOTES:
     1. An EPE given in conjunction with a combined evaluation (e.g. SIM INSTM/QUAL and
         MSN) satisfies the EPE requirement for both QUAL and MSN evaluations.
     2. Pilots receiving initial instructor (Receiver) evaluations require only those requisites under
         MSN (ARR)
     3. The NBQ end-of-course test administered in initial qualification training counts toward
         completion of open and closed book testing for INIT QUAL evaluation and will be
         annotated as “End of Course” on the INIT QUAL AF Form 8. However, when realigning
         the INIT QUAL evaluation with the INIT MSN evaluation, the end-of-course test will not
         be used to satisfy the open and closed book requirements even if it is within six-months (see
         paragraph 3.2.4.).
AFI11-2KC-135V2_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 17 OCTOBER 2011                                                3


      2.2.1. (Added) SIM INSTM/QUAL Evaluations. Pilot instrument and qualification
      evaluations (INSTM/QUAL) will be conducted in the simulator IAW with the student
      and instructor guides provided by CAE. Complete all Required Pilot Pattern Items as in
      Table 2.2.
      2.2.2. (Added) Simulator Scheduling. The aircraft (MSN) evaluation should be
      scheduled prior to the simulator (INSTM/QUAL) evaluation in an effort to accomplish
      circling and holding in the aircraft as opposed to in the simulator. If the MSN evaluation
      sortie cancels for any reason, do not cancel an INSTM/QUAL simulator evaluation in
      order to comply with the above guidance. AA22 simulator evaluations should be
      scheduled for a four-hour period (normally 0830-1230 and 1430-1830) with a CAE
      Instructor operating the simulator. This permits more thorough evaluations, as well as
      adequate time to conduct the EPE in the simulator. Squadrons will schedule a pilot team
      suitable for a pattern-only sortie. If an IP or touch-and-go certified AC is not available,
      contact the evaluator to coordinate desired actions. Squadron schedulers will inform
      CAE scheduling NLT 1300 the day prior of any changes to the schedule. Evaluatees
      should have crew rest for a simulator evaluation.
      2.2.3. (Added) Simulator Preparation. Pilot teams will obtain mission paperwork
      from the CSOC Ops Desk, review TOLD, obtain NOTAMS, check BAM/AHAS, review
      ORM, and sign off FCIFs in ePEX prior to showing for the simulator. Basically, the pilot
      team should accomplish actions as if stepping for a pattern-only sortie. Weather and fuel
      loads will be IAW the simulator student guide, but may be adjusted by the evaluator.
      Pilot teams will show up prepared to accomplish a crew briefing with the evaluator 1+00
      prior to the scheduled simulator start time. Pilots will wear headsets for all simulator
      evaluations.
      2.2.4. (Added) Simulator Execution. To the maximum extent possible, a contracted
      simulator instructor should operate the simulator during the evaluation. An Air Force
      Flight Evaluator will administer the evaluation. The evaluator will discuss the profile and
      emergency procedures with the contracted simulator instructor 0+30 prior to the
      simulator start time. The evaluator will provide the CAE instructor with the required
      information for the EPE profile. Evaluators will clearly define objectives of the EPE to
      the evaluatee. The contracted simulator instructor will be released to set up the simulator
      0+15 prior to the simulator start. During the simulator, headsets will be used and motion
      will be on (motion required for landings at a minimum). Evaluatees will plan their
      profile. The evaluator will coordinate with the contracted simulator instructor on when to
      inject engine malfunctions to satisfy the evaluation requirements.

          NOTES:
          1. A minimum of one landing (Normal or Partial Flap) will be evaluated in
              the aircraft
          2. Evaluate in the aircraft due to simulator visual limitations, if available;
              otherwise evaluate in the simulator with an emphasis on executing a
              missed approach if the evaluatee loses site of the airport environment by
              making a climbing turn towards the landing runway.
          3. Weather permitting or certified simulator

    2.4. MSN Evaluations. Attempt to evaluate circling and holding in the aircraft as opposed to
    in the simulator. If unable, evaluate circling and holding in the simulator. Each evaluatee
    will accomplish a landing in the aircraft.
       2.4.2. Breakaway may be evaluated as the pilot flying or as the pilot not flying.
           2.5.1.1. (Added) MSN (ARR) Evaluations. Pilot Air Refueling Receiver (ARR)
           evaluations include ARR procedures, equipment and systems knowledge. For
           initial/re-qualification evaluations, examinees should fly a minimum of 10 minutes of
           autopilot on and 5 minutes of autopilot off. Evaluators are encouraged to use 10
           minutes autopilot on and 5 minutes autopilot off as a target for periodic evaluations.
           2.5.1.2. (Added) Instructor Pilot Air Refueling Receiver (ARR). Instructors will be
           evaluated on their instruction of ARR procedures, equipment/systems knowledge and
           limits demonstration while at the controls during receiver A/R. Instructor examinees
           should demonstrate 10 minutes of autopilot on contact, which may be concurrent with
           a limits demonstration, and 5 minutes of autopilot off contact.
       2.5.2. Operational Mission Evaluations (OME). All pilots who were not previously
       certified as an aircraft commander in a tanker MDS (KC-135/KC-10) are required to
       complete an OME in conjunction with aircraft commander certification. 22 OG/CC has
       given Sq/CCs the discretion of utilizing the Altus KC-135 Initial INSTM/QUAL/MSN
       Evaluation to satisfy the OME requirement for pilots who were previously certified as an
       aircraft commander in another mobility MDS (e.g. C-5, C-17).
           2.5.2.1. 1 (Added) OME Profiles. The following profiles are listed in order of
           preference and will be used to satisfy the OME requirement: NOTE: 22 OG/CC has
AFI11-2KC-135V2_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 17 OCTOBER 2011                                             5


        given Sq/CCs the discretion of utilizing the evaluator to perform instructor duties on
        an initial leg of the mission to satisfy remaining MCT requirements.
           2.5.2.1.2. (Added) OCONUS TACC mission; air refueling highly desired.
           2.5.2.1.3. (Added) CONUS cross-country mission (with enroute stop-overs); air
           refueling highly desired.
           2.5.2.1.4. (Added) Local mission; rendezvous and air refueling required, TACC
           mission highly desired.
           2.5.2.2.1. (Added) OME Documentation in FEF. Document the OME in the
           individual’s FEF using the applicable format below:
           2.5.2.2.2. (Added) No testing requisites exist for a “SPOT” OME. There is no
           eligibility period associated with an OME, but a successful OME does establish
           an expiration date. Include the following statement in the remarks section: “This
           OME was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification.”
           2.5.2.2.3. (Added) “INSTM/QUAL/MSN” Evaluation Option. If the decision is
           made to complete an OME and simultaneously re-aligning an
           “INSTM/QUAL/MSN” evaluation, conduct and document the evaluations IAW
           AFI 11-202 Volume 2 and AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2 requirements, as
           supplemented. In the remarks section of the Form 8 include the comment “This
           evaluation was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander certification.
           All Operational Mission Evaluation and INSTM/QUAL/MSN requirements have
           been fulfilled.”
           2.5.2.2.4. (Added) Altus Evaluation Option. The Sq/CC may elect to utilize the
           Altus KC-135 INIT INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation to satisfy the OME
           requirement for an individual previously certified as aircraft commander in
           another mobility MDS. The Sq/CC will sign an MFR with the statement “<Rank
           First Last’s> INIT INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation on <DD Mmm YY> has been
           utilized to satisfy the Operational Mission Evaluation requirement in conjunction
           with aircraft commander certification.” Place the MFR in the member’s FEF.
     3.1.1. (Added) Navigator Evaluations. Requisite testing for both QUAL and MSN
     evaluations will be accomplished IAW Table 2.1 above.
        3.2.2.1. (Added) INIT QUAL Evaluations. Navigator training for initial
        qualification and senior officer qualification are conducted IAW the Navigator Basic
        Qualification (NBQ) course syllabus (AMC). This training course will culminate in
        an INIT QUAL flight evaluation. INIT QUAL evaluations will include at least 30
        minutes of point-to-point navigation.
        3.2.3.1. INIT MSN Evaluations. Due to the unique requirements of 22 ARW
        missions, locally-assigned navigators trained and qualified under the AMC NBQ
        syllabus will complete the Mission Qualification Training program as defined by 22
        OSS/OSN. This training course will culminate in an INIT MSN/QUAL flight
        evaluation.
     3.2.4. (Added) Realignment of QUAL with INIT MSN Evaluations. If the
     instrument examination administered in conjunction with the INIT QUAL evaluation is
6                      AFI11-2KC-135V2_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 17 OCTOBER 2011


    within six months of the INIT MSN evaluation, it may be used to satisfy the requirement
    for the realigned QUAL evaluation. However, the end-of-course test will not be used to
    satisfy the open and closed book requirements of the realigned QUAL evaluation even if
    it is within six months. The front of the Form 8 will include one entry in the Flight Phase
    section; “INIT MSN/QUAL”. Annotate the eligibility period as “N/A” and “QUAL
    evaluation realigned during INIT MSN evaluation” in the Additional Comments section.
    4.3.2. MSN (CARGO) Evaluations. Cargo loading evaluations should be conducted
    during actual or static cargo loading or unloading operations. The examinee’s flying unit
    is responsible for coordinating static load requirements. Periodic evaluations may be
    conducted verbally but only as a last resort. Initial and requalification cargo evaluations
    cannot be verbally evaluated.
