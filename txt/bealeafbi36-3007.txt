1. Purpose The purpose of the 9 RW Key Spouse Program is to enhance mission readiness
through effective outreach, education, and support by unit leadership to its family members. It is
designed as a partnership between squadron leadership, appointed key spouses/mentors, and the
Airman and Family Readiness Center to address family readiness concerns. By empowering a
volunteer key spouse/mentor to serve as a vital communications link between the command
structure and its families, squadron leadership will have a direct connection with family members
to pass on vital information of upcoming squadron activities and deployment related issues. As a
result, families become more self-reliant with knowledge of the available resources.
Furthermore, they are better prepared for deployment and should be ready to deal with
