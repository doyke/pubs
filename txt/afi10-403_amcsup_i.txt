AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 45


     ensuring unit personnel can immediately respond to the transportation function to
     reconcile any frustrated cargo.
        1.6.1.16.1. Ensure unit representatives are identified as cargo couriers, as required, to
        accompany equipment and supplies on assigned lift for accountability.
     1.6.1.17. Ensure the UDM or designated representative collects the minimum required
     NoK information for each deploying member in a timely manner. NoK information will
     be provided to the IDO or CMOS/GATES operator directly (dependent on local policy)
     for input into CMOS/GATES. Minimum requirements for NoK are First-Middle-Last
     Name, Phone Number, Address, City, State, Country, and Zip code for a deploying
     member’s NoK. For short-notice deployments, where time doesn’t permit collection of
     NoK information, deploying members may ―Refuse‖ to provide their NoK information.
     1.6.1.18. Ensure accomplishment of a risk analysis during pre-deployment planning to
     identify and ensure abatement of potential hazards. It is important to review as much of
     the deployment prior to departure, as this will enable the correction or mitigation of many
     hazards before they become mishaps. It is equally important to accomplish a risk analysis
     once the unit reaches the deployment location. AFPAM 91-216, USAF Safety
     Deployment and Contingency Pamphlet, assists commanders and planners in the
     evaluation and mitigation of risks associated with deployments and contingencies. Ensure
     units conduct deployment operations in a professional military manner with a sense of
     urgency and keen situational awareness. Personnel should immediately correct unsafe
     conditions.
     1.6.1.19. Ensure civilians postured to deploy have appropriate civilian ID card, Common
     Access Card (CAC), Geneva Convention card, passport, and/or visas when required.
     Ensure E-E civilian personnel are prepared and trained to deploy IAW this AFI and AFI
     36-507.
     1.6.1.20. When OPLANs, deployment taskings, or the Supported Commander’s
     reporting instructions do not authorize the hand carrying of individual weapons by
     deploying personnel, unit commanders must appoint a primary and alternate weapons
     courier, in writing to the DCC, to ensure the security and accountability of weapons and
     ammunition while en route from origin to the final destination. It is the deploying unit's
     responsibility to ensure appointed couriers are knowledgeable of policies and procedures
     associated with resource protection, use of deadly force, and equipment accountability.
     Units are encouraged to seek assistance from the host wing Security Forces Squadron to
     develop weapons courier training plans tailored to the deploying unit's specific resource
     protection needs.
     1.6.1.21. Ensure mobility bags, weapons, munitions, and insect vector requirements are
     established and filled based on the units/wings maximum simultaneous deployment
     capability as described in para 2.24.6. Refer to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions
     Maintenance Management, for base-level positioning policy for Category-B (Mobility)
     munitions for miscellaneous units defined in AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground
     Munitions.
46                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        1.6.1.21.1. Commanders will coordinate storage, accountability, and maintenance of
        mobility bags (including medical kits), insect vector requirements, weapons, and
        munitions with the LRS commander.
        1.6.1.21.2. Required quantities will be procured and maintained IAW AFMAN 23-
        110and AOR Reporting Instructions.
     1.6.1.22. Ensure all personnel postured against UTCs P-coded as A/DW_ or A/DXS in
     UTC Availability, or AFSCs listed on the AF/A3/5 deviations request letter, maintain the
     highest state of readiness, have their affairs in order, and have a Personal Readiness
     Folder, containing required deployment documentation (see paragraph 1.6.2.9),
     maintained by the UDM (J-suffix coded UTCs may not have the same requirements
     unless directed by the owning command). NOTE: It is recommended that Airmen
     postured in all other coded UTCs have their affairs in order and personal readiness
     folders for possible short-notice tasking requirements. See paragraph 1.6.2 for specific
     readiness requirements. Commanders should make every effort to ensure shortfalls are
     mitigated prior to their deployment window (see Attachment 4 for training process
     flowchart). While training should be kept current and UTCs green at all times to meet
     AEF surge requirements, commanders must ensure Airmen are fully qualified at least 120
     days prior to their AEF vulnerability period and their UTCs are green in ART to the
     maximum extent possible when the AEFC starts scheduling.
        1.6.1.22.1. (Added-AMC) Electronic Deployment Folders are authorized for day to
        day folder maintenance purposes with the following caveats:
            1.6.1.22.1.1. (Added-AMC) Wing Commanders and IDOs must approve all
            requests for use of Electronic Deployment Folders; ensuring compliance with all
            AFI 10-403 requirements and their ability to manage wing deployment readiness.
            1.6.1.22.1.2. (Added-AMC) Units must create the required hardcopy Standard
            Deployment Folder for every individual tasked to deploy to facilitate out-
            processing the installation and in-processing AOR PERSCOs. These folders must
            include unique COCOM documentation requirements. Wings must ensure that
            any Electronic Deployment Folder is managed in a way that ensures units can
            create the required folders in support of both AEF rotation taskings and large
            scale unit moves based on DOC timing.
            1.6.1.22.1.3. (Added-AMC) In no instance may units use electronic versions of
            a deployment folder for out-processing and in-processing activities. AMC will
            continue to work with Air Staff A4 and A1 counterparts in an attempt to move
            toward an AF- wide Electronic Deployment Folder.
     1.6.1.23. Be responsible for ensuring deploying Airmen know, before departing, the
     entire expected deployment period to include pre-deployment en route training, the
     estimated tour length, and any overlap required at the end of the tour.
     1.6.1.24. Upon redeployment, commanders and their designees, first sergeants,
     supervisors, UDMs, and Wingmen must be prepared to make timely decisions for actions
     that support the positive recovery of their personnel.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              47


         1.6.1.24.1. Serve as the critical link between active duty personnel, their families,
         and installation helping agencies.
         1.6.1.24.2. May request tailored support from various CAIB/IDS helping agencies
         for personnel and their families.
         1.6.1.24.3. Commanders consult with and are trained by CAIB/IDS agencies on their
         redeployment support roles and responsibilities.
         1.6.1.24.4. Commanders will strongly encourage family member participation in
         CAIB/IDS agency activities supporting the AEF cycle.
         1.6.1.24.5. Proactive command responses include: early recognition of readjustment
         difficulty, eliminating derogatory feelings towards the use of readjustment support,
         and facilitation of help-seeking behavior.
         1.6.1.24.6. Actions during reintegration education and the AEF cycle will include:
         observation, screening, identification, referral, and follow-up support for personnel
         recovery.
         1.6.1.24.7. Critical components supporting personnel recovery include: reintegration
         education, post deployment assistance, health care, spiritual support, childcare, and
         trauma response care.
         1.6.1.24.8. Commanders ensure complete redeployment processing of their personnel
         and support each individual to make a smooth post-deployment transition.
         1.6.1.24.9. Commanders ensure UDMs contact redeploying personnel 90 days after
         return from deployment to complete PDHRA (DD Form 2900).
     1.6.1.25. Commanders who have mission essential contracts will comply with DODI
     3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crises. Key issues
     include, but are not limited to the following:
         1.6.1.25.1. Review new and existing contracts and identify mission essential services
         performed by contractors that are required during crisis. Ensure identification of
         mission essential services are in the contract statement of work (SOW).
         1.6.1.25.2. Track contractor personnel who are performing or who would perform
         mission essential services. Include their family members in non-combatant evacuation
         planning.
         1.6.1.25.3. Provide essential personnel information on contractors selected for
         deployment to the PRF. Ensure the contractor receives appropriate Letters of
         Introduction (LOI) and required contractor information is entered into DCAPES for
         proper accountability.
     1.6.1.26. Develop contingency plans for execution of mission essential services per
     DODI 3020.37.
  1.6.2. Training Requirements and Unit Personnel Readiness. The unit commander ensures
  unit personnel prepare for deployment within the AEF rotational construct IAW this
  instruction, AFI 10-401, AFI 36-507, and AFI 36-2201. Units will ensure all military and E-
  E civilians receive appropriate deployment ancillary training and other deployment
48                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  requirements at the appropriate times according to the respective policy guidance referenced
  for each (see Attachment 4 for training process flowchart). NOTE: Whenever possible,
  ancillary training will be provided/executed via computer based training (CBT) using the
  Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS) found on the Careers tab of the AF Portal.
     1.6.2.1. The following are the minimum deployment ancillary training requirements for
     personnel identified against a position in a UTC postured in the UTC Availability
     (formerly AFWUS) according to posturing identified in the paragraphs that follow (para
     1.6.2.1.1 through 1.6.2.1.9):
         1.6.2.1.1. Law of Armed Conflict/Rules of Engagement/Human Rights training, IAW
         AFI 51-401.
         1.6.2.1.2. Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Awareness Training IAW USAF/A1
         Memorandum, ―Awareness Training for Combating Trafficking in Persons‖, 27 Feb

         1.6.2.1.3. Self-aid and buddy-care training IAW AFI 36-2238, Self-Aid and Buddy
         Care Training, and supplemental training on the new Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK),
         when required.
         1.6.2.1.4. Level I Anti-Terrorism Awareness training and appropriate AOR-specific
         threat briefings IAW AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards.
         1.6.2.1.5. Information Assurance Awareness Training IAW AFI 33-115V2, if
         deploying member will require a network account at deployed location.
         1.6.2.1.6. Small arms training IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air
         Force Personnel; AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program; and AFPD 16-8, Arming of
         Aircrew, Mobility and Oversea Personnel. NOTE: Per AFI 36-507, this training is not
         required for federal civilians who plan to decline acceptance of a firearm if offered
         one. Chaplains, AFSCs 52RX, are noncombatants (reference AFI 52-101, Planning
         and Organizing) and exempt from all arms training.
         1.6.2.1.6. (AMC) 1 (Added) Per updated AF policy, previous Arming Group C
         (Arming Group B in the new AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
         Personnel) individuals are no longer required to maintain recurring small arms
         qualifications and will accomplish pre-deployment qualification only.           Pre-
         deployment qualification must be accomplished within 90 days of deployment
         departure. Personnel completing qualification in preparation for deployment will fire
         the applicable course(s) of fire wearing individual combat equipment (ICE) and when
         qualifying on the hand gun will use unit issued holsters. Additional details are
         available in AFIs 36-2226 and 31-207.
             1.6.2.1.6.1. (Added-AMC) Commanders are responsible for ensuring
             compliance and unit awareness of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. §
             922(d)(9) and (g)(9)/Lautenberg Amendment) IAW AFI 31 – 207.
         1.6.2.1.7. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive
         (CBRNE) Defense Training IAW AFI 10-2501.
         1.6.2.1.8. Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) training IAW AFI 10-2501.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               49


        1.6.2.1.9. Combat Skills Training – In a coordinated AF/A1, A3/5, A4/7 memo, Air
        Staff issued training guidance for Wing commanders to ensure Airmen deploying to
        the CENTCOM AOR received pre-deployment readiness training needed to be safe
        and effective in environments not traditionally encountered by most Airman. The
        CST course is designed to make all Airmen proficient and comfortable with handling
        a weapon and working within a team to defend themselves, the team, and their
        mission.
     1.6.2.2. Personnel assigned against UTCs with posturing codes A/DWS, A/DWX, or
     A/DXS (see AFI 10-401, Chapter 7 for AEF posturing coding) or personnel with AFSCs
     listed on the AF/A3/5 deviations request letter will, at a minimum, be fully trained and
     maintain the highest state of readiness at all times (J-suffix coded UTCs may not have the
     same requirements unless directed by the owning command) IAW requirements in
     paragraph 1.6.2.1. UTCs with posturing codes A/DW_ will be equipped and ready at all
     times. A/DX_ UTCs may be equipped as resources allow, but will generally share
     equipment with A/DW_ UTCs and may receive training as training resources become
     available after meeting A/DW_ requirements.
     1.6.2.3. Personnel assigned against UTCs coded A/DXX or A/DPS should be trained and
     equipped, or have access to equipment IAW FAM guidance in case the equipment is
     shared with another UTC, to the maximum extent constrained resources allow (see
     paragraph 1.6.2.3.2). Personnel assigned against UTCs coded A/DPX do not require
     training or equipping beyond what is required at their home station for their war time
     mission. A/DPS and A/DPX UTCs already permanently assigned to forward areas (e.g.,
     Korea), will normally require all training and equipment required to deploy to that
     location.
        1.6.2.3.1. Upon notification of a deployment tasking, any remaining training
        requirements must be fulfilled within 72 hours or in time to meet the ALD. All
        personnel in all UTCs in DOC-tasked units should be trained and equipped to meet
        DOC response times.
        1.6.2.3.2. Generally, constrained resources include Combat Arms Training &
        Maintenance (CATM), CBRNE Defense Training, and Expeditionary Combat Skills
        materials, facilities, and/or personnel and are usually accomplished through just-in-
        time training. All other training should be accomplished by all personnel, including
        A/DXX and A/DPS UTCs just prior to the AEF sourcing process to ensure the
        training is completed and remains current throughout their deployment.
        1.6.2.3.3. Commanders should keep in mind that while A/DXX-coded UTCs are not
        normally available for deployment under non-surge ops within their aligned AEF,
        under USAF A3/5 declared minimum surge rotational conditions these A/DXX UTCs
        may be tasked in their on-call period ahead of the unit’s A/DW_ UTCs in the second
        on-call period up to the maximum total A/DW_s (reference AFI 10-401, Chapter 7).
        If at all possible, commanders should not defer deployment training to ―just-in-time‖
        for A/DXX assigned people, since they may be required to deploy short notice during
        a crisis and ―just-in-time‖ training might not be possible.
50                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     1.6.2.4. Note that referenced functional publications may levy additional training
     requirements for some or all individuals who are identified against a UTC Availability
     position.
     1.6.2.5. Additional training may be required based on duties performed and location of
     deployment (e.g., Basic Combat Convoy Course training, etc.). These will be defined in
     appropriate line remarks/reporting instructions of taskings.
     1.6.2.6. Civilian personnel postured to deploy will meet all of the deployment training
     requirements established by their military counterparts. AFI 36-507 outlines any
     additional training and processing requirements that may be necessary.
     1.6.2.7. ANG and AFRC unit commanders must ensure MPA man-days are requested
     and orders are received at least thirty (30) days prior to deployment.
     1.6.2.8. The unit commander or designated representative must track and ensure all
     personnel assigned a UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS) position meet all medical and
     additional deployment requirements at all times ensuring rapid response to a situation
     (AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, and local guidance). This includes having:
     1.6.2.8. (AMC) 5 QNFT frequency requirements IAW AFOSHSTD 48-137_IC2:

        identified by the Medical Group may also be required. Contact local Medical
        Group/Unit for specific requirements for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
        Anthrax, etc.
            1.6.2.8.1.1. Issuance of DHHS Form PHS (Public Health Service) 731,
            International Certificate of Vaccination, is no longer required for each member of
            the Armed Forces and for non-military personnel. AF Complete Immunization
            Tracking Application (AFCITA) products will be used as a replacement for the
            DHHS Form PHS 731. The form contains valid certificates of immunization for
            international travel and quarantine purposes IAW World Health Organization
            international health regulations. The AFCITA product remains in the custody of
            the individual who is responsible for its safekeeping and for keeping it in his or
            her possession when performing international travel.

  1.6.3. Training Requirements Tracking. Units will track individual deployment requirements
  for all personnel assigned a position on the UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS) using
  LOGMOD, LOGMOD Stand-Alone, or other Air Staff- or MAJCOM approved automated
  system (e.g., Automated Civil Engineering System (ACES), Advanced Distributed Learning
  System (ADLS), Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS), Integrated Maintenance
  Data System (IMDS), Heavy Airlift Maintenance System (G081), Reserve Aerial Port Data
  System (RAPDS), Medical Readiness Decision Support System Unit Level Tracking and
  Reporting Application (MRDSS ULTRA), Security Forces Management Information System
  (SFMIS), Training Education Management System (TEMS), Web-based Integrated Training
  Database II (WBITS), Deployment Readiness Service (DRS), etc.). At a minimum, a system
  is deemed Air Staff- or MAJCOM-approved when a unit has written or electronic
  correspondence from an applicable Air Staff or MAJCOM system functional manager
  specifically indicating approval. The AF Form 4005, Individual Deployment Requirements,
  will be generated for all personnel assigned to A/DW_ and A/DXS coded UTCs in the UTC
  Availability. It is recommended that an AF Form 4005 be generated for all personnel
  assigned to any UTC in case of surge or substitution requirements.
  1.6.3. (AMC) Deployment Personnel Assessor and Requirements Tracker (DPART) is an
  HQ AMC/A4 approved system which can be used to track individual deployment
  requirements.
     1.6.3.1. LOGMOD can automatically generate an AF Form 4005 product containing all
     required readiness information. If LOGMOD is not used, hard copies of AF Form 4005
     will be filled out manually to ensure individuals have completed all personal preparation
     actions. Instructions for completing AF Form 4005 are as follows:
         1.6.3.1.1. The individual and the UDM/Supervisor will complete the AF Form 4005
         together. The individual will date and initial next to each completed item. As a
         minimum, UDM/Supervisor and individual will perform an annual review of the AF
         Form 4005/LOGMOD product, or upon notification/identification of deployment or
         vulnerability for deployment.
         1.6.3.1.1. (AMC) UDMs will conduct an initial Folder/AF Form 4005 review NLT
         45 days after newly assigned personnel have completed unit in-processing actions,
         and every 12 months after that initial review. Reviews not accomplished due to
         deployments will be accomplished within 45 days after deployed member returns and
         then every 12 months after that.

                                 DEPLOYMENT PLANNING

Section 2A—Planning Overview

2.1. Deployment Planning Introduction.
   2.1.1. This chapter discusses Air Force deployment planning, much of which occurs in the
   first of four deployment phases – pre-deployment activities. The other three phases are
   movement to and activities at the port of embarkation; movement to the port of debarkation;
   and joint reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (JRSOI) activities and will
   be covered in subsequent chapters.
   2.1.2. The Air Force deployment process begins when planning is initiated for force
   projection operations in response to an action or event that requires protection of U.S.
   national interests. Actions or events which could trigger the deployment process could fall
   under the full range of military operations (ROMO) and include natural disasters, civil
   support, foreign humanitarian assistance (FHA), Security Assistance, Homeland
   Defense/Security (HLD/S), United Nations (UN) actions and support to regional
   organizations (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations), etc.
   2.1.3. Planners must consider use of a combination of pre-positioned materiel, HNS
   agreements, ACSAs, and contingency contracts, when planning deployments and tailoring
   unit-level personnel and equipment requirements.
   2.1.4. As in joint deployment planning, Air Force planners must view deployment in the
   context of overall operational planning. Deployment planners at all levels must consider not
   only the actual deployment of forces, but also the employment mission, expeditionary
   organization structure, command relationships, the reception of forces, pre-positioning
   strategies, HNS, information systems, forward basing, and en route infrastructure.
2.2. Deployment Planning Challenges.
   2.2.1. Finite force structure. Commanders and planners can only plan with the current force
   structure. The Air Force’s total combat capability is aligned in the 10 AEFs and Enabler pool
   and is used to meet the global needs of all CCDRs. All National Military Strategy (NMS)
   objectives must be met with the weapons, units, personnel, and equipment/supplies in this
   single pool of both permanently assigned and rotational forces. The AEF is the primary
   methodology for meeting and sustaining these objectives.
   2.2.2. Limited transportation and mobility assets. Airlift and tanker aircraft, aircrews, aerial
   port personnel, and material handling equipment (MHE) are limited assets and must be used
   wisely or risk being wasted. Wings/units must ensure their deployment processes and
   systems are kept up to date through aggressive training and exercise programs.
   2.2.3. In-transit Visibility. Commanders at all levels rely heavily upon information systems
   to provide visibility of the movement of forces. Tracking force closure is critical to the
   combatant commander's (CCDR) ability to begin operations. Fully integrated and
   interoperable command and control systems must be on-line and available at all times to
   support the IDS components (Ref. AFI 24-238). Those systems require the highest levels of
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 59


   communications security (COMSEC). Operational security (OPSEC) is also critical in
   today’s environment. Thus, it is imperative that deployment systems and processes down to
   the unit level be used effectively and efficiently.
   2.2.4. To fully understand Air Force deployment planning, one must start with the basic
   building blocks and the systems used.

Section 2B—UTCs / War Planning and Execution Systems

2.3. Unit Type Codes (UTC).
   2.3.1. War planners use UTCs to document total Air Force manpower and logistics
   capabilities needed to support the national military strategy during operational planning and
   execution activities. These requirements are documented in a JOPES/DCAPES TPFDD (See
   AFI 10-401, Chapter 8) in support of an OPLAN, CONPLAN, or Operations Order
   (OPORD) in the form of standard UTCs. UTC is described and defined in more detail in AFI
   10-401.
   2.3.2. The MISCAP is simply a statement of the capabilities of the force identified by each
   UTC. Do not include crew ratios and monthly flying hours in UTC MISCAPs. Reference
   War Mobilization Plan, Volume 5, Basic Planning Factors & Data, for such planning data
   and factors. The UTC FAM at the MEFPAK responsible agency is responsible for writing
   the MISCAP.
   2.3.3. UTC personnel requirements are reflected in the UTC Manpower Detail (MANFOR).
   The AFSC/skill level/grade requirements listed in the UTC MANFOR must match
   AFSC/skill level/grade of the UMD positions postured. Substitutions of AFSC, skill level,
   and grade are allowed if specifically referenced in the MISCAP; however, the UTC must still
   be able to perform its MISCAP. EXCEPTION: Civil Engineers (CE) may substitute positions
   for posturing of UTCs IAW substitution rules outlined in AFI 10-210. Additionally, for
   posturing, units can fill lower skill or grade UTC requirements with a higher UMD skill or
   grade position. When making AFSC and/or grade substitutions, changes should be reflected
   in the LLD of the postured UTC. If authorizations are unfilled, this must be reflected in ART.
   Units will not be tasked to provide personnel resources for wartime and/or major operation
   and campaign requirements that exceed their UMD authorizations unless authorized to
   posture above their authorizations. (See AFI 10-401 for exceptions to posturing).
   2.3.4. UTC equipment requirements are reflected in the UTC Logistics Detail (LOGDET).
   Units must be authorized the full allowance standard of equipment as specified in the
   LOGFOR subsystem. If authorized equipment is not on hand, this must be reflected in ART.
2.4. Global Command and Control System (GCCS).
   2.4.1. GCCS is designed to improve the Joint Force Commander’s (JFCs) ability to manage
   and execute joint operations. It is the primary means of Command and Control (C2) for the
   President and SecDef over all military forces. GCCS provides a classified global network of
   military and commercial communications systems that the JFC uses to send and obtain
   critical force projection information.
2.5. Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).
 60                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   2.5.1. JOPES is the DOD-directed single, integrated joint command and control system for
   conventional operation planning and execution (to include theater-level nuclear and chemical
   plans). JOPES is both a process and a collection of automated systems used to develop
   OPLAN TPFDDs that drive deployment taskings. The OPLAN details the mission to be
   accomplished and the TPFDD contains force record data, including UTCs that represent unit
   capabilities and are the primary source for movement planning. The TPFDD provides a
   prioritized list of what combat forces, combat support, and combat service support UTCs
   deploy in support of a particular operation plan. It catalogs the UTCs to deploy and outlines
   who provides them. The TPFDD also identifies where they are going, how they get there,
   cargo dimensions, number of personnel, and non-organic personnel movement required.
   Units must maintain and report UTC information as accurately as possible to ensure proper
   forces are identified and adequate lift is planned for and provided. Reference JP 1-02, DOD
   Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms; JP 3-35, Joint Deployment and Redeployment
   Operations; AFI 10-401; AFPD 10-4; and the CJCSM 3122-series publications for additional
   information on the use of JOPES to support deployment operations.
   2.5.2. The process of force projection is an integral part of JOPES. It tracks requirements,
   departures, and arrivals in the scheduling and movement subsystem of JOPES and provides
   users with an ordered and comprehensive set of procedures for resolving complex strategic
   mobility force deployment and sustainment problems. JOPES includes an operation planning
   process, an Automated Data Processing (ADP) support system, and procedures to support the
   planning process.
2.6. Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES).
   2.6.1. DCAPES is the standard Air Force ADP system designed to communicate OPLAN
   requirements and resource monitoring capability to minimize unnecessary movement of
   personnel and equipment into a theater of operations during execution. The objective of
   DCAPES is to provide improved and streamlined operations planning and execution
   processes. This includes associated policy and procedures, along with organizational and
   technology improvements. DCAPES provides standard data files, formats, application
   programs, and management procedures that are Air Force unique and Joint guidance
   compliant. DCAPES is at the heart of the Air Force’s War Planning and Execution System
   (WPES); a comprehensive, net-centric system of systems used in war planning and execution
   for the purpose of presenting, planning, sourcing, mobilizing, deploying, accounting for,
   sustaining, redeploying, and reconstituting AF forces; and provides a Service feed to JOPES.
   NOTE: WPES includes LOGMOD, BaS&E (formerly LOGCAT), LOGFAC, DCAPES,
   UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS), and several other war planning and execution
   systems.
   2.6.2. DCAPES and the WPES support all phases of operations planning and execution at
   the HQ USAF, MAJCOM, AFCC, NAF, and Wing/Squadron level. It is the Air Force’s sole
   capability to present, plan, source, mobilize, deploy, account for, sustain, redeploy, and
   reconstitute Air Force forces satisfying CCDR’s requirements.
   2.6.3. DCAPES transactions that support JOPES procedures are the mechanisms for
   submitting movement requirements to USTRANSCOM.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 61


   2.6.4. DCAPES supports accurate and timely sourcing which includes validation and
   verification. This allows sourcing and tailoring of lower levels of detail beyond the JOPES
   level of detail. DCAPES is detailed in AFI 10-401, Chapter 4.
      2.6.4.1. The Air Force Verification Capability (AFVC) in DCAPES will be used at wing
      level to verify AEF taskings. Logistics Planners in the LRS Readiness Flight and IDRC
      are required to have write permissions to DCAPES to support the IDO’s verification
      responsibilities. If DCAPES is not available, wing/installation IDOs will work with
      MAJCOM FAMs for requirements.
      2.6.4.2. A minimum of two manpower positions in the LRS Readiness Flight
      Contingency Planning Branch will be identified as requiring DCAPES SEI 062
          2.6.4.2.1. If Airmen have attended the JOPES course prior to implementation of
          4.0.2.0 and they are qualified (or will qualify) for SEI 048 or SEI 049, they will only
          be required to attend the Base-level DCAPES course. The squadron commander will
          sign a letter validating qualifications and request a waiver for DCAPES training from
          the MAJCOM DCAPES administrator when requesting write permissions to
          DCAPES.
2.7. USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).
   2.7.1. The USAF WMP consists of five volumes and is the USAF supporting document to
   the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The five WMP volumes provide the Air Staff,
   Air Force planners, and Air Force commander’s current policies, planning factors, and GFM
   apportioned forces for conducting and supporting operations. A description of the five
   volumes of the WMP can be found in AFI 10-401, Chapters 2 and 4. Of particular interest
   should be WMP, Volume 3:
      2.7.1.1. Volume 3 (WMP-3), Combat and Support Forces, has five parts. Part 1 contains
      combat forces. Part 2 is the Air Force UTC Availability and contains all postured UTC
      capability in the Air Force. Part 3 contains the Air Force Readiness Spares Package
      (RSP) authorization document. Part 4 contains the AEF Rotational Force Schedule for
      combat and support forces. Part 5 contains the U.S. Air Force Rotational Force
      Allocation Plan.
          2.7.1.1.1. WMP-3, Part 2, UTC Availability, is the official Air Force data source for
          identifying the availability of all Air Force UTCs. It contains all postured UTC
          capability in the Air Force listed by UTC/Unit Identification Code (UIC)/Record
          Number. This UTC Availability represents the Air Force's commitment to support
          CJCS, Combatant Commander, and Service-unique requirements. It documents all
          conventional and OPLAN 8044 capabilities for all Active, Guard, and Reserve units.
          MAJCOMs will provide excerpts of the WMP, Vol. 3, Part 2, to the LRS Readiness
          Flight Contingency Plans Element.
2.8. Logistics Module (LOGMOD).
   2.8.1. LOGMOD is a logistics-planning program that receives and maintains the cargo and
   personnel details for UTCs and taskings. It maintains detailed cargo records as well as
   personnel records (levy file positions and the personnel to fill them) and provides a command
   and control capability through the DSOE module. LOGMOD operates in unclassified mode.
62                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  Currently, there is no direct interface between LOGMOD and DCAPES. LOGMOD is part of
  the WPES.
  2.8.2. There are four modules resident in LOGMOD: Logistics Force Packaging Module
  (LOGFOR), Logistics Planning Module (LOGPLAN), DSOE Module, and Unit Deployment
  Management Module (UDM).
     2.8.2.1. The LOGFOR module provides the capability to create and maintain the
     standard logistics details consisting of supplies and equipment for all AF UTCs that have
     associated supplies and equipment. This data is called the LOGDET. AFI 10-401
     provides detailed instructions on adding, deleting, updating, and maintaining UTCs.
     2.8.2.2. The LOGPLAN module provides the capability to tailor or customize the plan-
     unique UTC database of equipment and supplies. It allows units to uniquely customize
     UTCs for each tasking (OPLAN/CONPLAN/AEF) that unit supports. Tailored UTC
     information developed in LOGPLAN must be manually transferred to DCAPES (air-gap
     process) to ensure the TPFDD includes correct movement requirements data. This data is
     called the Logistics Plan File (LPF).
     2.8.2.3. The DSOE module provides users with an automated capability to plan,
     schedule, and monitor the deployment actions that support the movement of forces.
     2.8.2.4. The UDM module is used by the UDM in preparation for and execution of
     deployment taskings.
  2.8.3. LSA is used as the backup to LOGMOD. This system is a unit-level program that
  manages personnel and cargo data in an off-line mode. LSA has capabilities similar to
  LOGMOD and may be used when or where LOGMOD is not available or functional.
  2.8.4. LOGMOD will be used as the primary AF Deployment system. Units will use LSA, to
  the maximum extent possible, as the backup deployment system to LOGMOD when their
  LAN will not facilitate the expeditious use of LOGMOD. It is at the discretion of the IDO or
  equivalent to determine when it is not feasible to use LOGMOD as the primary system for a
  deployment after having tried to use it in the initial stages of the deployment or exercise.
  NOTE: If neither LOGMOD nor LSA can be used, AF IMT 2511, Deployment Schedule of
  Events - Cargo (see Attachment 10), AF IMT 2511A, Deployment Schedule of Events -
  Passenger (see Attachment 11), and AF IMT 2512, Deployment Schedule of Events -
  Loading Schedule (see Attachment 9), will be used for the purpose of developing and
  maintaining a manual DSOE. In lieu of manual DSOE, units may use locally developed
  software processes to build a DSOE, provided that software will create a product that
  includes, at a minimum, the data elements of the AF Forms 2511, 2511A and 2512.
  2.8.5. The IDO, or equivalent, will establish, within the IDP, a process of how the wing will
  use LSA as the backup deployment system when LOGMOD is unavailable or is not feasible
  to use for exercise or deployment purposes. As a non-LAN dependent system, the IDO will
  utilize LSA as a single source C2 system within the DCC or Logistics Plans office to build
  and distribute the DSOE to UDMs and DCC work centers. UDMs will use LSA to the
  maximum extent possible in updating LOGMOD files (i.e., *.PLN, *. PRF, *.LVY) provided
  by the IDO for their deployment tasking and generating Deployment Load and Packing lists
  and Deployment Shipping Placards for deploying cargo.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 63


2.9. Defense Readiness Reporting System-Air Force.
   2.9.1. In 2002, SECDEF mandated use of the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)
   by all services by September 2006. DRRS is a capabilities-based reporting system which
   measures an organization's ability to execute Mission Essential Tasks (METs) at the unit
   level.
2.10. AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART).
   2.10.1. ART is a CSAF-directed system developed to measure AEF readiness. ART captures
   UTC assessments, identifies suitable UTCs to satisfy taskings, and helps forecast shortfalls
   (see AFI 10-244). Unlike DRRS and SORTS, ART is the only assessment system that goes
   down to the UTC level. In an effort to integrate UTC and MET assessments and simplify
   reporting, DRRS will be modified to include a tab for ART inputs.
2.11. Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS).
   2.11.1. CMOS is a CSAF-directed IDS system used for wing-level deployment and
   contingency passenger and cargo processing operations.
   2.11.2. CMOS is used for preparing and managing all movement documentation.
   2.11.3. Enables bar coding and scanning for cargo processing.
   2.11.4. Provides ITV.
2.12. Automated Air Load Planning System (AALPS).
   2.12.1. AALPS is an Air Force system that automates load planning in support of worldwide
   deployment of forces and day-to-day cargo movement. IDS Component System partner
   which receives AALPS *.CL5 files and uses the data for load planning.
2.13. Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES).
   2.13.1. GATES is the current AMC real-time system that supports fixed, deployed, and
   mobile sites. GATES can be used in the IDS system in the same way CMOS is used; it is an
   equal IDS partner.
      2.13.1.1. It will process and track cargo and passengers; support resource management
      and provide command and control support information.
      2.13.1.2. It will also generate cargo, passengers, and resource reports at headquarters and
      unit level, and will provide message routing and delivery for all AMC transportation
      airlift operators regardless of size, workload, volume, configuration, or location.
2.14. Global Combat Support System (GCSS).
   2.14.1. GCSS provides universal secure access to information and interoperability of that
   information across combat support and C2 functions. GCSS provides a secure, intranet
   environment allowing DOD users to access shared data and applications that results in near
   real-time command and control of the logistics pipeline.
2.15. Global Transportation Network (GTN).
   2.15.1. GTN is an automated C2 information system that supports the family of
   transportation users and providers by providing an integrated system of ITV information and
   C2 capabilities. GTN receives wing deployment data from CMOS/GATES.
 64                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   2.15.2. GTN collects and integrates transportation information from selected transportation
   systems. The resulting information is provided to the President and SecDef, CCDRs,
   USTRANSCOM and its component commands, and other DOD customers to support
   transportation planning and decision making during peace and war.
2.16. Single Mobility System (SMS).
   2.16.1. The Single Mobility System (SMS) is a web-based computer system that provides
   visibility of air, sea, and land transportation assets and provides aggregated reporting of
   cargo and passenger movements. SMS does this by collecting plane, ship, and truck
   movement data from other computer systems such as GTN and GDSS.
2.17. Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS).
   2.17.1. Feeds DCAPES with all personnel information required to support the War Planning
   and Execution process. It is used in the management of every aspect of Airmen’s careers
   from accessions, reenlistments, retraining, career field management, assignments,
   employments, quality force management, evaluations, and retirements. It contains an AEF
   association data field for documenting a member’s assigned AEF and the date they were
   assigned to that AEF. AEF association does not apply to the ARC.

Section 2C—Pre-Deployment Activities

2.18. Supported Commander Defines Pre-deployment Training and Activities.
   2.18.1. The supported commander and his or her components, along with HAF FAMs for
   Joint Sourcing Solution (JSS)/In Lieu Of (ILO)/Individual Augmentee (IA) requirements,
   define pre-deployment training and standards required for the safety of our members and the
   successful mission completion in their AOR. These training needs and standards ensure
   deploying units are aware of the CCDR's mission, theater support parameters and pre-
   positioned equipment, host nation cultural differences and environmental standards, mission-
   specific training requirements, and medical issues within the AOR. It is imperative that
   training requirements, pre-deployment activities, and standards be identified accurately and
   in a timely manner to increase the skill, rapid assimilation, and confidence levels of our
   Airmen.
2.19. Deploying Commander Preparation.
   2.19.1. With the pre-defined training and standards outlined by the supported commander,
   the responsibility for preparation for movement rests with the deploying units. Preparation
   for movement will be further defined in this instruction, but can include review of personal
   Service records and legal documents, medical processing to include updating inoculations,
   receipt of theater-specific organizational clothing and equipment, theater-specific cultural or
   environmental protection training, warrior skills training, expeditionary combat skills, special
   training (e.g., convoy drivers), and refresher weapons training prior to movement.
   2.19.2. Conducting this training prior to deployment normally facilitates rapid assimilation
   and integration of arriving forces and personnel in theater.
      2.19.2.1. Unit commanders will use the AOR Reporting Instructions provided by the
      PRF to identify theater-specific training and track mobility requirements, which help
      prepare Airmen for deployment. The AEF Center’s AEF Online web site also provides
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                65


      guidelines for AOR Reporting Instructions via the AEF Reporting Tool and the
      Commander’s Toolkit in addition to other personnel readiness tools. If using the web site,
      commanders will ensure the Reporting Instructions are the AOR’s latest version available
      by checking with the PRF.
   2.19.3. Pre-deployment training needs are also identified by the supported command via a
   DRMD line remark. A list of current line remark codes and their definitions are available on
   the AEFC AEF On-Line web site.
   2.19.4. Other pre-deployment activities could include: continued refinement of OPLANs;
   preparation of personnel and equipment for movement; preparation of ammunition, supplies,
   and equipment; rehearsal of mission-essential tasks; conducting mission-specific training;
   establishment of sustainment requirements; and focused awareness of the impact of threat,
   climate, and geography in the AOR or joint operations area (JOA) on planned joint force
   activities.
   2.19.5. Echelons. Prior to any deployment, commanders echelon their units based on
   operational considerations, movement schedules, and the type of lift projected. This process
   organizes and prioritizes movement within the joint force to accommodate the available lift.
   For example, the movement plan may echelon units into an advance party, main body, and
   rear party.
2.20. Wing Commander Deployment Planning Role.
   2.20.1. Host wing commanders are responsible for every aspect of deployment planning at
   their installation. In support of deployment planning activities, host wing commanders will:
      2.20.1.1. Provide command and control over all phases of the deployment of host and
      tenant units.
      2.20.1.2. Ensure adequate facilities and infrastructure is available for the processing of
      personnel and cargo.
      2.20.1.3. Be briefed at least annually by the IDO on all UTCs assigned to the installation
      as well as those that may deploy from, to, or through the installation.
      2.20.1.4. Develop and validate an IDP at least annually showing how the installation will
      process its maximum simultaneous deployment capability as discussed in Section 2E.
      2.20.1.5. Coordinate deployment planning with other Services and agencies that may
      deploy from the installation.
      2.20.1.6. If deploying other Services from the installation:
          2.20.1.6.1. Work with MAJCOM planners to determine additional personnel,
          equipment, and ADP requirements that may be needed for this. This may require
          support agreements, new terms of agreement (TOA), etc.
          2.20.1.6.2. Get MAJCOM determination on which Service component will provide
          Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG) or equivalent functional lead
          assistance (IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR, Part III - Mobility).
          2.20.1.6.3. Conduct inter-Service exercises at least annually to assess and promote
          interoperability of systems and processes. If resources for a field exercise are not
 66                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          available, this requirement may be filled with command post and/or tabletop exercises
          that incorporate actual use of deployment systems.
      2.20.1.7. Ensure assigned Airmen, to include tenant personnel, are qualified and trained
      to fulfill their UTC MISCAP and deployment tasking.
      2.20.1.8. Designate trained personnel to deployment processing functions.
      2.20.1.9. Provide ready combat, combat support, and combat service support forces as
      tasked by CSAF.
      2.20.1.10. Assume and mitigate risks incurred with the deployment of a sizeable force
      from their installations.
      2.20.1.11. Identify limiting factors and shortfalls that preclude the deployment of
      assigned forces and report these to the MAJCOM for resolution.
      2.20.1.12. Budget for the cost of training and exercises as well as for individual
      protective equipment (IPE) and medical support requirements (e.g., first-aid kits, DEET,
      permethrin uniform treatment, bednets/poles, etc.).
2.21. Squadron Commander Deployment Planning Role.
   2.21.1. Unit (squadron) commanders are ultimately responsible for the readiness of their
   assigned personnel and cargo and must ensure the squadron can meet the MISCAP of all
   assigned UTCs. In addition to their other responsibilities, UTC-tasked squadron commanders
   will:
      2.21.1.1. Ensure all assigned personnel are postured in UTCs in the appropriate AEF (see
      Attachment 4 for process on assigning personnel to UTCs). Such assignment will be
      indicated in LOGMOD and MilPDS.
          2.21.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Must be accomplished in conjunction with IDO who has
          responsibility for maintaining the UTA DSOE-ID, in which units should assign
          personnel to their maximum simultaneous deployment capability (the total of all
          DW_ coded UTCs) as depicted in the UTA, and then assign remaining personnel to
          remaining UTA UTCs. This is the only DSOE-ID which must be maintained with
          personnel assignments per AMC Sup para 2.33.2.1.
      2.21.1.2. Procure, maintain, and prepare equipment/supplies required for postured UTCs.
      2.21.1.3. Train and equip assigned personnel to meet MISCAP of postured UTCs.
      2.21.1.4. Report readiness of assigned UTCs in ART. Assign an ART OPR/monitor to
      report squadron UTC readiness (if not the UDM) IAW AFI 10-244. ART OPR/monitor
      should be assigned to this position for at least 18 months.
      2.21.1.5. Identify personnel and equipment shortfalls and take necessary action to
      eliminate/mitigate those shortfalls. Elevate shortfalls to Wing/Installation commander,
      through the IDO, for resolution. Unit commanders must ensure they have thoroughly
      reviewed all shortfalls to ensure that every option regarding AFSC or equipment
      substitution (IAW UTC MISCAP, functional guidance, etc.), risk mitigation, etc. have
      been considered for their unit prior to submitting a shortfall. They are ultimately
      responsible for the overall accuracy of shortfalls submitted by their unit.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  67


      2.21.1.6. Prior to AEFC sourcing and MAJCOM verification of a UTC, unit
      commanders will identify UTC shortfalls and take corrective action in ART within 24
      hours of the initial discovery and on a monthly basis thereafter. They will also provide
      that information to the IDO. See Chapter 3 for shortfalls identified after AEFC sourcing
      recommendation.
      2.21.1.7. Train and equip assigned personnel to process deploying personnel and
      equipment.
      2.21.1.8. Review the IDP at least annually and develop unit checklists/operating
      instructions to ensure the squadron can comply with the plan and meet deployment
      requirements.
      2.21.1.9. Work with the IDO/IDRC and Operations Plans to identify all planned taskings
      (e.g., contingency plans, UTC Availability, base support planning responsibilities, etc.).
      This should be accomplished during the commanders update described in paragraph
      1.5.5.7.
      2.21.1.10. Establish recall rosters and ensure unit representatives can be notified
      immediately upon IDRC receipt of deployment tasking.
      2.21.1.11. Document and validate the unit’s maximum simultaneous deployment
      capability annually to the wing/installation IDO. This should be accomplished during the
      commander annual update described in paragraph 1.5.5.7.
      2.21.1.12. Develop leading and lagging indicator metrics to manage the unit’s
      preparedness during each stage of the AEF battle rhythm (e.g., ART assessments;
      personnel, training or equipment deficiencies; AEF association; UTC alignment in the
      UTC Availability; timeliness of tasking notification; identified deployment discrepancies,
      etc.).
      2.21.1.13. Designate unit representatives (i.e., cargo couriers) to accompany equipment
      and supplies on assigned lift. If, while in-transit, equipment and supplies are bumped en
      route to the deployed location, courier(s) will be available to coordinate movement of
      assets on the next available lift.
2.22. The Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) Deployment Planning Role.
   2.22.1. The IDO provides oversight and executes the deployment command and control
   process. The IDO is assigned in writing by the host wing commander and resides in the
   IDRC of the LRS. The individual designated as the IDO oversees and directs the Logistics
   Planners (normally assigned to the Readiness Flight of the LRS), Personnel Readiness
   experts, Manpower representatives, and Transportation personnel within the IDRC (either as
   permanent staff or direct support staff) to perform the support activities required that ensure
   assigned units plan, prepare, and execute deployments IAW CCDR requirements. Included in
   those deployment planning responsibilities, the IDO (and his/her staff) will:
      2.22.1.1. In conjunction with assigned units, determine the installation’s maximum
      simultaneous deployment capability and get annual wing commander approval.
      Maximum simultaneous deployment capability validation by squadron and wing
      commanders must be documented in writing and maintained in the IDRC/Logistics
      Readiness Flight office.

      2.22.1.1. (AMC) AMC units will use UTC Availability to determine the most stringent
      deployment requirements. AFRC units will use the UTA as pulled from DCAPES.
          2.22.1.1.1. (Added-AMC) Provide        electronic   copy   of     approved    IDP   to
          AMC/A4RX.
      2.22.1.2. Develop the IDP.
      2.22.1.3. Brief the wing commander and senior staff at least annually on UTCs assigned,
      the IDP, OPLANs the installation is tasked to support, projected installation throughput
      requirements by day, installation bed-down forces by day, and installation LIMFACs
      and/or shortfalls.
      2.22.1.4. Train senior staff and squadron commanders on their responsibilities in
      deployment planning and execution.
      2.22.1.4.1. (AMC) (Added) Unit commander training must be accomplished within 45
      days of assignment per paragraph 1.6.1.2.
      2.22.1.5. Train UDMs to manage unit deployment programs.
          2.22.1.5.1. (Added-AMC) UDMs must be trained within 45 days of assignment.
      2.22.1.6. Train unit personnel to prepare unit equipment and assigned personnel for
      deployment processing requirements.
      2.22.1.7. Train wing personnel to process installation equipment and personnel.
      2.22.1.8. Establish policies and procedures for a DCC, PDF, and CDF for providing
      deployment command and control and for processing installation personnel and
      equipment.
      2.22.1.9. Monitor appropriate command and control systems (e.g., DCAPES, JOPES,
      etc.) for TPFDD taskings and to identify requirements sourced to the installation and/or
      identified to embark from the installation. Coordinate TPFDD requirements with PRF,
      TMF, and affected units.
      2.22.1.10. Ensure TPFDD routing and time phasing information is followed.
      2.22.1.11. For AEF rotations, monitor the designated or dedicated newsgroups.

      2.22.1.13. Process installation personnel and equipment shortfalls.
      2.22.1.14. Identify LIMFACs/shortfalls in the deployment process.
      2.22.1.15. Establish installation procedures to ensure processing personnel accomplish
      all pre-deployment requirements to meet the specific AOR reporting instructions.
      2.22.1.16. Ensure Airmen identified to deploy during and AEF rotation are educated on
      pertinent information: ULN and line number, line remarks, final destination/travel
      itinerary to include mission number.

Section 2D—Worst Case Scenario

2.23. Factors in Determining Worst-Case Scenario.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  69


   2.23.1. There are a number of factors units must consider in estimating their worst-case
   scenario. The IDO works with functional planners, unit representatives, operational planners,
   and MAJCOMs to determine the worst-case scenario. They review contingency plans the
   installation is tasked to support, the UTC Availability, UTC availability P-coding, DOC
   statements, home station mission requirements, possible installation through-put, etc. Table
   2.1 depicts many of the factors that must be considered.

Table 2.1. Example of Factors Used in Determining Worst Case Scenarios:

   Total number of assigned personnel that could be deployed over a given period of time.
   Total number of UTCs P-coded as DW_ and DPS.
   Total number of short tons that may be shipped over a given period.
   Total number of transiting personnel.
   Total number of transiting short tons.
   Total number of inbound personnel.
   Total number of inbound short tons.
   Maximum on ground (MOG): Number of aircraft that can be parked and/or worked
   (loaded/unloaded) simultaneously. Parking MOG and working MOG could be two
   different numbers with two significantly different meanings (e.g., an installation may be
   able to park 10 wide-body aircraft at one time but may only have the personnel and
   equipment to load or unload two). The more restrictive MOG will generally equate to the
   worst-case scenario.
   Day (generally C-day) with largest volume of personnel movement.
   Day with largest volume of short ton movement.
   Type and quantity of on-hand MHE.
   Type and quantity of on-hand aerospace ground equipment (AGE).
   Type and quantity of special purpose vehicles (e.g., tugs, de-icers, etc.).
   Capacity of cargo marshalling yard/facility.
   Capacity of personnel processing center.
   Airfield capacity (ramp space, fuel dispensing, lighting, C2, etc.).
   Pre-positioned WRM.


   2.23.2. Much of the source data required to determine worst-case scenarios come from the
   following systems and/or applications:
      2.23.2.1. The War Mobilization Plan, Vol. 3 (WMP-3), identifies apportioned forces and
      contains the UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS) listing all postured UTCs.
 70                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      2.23.2.2. The WMP, Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WMP-4), contains the
      Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR) depicting aircraft activity aligned against
      OPLANs and some CONPLANs with TPFDDs. The WMP-4 also includes the Wartime
      Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO), which planners can use to approximate
      maximum support of aircraft activity (e.g., working MOG). Planners can get to the
      WAAR and the WCDO from the Logistics Feasibility Analysis Capability (LOGFAC)
      System.
      2.23.2.3. Force flow data for deploying, transiting, and inbound forces can be accessed
      via the TPFDD. Planners may use JOPES or DCAPES to query the TPFDDs their wing
      units are tasked under.
      2.23.2.4. The local IGESP or ESP will identify wartime facility and infrastructure
      capacity, capability, ownership, and use. This data can be accessed through the Base
      Support & Expeditionary (BaS&E) Planning Tool. The Civil Engineering Squadron
      (CES) also hosts the Facility Management Board that allocates facility use. Airfield
      Managers work with CES and Wing Safety to develop aircraft parking plans.
      2.23.2.5. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) and Standard Base
      Supply System (SBSS) will provide the War Plans Additive Requirements Report
      (WPARR), Vehicle Authorization Listing (VAL), and Custodian Account/Custody
      Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) for equipment and vehicle authorizations and on-hand
      numbers. The Inventory Management Plan (IMP) will detail fuels storage capacity and
      requirements.
   2.23.3. Taking these and other factors into account, the IDO and functional planners can
   start to estimate maximum requirements for facilities, equipment, vehicles, and personnel to
   support contingency/deployment operations. Knowledge of the high volume days bounds the
   upper support limit (i.e., largest processing center required, most number of support vehicles
   needed, greatest amount of support personnel to train, etc.). Total quantities assist in
   determining number of mobility bags and training capacity (instructors, facilities,
   equipment/supplies). Other factors include weather/climate and home station location with
   associated risk.
   2.23.4. There is no cookie-cutter solution to estimating an installation's worst-case scenario.
   In fact, worst-case scenario can mean different things to different units and/or installations.
   For example, where many units will consider maximum number of deploying personnel in
   the equation, units in Korea may pay little attention to this. But there are some common sense
   approaches planners may build on to develop a realistic scenario.
   2.23.5. The first consideration should be an assessment of UTC posturing, AEF alignment,
   and P-coding and planned rotational taskings.
2.24. Deployment Taskings.
   2.24.1. The IDO will identify, accept, validate, and verify all assigned taskings for host,
   tenant, and GSUs. The IDO and base units tasked to support an OPLAN or CONPLAN will
   be familiar with the plan’s concept of operations, basic plan, and the tasking.
   2.24.2. In addition to contingency planning taskings (OPLANs/ CONPLANs), the IDO will
   identify UTCs postured in the UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS) for all units. The IDO
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               71


   will review installation taskings with planners, unit commanders, and UDMs to validate the
   posturing, AEF alignment, and P-coding of their respective units. Validation includes
   assessing the ability to support and execute MISCAP statements, whether UTC equipment
   and personnel requirements can be met, and whether readiness reporting in ART is correct.
   Deficiencies will be identified and reported to the appropriate MAJCOM FAM.
   2.24.3. MAJCOM/NGB FAMs, working with unit commanders and following Air Staff
   FAM guidance, posture units by entering a UTC for that specific unit (UIC) into UTC
   Availability. Multiple occurrences of a UTC for a unit will have a separate Record Number.
   MAJCOM FAMs, unit commanders, and UDMs must ensure the maximum number of
   funded authorizations assigned to the UMD are postured in standard UTCs. Any residual
   deployable authorizations not in standard UTCs will be postured into associate UTCs (A-
   UTCs). Commanders and UDMs must ensure that Air Force manning positions are not
   assigned to more than one UTC record. See AFI 10-401 for deviations from this policy.
   2.24.4. After validating all postured positions, unit commanders, UDMs, IDOs, and planners
   will check the P-coding of postured UTC records and the subsequent AEF alignment. The P-
   coding will indicate the maximum number of UTCs of the type requested can be deployed
   simultaneously during normal rotational operations or during the various levels of surge.
   UTCs will be aligned as equally as possible between two AEF libraries (not applicable for
   ARC) or in the Enabler library. Unit commanders will work with MAJCOM and Air Staff
   FAMs to appropriately code capabilities required for home station and properly align the
   postured UTCs (see AFI 10-401, Chapter 7).
   2.24.5. Definitions for P-Coded Standard Deployable and Associate UTCs are spelled out in
   AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
   2.24.6. After assessing UTC posturing, AEF alignment, and planned AEF Taskings, the IDO
   and planning community can determine an installation’s maximum simultaneous deployment
   capability (maximum number of personnel and equipment that can be deployed
   simultaneously during maximum surge operations). All UTC Availability records that are
   ―Homestation Requirements‖ are coded DX_ and Home Station missions that directly
   supports a Combatant Commander’s mission or are deployed within the assigned theater are
   coded DP_. All others are DW_ coded. The maximum simultaneous deployment capability
   will be the total number of DW_ coded UTCs across all the AEF libraries the installation is
   aligned against. That will be the maximum number of personnel deployable at one time from
   that particular installation (although there may be additional through put).
2.25. Location and Risk Assessment.
   2.25.1. A second consideration in determining worst-case scenario is location and the
   accompanying risk assessment.
   2.25.2. A unit in Korea may not deploy very many personnel, but they could be in a high-
   risk locale (fight in-place) and they may be on the receiving end of deploying forces. They
   may also have to plan for a NEO. So they will have to plan for the purchase, storage, and
   maintenance of a large quantity of IPE due to the high-risk location (see AFMAN 10-2602,
   Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional Defense Operations and Standards, Table
   2.2). In addition, if they have incoming forces they"d have to plan for the capacity to off-
   load, process, transport, and/or bed down additional personnel. And simultaneously, they
 72                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   may need to plan for capacity to evacuate non-combatants. Some of the risk may be
   mitigated with pre-positioned materiel, contingency contracts, and host-nation support, but
   all would have to be factored into their worst-case scenario.
   2.25.3. On the opposite end of the location and risk spectrum, an AF Space Command
   (AFSPC) unit in Colorado may also "fight in-place." But they could be considered a low-risk
   locale and wouldn't expect to receive additional personnel. So while the units in Korea and
   Colorado may have similar numbers of DW_ or DP_ coded UTCs, their planning
   requirements may be completely dissimilar.
   2.25.4. As such, even though functional planners, unit personnel, and the IDO estimate the
   worst-case scenario, final estimated requirements must be agreed to by squadron
   commanders and signed by the wing commander. These requirements will be reviewed at
   least annually or whenever the estimates increase or decrease by 10%.
2.26. Deployment (Mobility) Bags and Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).
   2.26.1. The IDO will analyze and determine deployment bag and IPE requirements at least
   annually NLT 1 January. The numbers will be based on the total number of A/DW_ coded
   UTCs in UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS) for that wing/installation (J-suffix coded
   UTCs may not have the same requirements unless directed by the owning command).
   MAJCOMs will provide further guidance for requirements computation and coordination.
      2.26.1.1. NOTE: For locations in medium or high threat areas as noted in AFMAN 10-
      2602, Table 2.2, planners will use formulas as prescribed in 23-series AFIs to meet home
      station protective requirements in addition to deployment requirements.
      2.26.1.1. (AMC) C-1 bag requirements will be determined IAW AFI 10-2501, Table 3,
      which directs inclusion of the DXS coded UTCs in calculating requirements for C-1 bags.
      2.26.1.2. (Added-AMC) The IDO must provide HQ AMC/A4RX and A4RW a copy of
      this report NLT 15 Jan of each year. AMC/A4RX will provide instructions regarding
      submission of this report in the month prior to the report due date.
      2.26.1.3. (Added-AMC) Out of cycle updates are required to reflect authorization
      changes that exceed the ten percent back-up variance, requirements should be reviewed
      when a unit undergoes a mission change, BRAC etc. The IDO will assess deployment
      taskings upon:
          2.26.1.3.1. (Added-AMC) Activation of a new unit with a deployment commitment.
          2.26.1.3.2. (Added-AMC) A major change in manpower or equipment
          authorizations that result in changes to installation deployment policy or processes.
          2.26.1.3.3. (Added-AMC) A unit move or mission design series (MDS) change by a
          tenant or subordinate unit.
          2.26.1.3.4. (Added-AMC) Receipt of newly published deployment guidance from
          USAF/ A4RX or AMC/A4RX.
   2.26.2. There may be circumstances where the requirement is greater than the maximum
   simultaneous deployment capability (e.g., at overseas installations where non-deployable
   personnel may be stationed in the AOR and require protective equipment at home station).
   The IDO will consult with the CE Readiness Flight, the LRS Readiness Flight WRM section,
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                73


  and the Medical Group to determine the installation’s total requirement. See AFI 10-2501
  and AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2 (USAF Standard Base Supply System), Chapter 26,
  for determining CBRNE and IPE content and requirements, respectively.
  2.26.3. A/DX_ and A/DPS coded UTCs may share equipment/supplies with DW_ coded
  authorizations.
  2.26.4. Adding 10% to the total minimum required deployment bags and IPE allows for
  cases where equipment sharing is otherwise impossible, such as when deployments overlap,
  during declared surge operations, or when an equipment hand-off between deploying and
  redeploying individuals is otherwise not possible. MAJCOMS will determine tariff-sizing
  requirements.
  2.26.5. Gas Masks. As a minimum, installations must procure gas masks for all
  authorizations except those in CONUS-based or low-risk OCONUS-based DXX and DPX
  coded UTCs. Units should consider procuring an additional 10% of masks since they must be
  fitted to individuals and any individual authorization may be required to deploy (e.g.,
  personnel in DXX/DPX coded UTCs can deploy when personnel from DW_/DPS coded
  UTCs are at home station). MAJCOMS will determine tariff-sizing requirements.
  2.26.6. Insect Vector Control Measures. Units/installations will maintain adequate stocks of
  DEET, Permethrin, and insect bed nets and poles to meet their maximum simultaneous
  deployment capability.
     2.26.6.1. IDOs and units will consult AOR reporting instructions, OPLANs/
     CONPLANs, AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 2, Part 2for more details on quantities, procurement,
     storage, maintenance, and shelf-life issues.
  2.26.7. While the IDO, CE Readiness, and the LRS/CC (or Chief of Supply where LRS
  doesn’t exist) determine quantities required for deployment bags, the procurement, storage,
  and management responsibilities vary. A- and B-Bags are purchased with line Organization
  & Maintenance (O&M) funds. C-Bag components are requisitioned IAW AFI 23-226,
  Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (CWDE) Consolidated Mobility Bag Management,
  (for CONUS and ANG units) or through standard base supply procedures (OCONUS units).
  A- and B-Bags are generally stored by the LRS unless Support Agreements or
  Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) specify that the unit will store them. C-Bags are
  usually stored by the LRS unless local agreements specify otherwise.
     2.26.7.1. Inventory and shelf-life control of deployment bags will be maintained in
     Mobility Inventory Control and Accountability System (MICAS) by the storing
     organization. The storing unit is also responsible for inspection, repair, and replacement.
     See AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 2, Part 2, Chapter 26, for more on management and shelf-life
     control.
     2.26.7.2. (Added-AMC) Mobility Bag Requirements.
         2.26.7.2.1. (Added-AMC) Detailed AMC mobility bag policy can be found in AMC
         SUP 1 to AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 2 Chapter 26.
         2.26.7.2.2. (Added-AMC) D-Bags: Requirement for deployable aircrew members.
         (For specific guidance, see AMCI 10-403)
 74                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          2.26.7.2.3. (Added-AMC) D-Bag Required Contents: D-Bag items outline aircrew
          chemical defense requirements for AMC aircrews as specified in AFI 11-301V1,
          AMCSUP1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program. For specifics see AMCI 10-
          403.
2.27. Weapons and Ammunition.
   2.27.1. The IDO will determine the number of weapons required to support an installation's
   maximum simultaneous deployment capability on an annual basis. The IDO, in coordination
   with the Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO), will utilize AFCAT 21-209 Vol 1
   and Vol 2 and AFI 21-201 to determine the authorized quantities of ammunition to be
   positioned on the installation to support deployment capability on an annual basis.
   MAJCOMs will provide guidance for requirements computation and coordination.
   2.27.2. As noted in AFI 31-207, commanders may arm deployable forces to support
   contingency, wartime, or training operations. IDOs and units will consult OPLANs and
   CONPLANs that the installation is tasked to support for specifics describing the type of
   firearms required, the arming mission, the anticipated tasks armed members will perform,
   and the command and control elements.
      2.27.2.1. Tasking messages (or reporting instructions) will also describe arming
      requirements for current operations.
   2.27.3. As a minimum, the number of weapons required will include all DW_ coded
   positions (except those exempted under the Geneva Convention). J-suffix coded UTCs may
   not be required to have weapons unless directed by the owning command. IDOs and units
   will consult AFCAT 21-209 Vol. 1, Chapter 3, and AFI 21-201 to determine ammunition
   quantities authorized to position at the base to support deployment requirements.
      2.27.3.1. While the IDO is responsible for determining the number of weapons required
      to support installation deployment requirements, procurement, establishment of accounts,
      documentation, transportation, and maintenance of weapons and ammunition are all unit
      responsibilities. Munitions accountability is established IAW AFI 21-201.
2.28. Medical Requirements.
   2.28.1. The IDO will assist the Medical Group developing a process to ensure deploying
   personnel have received or have immediate access to required force health protection
   prescription products (FHPPP). FHPPP is comprised of atropine/2-PAM chloride auto-
   injectors. Other items that may be required but are not FHPPP include immunizations;
   sunscreen; DEET/Permethrin; lip balm; malaria prophylaxis; pyridostigmine bromide (PB)
   tablets, and convulsive antidote for nerve agents (see AFJI 48-110). FHPP requirements must
   be on CED orders before FHPP can be dispensed to member.

Section 2E—Installation Deployment Plan (IDP) Development

2.29. Installation Deployment Plan (IDP).
   2.29.1. The Host Installation/Wing Commander, through the IDP, defines the local
   processes, procedures, infrastructure, and resources used to deploy forces. The IDO develops
   the IDP for the Host Installation/Wing Commander. The IDO must analyze inputs from all
   assigned units (including collocated, GSU, tenant, and transient units) and develop local
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  75


  operations guidance on how units will deploy from the installation. The IDP must contain
  detailed deployment guidance that reflects the installation’s current deployment processes
  and mission. Include processes for executing all contingencies, exercises, and other
  deployments (e.g., weapons training deployments, tactical leadership programs, airfield
  closures, etc.). The IDP must describe who, what, when, where, and how the installation
  meets each basic deployment requirement. As the deployment process owner, the host wing
  commander must ensure the IDO and the deployment planning and execution community are
  in step with his or her direction. The IDO will brief the Host Installation/Wing commander
  and senior staff annually, as a minimum, on IDP requirements as listed in Attachment 14. A
  sample IDP can be downloaded from the AF/AFRX Portal website.
  2.29.2. The IDP must have the flexibility to process a single individual and be robust enough
  to cover the base’s largest possible deployment, or maximum simultaneous deployment
  capability.
     2.29.2.1. The first step in creating an IDP must be determining the maximum
     simultaneous deployment capability. With that established capability requirement, they
     may program for the equipment, supplies, facilities, and infrastructure in addition to
     working the personnel actions necessary to meet planned capacity.
     2.29.2.2. The IDP should include an infrastructure assessment such as facilities and ramp
     space to bed down, feed, train, deploy, and redeploy forces and their required supporting
     materiel. Included should be any capacity commercial support may provide such as
     transportation.
     2.29.2.3. Considerations must also be made for the installation’s handling throughput as
     a result of being designated an aggregation point APOE. A preplanned analysis of
     capabilities and limitations will ensure an effective and efficient plan if selected to be an
     aggregation APOE.
     2.29.2.4. IDPs for forward presence forces should include host nation (HN) resources
     available to successfully execute deployment and redeployment operations. HN
     agreements, such as status-of-forces agreements and multinational and/or bilateral
     agreements negotiated before crisis situations arise facilitate needed access to HN
     resources. HNs may provide a variety of services through their national agencies in
     support of deployment and redeployment execution.
  2.29.3. To mitigate risk, the IDP should continually consider ORM throughout the
  deployment planning and execution process, taking advantage of the expertise at their local
  safety offices and the tools and techniques contained in publications.
     2.29.3.1. IDO, in coordination with the local integrated base defense (IBD) OPRs, will
     determine if there is an increased threat to, and the criticality of, mass forces staging for
     deployment to ensure proper Force Protection flexibility is incorporated into the IDP.
     Counterintelligence, intelligence, and security forces OPRs conduct risk assessments
     IAW DoD O-2000.12-H, DoD Antiterrorism Handbook.
  2.29.4. After the IDO and the deployment planning and execution community complete data
  collection and determine the maximum simultaneous deployment capability, they start
  answering the necessary questions for the wing commander briefing as part of the IDP. They
  prepare facilities for processing or conducting command and control activities; they train
76                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  personnel involved in the process; and they acquire the MHE, scales, communications
  equipment, and programs necessary to implement the plan. They develop personnel and
  equipment processes tailored to the unique requirements of the installation, to include
  processing tenants and units from off base.
  2.29.5. As a minimum, the IDP must address the following areas: deployment roles and
  responsibilities, pre-execution procedures, deployment work-center organization and
  facilities, unit personnel and equipment assembly areas, cargo marshaling yards, installation-
  level passenger and cargo processing facilities/locations, execution procedures, weapons and
  ground safety concerns (including ORM mitigation procedures), deployment training
  requirements, deployment process flowcharts, and pre-processing procedures (see
  Attachment 3 and Attachment 5 as guidelines to responsibilities and processes).
     2.29.5.1. The IDP must clearly define the processes for individual issue and mass issue
     of mobags, weapons, and ammunition. It must lay out storage, inventory, and
     maintenance responsibilities for mobility bags, weapons, ammunition, insect vector
     control measures (e.g., DEET), and first aid kit requirements.
     2.29.5.2. The IDP will identify how the wing will use all components of IDS, to include
     a backup process for using LSA for deployments (see Attachment 18).
     2.29.5.2. (AMC) IC 2007-1 to AFI 31-101, AMC Supplement 1 provides policy
     regarding installation commander authority for allowing transportation of Category II, III
     or IV arms and associated ammunition in privately owned vehicles.
         2.29.5.2.1. These procedures will address timelines and receipt/production of
         personnel and cargo files for manifesting, AALPS files for load planning, LOGMOD
         and CMOS/GATES interfaces for ITV, and RFID tag requirements.
     2.29.5.3. The IDP must identify how the installation will work within the AEF construct.
     It must define how taskings are received; who receives the tasking; who is notified; how
     taskings are validated; timelines for validation, sourcing, and shortfalls; and how
     shortfalls are processed (see Attachment 4 for typical process flowcharts). It must also
     define the substitution process for both skill level/grade substitutions and AFSC
     substitutions.
     2.29.5.4. The IDP will reflect mass and individual processing procedures. It will include
     interface procedures to receive, process, and deploy individuals and independent units
     departing by airlift or surface to an APOE or from the installation when designated an
     aggregate APOE.
     2.29.5.5. See Attachment 15 for minimum content of the IDP.
  2.29.6. The IDP will be reviewed annually by the IDO. IDOs will republish or revise the
  IDP within 6 months after any of the following:
     2.29.6.1. Activation of a new unit with a deployment commitment.
     2.29.6.2. A major change in manpower or equipment authorizations that result in
     changes to installation deployment policy or processes.
     2.29.6.3. A unit move or mission design series (MDS) change by a tenant or subordinate
     unit.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                77


      2.29.6.4. Receipt of newly published deployment guidance or changes from USAF
      A4RX.
          2.29.6.4.1. (Added-AMC) Receipt of newly published deployment guidance from
          AMC/A4RX.
   2.29.7. The IDP must identify process and physical choke points and provide guidance on
   how to eliminate them or reduce the impact of them on deployment operations.
   2.29.8. Tenant units will deploy IAW host deployment guidance. The host IDO determines
   specific support requirements based on tenant unit taskings and available resources.

Section 2F—Logistics Plan Development and Management

2.30. Integrated Deployment System (IDS).
   2.30.1. Preparation for deployment includes tailoring, task organizing, and echeloning forces
   and materiel for deployment as well as documenting the sequence of deployment and
   movement requirements on the appropriate TPFDD. IDS is the Air Force system for
   accomplishing these tasks.
   2.30.2. The use of IDS is mandatory for all deployments. The IDS is the automated family of
   systems used for wing-level deployments and contingency operations. IDS includes the
   following: LOGMOD, DCAPES, CMOS, and AALPS. Deploying unit cargo information is
   consolidated in LOGMOD and passed via file transfer to CMOS by the Logistics Plans
   function within the IDRC/DCC to provide ITV information to GTN. Deploying passenger
   information is consolidated in LOGMOD and passed via file transfer to DCAPES and
   subsequently to CMOS to provide ITV information. Failure to use integrated systems
   correctly reduces in-transit visibility and the JFC’s capability to see force closure. NOTE:
   CONUS AMC strategic aerial ports and OCONUS en routes as defined in the DTR may use
   GATES instead of CMOS to meet in-transit visibility requirements. IDS passenger manifests
   are not required for commercially ticketed passengers.
   2.30.3. The IDO will direct Logistics Readiness and Manpower offices to develop
   LOGMOD and DCAPES planning files for use in the IDS as required.
   2.30.4. The Logistics Plans function will maintain unique deployment planning data for all
   taskings.
      2.30.4.1. At a minimum, the installation Log Planners in the LRS Readiness Flight (or
      equivalent) will develop and maintain the following separate LOGPLAN files:
          2.30.4.1.1. A master LOGPLAN file containing all UTCs listed as available for
          tasking by the UTC Availability (formerly AFWUS). The master LOGPLAN file will
          consist of the standard LOGDET for every UTC the wing is tasked with. The UTCs
          in this file will not be tailored.
          2.30.4.1.2. A LOGPLAN file for each OPLAN and CONPLAN the wing is tasked to
          support.
          2.30.4.1.3. A separate LOGPLAN file for each AEF pair the wing supports (and for
          the Enablers the installation supports).
 78                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          2.30.4.1.4. They may also build separate LOGPLAN files to support local exercise or
          contingency plans.
      2.30.4.2. OPLAN and Pseudo PIDs: Units will maintain deployment planning data
      unique to their unit UTC tasking in the LOGPLAN module of LOGMOD. Individual
      LOGPLAN PIDs will be created for each tasked OPLAN, CONPLAN with TPFDD,
      and/or notional tasking such as an AEF. Units will use only HQ USAF-approved Pseudo
      PIDs in LOGPLAN in lieu of actual OPLAN PIDs for contingency planning to minimize
      the risk of classifying LOGMOD. Units tasked under specific OPLANs will build each
      LOGPLAN PID using the first four characters of the approved corresponding Air Force-
      approved Pseudo PID, and leave the fifth character blank (EXAMPLE: WOTJ_). In the
      DSOE module of LOGMOD, units will maintain corresponding information using the
      full five-character Air Force-approved Pseudo PID (EXAMPLE: WOTJZ). NOTE: Units
      must use a different character in the fifth position of the LOGPLAN PID because
      LOGMOD will not support the use of the same PID in both LOGPLAN and DSOE. The
      reason units are required to use the full five-character Pseudo PID in DSOE is because
      units will be required to pass DSOE data to their MAJCOM in order to populate
      contingency and execution TPFDDs with tailored deployment data. A list of Air Force-
      approved Pseudo PIDs may be obtained from the MAJCOM LOGMOD Manager.
      Specific instructions regarding the passing of data from DSOEs are identified in
      Attachment 8.
          2.30.4.2.1. Under no circumstances will units classify their LOGMOD database by
          loading actual classified PIDs in LOGMOD (LOGPLAN or DSOE).
          2.30.4.2.2. Do not identify the AOR or exact location, geographic location
          (GEOLOC) code, or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code of a
          deployment in the DSOE ID Title or Destination data field of the LOGMOD DSOE
          ID header record. This minimum information will classify a LOGMOD database.
          Guidance on JOPES data element classifications can be found in CJCSM 3122.01,
          Joint Operation Planning and Execution System Volume I (Planning Policies and
          Procedures) and CJCSM 3150.16b, Volume 2, Joint Planning and Execution System
          Reporting Structure (JOPESREP).
      2.30.4.3. The starting point for determining deploying unit equipment is the standard
      LOGDET found in LOGFOR. Logistics Plans will copy UTCs from LOGFOR into
      LOGPLAN to build LOGPLAN PIDs.
2.31. Tailoring UTC Logistics Detail in LOGPLAN.
   2.31.1. Tailoring is the process by which base-level units make a generic capability fit a
   specific purpose, region, supported or supporting command instruction. MAJCOM FAMs are
   the approval authority for any significant tailoring action such as addition or deletion of UTC
   personnel and/or mobility equipment that may otherwise impact the overall mission or
   movement of a UTC. Tailoring must either be directed by the MAJCOM FAM in writing or
   based on an approved planning document (OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD, AEF
   planning/execution conference, ESPs, Exercise Support Plans, Site Surveys, etc.).
   2.31.2. Tailoring out cargo is permitted if authoritative documentation states what required
   assets are in-place and available at the deployed location for their use. Pre-positioned assets
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                79


  identified in the War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR), the ESP, and/or
  TPFDD WRM UTCs will be tailored from the standard LOGDET UTC gross weight.
  Tailored weights will be based on the gross incremental weight of each item and adjusted in
  the appropriate TPFDD. Units will tailor their LOGPLAN UTCs by adding, deleting, and
  modifying applicable increments, items, and suffix items.
  2.31.3. AEF lead wings in collaboration with supporting wings/units will use LOGMOD’s
  LOGPLAN Module to tailor equipment for AEF deployments. LOGPLAN files can be easily
  passed to the lead wing, the wing/units currently deployed, and to the various supporting
  wings to assist in the collaborative process to ensure the right capability is provided at the
  right time in the right way to meet the mission and to refine/reduce the deployment footprint.
  2.31.4. Tailoring must not change the mission capability of a UTC as described in the UTC
  MISCAP.
  2.31.5. Adding equipment items to LOGPLAN is prohibited unless the item has been added
  to the standard UTC by its Pilot Unit and approved by the USAF FAM and LOGDET
  Manager for that UTC or is contained in an approved Allowance Standard (AS) for that
  UTC. For CE, no equipment item can be added to a standard UTC unless it is identified on
  the Equipment and Supply List (ESL) as well as contained in applicable AS.
     2.31.5.1. Deployable equipment items added to a UTC are considered Use Code ―A‖ as
     reflected in an AS by an Allowance Source Code (ASC).
     2.31.5.2. Non-equipment items may be added to LOGPLAN if they are required to
     directly support the mission specified in the MISCAP for the UTC.
     2.31.5.3. Tailoring must not cause the gross movement weight of the LOGPLAN UTC to
     exceed the standard LOGFOR UTC. USTRANSCOM and AMC currently plan airlift
     requirements based on the standard LOGFOR UTC weight and cube reported to JOPES.
     EXCEPTION: If units bulk-ship small arms weapons, small arms ammunition,
     deployment/mobility bags and expendables, then they may add these weights to the
     LOGPLAN file. Do not count the weight of these items against the UTC when comparing
     the gross transportation weight to the LOGFOR UTC. Report these differences in the
     respective TPFDD during crisis action planning when importing unit LOGPLAN/DSOE
     files into DCAPES, which, in turn, provides updated data to the JOPES database. Make
     every effort to bulk ship mobility bags and weapons. Units will also determine if pre-
     deployed weapons, ammunition, and mobility bags that are centrally managed and
     distributed within certain AORs at ETDCs during their tailoring efforts. If so, this will
     eliminate the need for Airmen to deploy with these assets. Units may only tailor out these
     assets when the planning documents or theater directives make it clear that these assets
     are available for a specific unit’s or UTC’s use.
         2.31.5.3.1. Base-level units will compare LOGPLAN UTC weight to LOGFOR
         weight annually to ensure compliance with above. This review will be documented
         and maintained in the LRS Readiness Flight.
         2.31.5.3.2. Reference Attachment 8 for unit-level UTC reporting process.
         2.31.5.3.3. If there is a requirement to exceed standard UTC equipment weights, the
         AFCHQ must contact the supported commander to ensure the additional weight is
 80                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


          accounted for before validation occurs between supported commander and
          USTRANSCOM. This should only occur in unique circumstances such as
          environmental requirements (i.e., additional AGE requirements) or other such factors.
   2.31.6. Units will maintain documentation (memo for record) on equipment that has been
   tailored (added or deleted) from their LOGPLAN UTCs for historical and compliance
   inspection purposes until UTCs have been officially changed IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 7.
   Units will provide Logistics Planners in the LRS Readiness Flight copies of all
   documentation. If non-pilot units have to add items to their LOGPLAN UTC(s) in order to
   meet mission requirements, the pilot unit and MAJCOM UTC FAM should be notified in
   case a change to the LOGDET is required for all like units.
2.32. Pre-Planned Load Plans.
   2.32.1. The Logistics Plans function in the LRS Readiness Flight should maintain pre-
   planned load plans for tasked OPLANs/CONPLANs. Creating pre-planned load plans is an
   ideal training tool for members of the deployment team. However, MAJCOMs will
   determine if pre-planned load plans are mandatory for their wings and will specify the type
   transportation mode and means their wings will use to develop these load plans.
       2.32.1.1. If directed by MAJCOM, wings will pre-plan based on a prioritized flow of
       personnel and equipment needed to generate and provide immediate combat capability
       and/or humanitarian support capability upon arrival at the deployed location. C-17s will
       be the standard planning aircraft unless other organic (unit-owned) airlift is planned.
       2.32.1.1. (AMC) Pre-planned load plans are not required for AMC wings for deliberate
       planning purposes. This does not eliminate the need for pre-load and load plans during
       deployment execution processing.
2.33. Prioritization of Cargo.
   2.33.1. Echeloning is organizing units for movement. It is a pre-deployment activity that
   establishes a priority for movement within a capability (UTC), unit, or wing. Proper
   sequencing of forces into the AOR and/or JOA promotes the rapid buildup of capabilities that
   permit the supported CCDR to seize the initiative and conduct successful decisive operations
   as early as possible.
   2.33.2. Units will maintain LOGPLAN files for their tasked OPLANs/CONPLANs. The
   OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD priority flow must be reflected in each LOGPLAN PID. Units
   will prioritize the out-movement of equipment using both Deployment Echelon codes (See
   JCS Pub 6, Volume V, part 4; AFI 10-401, Chapter 5; MEFPAK; LOGMOD System Help
   files; and LOGMOD Users Guide) and the Movement Priority fields in LOGPLAN. NOTE:
   Use Deployment Echelon codes in contingency planning and use Movement Priority fields
   during crisis action to reflect changing requirements at execution. These are mandatory
   entries in LOGPLAN that improve connectivity between LOGMOD and other IDS
   components. Transportation Control Movement Data (TCMD)/AALPS data is required for
   LOGPLAN files.
       2.33.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC units will maintain a separate DSOE-ID file for UTCs
       listed in UTA or across all AEF libraries to include the enabler library. This allows
       visibility over all UTC taskings and provides the ability to assign names to UTC positions
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                    81


     and the identification of personnel shortfalls. For the UTA DSOE-ID, units should assign
     personnel to their maximum simultaneous deployment capability (the total of all DW_
     coded UTCs) as depicted in the UTAS, and then assign remaining personnel to remaining
     UTA UTCs. This is the only DSOE-ID which must be maintained with personnel
     assignments. This ensures compliance with para 2.21.1.1.
  2.33.3. LOGMOD users or administrators will not change deployment echelon codes and
  increment numbers identified in standard UTCs in LOGPLAN without written authorization
  from the MAJCOM UTC FAM or HHQ approval. When pilot units develop standard UTC
  requirements they are tasked to identify everything required to sustain a unit in an austere
  base environment for a period of up to 30 days, at which time re-supply will begin or may
  have already begun. As such, pilot units will develop these requirements based on the UTC
  MISCAP and Weapon/Non-Weapon System AS that are the baseline for LOGDET
  development. Pilot units are required to prioritize the out-movement of cargo in such a
  manner that the minimum equipment needed to support the MDS for weapons loading and/or
  regeneration of aircraft (for aviation UTCs) and/or essential equipment requirements
  necessary to establish base operations at the employed location (i.e., force protection, rapid
  runway repair, communications, lodging/food preparations, etc) be deployed on the first
  available support airlift to the forward operating location (FOL). Pilot units prioritize the out-
  movement of equipment using deployment echelons and increment numbers.
     2.33.3.1. If non-pilot units have differing opinions as to what equipment should be
     deployed first, second, and third, they are required to identify their prioritization
     requirements using the Movement Priority field for each increment of cargo within the
     LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD.
  2.33.4. For contingency and crisis action planning, units will use the LOGPLAN Movement
  Priority field to identify when UTCs and/or increments within a UTC will deploy. Movement
  priority is based on TPFDD C-day requirements, DOC statement response times, or HHQ
  guidance. In LOGMOD, the Movement Priority field defaults to a zero. Zero is not an
  acceptable value to use when prioritizing movement priorities for UTCs or increments within
  a UTC.
  2.33.5. Two of the most efficient ways of utilizing the Movement Priority field in LOGMOD
  are by UTC or within a UTC.
     2.33.5.1. Prioritizing by UTC means organizing flow of capabilities by ULN based on
     TPFDD requirements (i.e., ALD, ready-to-load date (RLD), or RDD). For example, units
     would assign ―0001‖ to every increment within the first UTC scheduled to deploy and
     assign ―0002‖ to every increment within the second UTC scheduled to deploy. By doing
     this, DCC schedulers would have clear visibility as to which increments needed to deploy
     at which times when creating a schedule of events in the DSOE module of LOGMOD.
     2.33.5.2. Prioritizing within a UTC means units will prioritize, by increment, within each
     UTC. To do this, units should look at each increment and determine which ones need to
     deploy first, second, third, etc. based on unit-unique requirements. EXAMPLE: Three
     different UTCs may all be required to be at the employment location at the same time (or
     on the same day), but only certain increments from each UTC need to be in-place for
     aircraft generation and base operations set-up. By prioritizing within each UTC, units
     would designate those essential increments, from each UTC, by assigning ―0001‖ in the
 82                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      Movement Priority field. By doing this, DCC schedulers would have clear visibility over
      the higher priority increments (coded as 0001) as opposed to those with a lesser priority
      (coded as 0002, 0003, 0004, etc). Another option when using the Movement Priority field
      in LOGMOD is to assign UTC increments based on pre-planned load plans. EXAMPLE:
      All increments scheduled to deploy on chalk 1 would have a movement priority of 0001.
      Those increments scheduled to deploy on chalk 2 would have a movement priority of
      0002.
2.34. AF 463L Pallets.
   2.34.1. AF 463L pallets are the mandatory cargo-packing platform for the Air Force
   standard LOGDET because they are the most versatile for aircraft load planning. However,
   pallets with container attached/palletized container, Internal Slingable Units (ISU), may be
   used as a suitable substitute for 463L pallets in unit LOGPLAN development. Pallets with
   container attached or palletized containers (i.e., ISUs) must be purchased at unit expense.
      2.34.1.1. Not all types of ISUs will fit on all types of military or commercial aircraft.
      Units should ensure that if they do purchase/use ISUs, that they have types that will fit on
      all AMC/commercial type aircraft, including DC-8s, KC-10s, and KC-135s.
      2.34.1.2. Units designed to move on their own organic airlift may plan their types of ISU
      purchase/use on that, but it does not relieve them of the requirement to maintain 463L
      pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to meet the determined requirement.
   2.34.2. Standard 463L pallets and nets used for non-WRM UTC taskings are considered
   operational equipment, not WRM. NOTE: Pallets and nets used for movement of WRM
   assets are still designated as WRM per AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program
   Guidance and Procedures. Units must maintain and account for pallets and nets used for
   standard UTC requirements. The IDO must consolidate installation deployment pallet and net
   requirements and forward to the IPNM. IDOs and units must consider their maximum
   simultaneous deployment capability when determining their operational pallets and nets
   requirement and should identify any shortages or excesses to the IPNM so that assets may be
   redistributed, as required.
      2.34.2.1. The Traffic Management Flight, Air Terminal Operations Element will monitor
      the WRM 463L Pallet and Net program for the base and ensure submission of M&Q
      8701 report for WRM pallets and nets to the IPNM IAW AFI 25-101 and DOD 4500.9-
      R, DTR, Part VI - Management and Control of Intermodal Containers and System 463L
      Equipment. NOTE: HQ AMC/A4 will determine WRM pallet and net requirements to
      support mail, sustainment, and movement of AMC WRM assets.
      2.34.2.2. An IPNM will be designated by the MSG/CC and will inspect and report on all
      base pallet and net assets, both operational and WRM, to their appropriate MAJCOM
      managers as directed in DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part VI. All ANG and AFRC units, despite
      where they are located, will report their requirements directly to HQ ANG A4RX or
      AFRC A4X offices, respectively.
      2.34.2.3. If containers or palletized containers are used, units must be able to meet airlift
      constraints and must not exceed the weight and cube of the standard UTC LOGDET.
      Units with a minimum amount of equipment should continue to use 463L pallets.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  83


   2.34.3. LOGMOD automatically assigns standard planning information (weights,
   dimensional data, and quantities) to items 01, 02, and 03 when pilot/non-pilot units develop
   pallet increment types. The overall dimensions of a 463L pallet are 88 inches by 108 inches,
   by 2 1/4 inches thick. However, the usable dimensions of the upper surface are 84 inches by
   104 inches. This allows for two inches around the periphery to attach straps, nets, or other
   restraint devices. An empty 463L pallet weighs 290 pounds (355 pounds with nets) and has a
   maximum, netted load capacity of 10,000 pounds. The desired load capacity is 7,500 pounds
   (to help prolong pallet life). ISUs, Cadillac Bins, Brooks & Perkins containers, and married
   pallets/pallet trains are not considered LOGMOD Pallet Type Increments and will not be
   loaded as such in the LOGFOR module of LOGMOD.
   2.34.4. Pilot/non-pilot units will load pallet dunnage as Item 04 for all pallet increments
   using the following movement characteristics: Length 88, Width 4, Height 4, Weight 30
   pounds, with a quantity of three. Pilot/non-pilot units will use the appropriate National Stock
   Number (NSN) for dunnage obtained through the LRS Customer Service Center. Dunnage
   (e.g., lumber or timber) is placed under 463L pallets to prevent damage to the lower pallet
   surface and to aid in transportation with a forklift. The minimum dimensions of a piece of
   dunnage are 4x4x88 inches long. Use three pieces to support each loaded 463L pallet while
   on the ground. Many different materials may be used as dunnage. Wood is the cheapest and
   most readily available type; however, commercially available plastic dunnage is lighter and
   more durable. All 463L pallets will be shipped with dunnage. This is both required for
   deployment and redeployment and must be provided by the user (ref T.O 35D33-2-2-2 and
   T.O. 35D33-2-3-1).
   2.34.5. Pilot units will ensure ISUs, Cadillac Bins, or Brooks & Perkins containers are not
   loaded in lieu of, or as a substitute for 463L pallets and nets within standard Air Force
   LOGDETs. Possession of ISUs does not relieve a unit of their responsibility/requirement to
   maintain 463L pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to meet the determined requirement.
   EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 25-101, BEAR UTCs can only be shipped containerized and are
   therefore exempt from this guidance for items that must be containerized. This does not
   include RSP for Bare Base Systems and items that may be shipped in other than containers
   provided within the UTC buy. MEFPAK Responsible Agency LOGDET Managers will
   identify all LOGDETs that contain ISUs to the pilot unit for immediate corrective action.
   2.34.6. Pilot units will ensure the palletized increments within the standard UTC LOGDET
   do not exceed 10,000 pounds. Non-pilot units will ensure palletized increments within the
   LOGPLAN Module of LOGMOD do not exceed 10,000 pounds.
   2.34.7. Pilot units will physically build, weigh, and measure each increment of cargo when
   developing and maintaining standard UTC LOGDETs.
2.35. Maintaining Manpower and Personnel Data.
   2.35.1. Wing Manpower and Organization Flight (MOF) (MPF for ARC units) will use
   DCAPES to maintain the MANFOR UTC File. The Wing MOF will use the base-unique PID
   as identified by the MAJCOM DCAPES Sub-FM to build all UTC requirements available for
   tasking as found in the MAJCOM provided UTC Availability listing. This plan must
   maintain Deployment Echelon and Deployment Sequence for out-movement priority of
   personnel. Tailoring of personnel requirements is not allowed. This information will be
 84                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   provided to the IDO, UDM, and MPF at least on a quarterly basis or when a specific plan is
   updated (information will be available in DCAPES for IDOs and UDMs).
      2.35.1.1. OPLAN manpower (personnel) taskings will be provided by the MAJCOM,
      disseminated by the IDO, and maintained separately by the MOF (MPF for ARC).
      Recommended changes to these requirements will be coordinated through the IDO,
      UDM, and MPF. The IDO will present it to the parent MAJCOM.
      2.35.1.2. The base MPF uses DCAPES to maintain the Personnel Resource File,
      personnel assignments, and execution deployment requirements. They provide this
      information to the IDO, UDM, and logistics plans function as directed by the IDO. This
      is normally accomplished through an interface within IDS.
      2.35.1.3. The MOF uses DCAPES to link MANFOR details and the UTC Availability in
      order to pass the tasked UTC to the wings/units.
      2.35.1.4. At least annually, the MOF will coordinate, and in some cases may conduct, a
      UMD to UTC tasking validation to determine if MAJCOM FAM taskings exceed
      wing/unit UMD.
      2.35.1.5. At least annually, MOF, in coordination with the LRS Readiness Flight and all
      affected units, validates UTC, AFSC, Functional Account Codes (FACs), and Personnel
      Accounting Symbol (PAS) codes with tasked unit(s) and coordinates corrective action
      required with the unit and/or designated UTC Pilot Units.
      2.35.1.6. MOF will receive Deployment Echelon and movement priority sequence
      (Deployment Sequence) from the Logistics Plans function/IDO to build the contingency
      DCAPES plans data if TPFDDs are available. If TPFDDs are not available, the Logistics
      Plans function will provide PID, UTC(s), ULNs, RDDs, Deployment Echelon, and
      Deployment Sequence Number. MOF is responsible for coordinating with tasked units’
      UDMs to validate remaining DCAPES data (i.e., PAS codes, tasked AFSCs, FACs, etc.).
      They will coordinate required changes as needed through designated Pilot Units. Provide
      a courtesy copy to the IDO and Logistics Plans function.
      2.35.1.7. The UDMs will validate DCAPES UTC data to ensure tasked AFSCs are
      assigned against the correct PAS and FAC codes, and will coordinate movement priority
      requirements through the LRS Readiness Flight/IDO as needed. UDMs will ensure their
      unit taskings do not exceed their UMD and they will coordinate corrective action through
      the MOF for resolution.
      2.35.1.8. ANG and AFRC units are not authorized a MOF; therefore, the MPF chief or
      MPF commander performs these responsibilities. Processing procedures for
      DCAPES/MANPER-B PERSCO module are documented in AFI 38-205, AFI 10-215,
      and AFCSM 10-626, Volume 2, DCAPES.
2.36. Deployment Organizational Structure.
   2.36.1. The IDO must define an effective and efficient organizational structure to meet all
   command and control, cargo, and personnel processing requirements for the installation’s
   maximum simultaneous deployment capability. Establish a DCC to serve as the installation’s
   focal point for deployment operations command and control requirements beyond the normal
   IDRC requirements. The IDRC is subsumed into the DCC when stood up. Identify
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               85


  requirements for the DCC, CDF, PDF and Unit Deployment Control Centers (UDCCs) to the
  appropriate base agencies for staffing and infrastructure support. The IDO is responsible for
  standing up the DCC, CDF, PDF, and UDCCs (in coordination with unit commanders) to
  meet the requirements of a given deployment scenario. To meet AEF rotation requirements,
  procedures for interfacing with the TMF function responsible for booking passengers
  commercially will also be established. While the IDO may or may not choose to stand up the
  deployment work centers, he or she will ensure the functions of those work centers are
  accomplished for every deployment regardless of the number of personnel or short tons
  deploying. The IDO will accomplish these actions IAW the IDP.
  2.36.2. Deployment Control Center (DCC).
     2.36.2.1. DCC Responsibilities. As the focal point for all deployment operations, the
     DCC must ensure the installation meets all deployment command and control
     requirements. The DCC is the installation focal point for identifying, verifying, and
     distributing tasking information before and during execution. The IDO is responsible for
     reviewing and monitoring all applicable classified newsgroup messages that pertain to the
     installation’s taskings. MAJCOMs will identify which newsgroups their wings are
     responsible for reviewing and monitoring. The IDO and/or their logistics plans staff will
     review and monitor DCAPES PIDs and use the AFVC to verify receipt and
     acceptance/shortfalling of taskings. Again, MAJCOMs will identify which PIDs their
     wings are responsible for monitoring.
         2.36.2.1.1. On a routine basis, the DCC may not be required to stand up if the
         responsibilities can be handled effectively in the normal operating location of the
         IDRC (i.e., the IDRC must mirror the DCC requirements in paragraph 2.35.2.3).
         Regardless of operating location, the DCC responsibilities will be filled for every
         tasking received at the wing.
         2.36.2.1.2. The DCC is responsible for coordinating all transportation actions
         required to deploy passengers and equipment/cargo, including coordinating on-base
         transportation requirements to support deployment activities through a Transportation
         representative.
     2.36.2.2. DCC Manning. DCC functions include IDO, Logistics Plans, Personnel,
     Transportation, DSOE Monitors, Supply, Admin, runners, and selected unit
     representatives. Training for each of the work centers will include a thorough knowledge
     of this instruction, the local IDP, and functional expertise in their respective
     AFSC/function. All DCC personnel require a Secret clearance.
         2.36.2.2.1. If an IDO chooses not to stand up the DCC for smaller taskings, the IDRC
         will handle all daily tasking requirements. Within the IDRC, either as permanent staff
         or part-time direct support staff, PRF may fill the DCC Personnel role, the Traffic
         Management Flight will be responsible for DCC Transportation to include
         commercial passenger booking and/or Pre/Final-Load Planning (if personnel or
         equipment are being airlifted from home station), Log Planners will still accomplish
         the DSOE and distribute it as required, and the LRS supply functions will handle the
         DCC Supply requirements. The local IDP will spell out these specifics.
86                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     2.36.2.3. DCC Requirements. Robust communications in the DCC are essential for
     positive control. Minimum IDS communications requirements include access to Secure
     Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Non-secure Internet Protocol Router
     Network (NIPRNET), secure and unsecured telephones, and access to secure and
     unsecured facsimile (fax) machines. DCC personnel require a GCCS terminal to access
     JOPES, DCAPES, Base support Planning Tool (BaS&E - formerly LOGCAT),
     LOGFAC, LOGMOD, MANPER-B, classified newsgroups, secure web sites,
     collaborative decision support tools, and other planning aids. DCC key staff should be
     provided with land mobile radios (LMR) and cell telephones, when available. Additional
     requirements include uninterrupted power and classified storage. Video surveillance of
     marshaling yards and aircraft loading operation areas is optional, but desired if direct line
     of sight of these areas is not available from the DCC. NOTE: LOGMOD requires, as a
     minimum, T-1 LAN connectivity to all UDMs’ facilities and the wide area network.
        2.36.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) AMC wings must ensure they have the capability to
        establish an alternate DCC capable of functioning as focal point for all deployment
        activities, in case of loss of the primary DCC. This includes identification of an
        alternate facility documented in the IDP.
  2.36.3. Cargo Deployment Function (CDF).
     2.36.3.1. Cargo Deployment Function Responsibilities. The CDF is responsible for all
     actions necessary to receive in-check, inspect, marshal, load plan, manifest, and supervise
     loading cargo aboard deploying aircraft or vehicles (see Attachment 4 for cargo
     processing flowcharts). The host LRS, or APS on an AMC strategic port base, is
     responsible for providing CDF training which will include this instruction, local
     deployment management documents, and, more importantly, functional expertise in their
     CDF duties.
        2.36.3.1.1. Final Load Planner. Complete final load plans to ensure maximum
        utilization of aircraft Allowable Cabin Load (ACL), ease of cargo on/offload, and
        safety of flight standards. NOTE: Recommend Load planners complete AMC
        Affiliation training course, receive AALPS training, and be trained IAW AFMAN 24-
        204(I), Preparing/Inspecting Hazardous Materials For Military Air Shipments, (See
        Attachment 5 for training requirements). Load Planners must be identified in writing
        by their unit commander (or designated representative) as being fully qualified to load
        plan. An authorization letter listing all individuals qualified to perform load planning
        duties will be maintained and updated as required by the unit. Training will be
        annotated in the individual’s training record..
        2.36.3.1.1. (AMC) AMC aerial port load planners are exempt from the AMC
        Affiliation Course requirement.
        2.36.3.1.2. Quality Control. Ensures all documentation is correct, adequate, posted,
        protected, and processed properly and that equipment/material is properly configured
        for transport. Quality Control personnel must be qualified in hazardous material
        certification and load planning. Documentation includes cargo and passenger
        manifests, load plans, hazardous material certification, and special handling
        documentation.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 87


        2.36.3.1.3. Controllers. Manage status of cargo. Update completion times in the
        DSOE module of LOGMOD. Identify potential bottlenecks and work with CDF
        personnel, units, and DCC to ensure cargo is processed on time.
        2.36.3.1.4. Cargo In-Check. Responsible for verifying that equipment has been
        received for processing, is properly marked and packaged, and meets safety and in-
        transit visibility requirements for transport.
        2.36.3.1.5. Cargo Joint Inspection (JI). Inspect equipment/cargo with the owning unit
        representatives and/or cargo terminal representative, and the load plan-qualified CDF
        representative (or loadmaster, if necessary) before the load is accepted.
        2.36.3.1.6. Cargo Marshaling. Responsible for the placement of cargo in load plan
        sequence by chalk, normally according to chalk departure times, in preparation for JI.
        2.36.3.1.7. Cargo Manifesting and Documentation: Responsible for verifying cargo
        documentation is correct and for passing information to load planners. Accurate data
        in CMOS/GATES, along with correct documentation IAW the DTR and AFI 24-238,
        are critical to ensure proper ITV.
            2.36.3.1.7.1. Produces updated and accurate DD Form 1387s, Military Shipping
            Labels, or CMOS/GATES-generated shipping placards to attach to cargo prior to
            aircraft loading. Equipment that is required in support of flight line operations and
            have permanently installed metal deployment placards will still require a
            CMOS/GATES deployment placard. Permanently installed metal deployment
            placards are not acceptable, as they do not comply with DTR guidance.
            2.36.3.1.7.2. Ensures in-transit visibility through the creation, updating, and
            affixing to cargo of RFID tags IAW AFI 24-238 and the IDP.
        2.36.3.1.8. Load Teams: Transport, load, and secure cargo on aircraft or other
        vehicles.
        2.36.3.1.9. Ramp Coordinator: Ensures effective coordination of all aircraft and
        vehicle loading operations for the IDO. Passes aircraft commander package to aircraft
        commander/loadmaster and briefs them on special cargo handling requirements.
        2.36.3.1.10. If the IDO determines full CDF augmentation/stand-up is not required,
        the TMF will ensure all required CDF responsibilities are fulfilled as applicable
        (dependent on mode/source of transportation).
     2.36.3.2. CDF Requirements. As a minimum, the CDF requires: suitable materiel
     handling equipment (K-loaders, forklifts, tow vehicles, etc.), fixed or portable scales,
     RFID tags and required support equipment (when available), approach shoring material,
     portable lighting, marking equipment for classified and hazardous equipment holding
     areas, uninterrupted power (generator), robust communications (including telephones and
     LMRs, as required) and the correct ADP equipment (ADPE). Minimum T-1 LAN
     connectivity is required to support applicable components of IDS.
  2.36.4. Personnel Deployment Function (PDF).
     2.36.4.1. The PDF is directed by JP 1-0, Joint Doctrine for Personnel Support to Joint
     Operations. It is an organized processing activity designed to ensure deploying personnel
88                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     are properly accounted for and prepared for deployment. It serves as the installation’s
     focal point for monitoring all personnel processing activities to include eligibility
     screening, pre-deployment briefings, orders preparation and production, passenger
     manifesting, passenger baggage handling, and passenger loading.
     2.36.4.2. PDF Responsibilities. The PDF advises commanders when personnel selected
     for deployment are ineligible to deploy according to this instruction; AFI 10-201; AFI
     10-215; AFI 36-2110, Assignments; and the reporting instructions/processing guidance
     issued by the Supported Command. Although the ultimate responsibility for deployment
     eligibility rests with the unit commander, the PDF serves as the wing’s last set of eyes
     ensuring all personnel are eligible for deployment, waivered for deployment according to
     the governing guidance, or replaced when found ineligible. The PDF:
        2.36.4.2.1. Ensures deploying civilians have appropriate CAC, passport, and visas, if
        required.
        2.36.4.2.2. Ensures personnel selected for deployment have enough retainability to
        complete the established TDY tour length according to AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-215.
        2.36.4.2.3. Maintains accountability of deploying personnel from the time they arrive
        at the PDF processing line until they leave home station. This includes controlling the
        personnel until they reach the ―sterile‖ area for departure for home station airlift
        departure.
        2.36.4.2.4. When directed by the IDO, provides services (by exception only) for
        emergency data documentation (vRED/DD Form 93), ID card, Geneva Convention
        card, immunizations and identification tags (dog tags) updates. NOTE: The PDF line
        should be used only as a last resort in providing these items prior to the member
        deploying from home station.
        2.36.4.2.5. In coordination with Security Forces and the Office of Special
        Investigation (OSI), ensures deploying members are briefed on Foreign Clearance
        Guide requirements, DOD Travel Security Advisories, country threats, have a Force
        Protection Level I briefing within 6 months of deployment, and have any other
        training requirements identified in the Supported Command reporting
        instructions/processing guidance or DRMD line remark.
        2.36.4.2.6. Coordinates UDM filler and shortfall actions for unit personnel shortages
        with the personnel representative on the DCC staff and UDM.
        2.36.4.2.7. Initiates personnel shortfall procedures with the IDO according to AFI
        10-401 and Supported Command reporting instructions/processing guidance when
        position cannot be filled from base resources. For AFRC units located on bases where
        the host is different than their gaining MAJCOM, personnel and/or equipment
        shortfalls/LIMFACs must be submitted through appropriate personnel channels that
        will identify these requirements to that unit’s gaining MAJCOM.
        2.36.4.2.8. Uses DCAPES to produce CED orders according to this instruction, AFI
        10-215, Supported Command reporting instructions/processing guidance, and any
        applicable DRMD line remarks. Produce CED orders for all deployments in support
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                89


        of real-world contingencies, exercises, deployments, and unit moves involving
        deployment of personnel.
        2.36.4.2.9. Provides updates for LOGMOD or changes to requirement information as
        they occur. Processes LOGMOD personnel assignment data into DCAPES for issuing
        orders. Provides the Transportation representative a CMOS file for electronic
        manifesting once all processing of the chalk is complete.
        2.36.4.2.10. Selects and appoints Troop Commander for each deploying chalk. Briefs
        Troop Commander on his/her responsibilities for accounting for the troops until they
        are received by the Personnel Processing facility in the AOR.
            2.36.4.2.10.1. Prepares a PAK for the deploying troop commander according to
            AFI 10-215 and supported component command reporting instruction/processing
            guidance.
        2.36.4.2.11. Instructs all deploying personnel to report to the deployed Personnel
        Processing facility (normally led by a PERSCO team) for in-processing and deployed
        accountability.
        2.36.4.2.12. Works with the PRF ensuring all deployed personnel’s duty status is
        updated reflecting their deployment and departure from home station.
     2.36.4.3. The IDO, in coordination with the MPF Commander, establishes a PDF IAW
     this AFI and AFI 10-215. Establishing a formal PDF processing line provides the most
     effective means to check personnel eligibility and readiness. However, special
     circumstances (such as resource availability, etc.) may not warrant standing up a full
     processing line. If the IDO deems a full stand-alone PDF line is not required, every effort
     should be made to incorporate some functions of the line in the processing. When the full
     services of a PDF line are not available, deploying personnel must be provided a
     deployment checklist that ensures they receive the same processing and services afforded
     in the formal PDF line. Personnel processing via checklist should be afforded service of a
     line, as a minimum, within 10 days of departure to receive briefings, pick up mobility
     bags and airline tickets, and receive a last check to ensure they have accomplished all the
     required processing tasks. Once established, the PDF must at least fully staff the
     Deployment Eligibility and Medical stations and should have the manpower and
     resources to conduct continuous personnel processing 24 hours a day. Depending on the
     scope of the deployment, the PDF will establish the following processing stations (See
     Attachment 3, Deployment Checklists, for detailed processing station information):
        2.36.4.3.1. Emergency Data Station: For changes to emergency data, vRED
        (information is updated via Virtual MPF; however, PDF reps can pull an updated
        copy from MPF), and to Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI).
        2.36.4.3.2. Identification Station: ID Tags & military/civilian ID cards, Geneva
        Convention cards, passports & visas, etc.
        2.36.4.3.3. Finance Station.
        2.36.4.3.4. Legal Station.
        2.36.4.3.5. Chaplain Station.
90                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


        2.36.4.3.6. Airman and Family Readiness Station.
        2.36.4.3.7. Services (ground support meals) Station.
        2.36.4.3.8. When processing passengers for airlift from home station or when
        designated as a aggregation APOE, the PDF will also establish the Air Passenger
        Terminal (APT) to manifest passengers, build baggage pallets or coordinate belly
        loads, and brief, hold, secure, transport, and load personnel. The following materials
        must be available at the APT during operations:
            2.36.4.3.8.1. AFI 10-403, with all supplements, and IDP.
            2.36.4.3.8.2. CMOS/GATES systems.
            2.36.4.3.8.3. Portable pallet scales (1 set).
            2.36.4.3.8.4. 10K forklift, 463L pallets, plastic covers, nets and straps to conduct
            baggage build-up.
        2.36.4.3.9. Baggage Handling Station. The PDF is responsible to establish a baggage
        handling process and educate those who must execute the process through
        coordination/consultation with the LRS Readiness Flight.
        2.36.4.3.10. American Red Cross Station.
        2.36.4.3.11. Amnesty Box Station.
     2.36.4.4. PDF Requirements. As a minimum, the PDF requires: uninterrupted power
     (generator); robust communications (telephones and LMRs, as required); correct ADPE
     and unclassified and classified LAN connectivity to support applicable components of
     IDS, DCAPES, GCCS and secure web sites; classified storage; adequate briefing and
     passenger holding facilities; and adequate baggage handling facilities.
  2.36.5. Unit Deployment Control Center (UDCC).
     2.36.5.1. UDCC Responsibilities. The UDCC is responsible for coordinating all unit
     level deployment activities to include receipt of taskings and preparation of cargo and
     personnel for deployment. Once activated on direction of the IDO, the UDCC will not
     deactivate without prior coordination with the IDO and the DCC.
        2.36.5.1.1. The UDCC staff will include at least two trained and qualified UDMs,
        and must be able to successfully perform 24-hour operations when required.
     2.36.5.2. UDCC Requirements. The UDCC requires the following infrastructure:
     uninterrupted power; robust communications (telephones and LMRs, as required); correct
     ADPE and LAN connectivity to support applicable components of IDS; access to secure
     facsimile; access to Secure Telephone Unit-Third Generation (STU III) or equivalent;
     and classified storage capability.
        2.36.5.2.1. SIPRNET for access to GCCS and secure web sites is desired, if the
        capability exists, but not yet required at the unit to meet the CJCS objective of
        providing unit specific data rapidly in order to build a TPFDD in 72 hours. Until the
        SIPRNET can be extended to all squadrons, use the guidance in Attachment 8 to
        meet the CJCS objective using IDS and DCAPES.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                   91


2.37. Developing Deployment Training and Education Programs.
   2.37.1. The IDO has overall responsibility to establish a local deployment training and
   education program to ensure all deployment workcenter personnel fully understand the
   deployment process, are properly trained to function as deployment work center augmentees,
   and are aware of proper procedures for preparing unit personnel and equipment for
   deployment.
   2.37.2. Deployment Education and Training Requirements. The deployment training and
   education program must address the following areas (see Attachment 5 for training classes
   and timeline requirements):
      2.37.2.1. IDOs must ensure unit commanders receive initial training within 45 days of
      assignment as commander. To educate them on their responsibilities in ensuring their
      units properly prepare personnel and cargo for deployment.
      2.37.2.2. Developing a formal training program for UDMs, augmentees, and other unit
      personnel, and ensuring all personnel understand the deployment process and the proper
      preparation of personnel and cargo for deployment.
      2.37.2.3. Developing a formal training program for use of IDS. Use IDS, Computer
      Based Training (CBT), and other applicable materials to support the wing/unit initial and
      recurring training programs. NOTE: CBT for IDS and LOGMOD, user manuals, and
      lesson plans are available from the HQ OSSG Website (https://www.gunter.af.mil/) or
      via the AF Portal through the 754th Electronic Systems Group, Installations and Logistics
      Systems Division (LR), Deployment Systems Branch (LRR). NOTE: Accomplish and
      document IDS training by using scenario-based, hands-on desktop exercises led by the
      IDO and Logistics Plans function for UDMs, Transportation representatives, Manpower
      representatives, and Personnel representatives on a quarterly basis, or as necessary.
          2.37.2.3.1. IDS training classes will be conducted as a shared responsibility of the
          IDO, wing LOGMOD Administrator, and CMOS/GATES operators (see AFI 24-
          238). Classes will be provided to all tenant units and host-wing supported GSUs.
      2.37.2.4. Developing a formal training program for deployment work center supervisors
      and augmentees, ensuring all personnel understand the deployment process and their
      work center’s responsibilities in the process.
      2.37.2.5. A 2-month pre-deployment preparation period to focus unit activities on AOR-
      specific events required (if known) and/or training exercises such as Red Flag and Silver
      Flag. ECS units should be prepared to validate readiness via deployment to Eagle Flag
      during that 2-month pre-deployment preparation period. Do not wait until this period to
      accomplish warrior skills or other normal deployment training requirements (as listed in
      Chapter 1).
      2.37.2.6. The 4-month on-call/deployment period is based on a rotational environment
      where all requirements are known and can be met with the forces allocated within the
      AEF pair or enablers. Individuals and equipment allocated to UTCs within the current
      AEF rotation must not participate in any activity that directly impacts their availability to
      deploy during this period. Scheduled leaves during the deployment/on-call period should
      be scrutinized to ensure member’s ability to respond quickly, if required. Transportation
92                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


     arrangements into the AOR are influenced by availability of airlift, which is influenced
     by world events and subject to change prior to actual lift date.
  2.37.3. Ensure specialized training normally associated with the deployment process are
  identified, documented, and addressed in training. If Augmentees are required they should be
  managed IAW the installation augmentation program.
  2.37.4. The IDO, in conjunction with other essential agencies, will provide quarterly
  deployment training status to the installation/wing commander. This may include number and
  types of deployment training classes held, numbers of trainees trained, number and percent of
  no-shows, or other metrics the commander requires to show readiness of the wing/installation
  to deploy. This will be a coordinated product consolidated by the IDO with prepared inputs
  by those agencies providing deployment-related training to installation personnel.
     2.37.4.1. (Added-AMC) This quarterly update will focus on wing readiness, providing
     deployment readiness status for personnel postured to deploy in upcoming AEFs as well
     as wing-wide deployment readiness statistics based on the wing’s maximum
     simultaneous deployment capability as described in para 2.24.6. This quarterly update
     should also address deployment machine readiness status. AMC wings will include tenant

                                DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION

Section 3A—Executing the AEF

3.1. Force Presentation.
   3.1.1. As depicted in AFPD 10-4 and AFI 10-401, USAF forces are presented to CCDRs in
   the form of task-organized AETFs. The Air Force uses the AEF methodology to respond to
   new emerging requirements as well as to fill standing rotational requirements.
   3.1.2. This chapter will address the different ways a requirement may flow to the wing and
   how (and when) the installation/wing may be expected to respond. While bases may still see
   Warning Orders and Deployment Orders and while they may have to activate wing-wide
   recall rosters and stand up deployment processing centers, they will also see electronic flows
   of data 100 or more days from deployment and, thus, be required to monitor TPFDDs for
   notification of tasking when supporting AEF rotations. A quick reference for AEF Rotational
   TPFDDs can be found on the AEF On-line webpage (http://aefcenter.acc.af.smil.mil/).
   Processes are designed to allow units and the installation to process hundreds of taskings
   without any real change to the day-to-day workflow.
   3.1.3. The AF goal is to provide the unit as much time as possible for a deployment tasking.
   For crisis action planning, most personnel should be prepared for deployment using the AEF
   construct. All ECS and aviation force rotational and temporary requirements are sourced
   and/or un-sourced by the AEFC IAW the CAF, MAF, and ECS SIPT schedules using UTCs
   aligned to the AEF libraries in the UTC Availability IAW AFI 10-401.
3.2. Rotation Planning.
   3.2.1. AEF rotation is an activity of deployment and redeployment. It provides presence for
   those areas without permanently assigned forces or to support normal operations beyond the
   capability of the theater assigned forces. Rotation planning facilitates sustaining the
   employment mission and transitioning force capability within an expeditionary organization.
   Rotation planning prescribes how the Rotation of Airmen (ROA)/Transfer of Forces (TOF)
   will flow/occur in and out of theaters of operations systematically each AEF rotation.
   3.2.2. Rotation planning considerations that directly impact rotation operations are similar to
   those described in deployment planning with the following additional concerns: overlap
   (continuity training) requirements, Commander release of Airmen, ARC volunteers on
   mandays, en route training requirements, and Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and
   Integration (RSO&I) requirements. These factors are critical to rotation planning and are the
   basis for developing rotational airlift plans.
3.3. Concept of AEF Rotations.
   3.3.1. Initial identification of rotation follows crisis operations surge with CCDR authority to
   rotate forces. AFCHQs identify requirements that necessitate sustained rotation
 94                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   3.3.2. Rotations are established IAW service policy (4-months). Extended tours up to 179
   days are not uncommon and may be driven by limited/critical AFSCs/capabilities or by
   mission or CCDR requirements (see Figure 3.1, AEF 6-month Rotation Timeline).

Figure 3.1. AEF 6-Month Rotation Timeline




   3.3.3. AEF rotations are identified using designated AEF ULN constructs. Each AOR is
   assigned a different ULN construct that transitions to the AEF schedule. The AEFC
   maintains the AEF ULN matrix on AEF on-line.
3.4. Transfer of Forces.
   3.4.1. Transfer of forces for an AEF Rotation encompasses both Rotation-In and Rotation-
   Out execution. To facilitate delivery of forces in the most logical and efficient manner the
   AEF ROA template was developed.
   3.4.2. The ROA template outlines when to rotate commanders, key/essential personnel, and
   remaining forces in 7-day intervals over 28 days. This template is designed to logically rotate
   forces by function/capability and provides deployed commanders a predictable and deliberate
   plan. There may be instances where forces will move outside the 30-day window when
   mission dictates.
   3.4.3. Extended Tour Rotations. Extended tours will follow the template concept as well.
   However, their movement window is established based on the 6-month timeline.
   3.4.4. New requirements. New requirements may initially fall outside the movement window
   and will be adjusted to align within the ROA guidelines and towards the AEF movement
   window in no more than 15 day increments.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 95


3.5. Force Visibility.
   3.5.1. In an effort to gain and improve visibility of forces rotating, the AEFC generates
   reports to Commanders, MAJCOM AEF Cells, A1 Staffs, and IDOs to monitor and track
   names in system, data discrepancies with departure and arrival, mission scheduling and
   movement actions, and force closure in supported theater.

Section 3B—Execute/Deployment Order Process.

3.6. Pre-tasking Preparations.
   3.6.1. During a crisis or in the build up to a response to a crisis, units may expect to see a
   warning or alert order. While warning and alert orders are normally sent only to the
   MAJCOM headquarters and not directly to the wings, the MAJCOM/NAF, BS/CAT, or
   equivalent, is responsible for retransmitting the order to the affected wings. This requires
   prompt action on behalf of the BS/CAT since timely receipt of this order may not occur.
   MAJCOMs/NAFs receive information via secure telephone, message traffic, or GCCS
   newsgroups and pass that information to subordinate units using similar methods. Tasking
   information will flow from JOPES through DCAPES to the tasked installations/units. There
   will often be information flow before an official warning or alert order. Upon receipt of
   orders, the host installation/wing command post will immediately notify, at a minimum, the
   IDO and host installation commander. Notify other personnel/agencies IAW local guidance
   in the IDP.
   3.6.2. During AEF rotational operations, installations and units will probably not get a
   warning order or an alert order. Pre-tasking events are controlled and directed via the AEF
   Sourcing Plans and Tasks message and timeline. The AEF Sourcing Plans and Tasks
   message outlines the tasks, timelines, and OPRs associated with executing each rotation. The
   timelines identify when rotational requirements are built, sourcing verifications are to be
   completed and when transportation into the AORs will be visible in system (Figure 3.2, AEF
   4-Month Rotational Timeline). Adhering to the milestones in these messages is critical to the
   orderly presentation of capability to the CCDRs.
 96                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


Figure 3.2. AEF 4-Month Rotation Timeline




   3.6.3. To preclude delaying tasking notifications to appropriate Airmen, IDOs, and the
   IDRC, or the DCC if stood up, will monitor the DCAPES AFVC on a daily basis for new,
   modified, or deleted taskings.
   3.6.4. If the Warning or Alert order is received prior to the installation being sourced via
   AFVC, then the Command Post, or other 24-hour command center, will notify the IDO who
   will then review it with key personnel. The order may not contain any specific taskings for a
   specific weapon system. Compare available plans and details of the Warning or Alert order
   for clues as to what may be coming. If the message contains actual UTCs or weapon systems
   identification, actual preparatory movement actions may begin. In addition, it is imperative
   that other sources of tasking information be constantly monitored such as SIPRNET web
   pages, DCAPES, Web-Hoc Query, and TPFDD Newsgroups. Establish dialog with
   MAJCOM, NAF, or component CAT Cells or Operations Centers. Unless the pending action
   is in an area with no plan on the shelf, it may be necessary to read over the current plan for
   the AOR in question. Read the plan’s summary, the basic plan, annexes C & D, as well as
   your functional annex.
   3.6.5. Upon receipt of the Warning or Alert order (or other indications of an imminent
   deployment), the IDO will host a meeting to review the tasking(s) and establish a concept of
   operations and concept of logistics support (if enough detail is available). Members at this
   meeting will include, at a minimum: the IDO, Logistics Plans representative, PRF
   representative, MOF representative, Supply representative, Transportation representative,
   and other tasked personnel representatives. In addition, possible UTCs to be tasked will be
   reviewed and prioritized, and LIMFACs/shortfalls identified. An additional tasking review
   may be required when the actual tasking is received.
   3.6.6. Unit commanders will review shortfalls/LIMFACs and update as required. The
   Logistics Plans function will review the shortfalls/LIMFACS of the affected units so any
   problems expected are known ahead of time.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  97


3.7. Place Personnel on Standby.
   3.7.1. Place personnel on standby IAW MAJCOM directives. The requirement for standby
   (recall, if required) varies from MAJCOM to MAJCOM. Make personnel available if a
   known tasking is coming. Placing personnel on standby will allow maximum flexibility in
   responding to whatever tasking is received. At a minimum, the IDRC/DCC staff will be
   recalled or notified when the wing/installation commander is notified. The IDO will alert the
   MPF Commander of the potential need to activate the PDF and the TMF (or APS at CONUS
   AMC strategic aerial port) of the potential to activate the CDF. Follow the MAJCOM and
   installation/wing commander’s direction for placing personnel on stand-by.
3.8. Monitor Intelligence and Counterintelligence Activities.
   3.8.1. Local intelligence and OSI personnel through the local Threat Working Group will
   keep the installation/wing commander and the IDO current on intelligence and
   counterintelligence information needed to support deployment operations.

Section 3C—Tasking Execution Process

3.9. TPFDD Execution.
   3.9.1. Once a CCDR receives a duly authorized CJCS order (e.g., alert, warning,
   deployment, execute) for a major operation or campaign, the supported commander has 72
   hours to provide a sourced and validated, level-4 detail TPFDD for at least the first 7 days of
   the operation.
       3.9.1.1. The Air Force may be tasked by the President or SecDef via a Joint Staff
       sourcing message to fill requirements with no corresponding CJCS order (i.e., Individual
       Augmentee, Security Cooperation Activities, Military Tribunal, etc.). These requirements
       will be placed in a TPFDD and levied in the same manner as CCDR requirements.
   3.9.2. The Air Force process starts with the supported AFCHQ identifying the requirements
   in the TPFDD. The AFCHQ will input the ULN, UTC, APOD, deployed location, and
   EAD/LAD/RDD dates.
   3.9.3. The AEFC receives the requirements from the AFCHQ and sources them by placing
   UICs against appropriate ULNs/UTCs. See AFI 10-401, Chapters 8 and 9 for AEFC TPFDD
   sourcing procedures. NOTE: ANG units will follow their higher headquarters guidance on
   verification procedures
       3.9.3.1. The AEFC manages the sourcing process using AEF scheduled assets. It is
       responsible for flowing taskings through DCAPES for these TPFDDs and will provide
       automated support using DCAPES to base-level IDOs, manpower personnel, personnel
       readiness offices, PERSCO teams, and other central sites. The AEFC is responsible for
       flowing, accounting for, and reflowing sourcing packages.
   3.9.4. MAJCOM FAMs verify to the component the readiness of sourced forces to include
   the ability to meet the TPFDD timelines. This includes FAMs determination of capability and
   requirement and use of AFVC, if available, to notify units through the tasked
   wing/installation’s IDO.
98                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  3.9.4. (AMC) AMC Functional Area Managers (FAMs) are responsible for notifying the
  AMC Wing LRS/LGRD or Group XPL, and AMC-gained FAMs that a tasking is being
  levied on their unit(s). A heads up to the tasked unit is authorized; however, valid taskings
  are routed to the respective host Wing IDO/ LRS/LGRD, responsible for base deployments
  or tenant Group/XPL/LGX office on non-AMC bases (AMSG or AMSS for OCONUS).
  Only 618 TACC/XOPM, XOCL, AMC/A4O and AMC/A3M FAMs are authorized to
  verbally task as described in para 3.9.4.2 below. For AFRC units, communications will be
  coordinated through the appropriate AFRC command channels.
     3.9.4.1. (Added-AMC) When tasking normal day-to-day requirements, AMC functional
     area offices shall only task through host Wing LRS/LGRD or Group XPL offices on non-
     AMC bases (AMSG or AMSS for OCONUS). CRW/XP offices will coordinate with the
     host Wing LRS/LGRD for valid taskings received from AMC. AFRC/ANG taskings will
     be coordinated with the appropriate AFRC/ANG functional manager.
     3.9.4.2. (Added-AMC) The accepted deployment tasking mechanism in AMC is a
     validated DCAPES record, an Air Mobility Tasking (AMT) or an 18 AF approved
     EXORD/OPORD/DEPORD. DCAPES is the standard deployment tasking system for
     supporting COCOM TPFDD execution processes. The AMT or an 18 AF approved
     EXORD/OPORD/DEPORD will be used to communicate those requirements which are
     not captured in a COCOM TPFDD or the AMC PID within DCAPES. The AMT or the
     18 AF approved EXORD/OPORD/DEPORD will flow to the Wing’s LRS/LGRD, IDO,
     XPL, or equivalent office and the corresponding command post (a 24-hour point of
     contact). It is recognized that time constraints may on occasion require AMC to provide
     verbal taskings to the subordinate wings. These verbal tasking must be communicated to
     the Wing’s LRS/LGRD, the Group XP at AMC tenant units or the corresponding
     Command Post. Each wing should define 24 hour POCs and IDO notification processes
     within their IDP. 618 TACC/XOPM, XOCL,                  AMC/A4O and AMC/A3M are
     authorized to verbally task AMC personnel and equipment. It is vital that all tasking
     information, including verbal pre-coordination between TACC, FAMs and tasked units,
     be provided to the wing LRS/LGRD or Group XPL. In all cases, verbal taskings will be
     followed by a validated DCAPES tasking, an (AMT) message or a 18 AF approved
     EXORD/OPORD/DEPORD within 2 duty days. All ARC taskings will be coordinated
     with the appropriate HQ AFRC/ANG FAM, before being loaded into DCAPES and ARC
     validation. The IDO, XPL, or equivalent office, should perform the tasking analysis
     during the initial stages of notification. To the maximum extent possible all taskings
     must be identified by PID, UTC, and ULN; this information is required to create
     transportation control numbers (TCNs) and provide other critical data elements which are
     required to use IDS. From a deployment policy perspective these processes are the
     accepted tasking processes which drive involvement of the IDO and the supporting
     deployment processes.
     3.9.4.3. (Added-AMC) Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRTs) Policy: Per AMCI 21-
     108, TACC/XOCL directs, controls and tasks subordinate units for personnel, parts and
     equipment for MRT requirements. They also coordinate transportation requirements.
     The initial tasking will be via telephone to the tasked unit’s Maintenance Operations
     Center (MOC). The MOC is required to immediately inform the IDO of these taskings.
     XOCL is authorized to verbally task all MRT requirements through appropriate channels.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                99


     Verbal tasking will be followed by a validated DCAPES record, an AMT or an 18 AF
     approved EXORD/OPORD/DEPORD. Additional MRT guidance can be found in AMCI
     21-108.
         3.9.4.3.1. (Added-AMC) Per AMC/CC direction all AMC personnel [including
         aircrew and maintenance recovery teams (MRTs)] must deploy on CED orders in
         order to improve personnel accountability, duty status reporting, and support long-
         term sustainment of our warfighting capability. This applies only to those MRTs
         supporting a by-name operation or exercise. The intent of this policy is to outline a
         process for all stateside AMC tasked MRTs supporting a by-name operation or
         exercise to deploy with CED orders in hand. In the event the base-level DCAPES is
         inoperative, CED orders will be prepared on DD Form 1610 (request and
         authorization for TDY travel and DOD personnel) IAW AFI 36-3802.
         3.9.4.3.2. (Added-AMC) The tasked AMC unit's MOC will contact the host
         Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) immediately upon receipt of MRT tasking and
         provide the IDO with all details of the tasking.
         3.9.4.3.3. (Added-AMC) The IDO will notify the appropriate IDRC and FM
         personnel in order to facilitate execution of the MRT tasking. Additionally, the IDO
         must ensure base supply and other required agencies are called in to facilitate proper
         equipping and preparation of the MRT for deployment. The host base must issue
         necessary equipment to MRT personnel regardless of type of orders they are
         deploying under to ensure compliance with the foreign clearance guide and relevant
         reporting instructions. Note: In order to ensure "processing actions" do not hinder
         quick reaction of the MRT, the IDRC in coordination with base supply at each
         installation, will develop a local processing and equipping process that is tailored to
         the specific time-sensitive needs of MRTs.
         3.9.4.3.4. (Added-AMC) All supply parts and equipment tasked to move with
         MRTs will continue to be processed as "AMC MICAP" and not as ULN movements
         using ULNs or mobility TCNs associated with personnel movements.
     3.9.4.4. (Added-AMC) AMC FAMs must contact host Wing LRS/LGRD or Group
     XPL offices on non-AMC bases and provide verbal heads-up for any taskings, when
     initial tasking notification is provided within 15 days of ALD/RDD/DRI.
  3.9.5. Non-AFCHQ CCDR requirements defined in Request for Forces/Capabilities
  (RFF/Cs) may be inserted into a TPFDD at any time during the Force Rotation TPFDD
  Development Process Timeline. The Air Force may be tasked with ILO sourcing solutions
  requiring Airmen go to pre-deployment training as described in line remarks (e.g., combat
  skills training). Because training may be required en route, all JOPES dates (ALD, EAD,
  LAD, RDD) and locations must be carefully reviewed by IDOs and MAJCOM AEF Cells.
  These requirements may have a short timeline from CJCS DEPORD/EXORD to LAD/RDD.
  Short timelines make it imperative that sourcing, MAJCOM verification, and name fills by
  the tasked unit are accomplished within the required times to ensure deploying Airmen meet
  the required training dates as well as Force Provider and CCDR-directed thresholds
  (RLD/ALD and EAD/LAD).

3.10. Receipt of Taskings.
   3.10.1. OPLAN/CONPLAN Taskings. If an off-the-shelf OPLAN/CONPLAN is directed to
   be executed, compare the original OPLAN/CONPLAN tasking to the actual tasking. If
   needed, conduct a tasking review meeting to ensure all units are aware of significant changes.
   If a new plan, or crisis plan, is directed to be executed, conduct a tasking review meeting, if
   needed, to ensure all units are aware of tasking and supportability is reflected in ART.
   3.10.2. Taskings will be provided as soon as possible to appropriate agencies. The DCC
   staff, which prepares the DSOE, needs the tasking messages as soon as received. If BS/CAT
   validation results in changes to the tasking messages, the DCC staff will be notified
   immediately. Establish Reference Start Time (RST) and establish time of the Deployment
   Concept briefing, if required.
   3.10.3. Installations (most fighter/bomber wings) using the concept briefing to pass
   information to tasked units must have the briefing as soon as possible for short-notice crisis
   taskings. RST is established by the battle staff and the IDO based on the receipt of the
   warning, execute, and/or deployment order. The concept briefing sets the tone for the
   deployment and ensures all deploying and support units understand the tasking, the
   deployment schedule of events, and critical employment site information that may affect the
   mission, health, and safety of deploying personnel. If a formal concept briefing is not used,
   notify tasked units of all related deployment information as soon as possible to ensure they
   understand their tasking. Refer to Attachment 7 for Deployment Concept Briefing outline.
   3.10.4. In support of normal AEF rotations, tasking information flows continually
   throughout the scheduled AEF Rotation period. While it is not necessary to hold a concept
   briefing upon receipt of each tasking, the IDO must establish a system of notification to the
   wing commander and key senior leadership of each tasking. As a minimum, the IDO will
   notify key personnel within the IDRC (in the absence of the IDRC, notify PRF and TMF
   representatives) and respective units of each tasking within 24 hours of receipt of tasking.
   3.10.5. In every case, regardless of the size of the tasking, the IDRC will load the personnel
   levy flow file (or DCAPES file with v4.0.2.0) into LOGMOD and the UDM will always load
   tasked personnel in LOGMOD for transfer back to DCAPES. This is done to facilitate
   manifesting of passengers and to ensure ITV is maintained throughout the entire deployment
   process.
   3.10.6. If the IDO doesn’t hold a concept briefing upon receipt of every tasking, they will
   ensure wing leadership, tasked units, and deployment work centers receive key information
   normally disseminated in the concept briefing and provide a concept of operation for
   processing personnel and equipment.
3.11. Implement IDP.
   3.11.1. Once the base receives a deployment tasking, the base implements its deployment
   process IAW the IDP. Implementing the IDP will help to ensure all augmentees are available
   and will assist in activating the required work centers with needed equipment and supplies to
   operate for 24-hour operations, as needed.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                   101


3.12. Activate Deployment Functions/Centers.
   3.12.1. Deployment management requires all agencies responsible for deployment actions to
   work together to ensure they meet all taskings. Usually the wing/installation’s deployment
   organization is not fully activated until a base receives a tasking to deploy. Time
   requirements for activating work centers are not dictated, so each base must determine when
   to activate their work centers according to the situation at hand. The following paragraphs
   explain the purpose and suggested activation priority supporting the wing deployment
   process.
      3.12.1.1. Activate BS/CAT. Early in a crisis, the focus is on gathering and disseminating
      accurate information. Command and control is critical to important agencies such as the
      base command post, BS/CAT, and the DCC. Although each command and unit has its
      own BS/CAT activation procedures, generally expect BS/CAT activation in stages. As
      action by the unit becomes more likely, BS/CAT director should activate the full team.
      3.12.1.2. Activate DCC. Activate the DCC to allow logistics planners time to translate
      taskings into the LOGMOD DSOE. The IDO will activate other work centers in enough
      time to begin accepting cargo and personnel for processing based on the DSOE. The
      DCC is the focal point for all deployment actions on a base and reports to the BS/CAT.
          3.12.1.2.1. The IDO must establish lines of communication between higher
          headquarters, the battle staff, deployment work centers, and the DCC, and between
          the DCC and tasked units. All information essential to deployment operations must
          pass through the DCC.
          3.12.1.2.2. The IDO will use approved command and control systems such as
          DCAPES and LOGMOD to ensure everyone is informed of wing/installation TPFDD
          taskings.
      3.12.1.3. Activate Cargo Deployment Function (CDF). Activate the CDF when directed
      by the IDO. The OIC/NCOIC of the CDF will ensure all required resources are readily
      available to properly transport, receive, inspect, marshal, and load cargo to meet support
      transportation requirements. The CDF will develop clear procedures if both air and
      surface operations are required. Upon activation of the CDF, brief all assigned personnel
      on the nature of the deployment.
      3.12.1.4. Activate Personnel Deployment Function (PDF). The IDO, in coordination
      with the MPF Commander, activates the PDF. Once notified to activate, the OIC/NCOIC
      of the PDF will gather all PDF members and brief them on all information available
      concerning the deployment and advise them when to set up the processing line.
      3.12.1.5. Activate Unit Deployment Control Centers (UDCC). The UDCCs will be
      activated upon direction of the IDO (24-hour operations, if needed). Once notified to
      activate, the UDM will gather work center members and brief them on all the information
      they have concerning the deployment and advise them when to set up the cargo/unit
      assembly areas. UDCCs will deactivate after approval by the IDO. Personnel deployment
      eligibility will be constantly monitored by UDMs to ensure required deployment
      positions can be filled by qualified individuals at all times. Units will attempt, as early as
      possible, to identify potential personnel eligibility problems in order to allow the PDF

       personnel are not available on the base, notify the DCC so they can elevate the
       requirement to higher headquarters and/or the AEF Center. In many cases, commanders
       can waive eligibility factor problems. When they cannot waive them, commanders will
       elevate those personnel issues or shortfall IAW applicable reclama and shortfall
       implementing guidance.
3.13. Verification of Taskings.
   3.13.1. During the verification process (see Attachment 4 for wing verification process),
   every responsible agency, starting with the IDRC/DCC, is confirming the sourced UTC/UIC
   has the required elements to meet the requirement; the applicable forces are available and
   ready; forces have been alerted for deployment; and the cargo is tailored to level-4 detail, and
   passenger line-level detail is tailored to match level 2 detail, if applicable. Verification
   confirms the sourced data reflects actual data provided by the base or unit. Failure to
   accomplish this verification could result in misstating planned transportation requirements
   and possibly delaying the execution of a CCDR’s plan. Procedures for verification for ANG
   ULNs are different than stated in this paragraph. ANG units will follow their higher
   headquarters guidance on verification procedures.
   3.13.2. When verifying ULNs, planners utilize the AFVC in DCAPES to support
   information on deployment activity and data reflected in the TPFDD. See AFI 10-401,
   Chapter 8 concerning the purpose of AFVC.
   3.13.3. Tasking information will flow from the TPFDD in DCAPES to the tasked
   installations/units.
       3.13.3.1. Contacting the appropriate functional counterpart at base level to determine
       actual availability of assets in lieu of AFVC is not recommended. Any procedure that
       does not utilize DCAPES is considered an informal process to determine availability only
       and therefore does not constitute a tasking.
       3.13.3.2. MAJCOMs will utilize AFVC to notify bases, through the IDRC/DCC, of
       sourcing and initiate the verification process. The IDRC/DCC will acknowledge receipt
       of the sourcing through AFVC and then determine if the base can fill.
       3.13.3.2. (AMC) 2 (Added) IAW AFI 10-401, paragraph 8.14.9.2.3,                  MAJCOM
       verification
          3.13.3.2.1. (Added-AMC) MAJCOM AEF Tasking Receipt and ―N‖ Coding:
          AMC/A7ZD will ―N‖ code all ULNs upon identification through DCAPES (Dynamic
          Query         Tool)         and       post        this       file     at        URL:
          http://www.amc.scott.af.smil.mil/hostedorg_orgs/a77d/A77D.htm            (SIPRNET).
          This action will be accomplished through the use of the Air Force Verification
          Capability (AFVC) contained within the DCAPES application. The ―N‖ code
          provides initial notification of an official tasking for the base and starts the base
          deployment process. This includes submission of waivers, selection of personnel, etc.
          NOTE: The ―N‖ code provides visibility of personnel taskings in the Deployed
          Personnel Tasking (DPT) module of DCAPES. Tasking for equipment only UTCs
          will not show up in DPT and are only visible by conducting thorough TPFDD
          reviews. Project codes, definitions, shortfall processes and timeliness still apply.
          NOTE: The 6 day tasking timeline starts when the AEFC sources the requirement to
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                103


         an AMC unit via newsgroup posting and entering a Unit Identification Code (UIC) in
         DCAPES against a specified ULN. The entire process from ―N‖ code to base ―B*‖
         (BX, BXP, BXC, BXA) coding and FAM ―S‖ coding each record must occur within
         the 6 day timeline with the following exception: If taskings are within 30 days of first
         movement, MAJCOM FAMs will manage the tasking IAW their cu
         3.13.3.2.2. (Added-AMC) IAW AFI 10-401, paragraph 8.14.9.2.3, MAJCOM
         verification (S-Code) must be completed within 6 days of tasking receipt. If the IDO
         ―BX‖ codes the record, the FAM may ―S‖ code the ULN. If the sourced base cannot
         support the deployment requirement with an alternate resource, the base IDO will
         enter ―NXX‖ in the PC field. If the MAJCOM FAM agrees with the "NXX" code
         and can resource the tasking within the MAJCOM, they will submit a UIC change
         request via the RPT, as outlined in Chapter 10 of AFI 10-401. If the MAJCOM
         FAM agrees with the "NXX" code but cannot resource within the command, the
         FAM will submit a condition 1 – 4 reclama on behalf of the wing to expedite
         processing.Note: Condition 5 reclamas must be initiated by the base. Any other code
         submitted by the IDO requires FAM review of the code and the reasoning for the
         code, the FAM must then contact the tasked unit and determine an appropriate course
         of action. The overall intent of the base validation is to provide the MAJCOM FAMs
         an opportunity to resource a tasking through UIC change action without generating a
         shortfall from the unit. FAMs must proactively manage NXX‖ coded records.
     3.13.3.3. In support of AEF rotations, Log Plans, PRF, or Manpower Office personnel in
     the IDRC will check DCAPES at least twice daily during normal duty hours for new,
     changed, or deleted taskings. MAJCOMs must notify units directly to meet short notice
     alerts/taskings received during non-duty days that require immediate attention.
  3.13.4. When a new tasking or change to an existing tasking is received, the IDRC/DCC will
  verify it within two duty days (or within 24 hours for short-notice taskings) of receipt before
  forwarding to the appropriate unit(s). Verification includes:
     3.13.4.1. IDRC Manpower or PRF personnel ensuring the UIC for the tasking is
     appropriate. If not, the IDO will contact the tasking authority (e.g., MAJCOM, AEF
     Center) for re-sourcing to the appropriate UIC.
     3.13.4.2. In coordination with the tasked unit, ensuring the tasking is in UTC
     Availability and the required AFSC exists, for personnel taskings, in the tasked unit, and
     that it is postured in the appropriate AEF pair, unless surge operations are approved. If
     not properly postured, contact the AEFC or MAJCOM FAM for clarification. Also
     research MISCAP substitution rules and UMDs for possible resolution to tasking. If no
     capability exists at the base, reclama the tasking to the tasking authority IAW paragraph
     3.18 and AFI 10-401.
     3.13.4.3. Ensuring the LAD/RDD specified for the GEOLOC is feasible and attainable.
     Taskings should allow lead time at base level to allow for completion of Just-in-Time
     (JIT) training, equipment preparation, en route training, flight arrangements, etc. If the
     RDD is not feasible, the PRF/IDRC will contact the deployed PERSCO or deployed
     commander IAW this AFI and AFI 10-215 to request an extension to the required in-
     place date.
 104                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


           3.13.4.3.1. Request for RDD adjustments through the AFCHQ will only be made to
           comply with the timeline standard for verification in Chapter 9 of AFI 10-401, unless
           a more stringent timeline is stated in the DEPORD/RFF. If the RDD cannot be met
           due to completion of Just-in-Time (JIT) training, equipment preparation, or flight
           arrangements, contact the deployed PERSCO or deployed commander IAW this AFI
           and AFI 10-215 to request an extension to the date required in-place.
           3.13.4.3.2. (Added-AMC) The Wing LRS/LGRD , IDO or Group XP/XPL at non-
           AMC bases will review taskings and use localized procedures to determine the wing’s
           ability to fill the requirement(s) and inform the MAJCOM FAM of supportability.
           This will be indicated in DCAPES using the AFVC and use of prescribed ―B-codes‖
           indicated below. Bases have 3 days from receipt of the tasking to ―B-code‖ the ULN.
           MAJCOM FAMs will verify the ULN after the 3rd day, or when deemed necessary,
           and after proper evaluation and coordination has occurred with the tasked wing. For
           taskings with first movement within 35 days, the base has 24 hours to ―BX‖ or
           ―NXX‖ code the tasking.

Table 3.1. (Added-AMC) Codes and Definitions
Code:          Definition:
BX      Base Approve w/No Changes
BXP     Base Approve w/Personnel Changes Only
BXC Base Approve w/Cargo Changes Only
BXA Base Approve w/Personnel & Cargo Changes
NXX Base cannot support requirement(s)

        Note: Once the FAM ―S‖ codes any record, deployment preparation and shortfall
        processes and timelines are in force. DCAPES does not preclude a FAM from ―S‖ coding
        a record regardless of base level actions being taken at the ―B*‖ coding stage; however,
        appropriate coordination between the MAJCOM FAM and unit must occur.
           3.13.4.3.3. (Added-AMC) When a wing determines that they can only fill a tasking
           if a line remark requirement is waived they should submit the waiver upon receipt of
           an ―N‖ coded record. A waiver should also generate an ―NXX‖ code to the
           MAJCOM FAM. The MAJCOM FAM should research resourcing options to ensure
           timely response to waiver disapprovals. If resourcing can be done the originally
           tasked wing recalls their waiver request. MAJCOM FAMs may request a UIC
           change using the RPT during the verification process (0 - 6 days) if the requirement
           can be resourced within AMC.
           3.13.4.3.4. (Added-AMC) If a wing or MAJCOM cannot fill a tasking, the shortfall
           process must begin at the 6 day point regardless of the status of the record as
           indicated by the project code or tasking status code. If a MAJCOM, or Wing-level,
           tasking cannot be filled; and a waiver request has been submitted and disapproved; it
           will be followed by a shortfall/reclama submission. The waiver request and shortfall
           action will be reflected in the RPT, as outlined in AFI 10-401, Chapter 10. Shortfalls
           are denoted by placing an ―S‖ in the Tasking Status field that corresponds to that
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               105


         particular line number at the wing level. Upon approval by the AFPC/DPWC,a new
         UIC will be entered and the tasking should drop from the DPT screen. Additionally,
         if no answer to a waiver request has been provided, wings must submit shortfalls
         IAW established shortfall timelines in AFI 10-401.
     3.13.4.4. Identify any incomplete or missing data (i.e., incomplete or unlisted
     line/command remarks). The tasking authority (e.g., MAJCOM or AEF Center) will be
     contacted to clarify any inconsistencies.
     3.13.4.5. If the tasking does not require any corrections, the IDO will verify it in AFVC
     back to the respective MAJCOM that they acknowledge the tasking and that it will either
     be supported, partially supported, or shortfalled through the reclama process IAW
     paragraph 3.18 and AFI 10-401.
         3.13.4.5.1. (Added-AMC) When the IDO ―BX‖ codes the record, base deployment
         processes continue as this code signifies base level notification to the MAJCOM of
         tasking acceptance. This also starts the timeline for units submission of names against
         specific tasking. IAW AFI 36-3802 all names must be loaded against taskings in
         DCAPES within 15 days of the IDO acceptance of the tasking (BX code) or within 15
         days of ―S‖ code whichever is earlier. For those taskings received within 30 days of
         first movement, the name must be assigned within 24 hours of tasking receipt. When
         an IDO uses a code other than ―BX‖, the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM), in
         coordination with the IDO should contact the AMC FAM (usually listed in the POC
         field in DCAPES) and provide justification. IDOs must ensure they have
         communicated the reasons/justification to the appropriate FAM, via telecon or Email.
         Units should only ―NXX‖ code taskings that they truly cannot fill.
         3.13.4.5.2. (Added-AMC) For each ULN in the Deployed Personnel Tasking
         Screen, the Tasking Status Code field must be changed from ―D‖ to ―M‖. Changing
         it to an ―M‖ will allow your MO office to verify the tasking against the authorized
         positions on your installation. Once this action is complete, the MO office will
         change the ―M‖ to a ―P‖. This action will allow the PRF to assign names to the
         taskings IAW AFI 36-3802. After all the required trigger fields have been met by the
         PRF, the Tasking Status Code must indicate ―C‖ denoting the completion of the base
         level deployment process within DCAPES.
         3.13.4.5.3. (Added-AMC) AMC generated taskings (normally ―G‖ series ULNs)
         will not go through the same verification process since these requirements are
         predetermined and usually pre-coordinated with the units; these taskings will be
         sourced and tasked IAW previously established processes.Note: 1) DCAPES does
         not preclude a FAM from ―S‖ coding a record regardless of base-level actions being
         taken at the ―B*‖ code stage as this may be needed to allow the shortfall process to
         occur and AEFC to resource the tasking. 2) For AEF steady state requirements IDOs
         will not use the ―X‖ tasking status code. Wings are not authorized any tailoring of
         these taskings.
  3.13.5. The IDRC/DCC will upload the tasking into LOGMOD (for personnel taskings) and
  forward to the tasked unit/UDM. For cargo-only taskings, the IDRC will notify the unit of
  UTC(s) tasked. The notification to the unit and update to LOGMOD will be NLT than 1 duty
  day after receipt of tasking in the IDRC/DCC.
 106                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   3.13.6. Units will then provide equipment and personnel info back to the IDRC/DCC to
   fulfill taskings IAW Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, respectively, or provide shortfall
   documentation IAW paragraph 3.18.
   3.13.7. Immediately upon receipt of tasked SSAN(s) or equipment from UDM in
   LOGMOD, the IDRC updates DCAPES with tasked personnel and/or equipment data.
   Updates will be entered within five duty days of original receipt of tasking for taskings 30-
   120 days from LAD/RDD (whichever comes first) or 48 hours for taskings received less than
   30 days from LAD/RDD.
       3.13.7.1. Automatic rule sets in DCAPES will also be used to verify personnel
       deployment eligibility.
          3.13.7.1.1. (Added-AMC) Per AFI 36 – 3802 the timeline for names in DCAPES
          for taskings is to have a name in the system at base acceptance as indicated by ―BX‖
          code‖ + 15 days or ―S‖ code + 15 days. For taskings with first movement within 30
          days, names in DCAPES are due within 24 hours of ―BX‖ code or ―S‖ code.
       3.13.7.2. If the system flags a condition preventing assignment to the UTC, and an
       approved waiver is not already on file, the SSAN will be returned to the UDM for waiver
       or reclama process actions.
   3.13.8. Within one duty day of the IDRC receiving validation of deployment eligibility from
   the UDM, the IDO in coordination with the PRF and TMF will ensure appropriate mode of
   transportation is available to meet TPFDD ALD for personnel moves.
   3.13.9. Once the IDO, on behalf of the wing/installation commander, verifies requirements
   can be supported to the MAJCOMs, MAJCOM planners or FAMS will verify to the
   supported Air Component by placing an ―S‖ in the project code field in DCAPES.
   3.13.10. Supported AFCHQ will complete the verification process by putting an ―SC‖ in the
   project code field in DCAPES. This indicates that the requirement is ready for Supported
   Commander and USTRANSCOM (if needed) validation.
3.14. Requirement Validation.
   3.14.1. The validation process begins once the force provider has verified the sourcing.
   During execution, movement data within a TPFDD must be validated in order to schedule
   appropriate strategic transportation or book channel missions in GATES. "Validate" in this
   context is defined in Joint Publications as: ―Execution procedure used by combatant
   command components, supporting CCDRs, and providing organizations to confirm to the
   supported commander that all the information records in a TPFDD are not only error-free,
   but also accurately reflect the current status, attributes (lower level personnel and cargo data),
   and availability of units and requirements.‖
   3.14.2. Air Force planners and FAMs must ensure timelines established to support the
   sourcing, verification, and validation process are followed. The standard timeline for
   completing sourcing will be IAW respective TPFDD Letters of Instruction (LOIs).
   Wings/installations will normally have five duty days from tasking receipt until filling or
   shortfalling the requirement back to the MAJCOM/AEFC.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                     107


3.15. Verify Travel Requirements.
   3.15.1. The IDO and IDRC personnel (both permanent staff and direct support staff) must
   work closely together to ensure individuals/equipment meet deployment timing and mode of
   travel as specified in the PID/TPFDD tasking for personnel/equipment leaving their
   installation. In order to best help IDRC, PDF, and/or CDF personnel plan movement, the
   IDO first needs to make some decisions based on the TPFDD information and should ask the
   following questions:
      3.15.1.1. What is the APOE for the personnel/equipment leaving the base? Is the origin
      the APOE or will movement to an APOE be required? If moving to an APOE, ensure that
      the appropriate transportation is used (i.e., ground trans, commercial airline, Group
      Operational Passenger System (GOPAX), etc.). Is the APOE identified an international
      airport or is it a military installation? If a military installation, do you have their reporting
      instructions/equipment preparation requirements from the local IDO or transportation
      officer?
      3.15.1.2. What is the Mode/Source for the personnel leaving the base? If the
      Mode/Source is ―AC - Air via supporting commander channel (AMC or Service)
      aircraft,‖ the IDO should provide a TPFDD extract to the TMF and PRF to book
      passengers on missions loaded in GATES to meet their DRI at the end destination.
      3.15.1.3. If the Mode/Source is ―AK - Air via strategic (AMC, AMC-contract) aircraft,‖
      the IDO needs to ensure personnel/equipment are at the designated APOE only. The IDO
      can use a few different modes to get personnel/equipment to the APOE—commercial
      airlines, buses, organic or commercial trucks, or GOPAX through the Tanker/Airlift
      Control Center (TACC).
3.16. Movement Flow Schedule.
   3.16.1. The IDRC/DCC will coordinate with its MAJCOM, or AFCHQ, who will coordinate
   with 18th AF/TACC for airflow/surface movement information during normal rotations in
   support of CAF/MAF strategic airlift support. Airlift support for ECS is coordinated with
   TACC by the supported AFCHQ and the AEFC and verified to the supported CCDR for
   validation to USTRANSCOM. The supported CCDR will coordinate movement with
   USTRANSCOM during crisis action.
      3.16.1.1. (Added-AMC) Per CJCSM 3122.02C units must provide lift providers
      (i.e.TACC) with information required to adequately plan airlift requirements. This may
      include load plans, cargo and pax details and hazardous cargo documentation.
   3.16.2. For visibility of airflow, the IDRC/DCC will access DCAPES, GTN, Global
   Decision Support System (GDSS), and/or Single Mobility System (SMS). If airlift is not
   visible after the schedule status flag (SSF) in the TPFDD shows lift is allocated (―A‖), then
   the IDRC/DCC should contact their MAJCOM AEF Cell who will then contact the TACC
   for status.
   3.16.3. Monitor Status. A designated POC in each work center should provide status of
   deployment issues to the IDO/IDRC, who is responsible for status reporting to the BS/CAT.
   Also, POCs will report LIMFAC/shortfall status. DSOE screens, status boards, and other
   electronic media are helpful management tools for tracking deployment status.
 108                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   3.16.4. Monitor Tasking Changes. Due to dynamic situations, taskings and priorities may
   change daily, or even hourly. Bed down sites, number and type of aircraft required, aircraft
   configurations, and so on, can cause extensive changes to unit deployment efforts. In
   addition, the AEFC or FAMs at the MAJCOMs may feel a particular unit tasking has higher
   priorities than others. Units should monitor the situation closely and tailor their actions to
   reflect any changes in priorities.
3.17. Deployment Schedule of Events (DSOE).
   3.17.1. The DSOE is the authoritative document within the wing that orchestrates the
   movement of cargo and personnel (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 for specific cargo and
   personnel processing procedures, respectively). Therefore, its accuracy must be carefully
   ensured. The DSOE and initial load plans need to be worked in conjunction with each other.
   Create the DSOE to ensure cargo and passengers meet departure times of provided lift. The
   DSOE will be created utilizing LOGMOD. Base the DSOE on the movement priority of
   cargo and/or personnel. Reference AFPAM 10-1403, Air Mobility Planning Factors, the
   LOGMOD Users Guide, system help files, and sample DSOEs with recommended event
   times for more detailed information.
   3.17.2. Prioritizing and Monitoring Movement Outflow. The IDO is responsible for
   managing the outflow of cargo and personnel based on these guidelines:
       3.17.2.1. Schedule personnel and cargo to flow through your deployment processes
       (CDF, PDF, or other processes identified in local IDP) in time to meet the departure of
       the deployment transportation. Deployment transportation is coordinated between the
       Supported Command and USTRANSCOM and should be provided in time to meet the
       Supported Command TPFDD RDD.
       3.17.2.2. Units will prioritize the movement of cargo and passengers as directed in
       DCAPES (or, at a minimum, LOGPLAN) to meet the required delivery date specified by
       the Supported Command. The primary method of scheduling personnel and cargo is the
       LOGMOD DSOE.
       3.17.2.3. Units will properly utilize an adequate backup method for the DSOE. If
       automated systems are unavailable, use AF Form 2511, Deployments Schedule of Events
       – Cargo; AF Form 2511A, Deployment Schedule of Events - Passenger; and AF Form
       2512, Deployment Schedule of Events - Loading Schedule (see Attachment 9,
       Attachment 10, and Attachment 11). All work centers must complete scheduled events
       by times depicted on these forms. The IDO may choose to schedule and track some or all
       of the events on the forms, depending on local requirements.
   3.17.3. Distributing the DSOE. Once the schedule is completed, ensure all the key work
   centers and affected units receive the DSOE. Ensure changes to this schedule are published
   and distributed to all key work centers as above. Use either the LOGMOD Remote DSOE
   viewer capability or a distribution method that works best for an installation and include this
   in the IDP.
   3.17.4. Tracking DSOE Actions. Personnel who work in the deployment work centers use
   the DSOE to track the actions required (as described in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5) to ensure
   the people and equipment are processed and loaded on the support transportation (airlift,
   sealift, or vehicles) in time to meet their departure schedule.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                109


   3.17.5. Updating the DSOE. Taskings change, airlift changes, broken equipment causes
   something to move to a different load--anything can cause changes to the DSOE. Units must
   ensure that they inform the DCC of any unit-level issues that may drive DSOE changes.
   Make changes only when necessary and capture reasons for changes in the remarks.
   Distribute changes to all agencies immediately. All final changes to the DSOE will come
   from the DCC to the units and work centers.

Section 3D—Shortfall and Reclama Process

3.18. Shortfalls.
   3.18.1. Air Force active duty, AFRC, ANG, MAJCOMs, NAFs, wings, groups, and units
   will make every effort to meet all major operation and campaign taskings. Generally, relief
   should only be sought when a wing or tasked unit does not possess sufficient or qualified
   personnel to support a contingency tasking, the deployed commander is unable to waive the
   requirement, or the tasking is impossible to meet or will shut down critical elements of the
   home-station mission, as determined by the wing commander or equivalent.
       3.18.1.1. Tasking Waivers. Prior to submitting a reclama, the tasked commander,
       through the PRF and deployed PERSCO, will request the deployed group commander
       waive any restriction (e.g., line remarks, SEI, grade, skill level, etc.) or permit
       substitutions through the waiver process contained in AFI 10-401, Chapter 10, and AFI
       10-215.
       3.18.1.1. (AMC) If no answer to the waiver request is received the unit must submit a
       shortfall IAW wing processes and the timelines depicted in the table below.
   3.18.2. UDMs, through their commanders, will submit personnel and equipment shortfalls
   with the online AF Reclama Processing Tool to the IDO IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 10. The
   unit commander’s role in the shortfall process is critical. Unit commanders must ensure they
   have thoroughly reviewed all shortfalls to ensure that every option regarding AFSC or
   equipment substitution (IAW UTC MISCAP, functional guidance, etc.), risk mitigation, etc.
   have been considered for their respective unit prior to submitting a shortfall. Thus, they are
   ultimately responsible for the overall accuracy of shortfalls submitted by their unit. Report
   personnel shortfalls IAW AFI 10-215, the Supported Command’s reporting
   guidance/processing instructions, this instruction, and AEFC shortfall and reclama
   implementing guidance. The AEFC on-line shortfall process is not applicable to the ANG.
       3.18.2.1. (Added-AMC) AMC Host IDOs will ensure tenant units provide them with a
       courtesy copy of every shortfall submitted via the RPT. Additionally, AMC tenant units
       must ensure the host IDO is aware of shortfalls being submitted. This is accomplished by
       including the appropriate email address in the email notification section of the RPT. This
       requirement should be documented in the IDP.
   3.18.3. UDMs will prepare four copies of the shortfall letter (reproduced copies authorized)
   and distribute one copy each to the following prior to close of the deployment concept
   briefing, if held, or within 24 hours of when shortages occur:
       3.18.3.1. UDM for file copy.
110                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      3.18.3.2. IDRC/DCC personnel representative (for Deployment Position Number (DPN)
      shortages) or LRS representative (for spares, equipment and vehicle shortages). For
      assets not managed by LRS, (i.e., munitions and medical supplies), the appropriate base
      agency will track shortages in coordination with the DCC.
         3.18.3.2.1. Shortages for mobility small arms ammunition for Miscellaneous Units
         defined in AFCAT 21-209, Vol 3 (Logistics, Maintenance, and Services) will be
         tracked and reported based on the authorized base positioning quantity IAW AFI 21-
         201, not the total authorized quantity per weapon.
      3.18.3.3. DCC logistics/unit representative for file copy.
      3.18.3.4. PDF (DPN shortage only).
  3.18.4. The IDO will provide shortfall requests to the PRF and Manpower Office
  representatives in the IDRC, if a manpower shortfall, or Equipment Management Section
  (EMS), if an equipment shortfall, who will then notify the appropriate base-level FAM of the
  shortfall by forwarding the AF Form 4006 for action. The PRF may use personnel with the
  same primary, secondary, or tertiary AFSC. EMS may use equipment with the same national
  stock number (NSN) or a suitable substitute as approved by the MEFPAK Responsible
  Agency FAM for the applicable LOGDET. Suitable replacement must be IAW AFI 10-401
  guidance. Follow AFI 10-401 guidance for further coordination of reclamas. The IDO will
  monitor reclama status via the hqaf.source newsgroup.
      3.18.4.1. The IDRC/DCC Personnel representative or PRF reviews base resources to see
      if individuals, to include Air Force civil service employees, with the required AFSCs are
      located elsewhere on the base in the same MAJCOM in the same AEF. The IDRC/DCC
      Personnel representative/PRF will also check for individuals with matching
      secondary/tertiary AFSCs. NOTE: The Personnel representative to the IDRC/DCC is
      responsible for coordinating filler actions. The PRF will fill that role if the DCC doesn’t
      stand up. When unit resources cannot support the tasking, they acquire or source
      resources from other units and, whenever possible, identify the fills from other on-station
      units from the same MAJCOM and the same AEF. If the base cannot support the tasking
      or the AFSC is not on base, then a shortfall message is sent. NOTE: Personnel identified
      or coded in Augmentation Duty positions are not a legitimate reason to shortfall a
      deployment tasking. Reference AFI 10-401, Chapter 10, for more details on the
      shortfall/reclama process.
  3.18.5. (Added-AMC) Units may use RPT extracts in lieu of ―shortfall letter‖ and AF Form
  4006 described in paragraphs above . Shortfalls to AEF tasked requirements are submitted
  via the on-line RPT, thus no shortfall message is required. For taskings not tasked through
  AEF processes, units will use the AF Form 4006 provide that shortfall via message or Email
  to the appropriate MAJCOM FAM with copies to AMC/A7ZD. NOTE: For those taskings
  not sourced through AFPC/DPW processes, the appropriate tasking agency will be involved
  in the shortfall/reclama process instead of the AFPC.
  3.18.6. (Added-AMC) Shortfalls will be submitted as soon as possible, the following table
  expands the shortfall submission timeline as provided in AFI 10-401.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                   111

          less than 6 days from RDD/DRI.
3.19. Deployment Reporting.
     3.19.1. The IDRC/DCC must keep the installation’s senior leadership up to date during
     deployment operations as specified by local requirements. Use LOGMOD Remote DSOE
     Viewer, if available, to support this requirement. Specific base reporting requirements will be
     identified in the IDP.
3.20. Reporting Deployment UTC Data to JOPES.
     3.20.1. To support the CJCS requirement to develop a sourced TPFDD for the first seven
     days of a crisis within 72 hours, units will electronically transfer tailored LOGPLAN/DSOE
     files to the gaining MAJCOM for review and for processing into JOPES through DCAPES.
     The tasking source specifies how and when to send the information (reference Attachment
     8).
 112                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


3.21. Collecting and Documenting Deployment Data.
   3.21.1. The IDO is responsible for ensuring deployment data is collected IAW this
   instruction, and maintained and disposed of IAW AFMANs 37-123, Maintenance of Air
   Force Records, and AFI 33-364, Records Disposition - Procedures and Responsibilities.
   Additionally, deployment, contingency, and lesser contingency operations records, as they
   may be of historical significance, must be identified and retained as permanent under
   AFMAN 37-139, Table 10-6. The IDO also compiles and analyzes data for trends to identify
   ways of improving the deployment process. Deploying unit commanders must also document
   deployment data to ensure comprehensive deployment analysis to improve unit deployment
   procedures. During deployments, the IDRC/DCC is responsible for collecting and
   documenting deployment activity data. This is essentially handled by each deployed system
   and by unit logs. In LOGMOD/LSA, archive a copy of the Logistics Plan File and the DSOE
   file. In CMOS, archive the cargo and passenger manifest data. This data is of historical
   significance, required for trend analysis and process improvement, and maintained IAW
   AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
   RDS located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Accomplish documentation of lessons learned
   using the Air Force Lessons Learned program (IAW AFI 10-204), MAJCOM after-action
   reporting requirements, and AEF after-action reporting (Reference AFI 10-401).
       3.21.1.1. The IDO will ensure the deployment process includes collection and
       maintenance of the following minimum documentation for deploying aircraft: passenger
       manifest; cargo manifest; equipment listings; hazardous cargo waivers; load plans and
       other documents identifying equipment and personnel aboard deploying aircraft; Shippers
       Declarations for Dangerous Goods; DD Form 2133s, Joint Airlift Inspection Record; and
       LOGMOD/LSA load and packing lists. This will include documentation for both host
       and tenant units. If LOGMOD or LSA is not available or functional for the purpose of
       generating these products, , and AF Form 2518, Deployment Packing List, will be
       manually generated (see Attachment 16 and Attachment 17, respectively).
       3.21.1.2. Create a historical DSOE report after each local deployment for use as a
       management tool and lessons learned.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              113


                                         Chapter 4

   DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION, EQUIPMENT PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Equipment/Cargo Preparation.
   4.1.1. The unit commander, or designated representative, oversees all unit equipment and
   cargo preparation in support of deployments. The commander must ensure units prepare and
   handle their cargo IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR, Part II - Cargo Movement and Part III -
   Mobility; AFI 24-203; AFMAN 24-204(I); AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled
   Vehicle Driver; and Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.
4.2. Convoy Deployments.
   4.2.1. Units that deploy by convoy must follow the specific cargo preparation requirements
   in AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, and DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III, Appendix F.
4.3. Authorized Equipment.
   4.3.1. UTCs will only be filled with equipment assigned to the tasked unit (i.e., not
   fragmented). Exceptions to this policy require a waiver IAW AFI 10-401, Chapter 10.
   Fragmentation could occur where one unit provides the manpower requirement and another
   provides the equipment, or if one unit provides manning augmentation to another unit.
   Typically, fragmenting UTC records will only be allowed in cases where the two units are
   formally linked in DOC statements or other functional area documents.
   4.3.2. No authorization will be counted against more than one UTC record unless a waiver is
   granted by USAF A5XW (e.g., USSTRATCOM supported UTCs). Additionally, each UTC
   record will be placed into only one AEF library per cycle.
   4.3.3. If a unit can no longer support a postured UTC (e.g., a change in authorized position
   or equipment), the unit must coordinate with the respective MAJCOM war planner and
   MAJCOM FAM.
   4.3.4. Personnel in deployable UTCs must be equipped or have access to equipment to
   maintain the UTC capability.
   4.3.5. ART must be updated to reflect status of equipment for each standard deployable UTC
   IAW AFI 10-244.
4.4. Standardized UTC Cargo Increment Types, Deployment Echelons, and Functional
Account Codes (FACs).
   4.4.1. Pilot/non-pilot units will identify cargo increments, within LOGMOD, using the
   proper increment types, deployment echelon codes, and functional account codes.
   4.4.2. Units will assign unit cargo increment monitors to manage a given set of cargo
   increments from each deploying unit.
      4.4.2.1. The monitors will ensure they provide inputs/updates to their UDMs, who will
      ensure the LOGMOD database is updated with the most updated information.
   4.4.3. Refer to AFI 10-401 and the LOGMOD Help file for proper use of increment types,
   deployment echelon codes, and functional account codes.
 114                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


4.5. Equipment Sourcing.
   4.5.1. The AEFC is responsible for recommending sourcing of all UTCs that contain
   equipment to include equipment-only UTCs not directly tied to a unit (e.g., vehicles)
   postured in the 10 AEF or Enabler libraries. UTCs that contain both Manpower and
   LOGDET detail will be sourced by the AEFC using the same procedures and priorities as
   personnel only UTCs. Due to the sensitivity of AFSOC’s mission and AMC’s global MAF
   support, these mission requirements will continue to be sourced by the respective
   MAJCOMs. HQ AMC will source unique theater requirements for munitions support. The
   ECS SIPT is the focal point for coordinating all issues and concerns relative to equipment
   sourcing.
   4.5.2. Generic equipment-only UTCs will be placed in the Enabler library IAW guidance in
   AFI 10-401, Chapters 7 and 9. For sourcing purposes, all equipment-only UTCs placed in the
   UTC Availability are available for deployment.
   4.5.3. The AEFC will nominate equipment-only UTCs from the installations in the on-call
   AEF deployment window as identified by the ECS SIPT-approved Target Base Alignment
   Template.
   4.5.4. Once sourced, and at the direction of the parent MAJCOM, units/wings will
   electronically pass their equipment (DCAPES cargo-level detail) information to their
   MAJCOM FAM. Units/Wings must indicate if the equipment detail is from a UTC that
   contains both equipment and personnel or an equipment-only UTC.
   4.5.5. Use of WRM is restricted to ensure sufficient capability is available to support theater
   starter or swing stock requirements. Use must be approved only after considering the impact
   on ability to meet emerging requirements and the ability and timeliness of reconstituting the
   WRM assets. WRM assets should not be used solely to support ongoing rotational
   operations. Prior to using WRM, requesting organizations will make every effort to satisfy
   the requirement using alternative means of support. If still required, the requesting
   organization must follow procedures for indirect mission support IAW AFI 25-101.
4.6. Identify and Prepare Equipment and Cargo.
   4.6.1. This process ensures all equipment/cargo is properly identified, prepared, and
   documented (including appropriate customs documentation) before marshaling (see
   Attachment 4 for equipment processing process flowcharts). This is a unit responsibility that
   is usually completed in the unit area. As early as possible, units will identify equipment/cargo
   tasked for deployment and start all documentation (particularly hazardous materials
   (HAZMAT)) required.
   4.6.2. Accountability Sub-process. Deploying activities are required to account for their
   deploying unit equipment through the supporting CAF or MAF Logistics Support Centers
   IAW AFMAN 23-110. ANG is not currently supported by these centers.
   4.6.3. Accountability of Deployed Equipment and Vehicles. Before execution, UDMs,
   through the LRS Customer Service Center, will identify deployment equipment and ensure
   the assignment of the correct use codes (reference AFI 25-101) and UTCs.
       4.6.3.1. Upon receipt of tasking, the UDM or Vehicle Control Officer/NCO
       (VCO/VCNCO) will identify deploying equipment or vehicles, and appropriate support
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               115


       kits, and report them to the LRS Customer Service Center and/or Vehicle Operations
       Flight. LRS will prepare a deployed custodian account/custody receipt listing (CA/CRL)
       and will then update their systems.
   4.6.4. When preparing for deployments, units will refer to the squadron or shop LOGPLAN
   materiel list to ensure they have the required equipment. LOGPLAN materiel lists will be
   kept accurate and deploying equipment marked in advance (if possible). For cargo
   preparation, use LOGMOD to produce load and packing lists.
4.7. Identify and Document Hazardous Materials.
   4.7.1. Units will maintain and provide a current sample Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous
   Goods form for each hazardous item, to include a HAZMAT certification authorization letter
   signed by the unit commander or a designated representative, to the base TMF. The TMF
   will physically inspect cargo to ensure Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods forms are
   prepared accurately. Traffic Management Flight will review the forms for accuracy and
   create a sample book for the CDF, load planning, and Quality Control (QC).
4.8. Prepare Hazardous Material Shipments.
   4.8.1. To ensure hazardous materials are prepared and ready for shipment, units will:
       4.8.1.1. Prepare and move hazardous material shipments IAW AFMAN 24-204(I) (49
       CFR for surface shipments) and MIL-STD-129P, DOD Standard Practice, Military
       Marking for Shipment and Storage.
       4.8.1.2. Ensure applicable Competent Authority Approvals (CAA), Department of
       Transportation (DOT) Special Permits, Certifications of Equivalency (COE), and
       packaging or compatibility waivers accompany shipments.
       4.8.1.3. Classified or signature service hazardous materials are identified by using a DD
       Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification, in addition to a Shipper’s Declaration
       of Dangerous Goods.
       4.8.1.4. Ensure packaging, marking,       and documentation capability exists         for
       redeployment to home station.
   4.8.2. Hazardous cargo information is located in the TCMD located in LOGMOD
   LOGPLAN files. Tasked units load hazardous cargo information using the UDM Module of
   LOGMOD/LSA.
4.9. Sensitive Cargo.
   4.9.1. Units must handle and ship classified material IAW DOD 5200.1-R, Information
   Security Program Regulation, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
   AFI 31-401 also gives specific guidance on how to account for deployed classified material.
   4.9.2. Move weapons and ammunition IAW DOD 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive
   Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives. All deploying units must appoint a
   weapons and an ammunitions courier to accompany/receipt for small arms and ammunitions
   requirements while in transit and be trained IAW DOD 5100.76-M. Also, see DOD 4500.9-
   R, DTR Part III, for further transportation guidance. Ensure accountability is accomplished
   IAW AFI 21-201.
 116                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


4.10. Equipment/Cargo Documentation.
   4.10.1. Each increment of equipment/cargo must carry specific documentation IAW cargo
   preparation directives identified in the following paragraphs. Units must include these
   minimum forms of documentation/identification with each increment.
       4.10.1.1. Military Shipment Label (MSL). Each palletized load or non-palletized piece of
       cargo must have an authorized MSL, produced from CMOS/GATES, attached for air
       shipment IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III, and MIL-STD-129P. At a minimum, the
       following elements of information will be provided on the MSL: TCN (Transportation
       Control Number) with embedded ULN (up to the full seven digits), Origin (to include
       Stock Record account Number/DOD Account Activity Code (SRAN/DODAAC)),
       APOE, APOD, Destination (to include SRAN/DODAAC), Cube, Dimensions, Weight,
       and unit POC. Whenever possible MSLs should be produced from an automated system
       so that linear or 2D barcodes are shown for the TCN, destination/consignee, and piece
       number blocks so automated identification technology can be used to process unit move
       shipments through the terminals expeditiously.
          4.10.1.1.1. Temporary LOGMOD/LSA Deployment Shipping Placards will be used
          by UDMs for shipment/equipment identification purposes from the deploying unit to
          the CDF to facilitate the in-check process for deployments, exercises, and unit moves.
          UDMs may produce manual DD Form 1387s in place of LOGMOD/LSA placards
          during periods of LOGMOD/LSA inoperability. NOTE: Currently LOGMOD/LSA
          deployment shipping placards do not meet DTR requirements (bar coding) and
          therefore cannot be used for actual deployments, exercises, or unit moves (AFI 24-
          238, paragraph 1.10.1.1).
       4.10.1.2. Once equipment/cargo is in-checked into the CDF, CDF operators will produce
       an updated, accurate, and authorized MSL prior to joint inspection (JI). It is ultimately
       the CDF-CMOS/GATES operator’s responsibility to produce an updated MSL for every
       increment of cargo upon in-check into the CDF (Reference AFI 24-238). If
       CMOS/GATES is not available to produce authorized MSLs, then CDFs/units will
       handwrite required information on a DD Form 1387 IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III,
       and MIL-STD-129P. If manual DD Form 1387 is used, ensure blocks 1, 9, and 16 are
       legible for down line stations to update the advance movement data file and produce
       updated automated MSLs with bar codes, if capable. CDF personnel will place label in a
       waterproof envelope and securely attach the envelop to the deploying increment.
       4.10.1.3. Load and Packing Lists. LOGMOD/LSA is the source system for generating
       Deployment Cargo Load and Packing lists. If LOGMOD or LSA is not available or
       functional for the purpose of generating these products, an AF Form 2518, Deployment
       Packing List, will be manually generated (see Attachment 14). Items loaded onto
       increments (containers onto pallets or rolling stock) will be marked/stenciled in a
       waterproof manner. Minimum markings will consist of:
       4.10.1.4. Line One: UTC/Unit of assignment (e.g., 890 FS).
       4.10.1.5. Line Two: Deployment echelon/Increment number/Item number (e.g., C1-
       1004-01) Apply packing/shipping markings and labels IAW equipment technical orders.
       Additional unit markings are authorized.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              117


        4.10.1.5.1. Load and Packing lists must be accurate and be attached in weatherproof
        pouch with the pallet/container. NOTE: Accurate load and packing lists are critical to
        ensure unit equipment is not delayed by customs at entry into other countries. Failure
        by units to create accurate documentation can delay equipment arrival to the bed
        down location and seriously affect the mission. Pen and ink changes are authorized.
        4.10.1.5.2. All containers (except as otherwise identified herein) will have a
        LOGMOD packing list affixed with detailed list of all suffixed items within the
        container. When a suffixed item in the container is a container itself with more than
        one item, the inside container will have an AF Form 2518 attached as well. Locally
        developed electronic forms may be used, provided they include, as a minimum, the
        same data fields as the AF Form 2518.
        4.10.1.5.3. Medical units may use Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support
        (DMLSS) packing lists and logistics readiness units may use SBSS listings (R-43,
        etc.) for Mobility Readiness Spare Package (MRSP) packing lists. Civil Engineering
        units will use Equipment and Supply Listing (ESL). Standard configuration for
        equipment is identified in the ESL. The contents of individual kits are further defined
        in the ESL. Printed copies of pertinent ESL information will be placed on or within
        individual kits. Units will not use manual Deployment Load and Packing lists except
        under the most unusual of circumstances (i.e., LOGMOD/LSA system failure).
        4.10.1.5.4. The packing list, (ESL for CE only), will contain the contents (suffix
        items) for items identified as containers and include NSN, nomenclature, tasked
        quantities, hazard/special handling indicator codes, sensitive/controlled items, and
        ASCs of suffix items. The following exceptions apply: 1) Do not list contents for
        MRSP except those that are hazardous or Use Code "A" (Allowance Standard asset);
        2) Do not list the contents for Consolidated Tool Kits (CTKs) except those that are
        hazardous or Use Code "A"; 3) Do not list miscellaneous administrative supplies
        (pens, pencils, paper, etc.) except those that are hazardous or Use Code "A"; 4) Do
        not list medical supplies except those that are hazardous or Use Code "A"; or 5) Do
        not list individual CE kits except those that are hazardous or Use Code "A". NOTE:
        LOGMOD is not designed for making frequent changes to fluctuating quantities of
        such expendables as pencils, forms, hand tools, or narcotics. Inventory and
        Deployment Packing lists for CTKs and miscellaneous administrative supplies are the
        responsibilities of the owning unit.
        4.10.1.5.5. Units will maintain approach shoring material for the unit’s equipment
        and identify this material within their load and packing lists to account for the
        additional weight of this material.
     4.10.1.6. Pallet Identifiers. Air Freight/Transportation personnel will produce and place
     pallet identifiers, DD Form 2775, on two adjacent sides of a pallet or one conspicuously
     on one side of rolling stock per DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III.
     4.10.1.7. Deployment Transportation Control Number (TCN). If LOGMOD is not
     operational, the deployment TCN can be manually constructed by following instructions
     in DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III, Appendix H. NOTE: The TCN will include the ULN
     (use full seven-digit ULN when available), Deployment echelon, and increment number
     (automatically generated in LOGMOD DSOE module).
 118                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


4.11. Pallet Build-up.
   4.11.1. Pallet profile for all aircraft (e.g., C-130, KC-10, and Civil Reserve Airlift Fleet
   (CRAF)) will be considered when preparing cargo pallets. This may significantly reduce the
   possibility of further modifications at the time of actual loading. See Attachment 12 for
   pallet build-up checklists.
   4.11.2. Palletize Baggage. Baggage will be palletized for 20 or more passengers and for all
   C-5 and KC-10 aircraft. C-5 and C-17 baggage pallets will be loaded in the rear of the
   aircraft and KC-10 and KC-135 baggage pallets will be loaded towards the nose to expedite
   download at the final destination. Baggage pallets will follow the same height and contour
   restrictions as other pallets. When 20 or more passengers are on a chalk, load planners must
   account for baggage pallets on the load plan by using canned weights/heights (2500lbs/45).
   4.11.3. Any required shoring/dunnage will be provided by the unit and must be deployed
   with its associated equipment/pallet. Units deploying or redeploying are responsible for all
   cargo preparation to include providing special equipment operators, venting liquid oxygen
   (LOX) carts, providing de-icer drivers, etc. NOTE: Deploying units are required to install
   appropriate vent kit to the equipment. Aircraft maintenance personnel will then connect to
   aircraft venting system.
   4.11.4. Pallet dunnage will always accompany 463L pallets during movement. The
   following are general movement characteristics for pallet dunnage: length 88 inches, width 4
   inches, height 4 inches, and quantity of 3. Dunnage NSN information can be obtained from
   the IDO, the TMF, or by using the Federal Logistics (FEDLOG) system.
4.12. Deliver Cargo.
   4.12.1. Cargo movement requirements/responsibilities will be documented in the local IDP.
   Deliver cargo to the in-check area as required by the DSOE. Units deliver rolling stock. If
   required, units contact the LRS Vehicle Operations Flight, or DCC, to transport non-rolling
   stock items. Units must arrange movement of cargo well in advance of required DSOE
   processing times to ensure on-time processing and availability of transportation assets.
   Deploying non-local Air Force and non-Air Force units will provide a diskette in electronic
   format (CMOS/GATES/Transportation Coordinators-Automated Information for Movements
   System II (TC-AIMS II), or new generation system) containing outbound air cargo
   information to the CDF, Aircraft Services, or Cargo Processing Section IAW published times
   contained in local DSOE to expedite processing of cargo into the airlift system. Non-local
   Air Force and non-Air Force units will also provide a diskette with deploying passenger data
   to the PDF for input into IDS systems (CMOS/GATES) for manifest preparation, (Reference
   AFI 24-238, paragraph 1.12.4.). NOTE: Diskette data formatting information that will allow
   units to present passenger data in required format can be found at the CMOS and GATES
   websites. CMOS and GATES websites providing this information are:
   4.12.2. CMOS: https://www.gunter.af.mil/.
   4.12.3. GATES: https://gates.scott.af.mil/.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                     119


4.13. Cargo Processing.
   4.13.1. The CDF will:
      4.13.1.1. Receive, in-check, JI, and load unit equipment. The CDF is a controlled area.
      The CDF must have the capability to weigh and measure equipment.
      4.13.1.2. Determine and comply with any special requirements or procedures that may
      be required to inspect explosives (e.g., EOD/SF loads usually require a separate holding
      area or ―hot cargo pad‖ for meeting all safety requirements).
      4.13.1.3. Identify personnel to perform any ―mobile‖ in-check requirements and ensure
      enough materials are available.
      4.13.1.4. Coordinate commercial surface movement through TMF.
      4.13.1.5. Make augmentees aware of hazards such as LOX carts and explosives.
   4.13.2. Marshaling. Marshaling is the orderly assembly of cargo (in load plan sequence by
   chalk, in preparation for JI) to a location called the staging or call forward area. Identify these
   locations as sterile areas to ensure the equipment is not ―tampered‖ with (adding or deleting
   pieces). The CDF controls entry into the marshaling yard. Identify these areas in the IDP.
   4.13.3. Joint Inspection (JI) of Cargo. JI is the final inspection with the owning unit and the
   joint inspector (or loadmaster, if necessary) before the load is accepted.
      4.13.3.1. Review each increment/shipment against the load list with the unit
      representative. Verify items are present or have the unit representative make appropriate
      adjustments to the load list. Make proper adjustments to the load list so correct data can
      be updated in LOGMOD. This is usually the source document load planners use for
      finalizing actual load plans.
      4.13.3.2. Check all cargo documentation for consistency of proper markings, weight, and
      dimensions.
      4.13.3.3. Verify hazardous cargo documentation.
      4.13.3.4. Spot-check tire pressure, weight, dimensions, and center of balance (CB)
      markings to ensure accuracy. Check increments/shipments if the placard and load list
      weights differ, dimensions are close to allowable limits or appear suspect, contain
      secondary loads (e.g., cargo on trailers), or had several item numbers deleted (e.g.,
      mobility readiness spares package pallets). If weight, dimensions, or CB differ from
      preplanned, make corrections and notify load planning. CB is not required for surface
      moves.
      4.13.3.5. Conduct a thorough physical inspection of all increments/shipments, to include
      opening doors on vehicles and accessible doors and panels on ground support equipment
      (GSE). Restraints or tie-downs should not be disturbed unless necessary to determine fuel
      levels or prepare installed batteries. In-check personnel are not required to tear down
      pallets or unload cargo to search for hidden discrepancies. NOTE: 100% of integrated
      container-pallets (like ISUs) will be opened and inspected by CDF personnel. Containers
      will be frustrated if they do not meet local transportation guidance for ensuring ISU-type
      containers are packed correctly.
120                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      4.13.3.6. Verify that vehicles and GSE are "reasonably free" of built-up dirt, fuel residue,
      oil, grease, and other flammable or corrosive residue. While "reasonably free" requires a
      subjective judgment, the goal of this requirement is to:
         4.13.3.6.1. Prevent leaking equipment that may endanger personnel or compromise
         aircraft and vehicle safety. A leak is a loss of fluid or fuel that is readily detected or
         seen. Five or more drops a minute from a cooling system, crankcase, or gearbox is
         considered unacceptable, as well as any fuel leak or brake system leak. A damp or
         discolored seal is not considered a leak unless the above conditions exist.
         4.13.3.6.2. Avoid the spread of agricultural pests and diseases that may exist in
         accumulations of built-up dirt and mud.
         4.13.3.6.3. Avoid soiling or contaminating the aircraft floor and tie-down equipment
         with dirt, grease, or leaking fluid as this may endanger the safety of personnel
         working in the cargo compartment.
      4.13.3.7. Make sure items loaded in the bed of vehicles and trailers are properly
      restrained for air shipment. All loose equipment should be secured before marshaling.
      Surface convoys also require the use of proper restraints. Rope restraints should not be
      removed, as they may be needed for onward surface movement at their destination. These
      ropes will not, however, replace the use of cargo straps or chains to meet aircraft or over-
      the-road restraint criteria. Items too small to be properly secured should be placed in a
      restrained box or bin. Light cables and air or heater hoses on GSE may be secured to the
      unit using tape, rope, cord, or similar material.
      4.13.3.8. If an item is not properly prepared or documentation is incorrect, it should be
      placed in the frustrated cargo area and the CDF OIC/NCOIC notified immediately so that
      corrective action may be taken. The CDF OIC/NCOIC must notify the DCC of all cargo
      frustrations or any issues impacting the CDF.
      4.13.3.9. Ensure keys and combinations accompany cargo to in-check. Lack of keys or
      combinations will cause cargo to be frustrated.
      4.13.3.10. After the JI process is complete, equipment is and ready for loading. Ensure
      an experienced unit representative is readily available in case of discrepancies that may
      need to be fixed on the spot. At a minimum, documentation requirements (corrected
      copies of HAZMAT certification forms) may need to be fixed and unit representative
      should be trained and qualified to perform those duties.
      4.13.3.11. Each unit will also have a representative (increment monitor) accompany the
      equipment to the in-check area that can resolve discrepancies or can communicate
      requirements to appropriate unit personnel until their cargo clears the JI. The tasked unit
      must have a team ready (quick-fix team) to immediately respond to resolve any
      discrepancies frustrating the cargo.
  4.13.4. Frustrated Cargo. Frustrated cargo is cargo that failed the inspection at the in-check
  area, joint inspection, or any place after arriving at the CDF prior to loading the aircraft and
  was set aside until it could be fixed by the unit.
      4.13.4.1. Cargo frustration times are tracked because failure to fix a frustrated piece of
      cargo can delay the entire deployment schedule and affect a unit’s capability to support
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 121


      the mission at the deployed location. Reliable communications between the DCC, CDF,
      and tasked units are required to ensure that the tasked unit can quickly be called to
      resolve cargo frustrations, if the unit quick-fix team is not already pre-positioned in the
      CDF.
      4.13.4.2. CDF and the local IDP will identify a frustrated cargo holding area for
      increments having discrepancies (documentation or improper preparation).
      4.13.4.3. The CDF will notify the DCC immediately of all frustrated cargo, so proper
      action can be taken to resolve the problem.
   4.13.5. Cargo Manifesting. Cargo manifests will be prepared for each chalk to ensure in-
   transit visibility from point of origin to final destination. The individuals assigned to this
   function will be extremely knowledgeable of the requirements of DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part
   II. Cargo load plans cannot be used as cargo manifests.
      4.13.5.1. Either CMOS (or GATES for CONUS AMC strategic Aerial Port units and
      OCONUS en routes) will be used to generate the manifest. If CMOS or GATES are not
      available to produce the cargo manifest, a DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, is used. Fax
      or email DD Form 1385 to AMC ITV cell (ITV.AMC.TEAM@scott.af.mil) for ITV
      purposes. It is imperative that the UDMs ensure all of the required TCMD data (e.g.,
      transportation trailer data for HAZMAT, sensitive, classified, etc.) is accurate and loaded
      in LOGMOD. UDMs may require the assistance of transportation specialists to ensure
      TCMD Data meets DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III, requirements. Required information
      will be exported to CMOS or GATES from LOGMOD. CMOS or GATES will feed
      cargo and personnel manifests to GTN to provide in-transit visibility. Either CMOS or
      GATES will be used to generate the electronic cargo manifest and diskette to accompany
      each load of manifested cargo.
4.14. Load Planning.
   4.14.1. Load planners will use AALPS to prepare load plans. However, proficiency in using
   manual load planning methods must be maintained in the event AALPS is not available.
   4.14.2. Load planners will build initial load plans in conjunction with the person building the
   DSOE to ensure a viable DSOE. Ensure proper sequencing of equipment and personnel
   based on priority flow, en route support, and force/equipment mix needed to achieve initial
   operating capability at the bed down location as soon as possible.
   4.14.3. Coordinate with the DCC before moving a piece of equipment/cargo from one load
   to another to ensure the move will not affect either en route support or operations at the bed
   down location.
   4.14.4. Ensure that cargo, personnel, aircraft, and load plan destinations are the same. Units
   will coordinate with logistics planners to ensure prioritization of cargo to meet the mission
   requirements at the deployed location.
   4.14.5. Avoid placing all critical initial operating support equipment and personnel on the
   same aircraft/mode of transportation to prevent loss of capability if the mode is delayed or
   destroyed.
   4.14.6. Increments within a single UTC which are too small to be palletized by themselves,
   will be physically combined with other increments into a single increment and palletized
 122                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   whenever possible. When combined, a lead unit for that increment will be designated by the
   DCC or appropriate cargo processing function. The lead unit must then identify a POC for
   the increment or pallet. When combining increments and/or pallets, units must coordinate
   their efforts with the DCC scheduler and/or the IDO to ensure the DSOE Remarks field
   identifies which increments have been combined and which of the those increments is the
   Lead Increment/TCN. LOGMOD Administrators and UDMs should not combine different
   UTCs together into a single increment or pallet in order to ensure appropriate ITV. If UTCs
   must be combined into single increments in LOGMOD, ITV will not be lost if the following
   steps are followed:
       4.14.6.1. Use the Chalk Remarks block on the DSOE, for the specified chalk, to reflect
       combined UTC Increments.
       4.14.6.2. Use the Chalk Remarks block to identify the Lead Increment (i.e., TCN) for all
       of the increments that have been combined and what deploying unit is overall responsible
       for packaging and generating deployment products for that Lead Increment.
       4.14.6.3. CMOS/GATES operators will use the DSOE Chalk Remarks field, for the
       specified chalk, to consolidate the combined UTC increments under a tab pallet header
       (capped pallet). Even though CMOS/GATES will reflect a Lead TCN, all of the
       combined increments (i.e., subsidiary TCNs) will be associated to the Lead and will be
       visible in GTN. NOTE: When physically combining increments of cargo, copies of the
       load lists, for each of the increments that are being combined, must be placed on the
       outside of the Lead Increment. This allows CDF personnel to have access to all load list
       information at the time of JI/In-check. The Lead load list should be placed on the outside
       of the increment packing envelope as to be the first document pulled by the CDF in-
       checker. This lead load list must be annotated to reflect the overall combined increment
       weights and dimensions. Pen and ink changes are authorized. The same procedures apply
       for Deployment Shipping Placards for combined increments.
   4.14.7. Distribute Load Plans. Once the final load plans are accomplished, load planners
   ensure all essential players receive them. The following people and agencies need the
   indicated number of copies of load plans: aircraft commander (1-original), load team chief
   (1), DCC (1), station file copy (1), and ramp coordinator (1), if applicable. The load plan is
   NOT the same as the cargo manifest. The Cargo Manifest (DD Form 1385) or its automated
   equivalent is the official manifest IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part II.
       4.14.7.1. (Added-AMC) The IDO/DCC will ensure a copy of the load plan is included
       in the troop commander’s package.
4.15. Loading.
   4.15.1. The Cargo Deployment Function. Loads unit equipment and baggage. For specific
   guidance on how to load aircraft, consult DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part III, and the applicable
   aircraft -9 Technical Order (TO).
       4.15.1.1. Load team chiefs will ensure all team members are familiar with the load plan
       and everyone on the team understands their specific responsibilities. The load team chiefs
       will check with the ramp coordinator (RAMPCO) or OIC/NCOIC of the CDF if a load
       plan is not available at least 45 minutes before DSOE scheduled load start time. NOTE:
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               123


     Ensure load start time is coordinated with units’ operations representatives to ensure crew
     availability.
     4.15.1.2. All loads will be ready to load NLT 30 minutes before scheduled load start time
     or as spelled out in the IDP.
     4.15.1.3. Each load team should consist of a team chief and at least three handlers or
     operators. At the beginning of the shift, the team chief will conduct a safety briefing
     covering at least the following:
         4.15.1.3.1. Safe operation of MHE (e.g., speed limits, use of chocks, and need for
         spotters).
         4.15.1.3.2. Safe cargo handling (pallets pushed – not pulled, etc.).
         4.15.1.3.3. Safety equipment for all load team members, e.g., safety-toed work boots,
         gloves, reflective gear, light wands for hours of darkness, etc.
         4.15.1.3.4. Safety procedures during engine-running on/offloads (EROs) and
         concurrent refueling (if applicable).
     4.15.1.4. The deploying unit should furnish drivers for specialized equipment (e.g.,
     Rescue all-terrain transports (RATTs), all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), M-series vehicles,
     etc.). These drivers will load specialized equipment under the supervision of the
     loadmaster.
     4.15.1.5. The load team chief will follow safe loading procedures at all times, as well as
     ensure:
     4.15.1.6. Cargo is identified and segregated into loads according to the DSOE.
     4.15.1.7. The team has sufficient serviceable MHE to perform loading operations.
     4.15.1.8. The team loads the aircraft or vehicle according to the final load plan or at the
     direction of the aircraft commander or designated representative.
     4.15.1.9. Cargo is visually checked for obvious leaks and discrepancies before loading.
     Notify the RAMPCO of any problems so corrective action can be taken.
     4.15.1.10. Brief the loadmaster on the load configuration and special loading
     requirements. Have the team load the aircraft under the loadmaster's supervision.
     4.15.1.11. Report load start and completion times to the DCC.
     4.15.1.12. When loading 463L pallets onto aircraft, ensure that all placards are facing the
     same aisle-way side in the aircraft.
     4.15.1.13. Cargo is properly loaded onto trucks with adequate tie-down, as directed by
     the vehicle operator. All items planned for the truck are loaded.
  4.15.2. Aircraft Loadmaster Briefing. The ramp coordinator or load team chief will deliver
  deployment manifests and brief the Aircraft Loadmaster on the specifics of the load to
  include all hazardous materiel before loading.
  4.15.3. Ramp Coordinator (RAMPCO). RAMPCOs are the ―key ingredient‖ for ensuring a
  successful command and control element exists between flightline activities and the CDF and
 124                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


   DCC. For AMC units with an APS, this responsibility/function rests with Air Terminal
   Operations Center (ATOC).
       4.15.3.1. Responsible to the CDF for overseeing and coordinating all aircraft and vehicle
       loading operations as outlined in the DSOE and works closely with the CDF and PDF to
       ensure all facets of airlift support are met. The ramp coordinator act as the eyes and ears
       of the CDF function and, therefore, must closely monitor all aircraft ground handling
       operations and maintain constant communication with the CDF.
       4.15.3.2. Will carefully monitor their assigned loads from marshaling complete time
       until the aircraft or truck departs.
       4.15.3.3. At a minimum, RAMPCOs will visually check their load for any obvious
       discrepancies (leaks, missing placards, weights, etc.) prior to aircraft loading. In addition,
       they will be familiar with all the characteristics of the load (HAZMAT, documentation
       requirements, required waivers, etc.).
4.16. In-Transit Visibility (ITV).
   4.16.1. Use of Air Force automated systems that comprise the IDS to deploy Air Force
   forces is mandatory. IDS components include LOGMOD/LSA, DCAPES, CMOS, and
   AALPS. AMC’s GATES is considered an IDS partner and may be used in lieu of CMOS by
   CONUS AMC strategic Aerial Port units. To achieve deployment ITV, pass cargo and
   passenger deployment files from LOGMOD and DCAPES (or other Service systems) to
   CMOS or GATES, which, in turn, pass movement data to GTN. Further information and
   guidance on the use of CMOS can be found in AFI 24-203, Chapter 15, and online at
   https://www.gunter.af.mil/.
   4.16.2. The IDO is responsible for ensuring cargo and passenger data is accurately entered
   into IDS components to maintain ITV within established time frames. Without exception,
   valid and full 7-character (if used) ULNs from the applicable CCDR’s TPFDD are required
   for deployment cargo and personnel in order to relate these resources back to the force
   requirements in the TPFDD. Fictitiously entered ULNs will prevent cross-referencing this
   data back to the TPFDD (AFI 24-238, paragraph 1.11.1.).
   4.16.3. ITV provides visibility of deploying cargo and personnel from home station, or
   origin, to destination. Supported/Supporting commanders use ITV to track the flow of
   capabilities and critical assets (e.g., munitions) from origin into an area of operations (AO).
   Transportation closure, as indicated by ITV, is critical as a gauge to predict when capabilities
   are in place to commence operations. However, force closure cannot be ascertained through
   ITV alone. Only the deployed commander can declare force closure and operational
   capability (i.e., the force is ready to commence operations).
   4.16.4. IDS must be used to support the deployment process and enable/achieve ITV.
   CMOS/GATES manifest diskettes will accompany all missions to facilitate re-manifesting
   and continuation of ITV at en route or trans-load locations. CMOS/GATES must pass the
   movement data, with valid ULNs, to GTN. Training for CMOS can be downloaded from the
   following web site: https://www.gunter.af.mil/. A training manual for GATES can be
   downloaded from the following web site: https://gates.scott.af.mil/.

4.17. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tags.
   4.17.1. RFID tags are required for deployed unit and non-unit move cargo. The LRS TMF,
   or APS at CONUS AMC strategic port bases, will ensure non-unit move cargo is properly
   tagged IAW DOD requirements. Storage and maintenance of RFID tags will be IAW the
   IDP. The CDF will burn unit tags using shipment data imported to CMOS (GATES for
   CONUS AMC Strategic Aerial Ports) from LOGMOD and ensure tags are attached to all end
   items before aircraft loading commences. End items include rolling stock, pallets, and non-
   palletized containers. RFID tagging is required for equipment being deployed off
   installation/base for contingencies, deployments, or exercises and units should be prepared to
   demonstrate capability during base-level exercises. See AFI 24-238 for more details about
   RFID tagging.

                                          Chapter 5

   DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION, PERSONNEL PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS

5.1. The People Process.
   5.1.1. This chapter provides valuable information concerning the processing of personnel,
   for pre-planning and execution, and the processing activities supporting the personnel
   deployment process. The DRMD generated by DCAPES dictates the personnel taskings the
   unit must be prepared to fill for a deployment and is an essential element of the Personnel
   and Manpower communities supporting total force accountability. To this end, Manpower
   and Personnel at all levels facilitate the effective communication and coordination of
   executed TPFDDs, OPLANs, and any other contingencies by translating the TPFDD into a
   DRMD and validating whether the force mix and organization structure will accomplish the
   intended mission. They are critical elements in personnel requirement and resource
   accountability.
5.2. Personnel Authorizations.
   5.2.1. Postured UTCs will only be filled with authorizations from one unit (i.e., not
   fragmented). See AFI 10-401, Chapter 10, for exceptions and waiver procedures.
   5.2.2. Personnel in deployable UTCs must be trained and equipped or have access to
   equipment to maintain the UTC capability. ART must be updated to reflect status of
   personnel and equipment for each standard deployable UTC IAW AFI 10-244.
   5.2.3. When ―assigned‖ personnel is less than ―authorized,‖ priority should be given to
   filling UTCs required to maintain maximum combat capability as described by the unit DOC
   statement and as reported in SORTS. For most units this will put priority on filling
   deployable UTCs. If a unit with multiple UTCs only has one of a particular UTC then the
   following priority applies: DWS, DWX, DXS, DPS, DXX, and then DPX. If a unit with
   multiple UTCs has more than one of a particular UTC then the following priority applies:
   DWS, DXS, DPS, DWX, DXX, and then DPX. As a reminder, a UTC record coded DX_ can
   fill a DW_ requirement at execution during surge tasking as long as the total number of
   UTCs of that particular type does not exceed the total number of DW_ UTCs of that type
   postured across all AEF libraries.
5.3. Air Force Deployment Planning and Execution Concept.
   5.3.1. Air Force unit deployments normally occur after a Movement Day (C-Day) is
   established (NOTE: AMC’s Global Mobility Task Force as well as some other forces may
   move well before C-Day). Since planning assumptions, response options, and mobilization
   timing vary depending on the execution scenario, units may not move as a single UTC entity.
   Transportation constraints, reception capabilities and operational concepts dictate the final
   closure rate of the deploying force to the destination.
   5.3.2. Deployment Tasking Requirements. Consolidate all deployment tasking requirements
   for a particular contingency, exercise, or deployment into the DRMD. This document is a
   critical element of the deployment process for personnel and manpower functions. It provides
   MAJCOM, AFCHQ, and wings the requirements for fulfilling exercise, deployment, and
   contingency requirements. Failure to understand the DRMD and what to do with it causes
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              127


   problems throughout the process. AFI 10-401 gives the specific details on the data elements
   of the DRMD.
   5.3.3. Deployment Requirements Manning Document (DRMD). Transmit the DRMD to the
   base from the supported component command via the AEFC using DPT to the sourced base
   IDRC. The IDRC requires the DRMD to move forces. The DRMD has nine key and essential
   pieces of personnel deployment tasking information (NOTE: Every contingency,
   deployment, or exercise tasking built, created, and flowed contains this necessary
   information and other data elements relevant to the process). They are: PID, ULN, ULN
   position number, position number suffix, AFSC, unique qualifications (i.e., line remarks),
   tasked PAS, DRI, duty location (DLOC), and attached PAS.
      5.3.3.1. The baseline process is that the OPLAN requirements are loaded in both the
      Personnel and Manpower DCAPES. Before exporting plan data from DCAPES for input
      into other parts of the IDS system, the DCAPES operator uses published declassification
      procedures and software to ensure only unclassified data is passed from the classified
      system.
      5.3.3.2. The IDRC and tasked units review the key and essential pieces of the personnel
      deployment tasking and determine the proper course of actions (e.g., activating the wing
      deployment process).
      5.3.3.3. Tailoring and modifying the DRMD is managed according to AFI 10-401 and
      AFI 38-205. Once this is complete, the unit must assign personnel to support the
      requirement. The UTC identifies the specific requirements including the AFSC, SEIs,
      security clearances, and grade needed by personnel selected to fulfill the tasking.
5.4. Assigning Personnel to Planning and Execution Requirements.
   5.4.1. Commanders will ensure appropriate personnel have their affairs in order and have a
   Personal Readiness Folder (see paragraph 1.6.2.9), containing required deployment
   documentation, on file and maintained by the UDM. The following paragraphs provide a
   baseline or starting point for aiding the building of a successful personnel process (see
   Attachment 4 for flowchart of personnel processing process).
      5.4.1.1. The IDRC Personnel and Manpower representative(s) will have all the
      requirements identified by unit so the IDO can distribute to the appropriate UDM for fill
      action. After all the requirements are received and reviewed, they will be made available
      to the tasked units via the LOGMOD UDM module. The unit is then responsible for
      assigning a name for each requirement on the DRMD NLT the time listed on the DSOE.
   5.4.2. Before an individual can be deployed, they must meet the training and deployment
   eligibility requirements according to this instruction, AFI 36-2110, and the UTC MISCAP
   statement (also see Attachment 4 for typical process flowcharts). The MilPDS has a series
   of business rules identifying to unit commanders questionable deployment eligibility called
   Deployment Availability (DAV) codes. Along with DAV codes, some duty status codes
   place a person into a questionable deployment availability status. Attachment 2 of this
   instruction explains all duty status and DAV codes affecting the deployment process.
      5.4.2.1. The IDRC and PDF advise commanders when personnel are ineligible for
      deployment according to the governing directives. They also ensure documentation is
128                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      correct on personnel with waiverable DAV and duty status codes. NOTE: The ultimate
      responsibility for deployment eligibility rests with the unit commander. The use of IDS
      helps commanders in the unit deployment selection process by automating eligibility and
      waiver status of personnel.
         5.4.2.1.1. Units and IDRC/PDF work with a Personnel file that is a snapshot in time
         of MilPDS so some DAV/duty status codes may no longer apply. In these instances,
         close coordination between the unit and PRF/PDF must occur to ensure data systems
         reflect the proper status.
  5.4.3. Immediately upon receipt of the tasking, the UDM will notify the unit commander and
  accomplish the following:
      5.4.3.1. If the tasking is assigned against a standard UTC in the UTC Availability
      (formerly AFWUS), the UDM will assign a name as previously postured by the flight
      chief(s) and commander (provided all line/command remarks can be met). Commander
      and flight(s) chief will be notified of specific Airmen tasked.
      5.4.3.2. If the tasking is a non-standard UTC, the UDM will solicit names from the
      section/flight chief(s) and submit the name(s) for commander approval. Line and
      command remarks still must be met. UDMs will consult Personnel Readiness Folders and
      other data sources (reference paragraph 1.6.3) to ensure selected personnel meet all
      requirements (reference paragraph 1.6.2).
         5.4.3.2.1. UDMs may recommend selected personnel to fill taskings who have not
         completed all the necessary requirements if these requirements can be accomplished
         prior to deployment.
      5.4.3.3. If the unit has to shortfall any positions, the IDRC/IDO will look for alternates in
      Associate UTCs or un-tasked Standard UTCs. If an alternate UTC exists, submit
      recommendation to the wing commander. If no suitable airman/civilian is available, the
      UDM will process the shortfall IAW the reclama process in AFI 10-401.
         5.4.3.3.1. Even though units assess a UTC as ―Green‖ in ART, line remarks may
         require capability beyond the unit’s capacity to fill either due to non-availability of
         assets with specific line remarks or due to other competing requirements. Prior to
         submitting a reclama, the tasked commander will request from the deployed group
         commander to waive the requirement that precludes the unit from filling the tasking
         (e.g., line remarks, SEI, grade, skill level, etc.) or permit substitutions, if applicable
         (see paragraphs 5.4.4 and 5.4.5 regarding substitutions). This is done through the
         local PRF/IDRC to the deployed PERSCO. If the deployed group commander denies
         the waiver request, the tasked commander will either fill the requirement as requested
         or submit a shortfall/reclama request through the wing commander (or equivalent) to
         the MAJCOM IAW AFI 10-401 procedures. This written submission (message, e-
         mail, fax, etc.) will include PID, ULN, line number, UTC, line remarks(s), RDD/DRI,
         AFSC, and specific justification for each shortfall/reclama position or billet. The
         tasked commander must keep the MAJCOM FAMs informed of all waiver requests,
         to include the final decision of the deployed commander.
             5.4.3.3.1.1. (Added-AMC) If no answer to the waiver request is received the
             unit must submit a shortfall IAW the processes described in para 3.18 and the
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               129


            timelines depicted in the Shortfall Submission Timeline Table.
     5.4.3.4. The UDM will post the selected deploying individual(s) info (name and SSN)
     into LOGMOD and provide to the IDRC/DCC for tasking fill. Unit/UDM must provide
     names to fill tasking, or shortfall the tasking to the IDRC/IDO within 3 duty days from
     receipt for taskings 30-120 days out from earliest movement date. For taskings less than
     30 days from earliest movement date, units must provide names or shortfall the tasking
     with in 24-hours. During crisis action planning, these times may be constricted further, as
     directed by the IDO. The IDRC PRF representative will immediately update DCAPES to
     show name fill and projected departure data. This updates supports providing all echelons
     advance notification of projected arrivals and the expected delivery date.
        5.4.3.4.1. (Added-AMC) Per AFI 36-3802 the name is required in DCAPES NLT
        base acceptance of the tasking as indicated by ―BX‖ code + 15 days or ―S‖ code + 15
        days whichever is earlier; for taskings received within 30 days of first movement the
        name is due within 24hours.
     5.4.3.5. The unit commander/UDM will ensure in-person (i.e. face-to-face or phone)
     notification of tasking to Airmen within 4 duty days of tasking receipt by
     UDM/Commander. The notification may be done by the commander, UDM, or a
     supervisor.
     5.4.3.6. Within 5 duty days of notification of tasking, the member will report to the
     UDM with ID Card for a comprehensive review of the entire personnel readiness folder.
     The UDM will notify the member of any scheduled training/appointments required for
     the tasking, review reporting instructions with the member, ensure Foreign Clearance
     Guide requirements are met or initiated and identify any adverse medical conditions that
     may prevent the member from deploying.
     5.4.3.7. Not earlier than (NET) 30 days prior to PDF processing, or as directed by the
     Commander, the UDM will initiate a final review of readiness status with the member. At
     this time, the UDM will again review the AOR-specific reporting instructions, Foreign
     Clearance Guide and medical readiness requirements (such as additional vaccinations)
     with the member.
     5.4.3.8. If known, the UDM will inform the Airman of reporting times as reflected in the
     DSOE or TPFDD.
        5.4.3.8.1. UDM will schedule individuals for individual equipment and weapons
        requirements pickup through the War Readiness Element of the LRS or provide times
        they may do so on their own.
     5.4.3.9. The UDM will direct the Airman to Force Health Management at the Medical
     Treatment Facility (MTF) NET 30 days prior to deployment for the purpose of
     completing the DD Form 2795 and all other predeployment medical requirements.
     5.4.3.10. The Airman will complete all deployment and unit requirements per the
     guidelines given by the UDM, except those scheduled to be accomplished at the PDF, if a
     processing line is scheduled.
130                                                   AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      5.4.3.11. Ten duty days prior to processing at the PDF, the squadron commander will
      ensure all required actions are complete, with the exception of those being accomplished
      at the PDF.
  5.4.4. AFSC Substitution. The UTC MISCAP statement outlines the capability of the tasked
  UTC and identifies authorized AFSC substitutions unit commanders may use. The UTC
  MISCAP, functional AFIs, USAF WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or the Supported Command
  processing guidance/reporting instructions regulate and control authorized substitutions.
  When substituting AFSCs that fall outside the scope of the above, the unit commander must
  coordinate the substitution with the deployed group commander ensuring the substitution
  continues to satisfy the original tasking requirement without mission degradation and the
  designated person can meet the functional requirements of the originally tasked AFSC. The
  unit must coordinate all AFSC substitutions with the IDRC/PDF.
  5.4.5. Grade and Skill Level Substitution. Like AFSC substitutions, the UTC MISCAP,
  functional AFIs, USAF WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or the Supported Command processing
  guidance/reporting instructions regulate and control authorized grade and skill level
  substitutions.
      5.4.5.1. When units identify people to fill deployment requirements, enlisted are tasked
      based upon their Control AFSC (CAFSC) and officers are tasked based upon their Duty
      AFSC (DAFSC) or, for Individual Augmentees (IAs), on any of their qualified AFSCs.
      5.4.5.2. When selecting personnel, the unit maximizes the matching of the required
      AFSC and grade to the person’s AFSC and grade as much as possible. Grade and skill
      level substitutions will only occur when all available resources have been exhausted and
      the tasking authority allows them. Deviations may be made per the tasking’s line
      remarks.
         5.4.5.2.1. Enlisted Skill Level Substitutions. Unless prohibited by line remarks or
         UTC MISCAP, personnel with two skill levels higher or one skill level lower may
         satisfy enlisted requirements. EXCEPTION: Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM)
         requirements must be filled by a CEM/E-9 resource. EXAMPLES: A person having a
         3-, 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level may satisfy 5-skill level tasking requirements. A person
         having a 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level may satisfy 7-skill level tasking requirements.
         5.4.5.2.2. Enlisted Grade Substitutions. Unless prohibited by line remarks or UTC
         MISCAP, if the UTC or tasking identifies a required grade, the person must have that
         grade or higher grade to fill the requirement. EXAMPLE: A person with or in a
         higher grade than E-7 may satisfy an E-7 tasking requirement.
         5.4.5.2.3. Officer Grade Substitutions. Unless prohibited by the supported AFCHQ
         through line remarks or UTC MISCAP, officer grade requirements may be filled by a
         person having one grade higher or lower than the required grade.
             5.4.5.2.3.1. Second and first lieutenants are considered a single grade and can
             substitute in a captain grade requirement, provided they meet the intent of
             paragraph 5.4.5.2.
             5.4.5.2.3.2. EXCEPTIONS: Unless prohibited by the supported AFCHQ through
             line remarks or UTC MISCAP, a tasked medical commander may substitute two
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               131


              grades up and two grades down for officers. Additionally, clinical personnel who
              are colonels may be tasked to fill non-colonel requirements. However, for all
              other Air Force specialties, a colonel must fill a colonel grade requirement.
              5.4.5.2.3.3. EXAMPLES: A captain, major, or lieutenant colonel may satisfy a
              major grade tasking. A lieutenant (1st or 2nd), captain, or major may satisfy a
              captain tasking.
   5.4.6. Volunteer Guidance. AFI 10-401, Chapter 9, describes how active Air Force
   personnel (military and civilian) can volunteer for AEF ECS contingency taskings. All
   volunteers, including ANG and AFRC, must coordinate their intent to volunteer with the unit
   commander to ensure their volunteer status will not adversely impact the owning unit’s
   ability to meet its wartime mission.
5.5. Personnel Processing.
   5.5.1. Port Calls. The IDO will review the TPFDD for mode/source of transportation for
   deploying Airmen/units. If the mode/source (i.e., ―AC‖) directs AMC contract airlift from
   AMC gateways, the IDRC will forward the assigned names with ULN and requested dates to
   the TMF representative. The TMF representative will book the port calls based on the ALD
   provided by the IDO/Logistics Plans function. ULNs with mode/source for strategic lift (i.e.,
   ―AK‖) either out of home station or at an aggregate APOE are not given port calls, but will
   be manifested during passenger processing activities. For large groups, the IDO should
   consider the GOPAX method to move individuals. For large groups within driving distances,
   the IDRC should consider busing to the APOE either by commercial bus or military bus. If
   none of these options seem feasible, the IDRC will direct the TMF arrange commercial
   airline travel to the APOE only. There are no bookings in GATES for sending passengers to
   the aggregation point. All movement is projected in the TPFDD. If it becomes necessary that
   a deploying member is not able to deploy on the projected airlift, according to the TPFDD, it
   is imperative that the IDO notifies the respective MAJCOM FAM as soon as possible in
   order to coordinate changes to the TPFDD so that appropriate transportation changes can be
   made.
   5.5.1. (AMC) AMC IDOs will contact AMC/A4RX when identifying/resolving TPFDD
   transportation issues. A4RX functions as the command POC for these issues for all AMC
   wings.
      5.5.1.1. Port calls based solely on RDD/DRI may cause deploying Airmen to miss in-
      theater training/processing. Some ULNs in support of ILO requirements require
      personnel to be in theater earlier that RDD/DRI for Joint Reception, Staging, Onward
      Movement, and Integration (JRSOI)/Replacement In-place Transfer of Authority
      (RIPTOA). Port call planning for these ILO requirements must be based of off LADs in
      order to be able to meet CCDR required JRSOI/RIPTOA. The IDRC will identify all en
      route reporting requirements to the TMF representative who will book the appropriate
      port calls.
   5.5.2. Unit Personnel Assembly. After personnel are identified for deployment, they may be
   processed in mass or individually. Every effort should be made to mass process personnel to
   ensure a last check of all requirements is made to enable personnel to deploy with fewer
   discrepancies. Even if personnel are processed individually, some level of mass processing
132                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  should be incorporated, if possible. That may include eligibility check; pre-deployment
  briefings (e.g., medical, cultural, anti-terrorism, human slave trading, anti-hijacking, etc.);
  last chance medical/immunizations check; and issuing orders, airline tickets (if applicable),
  mobility bags, and weapons/ammo (if applicable). If airlift will pick Airmen up at home
  station, they will always mass at least 3 hours prior to aircraft departure for manifesting and
  anti-hijack processing. Local installations may institute longer lead times to meet their
  specific needs and spell this out in their IDP.
      5.5.2.1. When mass processing, deploying Airmen will be assembled in a pre-identified
      area at the unit NLT the time indicated on the DSOE for unit processing. If processing
      individually, the UDM will determine the assembly time. Regardless if mass or
      individually processing, the unit will always pre-assemble personnel prior to departure.
         5.5.2.1.1. During unit assembly all deploying personnel will be checked to ensure the
         following:
             5.5.2.1.1.1. They meet personnel deployment requirements outlined in the tasking
             order.
             5.5.2.1.1.2. They are eligible (DAV and duty status codes) to deploy.
             5.5.2.1.1.3. They have all personal items in order.
      5.5.2.2. Units will identify potential eligibility problems allowing the DCC and PDF
      maximum time to find qualified personnel from existing base resources.
  5.5.3. Deliver      Personnel       to     PDF.       Document        personnel      movement
  requirements/responsibilities in the local IDP. If required, the unit contacts LRS Vehicle
  Management to schedule/request transportation to get personnel to the processing area. Early
  contact will help ensure all individuals are delivered to the processing area in sufficient time
  to meet DSOE processing time.
      5.5.3.1. In no case should deploying personnel arrive at the PDF on their own. They will
      always be delivered through coordination by a UDM (albeit through the LRS Vehicle
      Management flight, if needed). In those instances where deploying Airmen are utilizing
      commercial transportation through a local airport, the unit should deliver the Airmen to
      the airport to ensure they have everything mentioned in paragraph 5.5.2.1.1.
  5.5.4. Unit Move PDF Processing. The key responsibilities of the PDF are: Advising
  commanders when personnel are ineligible for deployment; maintaining accountability of
  deploying personnel from arrival at PDF to base departure; and providing last-minute
  services (e.g., legal, chaplain, medical, personnel actions, etc.) to Airmen (as requested or
  required).
      5.5.4.1. From the time unit personnel are delivered to the PDF until they are physically
      loaded on the aircraft (or other embarkation movement source), the PDF is responsible
      for full control and accountability of them. A controlled area will be identified to hold all
      deploying personnel.
         5.5.4.1.1. Personnel representative in the PDF will conduct a roll call to see if all of
         the correct individuals are present for processing.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                133


     5.5.4.2. The final eligibility check of the PDF process is vitally important. A deployed
     commander does not want anyone unqualified or incapable of performing the deployed
     mission. The initial responsibility in the eligibility review process belongs to the unit
     commander. They know their people and should send only qualified, eligible personnel to
     process and deploy. However, sometimes in the heat of a deployment, things may be
     overlooked. The PDF serves as the wing’s last set of eyes ensuring all personnel meet the
     eligibility requirements to deploy and is responsible for informing the unit commander of
     any personnel in a questionable deployment eligibility status.
     5.5.4.3. CED orders are the only type of TDY orders used to deploy personnel. AFI 10-
     215 directs all members deploying on contingencies, exercises, or deployments to receive
     CED orders. As stated earlier, the DCAPES is used to produce these orders. An
     individual from the PRF will be assigned to the orders section during deployment
     processing. AFI 10-215 provides specific guidance on producing CED orders.
     5.5.4.4. CED orders will be produced according to the timelines specified in the DSOE
     and in sufficient time to be included in the Troop Commander Package for each chalk or
     at least one duty day prior to personnel departing from commercial airports. Ensure the
     tasked ULN (to include any frag and insert) and ULN position are included on the orders.
         5.5.4.4.1. Unclassified orders will be used unless driven by specific plan, message, or
         directive. Changes, amendments, or new orders, as required, are published and issued
         before, during, and after the deployment. NOTE: No CED orders will be issued until
         the IDO or designated representative ensures the unit(s)/person(s) is/are deploying by
         mode and source IAW the OPLAN/CONPLAN TPFDD or equivalent supporting and
         supported command guidance. Distribution of orders will be IAW AFI 10-215 and
         local procedures. CMOS or GATES (for CONUS AMC strategic Aerial Ports and
         overseas AMS units) will generate the passenger manifest based on the orders and
         files received from DCAPES for departure on airlift from home station. LSA can also
         produce a passenger manifest as a back up to CMOS and GATES, if required. TMF
         or Passenger Processing personnel will manifest and collect NoK information IAW
         DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part I – Passenger Movement. If the orders cannot be
         completed, a manual passenger manifest will be completed prior to the departure of
         the aircraft. Ample notification of any late orders will be given to the manifesting
         agency. Manual manifests will be followed up with electronic manifests to maintain
         ITV.
     5.5.4.5. DCAPES is essential to inform already deployed commanders, MAJCOM, and
     the Air Staff of the deploying force composition. Appropriate accountability actions in
     DCAPES (when fielded) will be accomplished by the PRF for systemized personnel
     strength accountability.
     5.5.4.6. Air transportation specialists will handle the passenger processing function after
     passenger processing is complete. Personnel may be released to the troop commander,
     after coordination with the IDO, if there is an extended delay in aircraft departure. The
     troop commander must be readily available to ensure no further delays. Upon deploying
     personnel return, they must be re-screened for accountability, anti-hijacking, etc.
  5.5.5. Individual Personnel Processing. Special circumstances (such as resource availability,
  etc.) may not warrant standing up a full processing line or one at all. If the IDO deems a full
134                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  PDF line is not required, every effort should be made to incorporate some functions of the
  normal line in the processing of personnel, and the rest accomplished by the unit and Airman
  through deployment checklists. When the full services of a PDF line are not available,
  deploying personnel must be provided a deployment checklist that ensures they receive the
  same processing and services afforded in the formal PDF line. Personnel processing via
  checklist should be afforded minimal PDF line services within 10 days of departure to
  receive briefings, pick up mobility bags and airline tickets, and receive a last check to ensure
  they have accomplished all the required processing tasks. Provided levy flow/tasking is
  received, Reserve personnel should complete all out-processing actions during the UTA
  (Unit Training Assembly) prior to their scheduled departure.
      5.5.5.1. Airmen are provided a checklist by the IDRC to out-process for deployment.
      This checklist should include all necessary actions to be accomplished prior to
      deployment that will not be accomplished by a PDF line. This checklist may be tailored
      to account for limited timeframes and TDY location(s) requirements.
         5.5.5.1.1. Checklist items should include training requirements as stated in paragraph
         1.6.2 and other actions such as medical/dental/immunization clearance certification,
         pre-deployment health assessment, A&FRC briefings, anti-terrorism/force protection
         briefings, education office reviews, IDRC/PRF (for orders), Finance, MPF, etc., as
         necessary and stipulated in local IDP.
      5.5.5.2. Deploying Airmen will ensure they receive CED orders from their PRF prior to
      departing home station. Distribution of orders will be IAW AFI 10-215 and local
      procedures.
      5.5.5.3. Final Check. The final check by the UDM/Commander of the Airman is vitally
      important. A deployed commander does not want anyone unqualified or incapable of
      performing the deployed mission. The initial responsibility in the eligibility review
      process belongs to the unit commander. They know their people and should send only
      qualified, eligible personnel to process and deploy.
         5.5.5.3.1. After Airmen have completed all checklist items required for deployment,
         they will be scheduled by the UDM to meet at a pre-identified area at the unit for unit
         processing. The UDM will determine the assembly time.
             5.5.5.3.1.1. During unit assembly all deploying personnel will be checked to
             ensure the following are in compliance:
                 5.5.5.3.1.1.1. They meet personnel deployment requirements outlined in the
                 tasking order.
                 5.5.5.3.1.1.2. They are eligible (DAV and duty status codes) to deploy.
                 5.5.5.3.1.1.3. They have all personal items in order.
                 5.5.5.3.1.1.4. They have accomplished all required training and deployment
                 preparation requirements.
      5.5.5.4. Deliver Personnel. When deploying Airmen are utilizing commercial
      transportation through the local airport, the unit will deliver the Airmen to the airport or
      arrange transportation to the airport to ensure they meet their scheduled lift. In either
      circumstance, deploying Airmen will be met by UDM or designated unit representative
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                   135


      after the Airman leaves his/her residence and prior to arriving at the airport. AFRC units
      will meet this requirement when practical. If Airmen are not accompanied to the airport,
      the unit will ensure the Airmen have a contact number to reach the unit in case of
      emergency or deviation from the planned deployment (e.g., personnel, equipment, or
      bags don't get on arranged transportation). If Airmen are scheduled to meet a commercial
      rotator chartered by AMC at an APOE different from their home station, the unit will,
      through the IDRC and the TMF, ensure appropriate transportation is scheduled/provided
      for the Airman to meet the required show-time of the mission. Units will also provide the
      troop commander a diskette with deploying passenger data for the aggregation point or
      APOE for input into CMOS or GATES, at CONUS AMC Strategic Aerial ports, for
      manifest preparation, (Reference AFI 24-238, paragraph 1.12.4.).
      5.5.5.5. Once Airmen have departed their home installation, UDMs will ensure that the
      local IDRC has updated status on the departure of the Airmen. They will contact the
      IDRC to inform them of departure time and means of departure.
      5.5.5.6. IDRC PRF representative will update DCAPES to show departure status of
      deployed member. This is essential to establish/maintain the foundation of systemized
      personnel strength accountability and supports the analysis of force closure timeliness
      data.
   5.5.6. Passenger Manifesting. Passenger manifests will be prepared for each chalk to ensure
   in-transit visibility from point of origin to final destination. The individuals assigned to this
   function will be extremely knowledgeable of the requirements of DOD 4500.9-R, DTR Part
   I.
      5.5.6.1. Either CMOS or GATES, for CONUS AMC strategic Aerial Port units, will be
      used to generate a manifest. If CMOS or GATES are not available to produce the
      passenger manifest, a DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, is used. Fax or email DD
      Form 2131 to AMC/ITV cell (ITV.AMC.TEAM@scott.af.mil) for ITV purposes.
      Required information will be exported to CMOS or GATES from DCAPES with fielding
      of version 4.0.2.0. CMOS or GATES will feed personnel manifests to GTN to provide in-
      transit visibility.
      5.5.6.2. Manifesting passengers during AEF rotations will require chalking of passengers
      to meet the scheduled aircraft mission versus final destination. Airmen may be deploying
      to multiple destinations, but are required to arrive in theater on the same LAD through the
      same POD. In order to meet the CCDRs RDD and maximize aircraft utilization, TACC
      may schedule/aggregate Airmen from multiple origins on a single mission. The IDO or
      IDRC must ensure Airmen are chalked and exported via the DCAPES export file titled
      ―CMOSxxx.file‖ that can be imported into CMOS and GATES. This is provided to the
      APOE 72 hours prior to mission departure. Updates will be transmitted via e-mail as
      required with a summary of changes and a new/updated ―CMOSxxx.file‖ attached.
5.6. Developing a Minimum Personnel Requirements List.
   5.6.1. Develop a minimum personnel requirements list within the unit for personnel assigned
   to a UTC. The supported commander determines any changes in theater clearance
   requirements and, along with HAF FAMs for ILO taskings, identifies all additional items
   deploying personnel must take. The supported commander, at execution, determines whether
136                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  personnel need mobility bags, weapons, ammunition, insect vector control measures, and
  chemical injectors. Mobility bag, ammunition, and small arms management for active duty
  units will be IAW AFMAN 23-110 and AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
  Management. ANG and AFRC units will follow the guidance of their higher headquarters.
  5.6.2. Acceptability and Limitations of Personal Baggage, Mobility Bags (MOBAG)/IPE,
  and Professional Gear (PROGEAR). For purposes of this instruction, the term ―bag‖ or
  ―baggage‖ refers to any soft- or hard-sided container with carrying handle(s) containing
  items necessary for personal/duty use for the duration of the deployment.
      5.6.2.1. Personal clothing will be deployed as baggage on the same aircraft transporting
      personnel. Personal clothing should be packed in duffel bags, barracks bags, B-4 type
      bags, or commercial luggage with rounded corners. Wheeled containers, footlockers, or
      trunks may also be used for personal baggage, MOBAGs/IPE, and PROGEAR as long as
      they meet the linear and weight requirements described in paragraph 5.6.2.7 and have
      rounded corners to prevent damage to other bags and their contents. Excess baggage must
      be authorized on orders.
      5.6.2.2. AOR Reporting Instructions published by the Supported Commander may limit
      the total number of bags authorized, particularly excess baggage, based upon lift
      availability to, and bed down capabilities at, the ultimate deployed location. Additionally,
      depending upon the mode of transport (e.g., commercial air segments between
      commercial airports or AMC contract airlift from AMC gateways) selected from origin to
      destination, IDOs, TMFs, and deploying units must be aware that commercial airlines
      may further restrict weight, size, and type specifications applicable to checked baggage.
      IDOs must thoroughly review AOR Reporting Instructions and consult with the
      installation TMF to verify whether such limitations or additional instructions (i.e. special
      baggage tag requirements), may impact deployment plans or execution.
         5.6.2.2.1. CCDRs may provide pre-deployed weapons, ammunition, and mobility
         bags at centrally managed and distributed locations within their AOR at ETDCs. This
         may eliminate the need for Airmen to deploy with these assets.
      5.6.2.3. When allowed by the Supported Commander and required by the deploying unit,
      excess baggage authorization must be specified in the individual’s CED orders, and must
      not exceed the size, weight, quantity, or content limitations.
      5.6.2.4. It is ultimately the unit commander’s responsibility to ensure unit personnel
      deploy with all required personal items, MOBAGs/IPE, and PROGEAR, and to ensure
      that all other non-individual issue equipment required for the major operation or
      campaign is properly identified in equipment UTCs. At no time, will equipment items
      normally shipped as freight, or deployed as cargo; be allowed to accompany a deploying
      individual as part of his or her excess baggage authorization, unless specifically stated in
      CED orders. Unit commanders must pay particular attention to this point to preclude
      baggage being ―bumped‖ en route due to transport mode weight or space limitations.
      NOTE: Aircraft ACL limitations may be particularly evident on AMC contract carrier
      contingency and rotator missions; therefore, excess baggage scrutiny at home station is
      prudent if deploying personnel will travel via this means.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              137


     5.6.2.5. Deploying members must not add any personal or unauthorized items to their A,
     B, C, or D-bags. Even if the bag weight remains in limits, the extra items add bulk and
     can cause aircraft cargo holds to become ―cubed-out,‖ resulting in a waste of airlift
     capacity.
     5.6.2.6. In some cases, deploying units require tools or equipment that are too
     large/heavy for movement on commercial passenger aircraft, and not currently listed in a
     UTC’s MISCAP. In each case, the deploying unit is required to arrange shipment of the
     required equipment separate from the deploying unit, and at unit expense. Either a
     complete MISCAP review needs to be accomplished, or procedures for the referenced
     scenario need to be identified to ensure the cargo movement is accomplished as part of
     the supported operation, tracked in an ITV system, and billed to the supported operation’s
     funds.
     5.6.2.7. Deploying personnel transiting commercial airports or AMC gateways on
     contract commercial aircraft may hand-carry one bag and check no more than two pieces
     of personal baggage without charge. In all cases, unless further restricted by individual
     commercial airlines, each checked bag may weigh no more than 70 lbs and cannot exceed
     62 linear inches (NOTE: Commercial tickets that contain only CONUS segments may
     limit checked baggage to 50 lbs each before excess baggage charges are assessed). Carry-
     on baggage cannot exceed 45 linear inches. Any bag that exceeds these weight,
     dimension, or quantity limitations will be regarded as excess baggage. Any single bag
     exceeding the 70 lb weight limit will count as two pieces. No bag exceeding 100 pounds
     will be accepted. MOBAGs (A, B, C, and D)/IPE and PROGEAR are common,
     acceptable examples of excess baggage.
     5.6.2.8. There is no standard policy between DOD and the Transportation Security
     Administration (TSA) for military shipments of weapons in checked baggage or as excess
     baggage. Ammunition and weapons are not permitted in carry-on baggage but, depending
     on the policy of the airline, may be included with checked baggage. Weapons must be
     unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and declared at check-in. All airline and
     TSA requirements must be strictly adhered to. All transportation offices should
     distinguish excess baggage contents as weapons when making airline reservations and
     ensure coordination with the airlines and TSA for handling and packaging instructions. It
     is suggested that advanced copies of the weapon declaration forms be completed in
     advance to streamline check-in. Commercial travel offices should provide proper
     passenger counseling, to include familiarization with rules and requirements of the
     scheduled service airlines and TSA.
5.7. Troop Commander.
  5.7.1. After processing of personnel is complete, the IDRC/PDF will provide the troop
  commander with a Troop Commander’s PAK. The troop commander is generally the senior
  ranking person (may not apply to certain Medical, JAG, Chaplain, etc. personnel) assigned to
  a group of two or more personnel that are deploying on the same means of transportation to
  the same deployed location.
     5.7.1.1. The troop commander must account for and control the deploying force from the
     time after processing through the PDF until arrival at the final deployed location. If
     personnel are traveling via commercial transportation and do not process through the
 138                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       PDF, a troop commander will still be appointed for a group of personnel traveling
       together to maintain accountability for personnel throughout the trip. In that case, the
       troop commander will be briefed on responsibilities by the PDF (see also DOD 4500.9-R,
       DTR Part III, Appendix T).
       5.7.1.2. The troop commander will confirm transportation allocation and mode/source of
       transportation before departing.
       5.7.1.3. The Troop Commander will be provided a Troop Commander’s Personnel
       Accountability Kit (PAK) from the IDRC/PDF containing:
           5.7.1.3.1. Incoming Aircraft Commanders package.
           5.7.1.3.2. CED Orders with Social Security Account Numbers (SSANs) of deploying
           personnel.
           5.7.1.3.3. IDS LOGPLAN and execution file data disk produced from LOGMOD.
           5.7.1.3.4. AALPS data file, if necessary.
           5.7.1.3.5. Passenger manifests.
           5.7.1.3.6. Shippers Declarations of hazardous goods if hazardous cargo on board.
           5.7.1.3.7. Cargo Load and Packing lists, if cargo on board.
           5.7.1.3.8. AF Form 245s, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist, for each
           deploying member.
           5.7.1.3.9. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, for any accompanying
           cargo.
           5.7.1.3.10. Aircraft Load Plans (for cargo aircraft).
           5.7.1.3.11. Information on how to lodge/feed troops in the event of diversion to
           unforeseen location prior to final destination.
       5.7.1.4. The PDF will brief the troop commander to turn this information over to the
       reception team, Logistics Readiness Center (LRC), or the PERSCO team upon arrival at
       the deployed location to track personnel accountability and to support redeployment
       planning.
5.8. Deployment of Ineligible Personnel.
   5.8.1. Personnel found to be unqualified or who do not meet the specifications identified in
   the tasking by the deployed commander will be returned to home station at the expense of the
   assigned unit.
5.9. (Added-AMC) Passport Requirements. NOTE: Passports for military personnel are not
normally required for contingency deployments. DD Form 2AF, or CAC, and valid CED orders
are normally sufficient for military operations. When passports are required due to line remarks,
reporting instruction or Foreign Clearance Guide, the MPF will verify with the AOR and
appropriate passport guidance. Passports are not contingency or wartime critical items, but a
peacetime requirement. However, civilians may require a passport and visa. MAJCOM FAMs
will identify those personnel requiring passports for use during peacetime deployments and in
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                      139


support of United Nations’ missions. Your local MPF/FSS can provide additional passport
assistance.

                                          Chapter 6

                                  RECEPTION PROCESS

6.1. The Reception Process.
   6.1.1. Reception is the first part of the overall joint concept of Reception, Staging, Onward
   Movement, and Integration (RSO&I). The Reception process is designed to integrate
   incoming units into a mission/combat capable force as soon as possible with the flexibility to
   stage and move units forward. It involves off-loading, documenting, accounting for, and
   bedding down inbound equipment and personnel. Reference AFI 10-404, Base Support and
   Expeditionary Site Planning, and MAJCOM guidance for specific planning processes,
   timing, decision support tools, bed down reception processes, and team composition.
   Additionally, see Joint Publication 4-01.8, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
   Reception, Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration.
   6.1.2. Within the AETF Force Modules, the ―Open the Base,‖ ―C2,‖ and ―Establish the
   Base‖ modules are primarily responsible for the efficient and effective reception of personnel
   and equipment and completing the ITV to provide the supported CCDR verification of force
   closure. For the purposes of this guidance, the reception process, if accomplished correctly,
   enables an efficient and effective redeployment process. The redeployment process supports
   both the forward deployment of personnel and the return of personnel to home station.
6.2. Employment and Reception Planning.
   6.2.1. The key to reception planning starts with the Supported Command. The Supported
   Command must develop a program to accomplish IGESPs for those installations in its AOR
   that are intended to be bed down locations with or without a major Air Force presence. The
   Supported and Supporting MAJCOMs OPRs for In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Planning
   establish criteria defining the degree to which bases will develop their IGESPs IAW AFI 10-
   404.
6.3. Command & Control.
   6.3.1. If opening a base, the ranking member of the deployed Contingency Response Group
   (CRG) is the acting commander, and responsible for the initial command & control of
   incoming forces until the arrival of the EMSG/CC. The aim is to properly manage the
   reception process and provide an orderly transition from base opening to the establishment of
   the end state organization.
       6.3.1.1. When receiving forces at established Air Force locations, the CRG may still
       deploy to support the initial arrival of resources. However, the established C2 function
       will retain responsibility for command and control of incoming and employed forces.
   6.3.2. Commander, Expeditionary Mission Support Group (EMSG/CC). The EMSG/CC (or
   acting EMSG/CC) is responsible for establishing the base and overall reception of forces.
   Upon establishment of the base, the EMSG/CC turns the reins of the employment mission
   and the Expeditionary Operations Center (EOC) over to the installation commander but
   continues to control the LRC, contingency response center, survival recovery center, disaster
   control center, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (PRIME BEEF), and Prime Readiness
   in Base Services (PRIME RIBS) units. These duties require oversight and control over fuels,
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                141


  supply, transportation, communications, civil engineering, personnel, services, security/base
  defense functions, and others. In addition, the EMSG/CC directs the actions of the Reception
  Control Center.
  6.3.3. Log C2 Team. The Log C2 Team role is to provide overall control and coordination of
  reception, bed down, onward movement, and redeployment. It manages WRM and
  coordinates inter-Service, international, and wartime HNS. Additionally, the chief is the focal
  point for redeployment actions.
     6.3.3.1. The Log C2 Team reports to the EMSG/CC (may be through the LRC or other
     established center within the EOC).
     6.3.3.2. The Log C2 Team is made up of Logistics Planners and LROs and any
     associated required equipment per applicable UTCs.
  6.3.4. Reception Control Center (RCC). The RCC provides overall direction and
  coordination of reception and bed down procedures and resolves any problems affecting
  reception of resources. It oversees two functions, the Reception Processing Unit (RPU) and
  the Cargo Reception Function (CRF).
     6.3.4.1. The RCC, if not at an established Air Force operating location, is created with
     the arrival of the ―C2‖ force module. Until their arrival, the CRG is responsible for
     accountability and onward movement of arriving forces. At established Air Force
     locations, the RCC is established IAW AFI 10-404 and the IGESP.
         6.3.4.1.1. When a CRG or aerial port is operating at the employment site, the RCC
         representative contacts the appropriate agent to ensure all incoming resources are
         accounted for and customs cleared before moving them to the reception area (see also
         AFI 10-404).
     6.3.4.2. The RCC may report to the LRC or like function within the EOC, but should not
     be subsumed by that function. The variety of tasks required to secure the base, build and
     maintain living and operating facilities, provide aircraft fire and rescue support, respond
     to emergencies, care for and feed the population, refuel and resupply aircraft, and bed
     down transient forces would not allow for the focus and concentration required to ensure
     forces are identified, met, accounted for, and integrated.
     6.3.4.3. At many locations, the RCC operates in a dual role with the DCC, as bases often
     deploy and receive forces simultaneously.
     6.3.4.4. The RCC will ensure all personnel are put in contact with their unit of
     assignment or duty sections.
     6.3.4.5. The RCC will monitor the inbound force airlift and the actual arrival times of
     personnel and cargo. See AFI 10-404, Attachment 7, for more on reception processes.
     6.3.4.6. At a minimum, the reception control center will ensure:
         6.3.4.6.1. They can track incoming units and airlift.
         6.3.4.6.2. The Aerial Port or CRG, if operating at the deployed locations, received
         incoming equipment data in GATES.
             6.3.4.6.2.1. If it is the final destination, the manifest shows equipment was
142                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


             trucked to the CRF.
             6.3.4.6.2.2. If it is not the final destination, the CRF manifests it in CMOS to the
             next or final destination.
         6.3.4.6.3. Equipment received is placed in a secure holding area until the owning
         units arrive for pickup.
         6.3.4.6.4. The Supply function in the Expeditionary LRS accounts for deployed
         equipment.
         6.3.4.6.5. Arriving personnel are accounted for by PERSCO personnel and briefed
         regarding their mission, work area, local conditions, and command structure.
         6.3.4.6.6. Arriving personnel are assigned lodging.
         6.3.4.6.7. Assigned personnel are met by their work center (if work center is already
         established).
      6.3.4.7. Deployment discrepancies are noted and loaded on the AEFC’s on-line
      deployment discrepancy database. NOTE: The PERSCO team usually operates the RPU
      and will enter these discrepancies. The RCC will have a representative from each
      deployed functional area ensuring integration of all efforts supporting base-level wartime
      support. The RCC oversees the RPU and ensures deployment discrepancies are validated
      and updated in DPDRT by the appropriate functional agency. PERSCO teams will assist
      the RCC in updating discrepancies for deployed units. Each functional agency will
      provide required equipment, forms, handouts, and checklists necessary to receive
      incoming resources. A copy of the checklists will be provided to the RCC.
      6.3.4.8. The senior AF LRO (e.g., LRS/CC) at the deployed location and the RCC will
      work together to ensure all problems are resolved at the lowest level.
      6.3.4.9. The Aerial Port command and control function at the deployed location will
      report the number of incoming passengers and cargo information to the RCC and
      coordinate support airlift servicing requirements with appropriate agencies.
      6.3.4.10. If reception and deployment occur at a location simultaneously, the senior LRO
      (e.g., LRS/CC) will ensure the proper coordination with all agencies is performed to
      ensure effective utilization of available resources.
      6.3.4.11. Units at the employment location will provide a representative to brief duty
      schedules, chain of command, supervisors, duty locations, and important phone numbers.
      6.3.4.12. Employed location units will provide the following briefings or information:
         6.3.4.12.1. Unit responsible for the Force Protection enterprise at the deployed
         location will provide force protection posture and conditions (FPCON).
         6.3.4.12.2. Mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) levels.
         6.3.4.12.3. Applicable SOFA, MOPP, and FPCON cards.
         6.3.4.12.4. Legal (or command) representative will brief Rules of Engagement
         (ROE) as published by the combatant commander.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               143


         6.3.4.12.5. Public Affairs will provide literature on base facilities, mission of the
         base, and the local area, if available.
         6.3.4.12.6. Safety will provide briefings on flightline driving and other local
         conditions.
         6.3.4.12.7. Medical will provide literature on local area health conditions and
         conduct a medical orientation.
         6.3.4.12.8. Security Forces (in coordination with airfield management) will arrange
         for custom clearances.
         6.3.4.12.9. Civil Engineering will provide literature on passive defense conditions
         and the necessary protective measures as appropriate.
         6.3.4.12.10. Communications and Information Postal Services will provide literature
         on procedures for receiving and sending mail and hours of operation.
         6.3.4.12.11. Services will provide lodging assignments and arrange for extended
         hours of operation or ground support meals for incoming forces as appropriate.
         Priority will be given to unit integrity and the homogeneous lodging of commissioned
         and enlisted personnel. Additionally, they will work closely with PERSCO to
         document lodging assignments.
         6.3.4.12.12. Finance will provide assistance in cash advances and pay inquiries.
         Sister Service Representative(s). If incoming personnel include personnel from the
         Army, Navy, or Marines, these Services will be contacted to provide a representative
         to assist in receiving and processing their personnel and cargo.
         6.3.4.12.13. Security Forces representatives will monitor weapons arrival and
         storage.
         6.3.4.12.14. PERSCO representative is responsible for providing guidelines for
         accounting of all forces according to AFI 10-215, Supported Command processing
         instructions/reporting guidance, and the deployed commander.
         6.3.4.12.15. AFOSI will provide the local threat update.
         6.3.4.12.16. Security Forces Commander or Defense Force Commander, if not the
         AEF/SF, will ensure the Integrated Base Defense posture and any unique procedures
         or awareness information is provided.
     6.3.4.13. When a CRG or element of a CRG is operating at the employment site, the
     RCC contacts the passenger service agent to ensure all passengers are accounted for and
     customs cleared before moving them to the reception area.
  6.3.5. Reception Processing Unit (RPU). The RPU is similar to the PDF, but in a reception
  role. It provides overall control for arriving personnel forces and coordinates requirements
  for processing and onward movement.
     6.3.5.1. In most cases, the RPU should remain separate from the PDF due to sterilization
     and customs issues.
 144                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       6.3.5.2. Accounts for all arriving and departing personnel. All arriving personnel will
       inprocess with this unit.
       6.3.5.3. The RPU manages the transportation needs of arriving personnel and delivers
       baggage to and from designated locations.
       6.3.5.4. The RPU provides shuttle bus maps/routes and arrival and departure times.
   6.3.6. PERSCO Team. The PERSCO Team usually operates the RPU and will account for
   all arriving and departing personnel. See AFI 10-215 for a complete description of PERSCO
   responsibilities.
       6.3.6.1. PERSCO personnel and their established procedures will be used for
       documenting arriving personnel. However, if a PERSCO team is not available, a person
       will be appointed by the troop commander to maintain accountability until a PERSCO
       team arrives (reference AFI 10-215).
   6.3.7. Cargo Reception Function (CRF). The CRF is similar to the CDF, but in a reception
   role. It provides overall control for arriving cargo/equipment and coordinates requirements
   for processing and onward movement.
       6.3.7.1. In most cases, there is not enough marshaling capacity for a separate CRF and
       CDF, but the collocated operations must physically keep incoming and outgoing cargo
       separate.
       6.3.7.2. Provides for movement of cargo from holding areas based on prioritization given
       by the unit representative or troop commander.
       6.3.7.3. Collects all documentation and dates (e.g., placards, load/packing lists,
       LOGMOD files, etc.) for incoming cargo. Notifies the RCC team of inbound surface
       deliveries, passenger movement status, and cargo hold and movement status.
       6.3.7.4. Establishes a holding area for collecting pallets, nets, dunnage, and RFID tags to
       be put back into the transportation system. NOTE: For employment sites with CRG
       support, the provisional wing/group provides the CRF process.
       6.3.7.5. Processes cargo for onward movement and provides continued in-transit
       visibility.
6.4. Reception Team Information Management.
   6.4.1. In-place teams, to include home station personnel, ―Open the Base‖ forces (e.g.,
   CRGs), or ―C2‖ and ―Establish the Base‖ forces, can accomplish the reception of resources.
   Reception teams will capture all data and documentation necessary to account for arriving
   resources using the IDS. Cargo received will be receipted for in GATES or CMOS, cleared
   through customs, and placed in the appropriate holding area pending distribution to the
   owners or onward movement. All personnel arriving at the deployed location will centrally
   process through the RPU, ensuring that full accountability is accomplished via standard Air
   Force force accountability systems used by PERSCO teams.
   6.4.2. The primary tool suite that supports and enables the reception process is the IDS. IDS
   components at a deployed site may or may not fully duplicate the tool suite used at home
   station. Minimum tools required are LOGMOD Stand Alone, AALPS, and CMOS. AMC
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                              145


   aerial port systems (GATES) may be used if CMOS is not available. The full suite of tools
   (LOGMOD, AALPS, and CMOS/GATES) will be the primary system utilized, if available.
   6.4.3. In addition, deployed Supply personnel/LROs will use systems required by AFMAN
   23-110 to account for arriving equipment, spares, and, if centrally stored, munitions,
   weapons, and mobags. The web-enabled Combat Ammunition System (CAS) will be used to
   account for and manage all munitions and ammunition under all situations and conditions
   IAW AFI 21-201.
   6.4.4. Finally, for visibility of incoming forces, the RCC requires access to the TPFDD and
   airlift schedules. They will require SIPRNET connectivity for access to DCAPES/JOPES,
   BaS&E (formally LOGCAT), and LOGFAC. If these systems are not available, RCC
   personnel should be able to access classified web sites or e-mail as a backup. For incoming
   airlift schedules, they’ll need GTN, GDSS, SMS, or similar airlift tracking system.
6.5. Advance Echelon (ADVON) Team Responsibilities.
   6.5.1. The primary responsibilities of the ADVON team are preparation, execution of unit
   employment, and developing employment reception. At established locations, these duties
   are performed by assigned functions within LRS, MSS, Operations planning, Airfield
   Management, Comptroller, CES, Services Squadron (SVS), SFS, the Judge Advocate
   General (JAG), Medical Group, etc. Air Component personnel, in-theater CRGs, or units that
   may be scheduled to deploy to austere bases, limited bases, or collocated bases, may perform
   these duties. These activities are performed by Open the Base forces (e.g., CRG), ―C2,‖ and
   ―Establish the Base‖ force modules at newly opened bases. An ADVON team is not required
   for every deployed unit or location. When used, the ADVON team or host unit will assist all
   other units in the bed down process.
6.6. Deployed Commanders.
   6.6.1. Ensures arriving/deployed personnel meet tasking requirements to include line
   remarks. See paragraph 1.7.2 for a detailed listing of responsibilities.
6.7. Documentation and Data Capture for Incoming Resources.
   6.7.1. Data Collection. The CRG or RCC will collect the following documentation and data
   for all incoming resources:
      6.7.1.1. Incoming Aircraft Commanders package.
      6.7.1.2. IDS personnel and levy data disk produced from DCAPES.
      6.7.1.3. Orders with SSANs.
      6.7.1.4. IDS LOGPLAN and DSOE execution files (disk), produced from LOGMOD.
      6.7.1.5. AALPS data file.
      6.7.1.6. Passenger manifests.
      6.7.1.7. Shippers Declarations.
      6.7.1.8. Cargo Load and Packing lists.
      6.7.1.9. AF Form 245, Employment Locator and Processing Checklist.
      6.7.1.10. DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record.
146                                               AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      6.7.1.11. Aircraft Load Plans.
      6.7.1.12. Deployed Medical Records (AF 2766), if brought, for turn-in to deployed
      Medical Treatment Facility (MTF)/Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS).
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 147


                                           Chapter 7

                           REDEPLOYMENT AND ROTATION

7.1. Redeployment.
   7.1.1. Redeployment applies to onward or forward deployment as well as return to home
   station which includes rotation of Airmen when AEF rotations have been established to
   sustain an operation. Redeployment planning is essential to an effective and efficient return
   of deployed resources or forward deployment of combat capability. Redeployment activities
   need to begin long before receipt of a redeployment order. Normally, the planning process
   begins upon arrival at the deployed location, and if possible, prior to departing home station.
   This ensures accountability of all deployed resources and that redeployment movement
   activities comply with host nation’s customs requirements. Rotation of Airmen (ROA)
   planning starts once the rotation or deployment movement plan has been completed. This is
   essential to ensure replacement of Airmen is timely and that any overlap or training en-route
   requirements have been considered.
   7.1.2. Redeployment is NOT ―deployment in reverse.‖ First, fragmented UTCs or ULNs are
   more likely to be incrementally redeployed/forward deployed to retain residual capability at
   original deployed locations requiring the supportability of the remaining forces. Planners
   (LRS representatives, etc.) need to plan for movement of parts of units, UTCs, or ULNs.
   Additionally, redeploying may, for military, political, or diplomatic reasons, be far more
   rapid than the deployment phase, which makes redeployment planning all the more critical.
7.2. The Redeployment Process.
   7.2.1. The following outlines basic steps in the redeployment process. These steps mirror,
   for the most part, the deployment process. However, as indicated above, the process must be
   flexible and able to adapt to the unique requirements of the redeployment environment.
   Additionally, be aware that unit moves are normally classified and redeployment information
   should be controlled and provided only on a strictly need-to-know basis.
      7.2.1.1. Redeployment Planning. Redeployment planning should normally start before
      the deployment, when the Joint Task Force (JTF) staff first gathers to plan the operation.
      Logistics Planners assist deploying commanders to ensure their units deploy personnel
      with necessary redeployment skills and training to ensure a smooth redeployment
      process. These trained personnel will become part of a Redeployment Assistance Team
      (RAT) to assist Logistics Planners in developing a redeployment plan at the employment
      site as soon as possible before redeployment orders are published. Logistics Planners
      must begin planning redeployment requirements as soon as possible upon arrival at the
      deployed location. They do this in concert with all deployed functional area
      representatives, as well as the host nation’s customs representative. As a Logistics
      Planner may not be on the initial or early loads, consider appointing an individual from
      another logistics area to be responsible for personnel and cargo manifest/load plan
      collection as initial documentation for redeployment preparations. Proper documentation,
      data, and supporting automated systems are vital in carrying out a successful
      redeployment. At deployed sites with multiple units, the lead unit is responsible for
      redeploying all the units at the site.
148                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


      7.2.1.2. Redeployment Documentation, Data, and Automated Systems. Deployed
      Logistics Planners, or a designated alternative, will collect as many deployment
      documents as possible—these are invaluable as references for the team to create the
      return documentation. For example, collect packing lists, load lists, and manifests or
      CA/CRLs to track assets and units when forward deployed and their redeployment status
      (e.g., destroyed, captured, excessive restoration costs, and reorder information). At the
      deployed location, the reception area is a good source for many of these documents and
      to account for equipment and collect cargo manifests, load plans, hazardous cargo
      documentation, etc. Knowing where assets are located, whether they are redeployable,
      and where the deployment documentation is, should reduce labor-intensive efforts when
      the redeployment order is received. Planners need to identify what equipment remains or
      what needs to be returned to other units. Further, documentation gives build-up teams an
      advantage when repackaging. This should aid in estimating actual weights when creating
      the redeployment load plans and manifests.
         7.2.1.2.1. Redeployment Electronic Data. Deployed Logistics Planners are
         responsible for the collection of resource information necessary to accomplish
         redeployment of all personnel and cargo at the deployed location.
             7.2.1.2.1.1. Data files to collect include LOGPLAN, CMOS export file, deployed
             personnel file, and tasked plan file. Some of these files may be resident in systems
             at the deployed location. Therefore, assuring the files are available in a system, so
             they may be used to support redeployment, is sufficient and precludes Logistics
             Planners from having to physically collect these files.
             7.2.1.2.1.2. Not all of these files may be available, but every effort must be made
             to capture this data for use in redeployment. This data may be collected from the
             RCC, if established.
             7.2.1.2.1.3. Deployed logisticians begin to prepare calculations, to include getting
             preplanned load plans, to estimate required redeployment airlift based on
             collected or captured deployment data. Build the redeployment plan and DSOE
             based on a priority flow.
         7.2.1.2.2. Redeployment Support Systems. IDS is the primary automated suite
         supporting and enabling the redeployment process. The IDS component tools may or
         may not fully duplicate the software suite used at home station. Minimum required
         tools are: LOGMOD Stand Alone, PERSCO module of MANPER-B, AALPS, and
         CMOS. AMC aerial port systems may be used, but only when CMOS is unavailable.
         Use of these automated systems is critical to ensuring ITV and personnel
         accountability.
             7.2.1.2.2.1. Deployed Logistics Planners will utilize LSA as the primary
             redeployment tool of IDS. Wherever possible, deployment data files from
             LOGMOD and DCAPES/MANPER-B PERSCO module will be collected and
             used in LSA to ease the redeployment activities to onward and forward
             deployments as well as deployments back to home station. Deploying/Deployed
             Logistics Planners will utilize the LSA Re-Deployment Checklist in Attachment
             18.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                149


      7.2.1.3. Rotation Planning. AEF rotation is an activity of deployment and redeployment
      and is the Rotation of Airmen (ROA)/Transfer of Forces (TOF) IAW the AEF schedule.
      It provides presence for those areas without permanently assigned forces or to support
      normal operations beyond the capability of the theater assigned forces. Rotation planning
      facilitates sustaining the employment mission and transitioning force capability within an
      expeditionary organization. Rotation planning prescribes how the ROA/TOF will
      flow/occur in and out of theaters of operations systematically each AEF rotation.
      Rotation planning considerations that directly impact rotation operations are similar to
      those described in deployment planning with the following additional concerns: overlap
      (continuity training) requirements, Commanders release of Airmen, ARC volunteers on
      mandays, and en route training requirements. These factors are critical to rotation
      planning and are the basis for developing rotational airlift plans.
7.3. Redeployment Organizations, Work Centers, and Responsibilities.
   7.3.1. Deployed Command Organization. The command organization at a deployed location
   varies depending upon theater and the designated lead single Service command or JTF. The
   redeployment order originates at JCS or the joint command headquarters, and then is
   forwarded to the deployed commander. The deployed commander usually tasks a J4/A4 as
   lead agent for execution of redeployment activities; however, determination of units and
   timing is primarily a commander and J3/A3 decision. During AEF rotations, the deployed
   commander must also ensure that TPFDD verification timelines/suspense’s are met and that
   personnel are released to meet the RLD and ALD or coordinate extensions that exceed tour
   length and stated line remarks for overlap. A3 and A4 coordination of the rotation out
   TPFDD is essential in ensuring the deployed location has the capability and infrastructure to
   support replacement of Airmen and time phasing identified in the TPFDD. NOTE: The
   deployed commander, before taking any actions, must authenticate any redeployment order.
   A false redeployment order could cause serious mission degradation.
      7.3.1.1. Identify Redeployment Team Members. Deployed installation commander
      identifies preliminary redeployment team members. Anticipate the formal redeployment
      tasking as early as possible. Normally, a RAT is formed under the overall management of
      the Contingency C2 Planning Team.
      7.3.1.2. RAT. Team of functional members accomplishing actions at the deployed site to
      include planning the redeployment and coordinating with the deployed installation
      commander to identify the correct priorities for getting the units’ personnel, equipment,
      and supplies back to home station or to a forward location. Suggested RAT composition
      includes representatives from the following functional areas: aircraft maintenance,
      transportation (including aerial port, if resident on the base, and vehicle operations),
      supply, services, personnel (PERSCO), contracting, and civil engineering. Additional
      members, to include tenants or sister Service representatives, may be required as the
      commander or Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell chief deems necessary.
   7.3.2. Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell. Logistics Planners, acting on behalf of deployed
   commanders, receive tasking/redeployment orders verbally or through levy flow, messages,
   or other official notification. Logistics Planners are responsible for planning, coordinating,
   managing, and executing redeployment/base closure activities. At a minimum, Logistics
   Plans representatives, in concert with RAT members, will plan for and execute movement of
150                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


  deployed resources. The cell will also monitor TPFDD and coordinate ―AK‖ or strategic
  aircraft moves with forward A4, direct/schedule members to move on ―AK‖ missions and
  provide electronic manifests for each mission from the APOE. Transportation will book
  channel moves in GATES and coordinate onward movement for all members from the
  APOD to home station. At deployed sites with multiple units, the lead unit is responsible for
  redeploying all the units at the site.
      7.3.2.1. Building the Redeployment Schedule of Events (RSOE) (format same as
      DSOE). The Contingency C2 Planning Scheduler, a member of the Contingency C2
      Planning Team/Cell, builds, coordinates with redeploying units, and publishes the RSOE
      based on the redeployment tasking and scheduled transportation. Distributes final RSOE
      to all unit redeployment work centers. Also accomplishes preliminary load plans based
      on the redeployment airflow message, if applicable.
         7.3.2.1.1. Contingency C2 Planning Scheduler will coordinate with all units to
         determine total redeployment requirement through data gathering of all cargo
         increments and personnel data from deployed PERSCO.
      7.3.2.2. Recall and Preparation of Equipment and Personnel. Recall various kinds of
      equipment: WRM, mobility equipment, host nation, and contracted equipment. Units
      prepare equipment for shipment (prioritize; identify owning unit, destination, and
      hazardous materials; create cargo movement markings; and build up pallets). CRF
      processes cargo for redeployment to include in-check, weigh, measure, joint inspect,
      marshal, prepare cargo manifest, load cargo, process and load baggage, and conduct
      customs inspections. A Passenger Redeployment Function will coordinate and establish
      requirements for personnel redeployment.
         7.3.2.2.1. Recall and assemble personnel, as required, to ensure they are ready to
         redeploy, whether it be forward or back to home station.
         7.3.2.2.2. Coordinate home base nation’s customs and agriculture inspections. The
         redeploying unit is responsible to ensure all equipment documentation is correct and
         their equipment is properly cleaned to meet customs and agriculture requirements to
         eliminate introduction of exotic agricultural pests and animal disease agents.
      7.3.2.3. Documenting the Redeployment. The Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell is
      responsible for collecting and documenting redeployment activity data. This is essentially
      handled by deployed components of IDS. This data is of historical significance and is
      used in trend analysis and process improvement.
         7.3.2.3.1. Maintain Logistics Plans files, DSOE files, PERSCO files, and
         cargo/passenger manifest files. Accomplish documentation of lessons learned using
         the Air Force Lessons Learned database on the AF Knowledge Now website
         (https://afknowledge.langley.af.mil/), as well as requirements contained in AFMAN
         37-123 and AEF after-action reporting requirements in AFI 10-401. MAJCOMs may
         also levy after-action reporting requirements, as they see fit.
      7.3.2.4. Redeployment Meals. The Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell will make
      arrangements to secure and provide in-flight meals to redeploying forces. Rations may be
      the only option available for in-flight feeding.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                151


     7.3.2.5. When closing down a deployed base, Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell
     personnel and deployed Contracting officers must ensure that all negotiated agreements
     are considered, complied with, and terminated, if appropriate.
  7.3.3. Unit Redeployment Work Centers. The Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell tasks
  units, as applicable, to stand up their unit redeployment work centers. Units must identify and
  prepare their resources for redeployment. Additionally, they ensure identification of
  shortfalls/LIMFACs relating to personnel, facilities, vehicles, MHE, and any other equipment
  necessary for the redeployment. Elevate shortfalls/LIMFACs as quickly as possibly to the
  Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell to ensure timely resolution.
     7.3.3.1. Unit Redeployment Work Center Responsibilities: Deployed unit commanders
     must ensure units prepare and handle equipment and cargo IAW DOD 4500.9-R, DTR
     Parts II and III; ; AFMAN 24-204(I); and Title 49. Carrying out the mission as safely as
     possible is paramount, and ORM concepts should be used to the maximum extent
     possible to mitigate risk.
         7.3.3.1.1. Units prepare documentation for each increment of cargo IAW cargo
         preparation guidance in Chapter 4. Units must include, at a minimum, the same
         documentation required for deployment. Ensure all customs documentation is
         complete. IMPORTANT: Original deployment documentation cannot be used as
         redeployment documentation.
         7.3.3.1.2. Unit identification, destination, and cargo movement markings must be
         clearly visible to assist transportation personnel to efficiently retrograde equipment.
         Proper identification and markings are especially important when moving by sea or
         when aircraft have integrated loads for multiple destinations. To aid in identifying
         unit cargo, use distinctive, waterproof markings, or placards made of squares of
         canvas that will be visible from a distance.
         7.3.3.1.3. Redeploying units must handle and ship classified material IAW DOD
         5200.1-R and AFI 31-401. AFI 31-401 also gives specific guidance on how to
         account for deployed classified material.
         7.3.3.1.4. Redeploying units must provide qualified drivers for specialized vehicles
         (e.g., RATTs, ATVs, etc.).
         7.3.3.1.5. Any required shoring/dunnage will be provided by the redeploying unit
         and must remain with its associated equipment. NOTE: Units redeploying from
         certain locations may be required to leave wooden dunnage due to infestations.
         7.3.3.1.6. Deployed equipment custodians are required to account for their unit
         equipment through the designated LRS function IAW AFMAN 23-110.
         7.3.3.1.7. Ensure return of WRM, borrowed, host nation, or leased equipment to
         owning organizations before unit departure.
         7.3.3.1.8. Units will be prepared to provide personnel resources to aid and assist in
         the redeployment process when requested by the Contingency C2 Planning
         Team/Cell.
         7.3.3.1.9. Units redeploying by convoy must follow cargo preparation requirements
         in AFI 24-203
152                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


         7.3.3.1.10. Deployed commanders must ensure hazardous waste is properly handled
         and prepared for retrograde or disposal IAW current guidance and host nation
         requirements.
         7.3.3.1.11. Redeploying units may be tasked to provide augmentees to support
         loading operations. For specific guidance on how to load aircraft, consult DOD
         4500.9-R, DTR Part III, and the applicable aircraft –9 TO.
  7.3.4. Cargo Redeployment Function (CRF). As with the CDF, the local deployed LRS, or
  equivalent, establishes the capability to receive, marshal, JI, and load equipment for
  redeployment. Responsibilities established in paragraph 2.36.3.1 also apply to redeployment
  operations.
      7.3.4.1. CRF Responsibilities: The LRS, upon direction of the Contingency C2 Planning
      Team/Cell, activates this work center to receive and process equipment for the
      redeployment. Conducts the following actions safely:
         7.3.4.1.1. Ensures each load crewmember has required safety gear (i.e., gloves, steel-
         toed shoes, hearing protection, and reflective belts).
         7.3.4.1.2. Provides secure location to hold baggage after inspection by customs
         officials. If bulk shipping, turns mobility bags in to a centralized location as soon as
         possible. Makes every effort to bulk ship mobility bags and weapons.
         7.3.4.1.3. Customs inspections are performed for all redeploying resources.
         7.3.4.1.4. Ensures maximum dissemination of customs information and compliance
         requirements.
         7.3.4.1.5. Ensures that all hazardous materials being moved comply with AFMAN
         24-204(I).
         7.3.4.1.6. Moves weapons and ammunition IAW DOD 5100.76-M and AFI 21-101.
         7.3.4.1.7. Plans to manage hazardous wastes that have been generated while at the
         deployed location will be developed IAW AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program in
         Foreign Countries.
         7.3.4.1.8. Coordinates joint cargo inspection for all redeploying cargo and documents
         IAW applicable instructions or guidance. Use the DD Form 2133 as a guide.
         7.3.4.1.9. Verifies all cargo weights and dimensional data for final load planning in
         AALPS.
         7.3.4.1.10. In the event of limited MHE, locate the pallet build-up area and the
         aircraft silhouette as near to aircraft load sites as possible to help reduce MHE
         requirements.
         7.3.4.1.11. Final load plans will be accomplished after the load has passed inspection
         for proper labels, weights, configuration and documentation of hazardous equipment,
         and security and agricultural checks.
         7.3.4.1.12. Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell, CRG, or designated cargo function
         must use CMOS or AMC systems (GATES) to maintain cargo ITV. CMOS/GATES
         will pass the movement data to GTN.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                               153


     7.3.4.2. When present, a CRG, or their equivalent, validates redeployment load plans and
     passenger/cargo manifests, supervises and controls cargo load teams, provides ramp
     coordinators, performs JIs, and provides/operates MHE beyond the capability of the
     redeploying unit. When present, a CRG works closely with the Contingency C2 Planning
     Team/Cell and RAT to ensure meeting of redeployment closure times.
  7.3.5. Passenger Redeployment Function. A deployed Passenger Redeployment Function
  must complete all redeployment actions required for personnel movement as developed by
  the Contingency C2 Planning Team/Cell and the deployed commander. The deployed
  PERSCO may be embedded with this function performing necessary out-processing and
  personnel accountability actions IAW AFI 10-215. Items considered during the planning
  effort are:
     7.3.5.1. SOFAs and customs of the host country.
     7.3.5.2. Type of personnel structure needed to retain residual capability of the deployed
     site, if required.
     7.3.5.3. Ensuring projected mode of transportation and itinerary are reported in available
     deployed IDS components or message traffic to facilitate ITV. At a minimum,
     redeployment departure dates (projected and/or actual) and mission or flight numbers
     must be updated in DCAPES/MANPER-B PERSCO Module
     7.3.5.4. Ensuring redeployment priorities and sequence of all resources is determined
     based on the modes of scheduled transportation (airlift/sealift/ground) in the TPFDD.
     7.3.5.5. Passenger Prioritization. The redeploying unit commander will select couriers
     (cargo/classified) familiar with the cargo for each load, as necessary. These couriers will
     be first on the aircraft; the rest of the seats will be filled according to the operational
     demands.
     7.3.5.6. Out-processing Actions. Ensure the out-processing plan includes checkout with
     Lodging, Security Forces, Services, deployed First Sergeant, and others as needed.
     Ensure redeployment documents clearly reflect all personnel redeploying. It is important
     to stress the deployed unit commander or their designated representatives are the only
     personnel that can authorize personnel departures from a unit.
     7.3.5.7. Loading of Passengers. Like the home station PDF, the Personnel Redeployment
     Function plays an essential role in the development of processes for passenger check-in,
     identification of ―sterile‖ waiting areas, and the eventual loading of aircraft. Ensure
     procedures are in place to alert appropriate agencies of personnel not departing on
     scheduled aircraft. This affects both future passenger flow and end-strength of a location.
     7.3.5.8. Ensures that a personal amnesty room or box is available for all personnel to
     pass through before customs inspection. Brief all personnel on contraband regulations
     before they pass through the amnesty room or by the amnesty box.
     7.3.5.9. Ensures passenger manifests are prepared for each deploying chalk. IDS use will
     provide the automation needed to support this requirement.
     7.3.5.10. PERSCO confirms the redeployment data and actual departure date/time to
     update DCAPES/MANPER-B PERSCO Module. PERSCO must update departure data
     within MANPER-B PERSCO Module on the day of the member’s departure

                                           Chapter 8

                         REDEPLOYMENT SUPPORT PROCESS

8.1. Purpose.
   8.1.1. The positive and sustained care, control, and discipline of each Airman is the purpose
   of the Redeployment Support Process. The goal is to ensure personnel readiness throughout
   the AEF cycle by providing timely support for our military members and their families.
   Redeployment support is an ongoing process, NOT a homecoming event. The intent is to
   provide continuous, integrated support from the AOR to home station and to assist in the
   transition from the deployed environment to family life and work site.
   8.1.1.1. (AMC) (Added) AMCI10-403 outlines AMC Redeployment/PostDeployment
   Reintegration policy.
8.2. Recovery.
   8.2.1. After periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite
   from the deployment environment has a beneficial effect on an individual’s psychological
   and physical status. An immediate recovery period also provides time for the returning
   Airmen to tend to personal needs neglected during lengthy periods away from home. Each
   MAJCOM is responsible for establishing and publishing personnel recovery (leave, passes,
   attribution and retention) policies for returning combat forces. Reference AFI 36-3003,
   Military Leave Program, for further guidance on leave and passes.
8.3. Reconstitution.
   8.3.1. Although a key consideration is to provide support to returning forces to transition
   back to their normal environment, it must also be remembered that forces must be
   reconstituted for further deployment possibilities including surge requirements. This process
   entails planning that will return units back to their full combat capability in a short time.
   While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution planning, consideration must be given
   to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables expended during the crisis, and recovering
   lost training. Every base/unit will have to assess their own situation based on such variables
   as the magnitude, duration and intensity of a crisis, consumption rates, and the type of
   deployment location (fixed vs. austere base). Reference AFI 10-401 for further guidance on
   reconstitution.
8.4. Redeployment Support Process.
   8.4.1. This process implements DOD and AF guidance, and the Department of
   Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs (DOD/VA) Post Deployment Health Clinical
   Practice   Guidelines   (PDH-CPG).    More   information can   be   found    at
   http://www.pdhealth.mil/.
   8.4.2. Minimum mandatory guidance is specified for functions and activities to be
   coordinated within the Community Action Information Board’s (CAIB) scope of operations
   at the base level. Maximum flexibility is advised for each MAJCOM to develop a
   redeployment support process tailored for its unique mission and personnel utilization during
   deployments. Command authority and responsibilities are delineated for support to military
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  155


   members, families, and units. Consultative and training responsibilities are outlined for the
   helping agencies included as members of the CAIB/IDS. Although the helping agencies are
   tasked with specific roles and responsibilities as part of the redeployment support process,
   these various roles and responsibilities can best be coordinated using the CAIB/IDS process.
   8.4.3. Guidance for redeployment support within AFRC is included in the AFRC
   Deployment Support Program. The AFRC/Surgeon General (AFRC/SG) is the OPR for
   deployment support within AFRC.
8.5. Scope.
   8.5.1. The Air Force Redeployment Support Process applies to deployed AORs and home
   stations. All personnel deployed to an AOR, to CONUS locations in support of
   contingencies, and to remote assignments are included. Key determinants for participation
   are lengthy family separation and significant family-related stressors prior to redeployment.
   CAIB/IDS helping agencies complete specified activities to support redeployed active duty,
   ANG, AFRC, civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the AEF cycle.
   Readjustment from duty in the AOR requires structured recovery time and activities for
   members and families, prior to leave or TDY.
8.6. Training.
   8.6.1. Critical components for training all personnel involved in the Redeployment Support
   Process include: recognizing readjustment difficulties, normalization for members following
   deployments, de-stigmatizing help-seeking behavior, and connecting members with
   CAIB/IDS agencies for support.
   8.6.2. At home station, the CAIB/IDS members provide training and education for
   commanders, their designees, first sergeants, supervisors, UDMs, Wingmen, and new
   CAIB/IDS members.
      8.6.2.1. CAIB/IDS members act as the commander’s consultants and use MAJCOM-
      specific redeployment support processes and reintegration education material posted on
      AF Crossroads and the AEF Center websites. AFRC Deployment Support material can
      also be found on the AFRC website. The CAIB/IDS agencies provide integrated,
      interoperable programs to strengthen force readiness. Reintegration education, medical
      care, spiritual support, and childcare will be available for all redeploying personnel, their
      family members, and units.
   8.6.3. A&FRCs collaborate with other IDS agencies in the development of reintegration
   training and education material. A&FRCs provide material to the Chaplain Service and
   LSSC personnel in the AOR via e-mail, websites, or hard copy.
   8.6.4. Air Mobility Warfare Center (AMWC) requires training briefings for AOR
   commanders prior to deployment during the ECS Executive Warrior Course (E2WC). AF
   CAIB/IDS members provide updated training material and slides.
   8.6.5. Annual deployment preparedness training is required for all AFRC military personnel
   and will be coordinated by the AFRC Wing Deployment Support Program POC. The dates of
   annual training will be included in the wing or unit training tracking system.
 156                                                    AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


8.7. Funding.
   8.7.1. Post-Deployment funding will be requested and is provided through Air Force funding
   channels per AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and Volume 2,
   Budget Management for Operations. Funding will be used to purchase training guides for
   leadership and military in an AOR and for leadership, members, and families for successful
   reintegration and reunion. Contact the local finance/budget office for base and MAJCOM
   specific guidance.
   8.7.2. Incremental costs caused by a higher than normal deployment rates (e.g., Global War
   on Terror (GWOT) operations) would allow incremental expenses associated with those
   contingencies to be coded against them. Work with the servicing Finance Managers to make
   the determination if the cost was truly incremental, and if so, code it as such. Reimbursement
   may not be dollar for dollar, so wings, MAJCOMs, and Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
   would have to determine if this program has a higher priority relative to their other
   requirements.
   8.7.3. Promotional items for the express intent of awareness, training and education, and
   implementation of post-deployment services to eligible family members may be procured
   IAW AFI 65-601, Volume 1. Promotional items may target age-specific audiences for both
   adults and youth participants and be used by various CAIB/IDS agencies as they deliver
   services in the AOR and at the home station.
8.8. Redeployment Support Process Timeline.
   8.8.1. Figure 8.1, Redeployment Support Timeline, provides a template for commanders’
   responses and actions and CAIB/IDS members’ activities at the critical junctures of
   redeployment, recovery, reconstitution, and spin-up/deployment operations. Subsequent
   sections provide detailed information on roles and responsibilities.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 157

          8.9.1.2.1. At home station, the installation commanders will ensure all units and
          tenants comply with requirements for the Air Force Redeployment Support Process
          IAW current DoD, AF, and MAJCOM guidance.
          8.9.1.2.2. Commanders ensure complete redeployment processing of their personnel
          and support each individual to make a smooth post deployment transition.
          8.9.1.2.3. Commanders must ensure that all redeploying airmen complete post-
          deployment medical processing immediately upon return from deployment, prior to
          release for downtime, leave, or demobilization IAW CSAF Memorandum, ―Post-
          Deployment Medical Processing‖, 27 Jun 2003.
       8.9.1.3. Agency Resources and Responsibilities.
          8.9.1.3.1. In the AOR within 30 days of redeployment, Chaplain Service members
          and LSSC personnel will provide reintegration education to redeploying members.
          8.9.1.3.2. Chaplains and LSSC personnel meet with higher-risk individuals who have
          been exposed to unusual danger, experienced loss, witnessed disturbing events, been
          injured, or had family problems before/during deployment.

8.10. Reintegration.
   8.10.1. Return Date from AOR (R-Day).
       8.10.1.1. Unit responsibilities.
          8.10.1.1.1. Units are responsible for ensuring families are notified of returning
          members and for ensuring all members have transportation from the aerial port of
          debarkation (APOD) to home station. When groups return together, units will
          coordinate transportation from the APOD.
          8.10.1.1.2. Units will coordinate with LRS and/or SFS for the collection and turn in
          of issued weapons on R-Day for returning groups and individuals. Having an on-call
          system for returning members to contact LRS or SFS to turn in weapons should be
          considered a last resort.
          8.10.1.1.3. Units will coordinate with returning groups and individuals for the turn in
          of classified information, as applicable.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                  159

        8.10.2.1.1. Units will coordinate with PRF to establish a reception station to provide
        streamlined inprocessing to redeploying groups, ensuring that redeployers are
        returned to their families as quickly as possible. Units will inprocess redeployers
        within 2 duty days of R-Day so that redeployers may begin personnel recovery (post
        deployment downtime and leave) as soon as possible. Inprocessing briefings and
        stations should include Finance, Public Health, and Legal.
        8.10.2.1.2. Units will coordinate with the unit deployment manager and LRS
        Mobility Bag section for mass turn in of mobility bags and other issued items at
        inprocessing.
        8.10.2.1.3. At home station, within 4 duty days of redeployment, reintegration
        education serves as a time for observing, screening, identifying, and referring
        returning members, families, and units who could benefit from readjustment support
        during the AEF cycle recovery period.
        8.10.2.1.4. Unit first sergeants will coordinate with the Family Support Center,
        Chaplain Service, Life Skills Support Center, and Family Advocacy Outreach
        Managers to plan and schedule reintegration briefings and individual counseling
        opportunities. Unit first sergeants will invite families to attend reintegration briefings.
     8.10.2.2. Inprocessing requirements.
        8.10.2.2.1. The PRF begins the reintegration process and develops the reception
        station. PRF will ensure procedures are established to account for members returning
        from deployments. These procedures will be incorporated into installation
        reconstitution planning and the IDP. Returning units and individuals will inprocess
        with the PRF within 2 duty days of R-Day. The PRF will update the date of return to
        home station for all individuals in DCAPES on the date of notification of return IAW
        AFI 10-215.
        8.10.2.2.2. At home station, if the PDHA process was not completed before
        redeployment, then complete no later than 30 days after return.
        8.10.2.2.3. At home station within five days of return, submission of redeployment
        travel vouchers aids the local finance office in their efforts to stop continued accrual
        of area of operation specific pay entitlements that may be unauthorized after a
        member redeploys.
        8.10.2.2.4. All personnel must process through Public Health prior to starting post
        deployment downtime. Public Health personnel will validate the member has
        completed a Post Deployment Health Assessment form and that they have received a
        post deployment medical debriefing. These DoD mandated requirements are
        necessary to protect the member and their family from significant health threats and
        highly contagious diseases the member might have been exposed to at the deployment
        location.
 160                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011

          personnel, and Chaplain Service members provide support and reintegration
          education to redeployed members, families, and units in collaboration with other
          CAIB/IDS agencies. Follow-up to Return and Reunion activities is provided IAW
          AFI 36-3009. NOTE: Air Reserve Component units without LSSC, Family
          Advocacy, or Chaplain support will need to request this support through their host
          active duty unit IAW AFI 44-153, Traumatic Stress Response.
          8.10.2.3.2. At home station following redeployment, LSSC personnel provide
          assessments, supportive counseling, and follow-up care to redeployers referred by

AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                 161


8.12. Home Station CAIB/IDS Agency Responsibilities.
   8.12.1. The Redeployment Support Timeline (Figure 8.1) outlines the AEF cycle and
   specifies activities for commanders and CAIB/IDS agencies at critical junctures. CAIB/IDS
   members act as the commander’s consultants and use MAJCOM-specific redeployment
   support processes and reintegration education material posted on AF Crossroads and the AEF
   Center websites. AFRC Deployment Support material can also be found on the AFRC
   website. The CAIB/IDS agencies provide integrated, interoperable programs to strengthen
   force readiness. Reintegration education, medical care, spiritual support, and childcare will
   be available for all redeploying personnel, their family members, and units.
   8.12.2. Personnel Readiness Function. The PRF begins the reintegration process and
   develops the reception station. PRF will ensure procedures are established to account for
   members returning from deployments. These procedures will be incorporated into installation
   reconstitution planning and the IDP. Returning units and individuals will inprocess with the
   PRF within 2 duty days of R-Day. The PRF will update the date of return to home station for
   all individuals in DCAPES on the date of notification of return IAW AFI 10-215.
   8.12.3. Chaplain Service. The Chaplain Service members provide support to personnel,
   families, and base populations during contingencies IAW AFI 52-104. At home station
   during post-deployment, Chaplain Service members provide follow-up support, reintegration
   and reunion ministries, and other programs to strengthen families and enhance the spiritual
   health of individuals. Post-deployment services within AFRC wings will be coordinated with
   the reserve wing Deployment Support Program POC.
8.13. Medical Treatment in the AOR and at Home Station.
   8.13.1. The PDH-CPG states that military members meet deployment criteria anytime they
   leave the physical locale of the parent command and enter an environment for operational
   deployment or are stationed in hostile territory. The PDH-CPG applies to family members’
   health concerns that relate to deployment. Medical treatment facilities (MTF) meet the
   physical, emotional, and behavioral needs of our deploying and redeploying members and
   their families, to include medical processing and services to the ANG and AFRC members,
   as they present themselves for care. LSSC personnel provide behavioral health care with
   psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, technicians, and psychiatric nurses to personnel,
   families, and base populations during contingencies.
      8.13.1.1. At home station during all phases of the AEF cycle, LSSC personnel provide
      traumatic stress response support to units and redeployers as requested by commanders,
      in conjunction with the Chaplains. Traumatic Stress Response team members meet with
      individuals for up to four visits outside of the LSSC for the purpose of education and
      consultation IAW AFI 44-153. All deployment/redeployment related Traumatic Stress
      Response services within AFRC wing must be coordinated with the reserve wing
      Deployment Support Program POC.
      8.13.1.2. The cadre of medical personnel providing PDHAs and PDHRAs includes
      physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and Independent Duty Medical
      Technicians. Public Health personnel provide medical threat debriefings.
 162                                                     AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011



8.14. Airman and Family Readiness Center.
   8.14.1. The A&FRC provides mobility and/or deployment assistance to help single and
   married DoD personnel and families meet pre-, during, and post-deployment challenges IAW
   AFI 36-3009. Services help reduce stress and deal with separation and reintegration, increase
   individual and family morale and unit cohesion, and support operational readiness.
       8.14.1.1. A&FRCs provide assistance with development of reintegration education
       material. A&FRCs provide material to the Chaplain Service and LSSC personnel in the
       AOR via e-mail, websites, or hard copy.
       8.14.1.2. During deployments, A&FRC staffs employ the AF Readiness EDGE Guides
       and other resources for tailored support to commanders, units, and families; work with
       local school authorities and teachers to assist their understanding the unique stressors of
       the children of deployed military; provide a myriad of deployment support programs; and
       distribute commercial, printed materials addressing deployment. Upon request, one-on-
       one counseling is provided. The A&FRC staff provides support to the parents and
       siblings of single Airmen.
       8.14.1.3. Post-deployment assistance is linked to pre-deployment activities, particularly
       early intervention to educate families, single members, and units on concerns related to
       reintegration and reunion. The A&FRC staff monitors family coping skills, assists
       potential at-risk families, and collaborates with the CAIB/IDS agencies to ensure smooth
       family reunions.
8.15. Comptroller (Wing/FM).
   8.15.1. FM personnel provide redeploying Airmen with guidance on financial matters.
8.16. Legal Office.
   8.16.1. Base legal office redeployment activities should focus on assisting the individual
   with personal and legal affairs that may have arisen as a result of deployment and regaining a
   sense of normalcy.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                                    163


                                           Chapter 9

 DEPLOYMENT AND REDEPLOYMENT LESSONS LEARNED AND AEF DEBRIEF
                         PROCESS

9.1. Lessons Learned.
   9.1.1. After-Action Reports (AAR). AARs are the means by which the Air Force records
   issues, best practices, and lessons learned from major exercises, operations, and experiments.
   AARs are applicable to the CJCS exercise program, other joint exercises, Air Force exercises
   (above wing level), and real world operations. AARs are consolidated reports that include an
   executive summary covering the event information (i.e., dates, locations, participant
   units/organizations, etc.), issues/problems encountered, and lessons observed. Air Force
   Lessons Learned, AF/A9L, provides specific guidance on the Air Force Lessons Learned
   Program in a separate instruction. Lesson observations of an urgent nature can be
   disseminated via a Quick Lesson Report and are sent out immediately after the event. Air
   Force Lessons Learned, AF/A9L, provides specific guidance on the Air Force Lessons
   Learned Program in a separate instruction.
      9.1.1.1. A lesson learned is defined as an insight gained that improves military
      operations or other activities at the strategic, operational, or tactical level, and results in
      long-term, internalized change to an individual, group of individuals, or an organization.
      9.1.1.2. Executive summaries document and provide a description of operations and
      exercises, including dates, locations, objectives, major participants, and limitations. It
      also provides the commander submitting the AAR the opportunity to address any of the
      issues identified in the AAR, or add any command-level issues he/she determines must be
      identified in this forum.
   9.1.2. Submission Process. The senior deployed location commander will consolidate AAR
   inputs from subordinate unit commanders, validate observations and submit the report to the
   NAF (NAF-C) NLT end-event +15 days (or as directed). AEW/CCs will consolidate AAR
   inputs from subordinate unit commanders, validate observations and submit the consolidated
   AAR to the NAF-C/A9L office NLT 30 days prior to AEF rotation date, or as directed by the
   NAF-C.
      9.1.2.1. Observations in the AAR should clearly identify the issues/problems
      encountered and successful practices, as well as provide sufficient discussion for follow-
      on forces to understand the context. A properly documented observation should be
      actionable by follow-on forces or HHQ staffs. This documentation is essential for
      planning subsequent exercises and operations, tasking corrective actions and sharing with
      follow-on forces.
      9.1.2.2. Commanders will use the AF’s web-based lessons learned reporting tool on the
      NIPRNET and SIPRNET websites to submit the AAR. These websites contain links for
      building the AAR and submitting the final reports.
      9.1.2.3. Individuals may also submit observations at any time during the pre-deployment,
      deployment, and redeployment phases via the AF lessons learned reporting tool. These
 164                                                      AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011


       reports may encompass training, preparation, deployment and on-call phases on the AEF
       cycle.
       9.1.2.4. The AF lessons learned database tool is the single system used by all MAJCOMs
       to make their personnel aware of problems encountered during previous cycles and to
       prevent repeat mistakes. Past critical lessons learned are available to be pulled by all and
       will also be pushed to units deploying and preparing to deploy.
   9.1.3. Review Process. Once observations are entered into the website, NAF (NAF-C)/A9L
   offices will evaluate them.
   9.1.4. Periodic Reviews. During ongoing operations that involve unit and/or commander
   rotations (e.g. AEF rotations), Periodic Reviews will be produced based on deployed
   commander (AEW CC or equivalent) submissions. Commanders must accomplish these
   submissions prior to the rotation in order to provide oncoming units and commanders timely
   lessons learned information to help prepare them for mission execution. The NAF/C or
   equivalent will determine these timelines, but typically submissions should be submitted 30
   days prior to rotation.
9.2. AEF Debrief. The AEF Debrief is similar to a flight debrief or status of discipline meeting
developed to ensure the supported combatant commanders are provided the best Airmen the AF
has to offer on time at the right place. It is an additional avenue for discovering lessons learned
for the entire AEF process. An AEF Debrief will be held by the MAJCOM Vice Commanders to
establish norms and provide crosstalk for AEF planning and execution. The AEF Center itself
will be measured on sourcing timelines, unit changes, stressed career fields, teaming, extended
tour lengths, etc. MAJCOMs will report on their posturing and coding, ART, verification
statistics, names in system timing, etc. Wing metrics will include posturing and coding, ART,
shortfall information, and names in system timing. MAJCOM/CVs will host the AEF Debriefs
every four months, approximately 45-60 days after each AEF pivot date to review common
metrics to determine how well the AEF was executed.
AFI10-403_AMCSUP_I 3 MAY 2011                                                             165

A2.1. Duty Status and Deployment Availability (DAV) Codes.
     A2.1.1. DAV Codes indicate personnel availability and eligibility to deploy. Duty Status
     codes are found in AFI 36-2134, Air Force Duty Status Program, Table 4.1. DAV codes are
     resident in MilPDS and codified in this AFI. UDMs should obtain periodic reports from the
     Commander’s Support Staff (CSS) to review Duty Status and DAV code changes for
     personnel assigned to the unit. Before tasking personnel to deploy, UDMs and unit
     commanders must verify individual duty status and DAV codes (if applicable) to verify that
     the individual is present for duty or can be recalled from TDY, and that there are no
     discriminating legal, security, medical, or administrative factors that may render an
     individual ineligible to deploy.

 X         Not Available to Deploy
 Note 1 If the expected deployment completion date is 30 or more calendar days before date
        of separation (DOS) or permanent change of station (PCS), the member is available
        to deploy. Members who have less than 30 calendar days before DOS are not
        available. If a PCS is within 30 days of deployment completion date, unit
        commanders need to work with AFPC to move PCS date. If unable to change PCS
        date due to firm training/school date, then members with deployment completion
        dates less than 30 days before PCS are not available to deploy. Unit commanders
        may waive this restriction provided the duration of the deployment will not interfere
        with separation/PCS processing or departure dates. DOS must not expire during the
        deployment. Before approving a waiver, commanders must review all other
        available options IAW AFI 36-2110. Commanders should also consider any
        Permissive TDY and/or Terminal Leave (Ref AFI 36-2110, para 4.6.5.3 and Table
        2)
 Note 2 Military personnel who have adopted children are not available for deployment until
        four months after the effective date of adoption. For military couples, only one
        member is exempt.
 Note 3 Member is available unless an AFPC TDY restriction applies, IAW AFI 36-2110

 CODE DESCRIPTION
 Note 4 Time on Station (TOS) minimums:
          Assigned in the CONUS or OS on a long tour………………….45 days
          Assigned OS on a short tour…………………………………….15 days
          Assigned in the CONUS or OS, and was assigned from an unaccompanied short
        tour or CONUS isolation station…..……..6 months
        These TOS minimums allow military members and their families who have made a
        recent PCS move to satisfy essential post-PCS military processing, to arrange their
        personal affairs, and to otherwise stabilize family needs. Personnel with less than
        the minimum TOS are not available for deployment. However, unit commanders
        may waive the 15-day and 45-day TOS minimums based upon mission needs.
        Waiver authority for the 6-month TOS minimum is the NAF/CC or first 3-star
        equivalent in chain of command.
 Note 5 Ex-prisoners/evaders of capture during an armed conflict do not deploy to areas
        where the same combatants (or nations sympathetic with the combatants) may
        capture them.
 Note 6 For DAV Code 49: Member deferred from deployment for four months after birth of
        baby (extensions approved at unit/CC discretion) per AFI 36-2110 and AFI 36-

       REPORTING UNIT LEVEL UNIT TYPE CODE (UTC) DATA TO JOPES

A8.1. Reporting Unit Level UTC Data to JOPES.
   A8.1.1. At the direction of the parent MAJCOM, wings will electronically pass their tailored
   DSOE files or the LOGPLAN DCAPES (level 6) files to their MAJCOMs. Parent
   MAJCOMs must make the determination when their units send these files. For example,
   when there are very limited or no changes to the standard UTC, a DSOE or LOGPLAN file
   would not be required. When there are major end-item/increment level changes/tailoring, the
   DSOE or LOGPLAN file would be required. When required, ANG units will send their files
   to NGB/A3XA for subsequent forwarding to gaining MAJCOMS or direct import into
   DCAPES.
   A8.1.2. Prior to importing the DSOE or LOGPLAN files into DCAPES and updating
   JOPES, MAJCOMS will ensure UTCs/ULNs match TPFDD UTC/ULNs and that only
   tailored UTCs are pulled and updated in JOPES. Once JOPES is updated, the force indicator
   code (FIC) will be updated indicating the standard UTC has been tailored. NOTE: The
   UTC/ULN combinations passed in the interface file will match the UTC/ULN combinations
   in the JOPES OPLAN based on the Pseudo PID relationship. Units will ensure the correct
   Pseudo PID is used based on approved HQ USAF A5XW guidance. Units should contact
   their MAJCOM LOGMOD Manager for a complete list of approved Pseudo PIDs.
   A8.1.3. MAJCOMS must ensure the DSOE or LOGPLAN file is forwarded from the base
   prior to, or in conjunction with, the supporting MAJCOM providing TPFDD verification to
   the supported commander. Once the supported commander provides TPFDD validation to
   USTRANSCOM, the UTC/ULN will be locked and cannot be updated.
