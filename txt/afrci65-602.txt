1. Background Information. Financial management is a responsibility and function inherent to
all levels of management throughout the Air Force Reserve. The Chief of Air Force Reserve is
responsible to Congress and Air Force leadership for the preparation, justification, and execution
of the Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA), Operation and Maintenance (O&M), and
Military Construction (MILCON) budgets for the Air Force Reserve; as well as managing the
Full-Time Support Program, and submitting an annual report to Congress on the state of the Air
Force Reserve and the ability of the Air Force Reserve to meet its missions. In carrying out
these responsibilities, the staffs at the Command, the Reserve Personnel Center, and HQ
USAF/RE must collectively plan, direct, coordinate, and review financial programs as part of the
larger planning, programming, budgeting, and execution environment within the Air Force and
AFRCI65-602 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                         3


Department of Defense. This responsibility is accomplished first by delegating budgeting
responsibilities for specific areas of financial requirements to designated staff agencies (resource
managers) and secondly, by appointing committees to coordinate the efforts of the staff and
recommend actions to the commander. The role of financial management is to be the honest
broker--estimating the cost of Air Force Reserve programs, developing budget estimates and
financial policies, guiding and directing budget justifications, and advising the commander on
the administration of all available appropriated funds. Participatory financial management
includes the use of resource advisors in each responsibility center and a financial management
and working committee structure to advise and assist the commander in the decision-making
process. The Air Force Reserve Command’s Corporate Structure (AFRC CS) relies on HQ
USAF/RE and HQ AFRC/FM to render objective advice on matters dealing with financial
requirements and resource allocation. To this end, HQ USAF/RE and HQ AFRC/FM sit as
independent advisors to the AFRC CS at the Group, Board and Council levels assisting the
managers by assuring fiduciary accounting and control of obligations and providing expense data
through the accounting system. Both obligation and expense data are important because each
involves distinct, but related aspects of financial management.
2. Command FMB Membership. The command FMB voting membership is made up of the
Commander as the chairperson, Vice Commander as the alternate chairperson, NAF/CCs, HQ
ARPC/CC, HQ USAF/RE Deputy, and HQ AFRC/FM. The advisory members of the FMB are
the AFRC and HQ USAF/RE directorates and staff agencies who serve as agents of the
commander. Voting and advisory members are shown in Attachment 2.
   2.1. Responsibilities of Members. Members consider the needs of the entire Air Force
   Reserve rather than only those of their functional areas. The major responsibilities of each
   functional area are shown at Attachment 4. In carrying out these responsibilities, members
   need to:
       2.1.1. Check and validate all command FWG financial recommendations to ensure
       consideration of all command requirements and policies.
       2.1.2. Resolve problems when the command FWG has not been able to reach
       coordinated solutions.
       2.1.3. Establish program trade-offs when available resources are insufficient to cover
       total needs.
       2.1.4. Direct other financial management actions to the command FWG as necessary.
   2.2. Scheduling. The chairperson calls meetings, at a minimum, four times per fiscal year
   (FY). (See Attachment 5.) Additional meetings may be called at the discretion of the
   chairperson. The Director of Financial Management (FM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/REC, should make arrangements for these meetings. The FM staff conducts an FMB
   pre-brief for the AFRC/CV.
   2.3. Recorder Services:
       2.3.1. Core agenda items are reflected in Attachment 7. Any changes to the core agenda
       should be provided to the members at least 3 days before each meeting.
       2.3.2. HQ AFRC/FMA records, publishes, and distributes the minutes of FMB meetings
       and provides each member a copy.
 4                                                                AFRCI65-602 3 AUGUST 2012


3. Command FWG Membership. The command FWG is subordinate to the command FMB
and is made up of the AFRC Vice Commander as the chairperson, Director of Staff, HQ
USAF/RE directors, NAF/CVs, ARPC/CV, and AFRC directorates and staff agencies who serve
as agents of the Commander. The advisory members of the FWG are the HQ USAF/RE division
chiefs, command resource advisors, AFRC Corporate Structure (AFRC CS) panel chairs, and
NAF and ARPC/FMs. Voting and advisory members are shown in Attachment 3.
     3.1. Responsibilities of Members. Members need to look at the broad spectrum of command
     requirements rather than their own functional areas. In carrying out the primary functions of
     financial management, members should:
        3.1.1. Review USAF program guidance related to the AFRC mission.
        3.1.2. Validate requirements of functional area financial managers for submission in the
        annual financial plan.
        3.1.3. Prepare proposed funding distribution based on approved programs ensuring the
        best possible balance between total dollar needs and availability. The working group
        recommends distribution of funds by category.
        3.1.4. Provide the command FMB with budget estimates, program costs, fund
        distribution proposals, and status of approved programs for its review and action.
        3.1.5. Perform other duties as directed by the command FMB.
     3.2. Meetings and Agenda. The chairperson calls meetings, at a minimum, four times per
     FY. The core agenda items are reflected in Attachment 7. FMA provides any changes to
     the core agenda items, in writing, to each member at least three workdays before the meeting.
     If a member is unable to attend, he or she designates an alternate who is authorized to act for
     and commit his or her staff agency in recommendations to the command FMB.
     3.3. MAJCOM Financial Analysis Officer Responsibilities:
        3.3.1. Develops budgets and financial plans for appropriations according to instructions
        from higher authority and with the advice of appropriate staff.
        3.3.2. Distributes the budget authorities (with staff participation).
        3.3.3. Helps subordinate organizations with programs and funding.
        3.3.4. Plans and continuously evaluates subordinate organizations' programs to
        determine:
            3.3.4.1. Actual accomplishments versus planned programs.
            3.3.4.2. Availability of resources to meet the rest of approved objectives.
            3.3.4.3. Areas in which you need to reprogram to meet plans.
            3.3.4.4. Effect on funding of proposed mission program changes and reprogramming
            actions.
        3.3.5. Advises the staff on results of analyses and makes appropriate recommendations.
        3.3.6. Adjusts the financial plan according to revised objectives, and when necessary,
        submits narrative justification for increased or decreased requirements.

      3.3.14. Advises and assists the comptroller in developing and implementing a
      comprehensive financial plan.
      3.3.15. Records, publishes, and distributes minutes of FWG meetings and provides each
      member a copy.
   3.4. Commanders’ Responsibilities. We encourage representatives of the Numbered Air
   Force Commanders (NAF/CC), the Air Reserve Personnel Center Commander (ARPC/CC),
   Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC), and Headquarters United States Air
   Force Reserve staff (HQ USAF/RE), to discuss issues with the FM staff, if necessary,
   following the FWG, but prior to the FMB, to address any major areas of concern.
   3.5. NAF Financial Advisors’ Responsibilities. Each NAF financial advisor should establish
   and maintain an integrated financial management system (for subordinate units) that is used
   to analyze financial management data and ensure effective development and execution of
   financial programs. The NAF financial advisors should attend the FWG, meet with their
   NAF/CC, identify any areas of concern prior to CCs meeting with HQ AFRC/FM staff, and
   attend the command FMB. The NAF financial advisors are the chief advisors to the
   NAF/CCs concerning their unit's financial matters.
4. Processing/Approving Changes Between Scheduled Command FWG/FMB meetings:
   4.1. If changes to command financial programs are required between scheduled meetings,
   members should submit a memorandum to HQ AFRC/FMAO/FMAR detailing complete
   justification for the unfunded requirement. The justification needs to include alternate
   funding methods explored and suggested source for funding. If a Snowflake is required, HQ
   AFRC/FM will submit the requirement to AFRC/CV, who recommends approval/disapproval
   to the commander, AFRC/CC.
 6                                                                AFRCI65-602 3 AUGUST 2012


     4.2. If the staff request is approved, the originating office provides AFRC/FMA with a copy
     of the approval package. AFRC/FMA realigns funding within 10 working days of receipt of
     the approved package.
5. Additional Financial Management Responsibilities. The AFR staffs shown in
Attachments 2 and 3 include the membership of both the command FMB and FWG and
constitutes the minimum framework of AFRC financial management. The following additional
responsibilities apply to the staff offices listed in Attachment 4:
     5.1. According to AFI 65-601, Vol 2, Budget Management for Operations, and Resource
     Management System (RMS) objectives, all staff offices listed are required to appoint a
     Command Resource Advisor to monitor command-wide funds in their functional area. This
     person is the liaison with AFRC/FMA and assists in the formulation of the budget. The chief
     of each AFRC staff office provides the name of the Command Resource Advisor, in writing,
     to AFRC/FMA upon initial appointment and as changes occur. The Command Resource
     Advisor ensures all actions accomplished are coordinated on/or signed at the applicable
     directorate level. The Command Resource Advisor:
        5.1.1. Reviews and validates/updates budget estimates that have been submitted by field
        units in their functional areas.
        5.1.2. Works with FMA on processing changes in requirements during the execution
        phase of the budget.
        5.1.3. Coordinates on e-mails/memos emanating from FMA, or any applicable staff
        function, to applicable field units which recommend/direct changes in funding policy
        associated to the Command Resource Advisor's area of responsibility.
     5.2. Each applicable AFRC staff function is responsible for all known program changes,
     conversions, etc., even though the affected units may not be fully informed. All actions
     which impact AFRC funds should be budgeted for in command financial plans. The
     AFRC/Financial Analysis Operation and Maintenance Branch (FMAO) for O&M and the
     AFRC Financial Analysis Reserve Personnel Appropriations Branch (FMAR) for RPA, and
     for all other appropriations should be notified as early as possible whenever unbudgeted or
     unfunded requirements surface.
        5.2.1. The command FWG reviews requirements and makes recommendations to the
        FMB.       Except as provided for in paragraph 4., the FMB reviews and
        approves/disapproves funding of new requirements and determines the source of funding
        or reprogramming actions.
     5.3. Appointment as a Command Resource Advisor or membership in either the command
     FMB or FWG does not confer the authority to directly authorize or approve the obligation of
     funds.
     5.4. Authority to certify availability of funds is vested solely in the host accounting office or
     persons designated by that office.
     5.5. Except as provided for in paragraph 4.1, the command FMB determines the distribution
     of funds to Air Force Reserve activities.
6. AFRC Command Programs. The Director of Staff (DS) chairs the Resource Management
Board (RMB) and is responsible for the OBANs identified in paragraphs 6 and 7. Depending
AFRCI65-602 3 AUGUST 2012                                                                     7


upon specific requirements, these OBANs will execute funds from a variety of appropriations
and are generally under the direct supervision of the Chief, Operation and Maintenance Branch
within HQ AFRC/FMA. Attachment 8 is a sample list of Command Programs and their OPRs.
   6.1. The OBAN Manager or Financial Analysis Officer coordinates with their specific
   Resource Advisor (RA) to identify program requirements, and communicate these
   requirements to HQ AFRC/FMAO/FMAR for inclusion in the Command’s financial plans.
   Additionally, the OBAN manager assists the RA in the timely execution of their programs.
   The specific procedures and processes used to execute these programs are covered in the AFI
   65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
       6.1.1. 6251 – Command Unique Programs: Executes programs that are centrally
       managed and funded, which may be applicable to several or all AFRC units. These
       requirements include, but are not limited to, environmental compliance/conservation, C-5
       simulator training, insurance/indemnities, and the Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve
       Test Center (AATC).
       6.1.2. 6256 – Reserve System Requirements: Executes AFRC’s Distributed Mission
       Operations (DMO) to include the F-16 Multi-Task Trainers and F-16 Training Support
       System (TRSS), A-10 Full Mission Trainers, C-5 Weapon System Trainers, C-130 H2 ad
       H3 simulators, as well as support for the Distributed Training Operations Center. The
       program management responsibilities for these requirements normally reside in HQ
       AFRC/A3TR.
       6.1.3. 629J – Command Information Technology Procurement: Executes Command
       Information Technology requirements as approved by the Command Chief Information
       Officer (CIO) Board, to include personnel computer technical refresh, software licensing,
       other command and control system buys, and automated data processing equipment
       (ADPE) maintenance and support. The program management responsibilities for these
       requirements normally reside in HQ AFRC/A6X.
       6.1.4. 629K – Command-sponsored PCS (AGRs/ARTs) and MEPS Recruiting
       Support: Executes the cost associated with command-sponsored permanent change of
       station (PCS) for Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART)
       personnel, as well as the Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) program.
       Requirements for these programs are in HQ AFRC/A1C/RS.
       6.1.5. 629N – HQ AFRC Support and Miscellaneous Appropriations: Executes
       command programs not specifically identified to other OBANs.
7. HQ AFRC Account (OBAN 95):
   7.1. Each AFRC staff office monitors costs related to operation of its functional area in the
   AFRC headquarters. These costs and related funding are collected in the HQ AFRC account
   (OBAN 95). OBAN 95 executes requirements supporting the HQ AFRC staff, the Force
   Generation Center (FGC), and the following units: 94 APS, 622 ASTS, 55 CBCS, and 622
   FSS. These requirements include: estimating staff TDY requirements, management of
   approved TDY dollars, and all other costs relating to day-to-day operations of the applicable
   HQ AFRC office.
8                                                               AFRCI65-602 3 AUGUST 2012


    7.2. Each director and head of special staff office (responsibility center manager) that does
    not personally monitor his or her financial program should appoint an RA to perform the
    above tasks. Provide the name of the RA, in writing, to AFRC/FMAH upon initial
    appointment and as changes occur. (RAs for OBAN 95 may or may not be the same as those
    appointed according to paragraph 5.1) Specific RA responsibilities are contained in AFI 65-
    601, Vol 2, Budget Management for Operations. It is critical that directors are kept abreast
    of their operation and maintenance (O&M) budgets. Responsibility Center Managers (RCM)
    must work closely with their appointed RA, who is their liaison with the HQ AFRC budget
    staff. All correspondence regarding financial plans, operating budget submissions; AF
    Forms 9, Request for Purchase; AF Forms 616, Fund Cite Authorization; DD Forms 448,
    Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request; reprogramming actions, etc., must be signed
    or coordinated on by the directors or assistants.
8. Resource Management Board (RMB):
    8.1. AFPD 65-6 requires that commanders at all levels establish and maintain financial
    management structures to determine funding priorities, to approve financial plans, and to
    ensure that funding resources are allocated and executed legally, effectively, and efficiently.
    Therefore, the centrally managed command programs and the headquarters account (OBAN
    95) are managed through a different board called the Resource Management Board (RMB) to
    differentiate from the MAJCOM Financial Management Board (FMB). The Resource
    Management Board (RMB) is chaired by the Director of Staff (DS) and includes heads of
    each staff agency and/or their appointed RAs (Attachment 9). They should meet at least
    once each fiscal quarter to plan and review financial programs relating to the command
    programs and headquarters account. The chairperson should notify members of the meetings
    and provide an agenda at least three workdays before the meeting. Specific responsibilities
    of the board are:
    8.2. Validate annual and quarterly requirements for submission to HQ AFRC/FMA and
    inclusion in the AFRC command budget.
    8.3. Validate distribution of funding authorization by element of expense/investment code
    (EEIC) based on approved program.
    8.4. Review status of funds, approve funds realignment actions, and validate and set up
    priorities for unfunded requirements to be submitted to AFRC/FMAO/FMAR for review by
    the Command FWG and FMB.
    8.5. Recorder Services. HQ AFRC/FMAH records, publishes, and distributes minutes of
    RMB meetings and provides a copy to each member.
    8.6. Training. HQ AFRC/FMAH and Budget Officers for Command OBANs provide initial
    resource management training to newly appointed RAs and follow-on training to all members
    as required.
