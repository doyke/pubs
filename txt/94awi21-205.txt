This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures for the safe handling and
subsequent inspection requirements for aircraft that have been subjected to a wheel/brake fire
and overheat occurrence in accordance with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management and T.O. 1C-130H-1, Flight Manual and is applicable to all aircraft that operate on
the Dobbins ARB, GA ramp. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’ s chain
of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with the Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document was revised to change the OPR from 94 MXG/MXQ to 94 AMXS/MXA, to add
600 feet for personnel and equipment evacuation distance if munitions is on board affected
aircraft to para 1.2 and 2.1 and to align the instruction’s wording with new emergency response
terminology.
1. Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of all 94 AW Maintenance and Operations personnel
that discover a hot brake condition to respond and determine the necessary action. Hot brake
procedures should be implemented upon notification from aircrew that a hot brake condition
exists or upon discovery of hot brakes by maintenance personnel. No ground personnel will

enter an aircraft’s safety zone when hot brakes are declared until cleared by the Incident
Commander.
     1.1. Every effort should be made to get the aircraft to the hot brakes area with the fire
     department standing by until brakes have cooled for at least 30 minutes.
     1.2. SET THE APPROPRIATE PARKING BRAKE ONLY and/or chock the nose wheel
     and evacuate the immediate area. Equipment and personnel should be at least 300 feet (600
     feet if munitions/pyrotechnics on board) from either side of wheel as a safety precaution
     against possible explosive failure of the tire or wheel.
     1.3. If notified of hot brakes while taxiing, aircrew should taxi to the nearest hot brake pad
     IAW Dobbins ARB 13-201 and stop the aircraft. If hot brakes are found after aircraft has
     been parked, the aircraft will be left in position. In a congested area, consideration must be
     given to the evacuation of nearby personnel and aircraft in the event of fire or tire failure.
     1.4. Overheated wheels and brakes will be cooled before towing or taxiing aircraft. The
     Dobbins ARB Fire Department will confirm cooling with thermal imaging and/or heat
     sensors. In the interest of safety, forced air cooling of aircraft brakes is not recommended.
     1.5. Maintenance Operation Center (MOC): Will initiate MOC checklist titled Hot Brakes
     making sure to document the following information: aircraft serial number, location, aircraft
     configuration, date and time. The MOC will coordinate equipment for the aircraft as required
     and notify appropriate personnel as required on checklist.
     1.6. The Senior Fire Officer assumes Incident Command of the situation whenever a ground
     emergency is declared. The senior maintenance person on site will coordinate with the
     Incident Commander as required.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. Procedures for suspected hot brakes found by maintenance at parking ramp: suspend
     maintenance, evacuate personnel 300 feet (600 feet if munitions/pyrotechnics on board) from
     suspected hot brake aircraft, and chock nose gear. Notify the MOC providing aircraft
     location, munitions and fuel on board and monitor the affected aircraft wheel and tire for 30
     minutes. Allow time for heat to build up to its maximum for melting fuse plugs which melt
     at 390 degrees Fahrenheit. Notify the Dobbins ARB Fire Department.
     2.2. If the tire deflates do the following: Notify the fire department and notify the MOC. Do
     not tow the aircraft and remain clear of the aircraft and adjacent aircraft until the Dobbins
     ARB Fire Department terminates emergency. NOTE: Ensure that minimum personnel are
     exposed to the explosive area of an aircraft with a hot brake condition. Do not approach
     landing gear from either side; approach only from the front or rear. Do not use fire
     extinguishers on hot brakes. Do not move aircraft for at least 30 minutes after brakes have
     cooled. The Dobbins ARB Fire Department will confirm cooling with thermal imaging/heat
     sensor.

  T.O. 4W-1-61.
