This instruction implements AFPD 25-2, Support Agreements, dated 01 November 2001, by
detailing support agreements procedures within the Air Force. DoDI 4000.19 governs
Interservice and Intragovernmental Support. The financial management aspects of Air Force
Support are covered in AFI 65-601. Support to civilian authorities is covered in AFI 10-802. Air
Force and DoD Policy directs that support agreements be developed between suppliers and
receivers within the affected organizations to document recurring day-to-day peacetime support
in order to provide unit commanders with the capability to ensure resources are expended wisely
and to help eliminate unnecessary resource duplication. This instruction does not cover
international agreements or the administration of contracts. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-
123, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records

(AFSOC) This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures. This supplement implements AFPD 25-2,
Support Agreements under which it is being published. It establishes and provides guidance and
procedures for Support Agreement Managers (SAMs) at all levels of the command to negotiate,
coordinate and document recurring day-to-day peacetime support. It applies to all active Air
Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) units and does not apply to Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the Air
Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision revises and/or clarifies Civil Engineering (CE), Security Forces (SF) and Staff
Judge Advocate (SJA) reviews during Support Agreement (SA) routing. It identifies early
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance. It authorizes electronic and digital
signatures as an approved method to sign agreements and eliminates the triennial review
requirement. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

(AFSOC) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Major changes include adding specific guidance and procedures for developing Executive
Agreements (EAs); Chapter 6 (Added).

                                           Chapter 1

                 AGREEMENTS—PURPOSE, TYPE, AND AUTHORITY

1.1. Support Agreements Covered by DD Form 1144.
   1.1.1. Support agreements administered by the Air Force are normally documented on DD
   Form
   1144 fall into the following principal categories:
   Air Force to Air Force, known as Intraservice Agreements (to include Air Force Reserve
   Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG)).
   Air Force to other Service or DoD components, known as Interservice Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-DoD Federal activities, known as Intragovernmental Agreements.
   Air Force to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or commercial enterprises.
   1.1.2. To ensure the maintenance of a comprehensive logistics record, all significant
   recurring support provided by the Air Force shall be recorded on DD Form 1144, whether
   reimbursable or non-reimbursable. Also, record all such support on DD Form 1144 when the
   Air Force is the receiver.
   1.1.3. Policy and procedures for Interservice, Intragovernmental and Air Force to non-
   Federal activities are governed by the DoDI 4000.19. In addition, the DoDI 4000.19 provides
   general guidance for the administration of support agreements within the DoD community.
   1.1.4. Conflict with Other Guidance. Information in agreements will not supersede any other
   DoD or Air Force directive or instruction that has instructional details of functional area
   support. The agreement itself should not prescribe detailed procedures for performing any
   particular support function. Such guidance is usually in other DoD or Air Force directives,
   instructions, manuals, etc., which apply to the particular type of support being performed.
   See Attachment 6 for examples. If such information is not in the DoD or Air Force directive
   in enough detail for local use, a local-level operational procedure/directive should be
   prepared and referenced in the agreement.
   1.1.5. (Added-AFSOC) An agreement between AFSOC units is not required unless
   otherwise deemed necessary by the supplier’s commander.
   1.1.6. (Added-AFSOC) Agreements must support and conform to the provisions of the
   Memorandum of Agreement between the Air Force and the United States Special Operations
   Command.
1.2. Memorandums of Agreement/Understanding (MOA/MOUs).
   1.2.1. Most MOAs and MOUs are used to define areas of broad agreement between two or
   more parties. MOAs are memorandums that define general areas of conditional agreement
   between two or more parties – the actions of the other party depend on what the other party
   does (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials).
   MOUs are memorandums that define general areas of understanding between two or more
   parties – explains what each party plans to do; however, what each party does is not
 6                                                       AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005


     dependent on the actions of the other party (e.g., does not require reimbursement or other
     support from receiver).
     1.2.2. MAJCOM/Numbered Air Force (NAF) Level MOA/MOUs. Most internal Air Force
     MOA/ MOUs are broad agreements between or among MAJCOMs or NAFs to identify
     parameters for developing support agreements between subordinate units. At the installation
     level, these MOA/MOUs are then used as a source document in addressing the provision of
     services, funding and reimbursement arrangements. However, the actual transfer of funds or
     other resources is effected by the relevant established functional procedure and not by
     MOA/MOUs alone.
     1.2.3. Functional Area MOA/MOUs. MOA/MOUs can be used between functional areas to
     docu-ment mutually agreed areas of responsibility, such as:
                • Statement of facts.
                • Intentions.
                • Procedures.
                • Policies for future actions.
     The functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) (e.g. Civil Engineers, Security
     Forces) will usually draft, sign and maintain these documents, which are procedural or
     technical in nature and will not initiate the obligation of funds or manpower for recurring
     support.
     1.2.4. (Added-AFSOC) Command level MOA/MOU(s) will be initiated and accomplished
     by the specific directorate concerned and coordinated with the AFSOC OPR, HQ
     AFSOC/A4RX. Functional OPRs at the MAJCOM level who develop MOU/MOA(s) are
     responsible for ensuring the document is marked with an effective date upon being signed.
     They will maintain and review it for validity as specified in the agreement. Finalized
     MOA/MOU(s) and subsequent updates will be coordinated as required and provided in a
     timely manner via e-mail to HQ AFSOC/A4RX (afsoc.a4rx@hurlburt.af.mil).
     1.2.5. (Added-AFSOC) Installation level MOA/MOU(s) will be initiated and accomplished
     by the specific functional area(s) concerned and coordinated with the installation SAM.
     Functional OPRs at the installation level who develop MOU/MOA(s) are responsible for
     ensuring the document is marked with an effective date upon being signed. The functional
     OPR will maintain and review it for validity as specified in the agreement. Updates will be
     coordinated as required and provided in a timely manner to the installation SAM in the
     format requested. Note: IAW DODI 4000.19, support should not be reoccurring in nature.
     1.2.6. (Added-AFSOC) MOA/MOU(s) must support and conform to the provisions of the
     Memorandum of Agreement between the Air Force and the United States Special Operations
     Command.
1.3. Major Range and Test Facility Bases.
     1.3.1. DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base, covers certain specialized range
     documentation. However, base support provided to range users should still be covered by a
     standard support agreement.

1.4. Support That Does Not Fall Under DoDI 4000.19 or This Instruction.
   1.4.1. Support to DoD contractors. If base support is required beyond what is identified in a
   Request for Proposal (RFP) or contract, the offerer or contractor formally requests the
   specified base support be incorporated into the RFP or contract. The request is submitted to
   the Contracting Officer who issued the contract or RFP. If the Contracting Officer agrees to
   the request, then it is documented in a contract not a support agreement. MOAs, MOUs or
   Support Agreements will not be used to amend or change contracts.
   1.4.2. Agreements In Lieu of War or Contingency Plans. Support agreements are not a
   suitable means to document support for war, Operations Other Than War (OOTW) or
   exercise requirements, which should be documented in the appropriate plan (e.g.
   support/operational/ deployment plans).
   1.4.3. Does not apply to agreements covering grants, international agreements, commercial
   activities, or acquisitions under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
1.5. (Added-AFSOC) Mutual Aid Agreements (MAAs).
   1.5.1. (Added-AFSOC) Installation level Mutual Aid Agreements. MAAs are defined as
   aid agreements and assistance agreements between agencies, organizations, and jurisdictions
   that provide a mechanism to quickly obtain emergency assistance in the form of personnel,
   equipment, materials, and other associated services. This includes Medical, Fire and
   Emergency Services, Security Forces, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and Emergency
   Management support.
      1.5.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) MAAs will be initiated and accomplished by the specific
      functional area(s) concerned and coordinated using the same staffing processes used by
      the installation SAM for other support agreements. OPRs will ensure requirements
      specific to functional AFIs are included and all agreements meet the requirements of and
      are in compliance with AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities.
      1.5.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) The MAA will contain a cover (refer to attachment 2 for an
      example); opening statement (refer to attachment 3 for an example); and a Subject;
      Purpose, Summary of Responsibilities, Effective Date, Review and Termination Plan,
      and signature blocks. Other optional components of the MAA include a table of contents
      and annexes necessary to accomplish the objective. The opening statement will be signed
      by the commanders of the elements participating in the agreement. All new MAAs will
      comply with this format and legacy or existing MAAs will comply with this format
      during the next revision, not to exceed 24 months from the current publication date.

   which would violate AFI 25-201, IC paragraph 2.7.3, the National Environmental Policy Act
   (NEPA) or EIAP.
   2.7.3. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
       2.7.3.1. Compliance with NEPA is an integral part of basing. Prior to making a final
       decision, NEPA’s implementing regulations prohibit the commitment of resources which
       will prejudice the selection of alternatives, and also prohibit taking any action which
       would have an adverse impact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable
       alternatives.
       2.7.3.2. Prior to basing at an installation that would be the subject of a request for
       support agreement, the proponent of the action (i.e., proposed tenant) is responsible for
       evaluating a full range of reasonable alternatives consistent with NEPA, the President’s
       Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the Procedural
       Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR §§1500-1508), and the Air Force’s EIAP, 32 CFR 989.
       2.7.3.3. When a non-Air Force proponent wants to use an Air Force installation (or
       portions thereof) for their own proposed action, the EIAP regulation at 32 CFR 989.7,
       Request from non-Air Force agencies of entities (among others) must be followed.
   2.7.4. (Added-AFSOC) The SAM will coordinate all agreements through the installation
   civil engineer squadron to ensure all engineering and real property concerns are addressed in
   the support agreement.
2.8. Installation Security Forces (SF).
   2.8.1. SF will conduct all required reviews, focused on security concerns (force protection,
   resource protection, weapon system security, information security, industrial security,
   weapon storage, law enforcement and related security services) and will coordinate on the
   SA during the initial review cycle. Additional reviews are only required if issues (security
   concerns) arise during the review process. The review of SA will be completed by the SF
   FAAC. An additional signature from the Security Forces Squadron Commander (or
   Commander designate) is not required on the DD Form 1144.
2.9. Installation Staff Judge Advocate (SJA).

                           SEEKING SUPPORT AND WAIVERS

3.1. Seeking Support.
   3.1.1. Circumstances which may cause commanders to seek support include:
      3.1.1.1. Additions to existing role or mission.
      3.1.1.2. Unplanned loss of an existing source of support (e.g. natural disaster).
      3.1.1.3. Similar or identical functions being duplicated by nearby DoD components or
      other federal agencies.
      3.1.1.4. Improved economy or efficiency of operation.
      3.1.1.5. The closest Air Force installation to an Air Force GSU should provide base
      support, regardless of parent MAJCOM.
      3.1.1.6. Consolidation of functions.
      3.1.1.7. Base Realignment and Closure.
      3.1.1.8. AFELMs, which need Air Force-unique support, that non-Air Force suppliers
      cannot provide (e.g. Military Personnel Flight Services, USAF unique uniform)
3.2. Development of Support Agreements.
   3.2.1. Air Force organizations will develop support agreements with receivers of that
   support. The following general rules apply:
      3.2.1.1. An agreement should normally cover only one receiver, but more than one
      receiver can be included if they are funded from the same source as long as the funding
      source, as identified in Block 11c, is the same.
      3.2.1.2. Separate agreements are required for each different supplier.
      3.2.1.3. If two organizations both supply and receive support to and from each other,
      then separate agreements should be developed.
      3.2.1.4. Air Force organizations should provide support to other Air Force or DoD
      organizations when requested, subject to the commander’s determination that the
      organization has the capability to do so without jeopardizing assigned missions.
      3.2.1.5. The support provided to receivers should be equivalent to the standard level of
      support defined and furnished by the supplier to its own mission, unless otherwise
      requested or agreed to by the receiver.
      3.2.1.6. The provision of small-scale recurring support may not always justify the
      administrative effort and expense of preparing a full support agreement. In such cases,
      the agreement approving authority may waive the need to prepare a formal agreement but
      SAMs should still retain a written record of details to ensure continuity for the
      arrangement.
 16                                                    AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005


      3.2.1.7. (Added-AFSOC) Approval of the support agreement will not be delayed
      awaiting actual transfer of manpower authorizations.
      3.2.1.8. (Added-AFSOC) Pen and ink changes to the agreement, (i.e., unit designation
      change, etc.) are not considered a significant change that would affect the specific
      support provided. The revised DD Form 1144 must be filed on top of the initial or
      subsequent DD Form 1144. Pen and ink changes to correct or effect minor changes to an
      agreement are acceptable providing the Supplier and/or Receiver indicate concurrence in
      writing. All pen and ink changes must be incorporated in the next review/revision.
   3.2.2. MAJCOMs need to ensure the AFRC and the ANG receive the same level of support
   as other Air Force tenant organizations on their installations. This includes but is not limited
   to:
      3.2.2.1. Base level support services
      3.2.2.2. Annual tours
      3.2.2.3. Unit training assemblies
      3.2.2.4. Peacetime training in all areas
      3.2.2.5. Weekend operations
3.3. Waivers to Support.
   3.3.1. Requests for a waiver to permit duplication of support functions are appropriate if:
      3.3.1.1. It is more economical
      3.3.1.2. Provision of support is physically impractical
      3.3.1.3. Wartime requirements dictate duplication of facilities or functions
   3.3.2. ANG and AFRC receivers do not require a duplication waiver if their requirement is
   based on a wartime mission of their gaining MAJCOM.
   3.3.3. To obtain a waiver, the receiving MAJCOM should send a waiver request to the
   supplying MAJCOM, including confirmation of whether or not the receiving MAJCOM
   accepts responsibility for the financial and manpower costs of supporting the waiver. The
   receiving MAJCOM then requests the waiver from HQ USAF/ILGC. If approved, the waiver
   will normally be valid for three years and a copy of it should be attached to the relevant
   support agreement.

             SUPPORT AGREEMENT DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES

4.1. Identifying the Requirement.
   4.1.1. The potential receiver identifies support requirements to the proposed supplier by
   official correspondence and if possible, sets up a face-to-face meeting to clarify respective
   requirements and capabilities, including mission, equipment types, and personnel. Typical
   questions to be resolved include:
       4.1.1.1. How will the potential receiver request support from the supplier?
       4.1.1.2. Who will receive the support?
       4.1.1.3. What type and level of support will be required?
       4.1.1.4. Are there non-standard conditions related to the request for support?
       4.1.1.5. What is the objective or mission supported?
       4.1.1.6. When will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.7. Have all support categories been considered?
       4.1.1.8. Where will the support be provided?
       4.1.1.9. Does the receiver have any contracts with contractors where the government has
       agreed to provide base support?
       4.1.1.10. Does the receiver have an existing Requirements Contract that precludes
       supplier from providing requested support or duplicate services already provided in the
       contract?
   4.1.2. Any doubts as to exactly what support is needed must be clarified before the support
   agreement is approved.
4.2. Drafting - Support Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. The SAM ensures population, equipment, and aircraft requiring support are identified
   and defined.
   4.2.2. The supplier SAM prepares a draft agreement to identify support, using the support
   category listings found in Enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19 and Attachment 5 to this AFI.
   Categories not included in previously cited references must be approved by MAJCOM.
   4.2.3. All affected parties, including the receiver and supplier’s functional areas should
   review and coordinate the draft agreement. SAMs should ensure that their FAACs fully
   understand the implications of the agreement in their respective areas and note that questions
   on the capability to support the receivers are best coordinated directly between FAACs and
   receivers.
   4.2.4. SAMs should ensure that all attachments to support agreements are listed in Block 11
   of the DD Form 1144.
 18                                                    AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005


   4.2.5. The SAM ensures specific provisions in all support agreements are identified and
   defined.
4.3. Drafting - Financial Responsibilities.
   4.3.1. The local FM assists support providers in identifying what the receiver pays for,
   including its basis and estimated reimbursements, on the DD Form 1144 and its funding
   annex (See Attchment 9 – Support Agreement Reimbursement Matrix).
   4.3.2. FM and DFAS organizations will detail all costs billed to the receiver to include the
   following:
       4.3.2.1. Relevant support categories.
       4.3.2.2. Computation details of the reimbursables.
       4.3.2.3. Frequency of billing (e.g. monthly, quarterly, or annually).
   4.3.3. Interservice and Intragovernmental receivers will normally be charged for direct
   incremental costs only, as per DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6. Reimbursement policy for
   intraservice agreements is covered by AFI 65-601, Volume I.
   4.3.4. Local FM personnel will record all reimbursement computations in sufficient detail to
   provide an audit trail by clearly documenting computation methods, factor sources, and
   results. In addition, the Funding Annex should include sufficient documentation to satisfy the
   financial concerns of the receiver. The Funding Annex must include program element code,
   any statutory limitations applicable to the program element code, funds expiration date for
   obligated purpose, method of reimbursement, method of recording obligations, and name and
   phone number of the originator of the document.
   4.3.5. Reimbursement should be understood to mean the transfer of funds from one agency
   to another, not the exchange of services.
   4.3.6. Note that non-standard rules apply to certain ’Providers of Public Goods or Services’,
   ’Mutual Benefits’ and other specific exceptions, as detailed at Attachment 6.
   4.3.7. If current Air Force standard base level accounting systems do not directly correlate
   identification of incurred expenses with the support categories outlined in DoDI 4000.19,
   then estimation of anticipated reimbursements should be based on:
       4.3.7.1. General and specific provisions of the agreement.
       4.3.7.2. Reasonable projections of required levels and amounts of support.
       4.3.7.3. Generally accepted cost analysis techniques and principles.
4.4. Drafting - Manpower and Organization Responsibilities.
   4.4.1. The installation Manpower and Organization Flight identifies required manpower in
   the manpower annex to support the additional workload. (Suggested format in Attachment
   8)
   4.4.2. The manpower annex will detail the following:
       4.4.2.1. Computation method.
       4.4.2.2. Man-hour or manpower impact by functional area/support category.
AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005                                                                 19


      4.4.2.3. Total manpower impact in whole numbers.
   4.4.3. Current Air Force Functional Account Codes and Air Force Manpower Standards do
   not correlate to support categories in DoDI 4000.19. Manpower impacts will be based on:
      4.4.3.1. Specific provision of the agreement.
      4.4.3.2. Air Force Manpower Standards.
      4.4.3.3. Management engineering methods (technical estimates, good operator timing,
      position manning, operational audits, etc).
   4.4.4. The man-hours required to support the additional workload will be totaled and the
   manpower will be computed using the Man-hour Availability Factor. The Manpower and
   Organization Flight will document and maintain on file all computations in sufficient detail
   to provide an audit trail of required manpower.
   4.4.5. Interservice Support Agreements causing a manpower impact need to be worked
   between the Manpower staffs of Headquarters Air Force and the affected service.
4.5. Contract Provided Support.
   4.5.1. When a receiving unit requests support that is provided to the supplier via a base
   support contract, a formal support agreement is necessary. Base contract support costs are
   reimbursable IAW DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6 and AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, as applicable.
   4.5.2. Each functional category provided by a base contractor will be documented in broad,
   general terms IAW enclosure 6 to DoDI 4000.19, or Attachment 5 to this AFI, or the
   supplier’s support capability catalog.
   4.5.3. Neither specific reference to the supporting contract number nor detailed wording
   contained in the contract will be included.
   4.5.4. Receiving activity requests for changes in support must be routed through the SAM
   and forwarded to the appropriate Point of Contact (POC) for contract impact review.
   Contract modification costs resulting from receiving activity requests are the responsibility of
   the receiving activity.
   4.5.5. To prevent the appearance of impropriety, the contractor will not serve as the FAAC
   for the contractor provided support.

                                           Chapter 5

        SUPPORT AGREEMENT PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES

5.1. Preparing and Revising Agreements.
   5.1.1. When a new agreement, revision, review, waiver, or termination is required, SAMs
   should ensure all relevant functional offices are notified and to this end they must retain POC
   details for all offices involved. An agreements processing flow chart for the process is at
   Figure 5.1.
   5.1.2. When there is a procedural conflict among MAJCOMs, the supplier MAJCOM
   procedures will take precedence, as long as the supplier MAJCOM procedures do not
   significantly impact the receiver’s mission.
5.2. Coordination.
   5.2.1. Coordination guidelines are as follows:
      5.2.1.1. SAMs produce the initial or revised draft of an agreement and then ensure it is
      coordinated in writing by all parties concerned (See Attachment 7).
      5.2.1.2. SAMs staff the agreement to Manpower, Financial Management, the Staff Judge
      Advocate (SJA), the Environmental Planning Function, and Security Forces for
      coordination and DD Form 1144 continuation statements, and signatures, as appropriate.
      However, the JA review will occur after all other coordination comments have been made
      and appropriate changes incorporated. Figure 5.2 shows the manpower review process.
      5.2.1.3. SAMs should check the completed coordination sheets for errors or changes that
      may create an impasse and transfer any amendments into the master draft agreement.
      5.2.1.4. (Added-AFSOC) The SAM will establish timelines to ensure the timely
      coordination of agreements being developed or reviewed.
5.3. Approval and Signatures.
   5.3.1. The SAM:
      5.3.1.1. Prepares a letter to transmit a copy of the final draft support agreement to the
      supplier Comptroller for approval signature.
      5.3.1.2. Prepares a letter transmitting the original agreement to receiver. This letter
      should explain any apparent anomalies and their rationale. If receiver requests further
      changes, then renegotiate the disputed issues and, after legal review of any substantive
      changes, have the approving official sign and return the original agreement.
      5.3.1.3. Obtains final approval signature. Insert the date of Supplier Approving Official’s
      signature in Block 3 (effective date) of the DD Form 1144 unless otherwise stated in
      Block 11.
      5.3.1.4. Determines the number of copies required and forwards them to the parties
      concerned.
      5.3.1.5. Consolidates correspondence and coordination that documents significant
      changes, and retains it for the next review cycle.
AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005                                                               21


       5.3.1.6. Use of electronic and digital signatures on SAs. IAW AFI 33-321, paragraph 4,
       Authorization of Air Force Records, a record is authenticated when it contains an official
       signature or seal indicating the document is genuine and official. A signature or seal may
       be written, stamped, electronic or digital. The guidance contained in AFI 33-321 now
       applies to all SAs.
5.4. Review and Revision of Support Agreements.
   5.4.1. Annual FM Budget Review.
       5.4.1.1. Ensures continued accuracy of estimated reimbursement charges and coincides
       with budget lead-time requirements and Financial Plan preparation.
       5.4.1.2. Does not involve a renegotiation unless there are significant changes in support
       requirements.
       5.4.1.3. Reviews estimated support requirements prior to the annual budget submission.
       A revised Funding Annex (if required), signed by both supplier and receiver FMs, will
       then be forwarded to the SAM to be included as an attachment to the agreement.

NOTE: There is no need to route the agreement through the final approval authorities. Figure
5.3 shows an Annual Budget Review flow chart of the process.
   5.4.2. Triennial Reviews.
       5.4.2.1. Triennial Reviews of Agreements are eliminated. SA reviews are only required
       when there are significant changes in the requested support.
       5.4.2.2. Delete
       5.4.2.3. Delete
       5.4.2.4. Delete
       5.4.2.5. Delete
       5.4.2.6. Delete
   5.4.3. Minor Revisions. Minor pen and ink changes, including non-substantive
   modifications, may be made by mutual agreement provided they do not significantly affect
   manpower or funds.
5.5. Resolving Impasses.
   5.5.1. As a general rule, impasses should be resolved at the lowest possible level and only
   elevated to higher authority when the local negotiation process is exhausted. The following
   rules apply:
       5.5.1.1. If an impasse concerning an overall agreement cannot be resolved between the
       supplier and receiver within a reasonable amount of time, then both SAMs pass details to
       their MAJCOM counterparts for resolution.
       5.5.1.2. If an impasse relating to a specific support category cannot be resolved at
       installation level then both FAACs pass details to their MAJCOM counterparts for
       resolution with copies to their installation SAMs and MAJCOM support agreement
       program managers. Omit the impasse category of support from the support agreement
 22                                                   AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005


      and include the following statement in DD Form 1144, Block 11, and General Provisions
      that ―Due to an impasse in negotiating support for category XXXX, this agreement is
      being processed with an impasse.‖
      5.5.1.3. MAJCOMs should advise HQ USAF/ILGC of any formal impasse outstanding
      for more than 180 days.
      5.5.1.4. Upon resolution of an impasse, correspondence documenting the resolution
      process will become part of the agreement file.
5.6. Reduction, Modification or Termination of Support.
   5.6.1. If an agreement is unilaterally terminated, suspended or significantly modified with
   less than 180 days notice to other parties of the agreement, the unilateral party may be billed
   by affected parties for reimbursement of unavoidable termination or re-procurement expenses
   incurred up to 180 days following the written notification.
   5.6.2. The supplier FAAC will ensure that final charges for support are submitted NLT 90
   days after receipt of notification of termination of support.
   5.6.3. Installation SAMs are to notify HQ USAF/ILGC, through their MAJCOM SAMs,
   prior to the issue of any unilateral termination notice.
5.7. Form Prescribed. DD Form 1144, Support Agreement.

                    PREPARATION OF EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS

6.1. (AFSOC) General. AFSOC commanders and directors are encouraged to cooperate with
other DoD components and government agencies in need of support. Interservice/interagency
support agreements should be utilized when recurring support would benefit the parties without
jeopardizing assigned missions. Executive Agreements (EAs) should be used to define areas of
responsibility or understanding between the supported and supporting parties. Because the
command may incur commitments upon entering into an EA, close staff coordination is required
before initiating outside action. Directorates will staff EAs in accordance with this guidance.
AFSOC EAs are negotiated at the lowest command level practical and signed at the most
appropriate level. Depending on the scope of the agreement, an EA may be prepared as one of
the following categories:
   6.1.1. (AFSOC) Memorandum of Understanding and Memorandum of Agreement
   (MOUs/MOAs). Apply to multiple issues that affect more than one AFSOC directorate and
   are coordinated between AFSOC and other participating commands by HQ AFSOC/A4RX.
   6.1.2. (AFSOC) Letters of Agreement (LOAs). Agreements between individual elements
   of AFSOC and other organizations that are limited in scope will normally be coordinated by
   the corresponding elements. Draft copy of the proposed agreement will be routed to
   AFSOC/A4RX to ensure compatibility with other agreements in effect or proposed.
   6.1.3. (AFSOC) Command        Arrangement    Agreements/International   Agreements
   (CAAs/IAs). Negotiated and signed at the USSOCOM level with input from AFSOC when
   applicable.
   6.1.4. (AFSOC) Interservice Support Agreements (ISAs). Negotiated and documented in
   accordance with AFI 25-201 and DoDI 4000.19.
6.2. (AFSOC) Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. (AFSOC) The Command Support Agreements Manager (SAM). HQ AFSOC/A4RX
   will:
       6.2.1.1. (AFSOC) Monitor agreement requirements and requests and initiate or
       authorize development of EAs to implement directed and authorized command
       relationships.
       6.2.1.2. (AFSOC) Coordinate on EAs developed by other AFSOC staff elements.
       6.2.1.3. (AFSOC) Maintain repository of EAs developed by other AFSOC staff
       agencies.
       6.2.1.4. (AFSOC) Establish a suspense date for EA coordination/publication in
       coordination with staff agencies.
       6.2.1.5. (AFSOC) Publish supplemental MAJCOM guidance to AFI 25-201 and assist
       the staff with EA development.
       6.2.1.6. (AFSOC) Govern the publication of AFSOC EAs and changes.
AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005                                                               29


   6.2.2. (AFSOC) The Agreement Manager. The agreement manager, whether assigned by
   HQ AFSOC/A4RX or other authorized AFSOC staff agency serving as OPR for an EA will:
      6.2.2.1. (AFSOC) Develop the draft opening statement, letter, change, or revision in
      conjunction with appropriate functional staff agencies.
      6.2.2.2. (AFSOC) Conduct a planning conference, if required, to review the draft
      opening statement, and initiate development of supporting staff annexes and scheduled
      actions.
      6.2.2.3. (AFSOC) Ensure all agencies affected by the execution of the EA are included
      in distribution of the EA.
      6.2.2.4. (AFSOC) Coordinate the EA through the staff for approval on applicable
      annexes.
      6.2.2.5. (AFSOC) Submit the coordinated EA to HQ AFSOC/CC or CV for approval
      and signature as required.
      6.2.2.6. (AFSOC) Prepare and coordinate all EA changes with appropriate functional
      staff agencies and other participants to the EA.
   6.2.3. (AFSOC) Staff Agencies.       AFSOC functional staff agencies will appoint annex
   mangers to:
      6.2.3.1. (AFSOC) Assist HQ AFSOC/A4RX, or the authorized staff agency, with
      development of the EA.
      6.2.3.2. (AFSOC) Provide HQ AFSOC/A4RX, or the authorized staff agency, with
      information required to develop a draft opening statement.
      6.2.3.3. (AFSOC) Attend planning conferences convened by the Agreement Manager.
      6.2.3.4. (AFSOC) Conduct internal staffing to review the draft opening statement and
      initiate development of supporting functional staff annexes.
      6.2.3.5. (AFSOC) Coordinate within their respective functional staff agencies, with
      other authorized staff agencies, and with counterparts in non-AFSOC agencies when
      those agencies are affected by their respective annex.
      6.2.3.6. (AFSOC) Identify EA annex program manager to HQ AFSOC/A4RX or the
      staff agency preparing the EA.
6.3. (AFSOC) Procedures.
   6.3.1. (AFSOC) Administrative Requirements. Type all portions of EAs in single space on
   standard 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper. Prepare appendices, charts, schedules, etc., so that the top
   of the attachment will be at the left when inserted into the document. MS Word, Version 6.0
   or higher, font Times New Roman 12 point font, is the standard print for EAs. Use 0.7 inch
   margins on top and bottom (to the header and footer, 1 inch to the text), with 1.25 margins on
   both sides. Number pages of the basic plan and supplements using standard Arabic numbers.
   Number annexes by assigned alphabetical designator, followed by page number. Number
   appendices so that the appendix number precedes the annex alphabetical designator. Each
   page of an annex will contain a footer indicating the OPR and EA number.

   6.3.2. (AFSOC) Classification. Published EAs will not contain classified information. Any
   classified information required to complete the EA will be contained in a separate annex,
   forwarded to the appropriate element, independently of the main document.
   6.3.3. (AFSOC) Requests for Release. Process release of information in a programming
   document to the public IAW DoDR 5400.7, Air Force Supplement, DoD Freedom of
   Information Act Program.
   6.3.4. (AFSOC) Distribution. The agreement manager will send copies of the EA to
   appropriate addressees in an attached distribution list. If the annex mangers need additional
   copies or addressees, they must notify the agreement manager during EA development. A
   copy of all completed agreements must be provided to the AFSOC/A4RX, regardless of
   agency preparing EA.
6.4. (AFSOC) Format. An EA normally contains a cover (attachment 2); opening statement
(attachment 3); and a Subject; Purpose, Summary of Responsibilities, Effective Date, Review
and Termination Plan, and signature blocks. Other optional components of the EA include a
table of contents and annexes necessary to accomplish the objective. The opening statement will
be signed by the commanders of the elements participating in the agreement. LOAs addressing a
single issue or topic typically can be completed in the opening statement without additional
annexes.
   6.4.1. (AFSOC) Annex. An annex (attachment 4) is a subdivision of an EA applicable to a
   single functional area such as logistics, personnel, etc. Annex designations are not reserved
   for individual functional areas and are assigned as needed. The decision to prepare an annex
   rests with individual staff agencies. If the opening statement provides sufficient information,
   or the EA has no application to an individual functional area, an annex is not necessary. In
   this case, the functional area OPR will advise HQ AFSOC/A4RX an annex is not required.
   6.4.2. (AFSOC) Appendix. An appendix is a subdivision of or an addition to an annex,
   containing listings of information specific to that annex.
6.5. (AFSOC) Changes or Revisions. Units or functional areas requiring a change to an EA
should contact the originator of the EA. The OPR will determine if a change or revision is
necessary and negotiate the change with the other participants according to the revision
procedures contained in the basic agreement. All changes require coordination and approval of
the other parties to the agreement. Upon approval and signature by all participants, the OPR will
issue a revised version of the agreement.
6.6. (AFSOC) Requests for EA Development. Forward AFSOC staff requests for EA
development to HQ AFSOC/A4RX. Identify an OPR and name of the agreement manager in the
request and include sufficient information to facilitate review. Following the review, HQ
AFSOC/A4RX will either:
   6.6.1. (AFSOC) Grant the requesting agency authority to proceed with EA development.
   6.6.2. (AFSOC) Assign a HQ AFSOC/A4RX agreement manager to proceed with formal
   EA development.
6.7. (AFSOC) Coordination. The staff agency developing the EA will forward the draft
opening statement to the staff for review and establish a suspense date for submission of staff
annexes. A meeting of action officers may facilitate the review of draft documents and annex
AFI25-201_AFSOCSUP_I 1 MAY 2005                                                                 31


inputs. If there are substantive changes to the opening statement or annexes, the affected
functional areas must coordinate on the final document before signature. The entire staff will
coordinate on the final document to ensure that individual annex actions are in line with those of
other staff agencies, to make final correction, and secure additional higher level coordination.
Determining adequacy of coordination is the responsibility of the OPR.
6.8. (AFSOC) Staff Actions. Staff agencies participating in EA development will provide HQ
AFSOC/A4RX, or other authorized agency, with:
   6.8.1. (AFSOC) Changes to the draft opening statement. Agencies without input to
   proposed changes will advise HQ AFSOC/A4RX in writing (negative replies required).
   6.8.2. (AFSOC) A recommended distribution list for their functions.
   6.8.3. (AFSOC) A completed annex, if required.
   6.8.4. (AFSOC) A listing of unique terms, acronyms, and abbreviations for inclusion in the
   EA glossary.
6.9. (AFSOC) Termination Authority. EAs exist for the duration agreed to and documented
in the agreement. The EA may be extended or terminated at the option of the participants, as
identified in the original agreement.
6.10. (AFSOC) Disposition. EAs, letters, messages, and reports must be maintained IAW
AFMAN 33-363 and disposed of in accordance with the AFRIMS RDS. Items of historical
significance should be forwarded to HQ AFSOC/HO. Comply with AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program, when destroying classified material.

installation can identify funds used to support these organizations, the installation commander
can choose to fund these costs within the existing budget.
Regulated Service Organizations such as a bank or credit union are charged for base support
services on the basis of existing directives or contract. Support agreements are not used. Refer to
DoD FMR 7000.14, Vol 5, Chapter 34 for further information on banks and credit unions.
A6.2. Mutual Benefit.
In some instances it is not appropriate to charge for certain services provided to local
government when such services are of mutual reciprocal benefit (e.g., agreements with fire
departments to provide mutual aid in the event of local disasters). Additional information
regarding support to civilian authorities is covered in AFI 10-802.

A6.3. Army Veterinary Service.
Status of the US Army Veterinary Service on USAF installations is governed by an MOU of 20
Aug 2003 between the Surgeons General of the two Services. It specifies that ―US Army
Veterinary Service is considered an integral part of the local Air Force medical staff and as such
is not considered a tenant on the Air Force base‖.
A6.4. United States Postal Service (USPS).
Status of USPS offices on military installations is governed by the US Postal Service Handbook
PO-630, Post Offices Serving DoD Installations, April 2000. In effect, this commits DoD to
provide ―adequate facilities for civilian post offices located at military installations solely in
support of the unit’s mission. Utilities and local telephone service shall be furnished on a
reimbursable basis‖.
A6.5. Aviation Engine Oil Samples.
AFI 21-124 provides for non-depot Oil Analysis Program laboratories to provide Nondestructive
Inspections lab analysis of aero engine oil samples in accordance with DoD policy.
A6.6. Service Level Agreements.
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are initiated as required by communications directives and are
technical arrangements that fall outside of the normal support agreement program as governed by
this instruction. Information about SLAs are located in AFI 33-115.

1. If funded by a contract
2. Reimbursable if additional services are satisfied by use of a contract chaplain.
3. Reimbursement for software sharing actions will be based on additional or incremental costs
   incurred.
4. Reimbursable except for common and joint-use communication facilities
5. Reimbursable if additional facilities are required to handle the increase in patronage
6. Unit disaster preparedness supplies, i.e., decontamination material, shelter supplies
7. For fee service provided by Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS)

8. Non-reimbursable except for unique expense material or when serviced by a contract
9. Tenant funds for off-base facilities whether work is done by the host work force or by
   contract, and on-base minor construction projects with funded cost over $2,000. The tenant
   also typically funds anything beyond this amount, to include actual MILCON. This is because
   the tenant is ostensibly reconfiguring the facility for their unique needs and such efforts are
   above and beyond the standard baseline service everyone else on base receives. The critical
   question to ask is if the building work is to maintain the basic, original integrity of the facility
   or is it unique to the user in that it changes the original form, fit, or function of the facility.
10. Reimbursable for non-active duty – non-reimbursable for active duty
11. Unusual, unique, or inordinate security requirements are reimbursable
12. Equipment and supplies ordered by the tenant are reimbursable
*NOTE: Most interservice or interagency support is reimbursable provided the basis of
reimbursement calculation meets the criteria found in DoDI 4000.19, paragraph 4.6,
Reimbursement.

**NOTE: Policy and methodology for determining reimbursement costs are found in DoD
7000.14-R, Vol. 11A. chap 1.

***NOTE: The tenant is responsible for budgeting and funding for required services provided by
contract as stated in AFI 65-601, Vol I, chap 7, Para 7.5.4.
