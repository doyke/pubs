                         CSAF-LEVEL AWARDS PROCEDURES

3.1. CSAF-level Awards. The Chief of Staff, United States Air Force has approved two awards
to promote maintenance excellence at the MAJCOM and Program Office level. These awards
are based on performance over the past year and reward the organization (MAJCOM/Program
Office) that demonstrates the most improvement from the previous year. At the end of each FY,
AF/A4MY will perform the calculations on “rates” (see 3.1.1.3 and 3.1.2.3) for both awards to
select the winners.
   3.1.1. The Gen Wilbur L. Creech Maintenance Excellence Award.
       3.1.1.1. Background. This award recognizes the MAJCOM demonstrating the most
       improved performance in the category of aircraft maintenance and logistics readiness for
       each fiscal year.
       3.1.1.2. Eligibility. All MAJCOMs are eligible for this award. There is no unit-
       generated package required. However, the winning MAJCOM will post an electronic
       copy of a citation to the AF/A4M CoP within 15 days of notification. This citation will
       be read at the presentation ceremony.
       3.1.1.3. Criteria. The winner is determined by calculating the improvement for a
       predetermined set of metrics (at the MAJCOM aggregate level) and multiplying each
       metric by a corresponding weighted value. The metrics are aircraft availability rate as
       follows: Mission Capable (MC) Rate, Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance
       (TNMCM) Rate, Total Not Mission Capable for Supply (TNMCS) Rate, Cannibalization
       (CANN) Rate, and Hangar Queen Rate. The weighting factor will be assigned to
       emphasize certain aspects of the award (i.e. used to influence key areas and focus
       attention on the most important metrics).
       3.1.1.4. Winner Notification/Presentation. AF/A4/7 approves the winner and will
       notify MAJCOMs by message. CSAF presents the award to the winner at a ceremony in
       the Pentagon. Winning MAJCOM name is added to the permanent display in the
       Pentagon.
   3.1.2. The Dr. James G. Roche Sustainment Excellence Award.
       3.1.2.1. Background. This award recognizes the AFMC aircraft Program Offices (or
       equivalent) that, while supporting the fleet, demonstrated the most improved performance
       in the category of sustainment for each fiscal year.
       3.1.2.2. Eligibility. All AFMC aircraft Program Offices (or equivalent) are eligible for
       this award. There is no unit-generated package required. AFMC will post an electronic
       copy of a citation to the AF/A4M CoP within 15 days of notification. This citation will
       be read at the presentation ceremony.
       3.1.2.3. Criteria. The winner is determined by calculating the improvement for a
       predetermined set of metrics (at the Mission Design Series (MDS) aggregate level) and
       multiplying each metric by a corresponding weighted value. The metrics are Aircraft
       Availability Rate, MC Rate, TNMCM Rate, TNMCS Rate, CANN Rate, and Hangar
AFI36-2818_AFRCSUP_I 10 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                 11


     Queen Rate. The weighting factor will be assigned to emphasize certain aspects of the
     award (i.e. used to influence key areas and focus attention on the most important
     metrics).
