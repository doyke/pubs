This is a new instruction which implements DoD Directive 5230.09, Clearance of DOD
Information for Public Release, Air Force Instruction 35-102, Security and Policy Review
Process, and Air Force Instruction, AFI 35-107, Public Web Communications for activities at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB). It provides new guidance for procedures to obtain
clearance for public release of accurate information that does not contain classified material and
does not conflict with established Air Force, Department of Defense (DOD) or U.S. Government
Policy. It also supports DoD Instruction (DODI) 5230.29, Security and Policy Review of DOD
Information for Public Release and restrictions on release of information in accordance with AFI
35-104, Media Operations. It applies to Air Force organizations located at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base, as well as geographically separated Air Force Life Cycle Management Center
(AFLCMC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT) subordinate organizations at bases or locations which do not have a servicing base public
affairs office. It identifies procedures for clearing web content for public release. It also
prescribes use of WPAFB Form 1420, 88 ABW Public Affairs Security and Policy Review
Worksheet. This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard or the Air Force Reserve
Center (ANG/AFRC) units. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional

Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).


1. Purpose and Objectives of Security and Policy Review: Security and policy review is a
coordination function to ensure only approved information is released to the public. Security and
Policy Review enhances public trust, understanding and support for the Air Force by releasing
timely, factual information on Air Force missions and activities. The Security and Policy
Review coordination process is designed to prevent release of classified information, Operations
Security (OPSEC) protected Critical Information, sensitive Scientific and Technical Information
(STINFO), Military Critical Technologies List, International Traffic-in-Arms Regulations
(ITAR) and Export Control Law restricted information, as well as Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA)-Exempted information.
2. Procedures for submitting information for security and policy review:
     2.1. The 88th Air Base Wing Public Affairs Office, Plans and Programs Division (88
     ABW/PAX) serves as the installation-level Public Affairs (PA) review authority for host and
     tenant units located at WPAFB, as well as geographically separated AFIT, AFLCMC and
     AFRL subordinate organizations at bases or locations which do not have an organic
     servicing base public affairs office. Personnel assigned to Headquarters Air Force Materiel
     Command, National Air and Space Intelligence Center, National Museum of the U.S. Air
     Force and 445th Airlift Wing shall submit materials proposed for security and policy review
     to their respective unit PA Office. Others will normally submit materials to 88 ABW/PAX.
     2.2. Detailed procedures for submitters are identified at the “Wright-Patterson AFB Security
     and Policy Review Fact Sheet” publicly accessible at www.wpafb.af.mil.
     2.3. Only full and final text of materials proposed for public release will be submitted for
     review. Notes, outlines, drafts with placeholder or blanks to be filled in later will not be
     accepted. Do not submit classified, sensitive, proprietary or Privacy Act-protected personally
     identifiable information. Compliance with AFI 33-332, The Air Force Privacy and Civil
     Liberties Program, applies. Copyrighted materials may not be submitted unless permission
     is granted by the copyright holder or a legal review is provided and a “fair use” determination
     made.
        2.3.1. Material proposed for release to Members of Congress shall be submitted to the
        organization’s Legislative Liaison in compliance with AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations
        with Congress.
     2.4. Submitters should normally plan for a minimum of 10 work days for Security and
     Policy Review. The 10 day clock starts when 88 ABW/PAX receives all required materials.
     Some complex documents, dissertations, manuscripts, theses, videos, etc. may require higher
     headquarters review and longer lead times. 88 ABW/PAX uses the Public Affairs
     Information Release System (PAIRS) online database to track submissions. The originating
     submitter will receive an email, automatically via PAIRS, when Public Affairs opens the case
     for review, and another email when a final release determination is made.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI35-102 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                    3


     2.4.1. Rush cases are defined as those cases which need to be cleared within 5 work days
     of submission to PA. Rush cases require a letter of justification signed by directorate
     level director or commander.
  2.5. The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Security and Policy Review SharePoint site was
  established to facilitate submission of material for review to PA. Do not use E-mail to
  transmit information for security and policy review. The only exceptions to this policy are
  identified in the fact sheet noted in para. 2.2. above.
  2.6. Coordination:
     2.6.1. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base’s role in advanced research, development, test,
     education, life cycle and supply chain management, intelligence and flying operations
     demands originators shall ensure appropriate scrutiny by technical, OPSEC, Security
     Manager, Foreign Disclosure, STINFO Officer and other directorate subject matter expert
     reviewers prior to submission of material to public affairs.
         2.6.1.1. For STINFO, only reports and information determined to be “Statement A”
         can be forwarded for security and policy review.
         2.6.1.2. Submitters shall ensure appropriate subject matter experts review for
         compliance with the salient weapon system security classification guide and
         Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, as amended to EO
         13292, DOD 5400.7-R, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program, DOD 5220.22-
         M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, and DOD 5220.22-R,
         Industrial Security Regulation apply.
         2.6.1.3. Restricted Information as identified in DODI 3020.46, The Militarily Critical
         Technologies List (MCTL), U.S. Department of Commerce Export Regulation and
         International Trafficking in Arms Regulation shall not be submitted for candidate
         public release.
     2.6.2. Prescribed Form and Other Coordination: The revised, current WPAFB Form
     1420, 88 ABW Public Affairs Security and Policy Review Worksheet, is available via the
     Air Force e-Publishing website. This link is the latest version of the form available as of
     publication of this instruction. Previous editions will not be used. http://static.e-
     publishing.af.mil/production/1/wrightpattersonafb/form/wrightpattersonafb1420/wr
     ightpatterson1420.xfdl. Submitters must consider other agency equities in a release
     recommendation. Cross coordination (i.e. between AFRL/RQ and AFRL/RY; or
     AFLCMC/WW and AFLCMC/EN) shall be completed by the submitter and clearly
     identified on the WPAFB Form 1420, prior to submission to PA. If a submitter or
     coordinating agency expert judges the case should be reviewed by higher headquarters or
     another outside agency, the submitter shall advise 88 ABW/PAX and clearly annotate the
     recommendation and relevant contact information on the prescribed WPAFB Form 1420.
     Failure to accomplish and identify other coordinating agencies may result in lengthy
     delays in processing. Note: 88 ABW/PAX personnel may also direct coordination with
     other organizations if they deem it appropriate.
  2.7. Defense contractors performing work or services to the Air Force are required to submit
  press releases and other information proposed for public release according to valid contract
  requirements, normally as specified in the Defense Department (DD) Form 254. Most often
 4                                 WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI35-102 26 NOVEMBER 2013


     this requires contractors to submit materials for PA review through the appropriate program
     manager or contracting officer. PA does not accept materials directly from defense
     contractors.
     2.8. Editorial review is the originator’s responsibility. Security and Policy Review by PA
     does not include review for style. PA and coordinators may annotate obvious typographical
     or grammatical errors and recommend editing for clarity or accuracy.
     2.9. Originators must not release information outside official channels until security and
     policy review confirms clearance. PA will not perform after-the-fact review of materials that
     already have been publicly released or already are posted to publicly accessible websites.
     Materials submitted after the “date needed” or “event date” will be returned without action.
     2.10. Following PA review by the appropriate officials, a determination will be made and the
     submitter notified via email. The most frequently seen determinations are: Cleared for Public
     Release; Cleared “with Recommendations” for Public Release; Cleared “As Amended” for
     Public Release; or Not Cleared for Public Release. A determination of “AF - No Objection”
     may be made when Air Force is not the final release authority, as in certain Joint or federal
     agency programs.
        2.10.1. Once cleared for public release, documents containing Technical Information as
        identified in DoDI 5230.24, can be marked “Distribution Statement A – Cleared for
        Public Release.”
        2.10.2. Submitters of materials containing scientific and technical information shall be
        responsible for compliance with DODI 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical
        Documents, DODI 5230.27, Presentation of DOD-Related Scientific and Technical
        Papers at Meetings and AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information.
     2.11. Originators may appeal a security and policy review decision. Appeals must be made
     in writing and normally are adjudicated by either the Secretary of the Air Force Public
     Affairs (SAF/PA) or DOD Office of Security Review (DOD/OSR).
3. Important considerations for submitters of material for security and policy review:
     3.1. In today’s information age, public release equates to global release. There is effectively
     no distinction between ‘local’ and ‘international’ release. A document or briefing presented
     and released at a conference open to the public or news media is equivalent to posting the
     presentation or document to the Internet where it is immediately accessible to a global
     audience.
     3.2. Note that a clearance to release information by PA does not grant approval to release the
     information. The actual release of information is the decision of the originator, normally
     reached with coordination of the originator’s chain of command. The originator should not
     nominate information for security and policy review that contains classified or other
     information that the originating office does not fully support being released to the general
     public.
     3.3. Clearance authority is delegated to the PA activity at the lowest echelon where
     competent authority exists to evaluate contents of the material proposed for public release.
     In instances where, based upon the determination of the PA office or published guidance,
     additional higher headquarters review is warranted, the information will then be forwarded to
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI35-102 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                   5


   the MAJCOM PA office for further review. A key objective at all levels is maximum
   clearance of releasable information in minimum time.
   3.4. Authors and submitters must not incorporate copyrighted works (cartoons, video, digital
   music and audio recordings, etc.) without permission of copyright holder or legal review
   provided stating use of copyrighted material is determined to be “fair use.” The rights of
   copyrighted sound and video recording owners shall be recognized in accordance with DoDD
   5535.4, Copyrighted Sound and Video Recordings.
   3.5. Submitters and Technical Reviewers shall verify presentations to industry comply with
   DODI 5410.20, Public Affairs Relations With Business and Nongovernmental Organizations
   Representing Business.
   3.6. Submission of mishap reports or excerpts require coordination with the MAJCOM
   convening authority PA office IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
4. Public websites and security and policy review. Information proposed for placement on
publicly accessible DOD websites available to anyone without access controls requires review
and clearance for public release prior to posting. AFI 35-107 Public Web Communications, AFI
33-129, Web Management and Internet Use and DODI 8550.01, DoD Internet Services and
Internet-Based Capabilities apply.
   4.1. The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base public website (www.wpafb.af.mil) and
   subordinate pages are managed by 88 ABW/PAO (Current Operations Division). PA
   personnel use the Air Force Public Information Management System (AFPIMS) to post
   content to dedicated AFPIMS servers. Requesters can submit fact sheets, senior leader
   biographies, news and feature articles and supporting photos and videos directly to site and
   content managers at 88 ABW/PAO for release clearance and web posting. Public Affairs may
   require units with substantial information to post identify content providers in writing who
   must then undergo AFPIMS training.
   4.2. Air Force information proposed for posting on publicly accessible DOD servers outside
   of AFPIMS must be submitted for review to 88 ABW/PAX and cleared for release before it
   is posted to the web or any equivalent application. Originators shall submit proposed public
   web content which is beyond the scope indicated in para. 4.1 above for security and policy
   review to 88 ABW/PAX in accordance with this instruction. This applies to content
   proposed for posting on all publicly accessible Air Force websites operating on other than
   AFPIMS servers.
       4.2.1. Publicly accessible websites outside of AFPIMS also require waivers from the Air
       Force Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA) prior to site activation and annually thereafter.
       Current waiver criteria are established by AFI 35-107 and AFPAA. Waivers are typically
       approved only for interactive content which is beyond the technical capabilities of
       AFPIMS. Contact AFPAA (afpaa.hq.publicweb@us.af.mil) for waiver criteria and
       process. Even temporary public sites such as those used by units for conference
       registration require waivers. Long lead times may be required for waiver approval.
       Following approval of initial waiver, organizations must annually validate all posted
       content remains current, accurate, appropriate for public audiences and in compliance
       with AFI 33-129 and AFI 35-107.
   4.3. Social Media websites such as Facebook, You Tube, Twitter, Flicker:
6                            WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI35-102 26 NOVEMBER 2013


    4.3.1. DOD and Air Force social web media policy is quickly evolving. Individuals are
    urged to consult http://www.af.mil/WebPolicy.aspx and the Air Force Social Media
    Guide for latest guidance.
    4.3.2. 88 ABW/PA will not review or clear content developed for posting on personal
    individual or organizational social media websites.
    4.3.3. All Individuals who post official Air Force information to social media sites
    should use their best judgment and do so at their own risk with the understanding that
    they take responsibility for what they post. DODD 5500.07, Standards of Conduct and
    AFI 1-1, Air Force Standards, apply. Information posted should clearly be relevant,
    accurate and appropriate for a global public audience. Sound security at the source and
    Operational Security is imperative and an individual responsibility. Include a disclaimer
    when personal opinions are expressed (e.g., “This statement is my own and does not
    constitute an endorsement by or opinion of the Department of Defense”). Individuals
    should not attempt to disguise, impersonate or misrepresent their identity.
    4.3.4. Commanders are responsible for content posted to any official unit presence on
    web-based social media sites.       Unit presence sites will be registered at
    www.af.mil/AFSITES/socialmediasites.aspx.
