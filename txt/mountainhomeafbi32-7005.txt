The purpose of this instruction is to define the requirements for personnel assigned or attached to Moun-
tain Home AFB (MHAFB), to protect the environment during field exercises conducted on MHAFB; it
does not cover operations at other Continental United States locations or foreign countries. The scope of
this instruction covers both routine and temporary "mission essential" use. Public land users will be
familiar with and follow this instruction at all times. Maintain records created as a result of published
processes in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
dispose of records IAW the Air Force (AF) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) available from the Air
Force Portal at the AF Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) link. Contact supporting
records managers as required. Refer recommended changes and questions regarding this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR).

AUTHORITY: OPR for this instruction is the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron Commander (366 CES/
CC), with operational control vested in its designated functional managers for environmental issues (366
CES/CEVC). The 366th Aeromedical-Dental Squadron Commander (366 ADS/CC) is an office of collat-
eral responsibility.


1. General. The affected squadron supervision is responsible for enforcement of this instruction.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. Exercising unit will: Appoint primary and alternate HM Monitors and APMs to ensure proper
    collection, segregation, handling, and disposal of waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) during field
    exercises.
       2.1.1. HM Monitors and APMs, appointed by the unit commander, are required to complete the
       appropriate training and take the most current version of their corresponding program handbooks
       with them during deployment.
           2.1.1.1. APMs should refer to the most current MHAFB APM Handbook and HM Monitors
           Handbook for further guidance. Both handbooks can be easily obtained through the Environ-
           mental, Safety, and Occupational Health web page or by contacting the Environmental Flight
           (366 CES/CEV) at 208-828-6351 or DSN 728-6351, but these handbooks should already be
           maintained in the shop’s HM and HW Program Binders respectfully.
       2.1.2. Ensure copies of waste profile sheets and MSDS are taken on all deployments, to aid in
       continuity of the waste collection and turn-in process.
       2.1.3. Follow the hazardous materials collection, segregation, and handling procedures outlined in
       the HM Monitors Handbook.
       2.1.4. Ensure waste collection containers are properly marked IAW the APM Handbook:
           2.1.4.1. Label waste containers with the applicable squadron name and office symbol.
           2.1.4.2. Label waste containers with a point of contact (either primary or alternative APM),
           APM telephone number and building number for the specific field exercise.
           2.1.4.3. Label waste containers with the waste stream profile name and number given to that
           specific field exercise. Waste stream numbers may change for each field exercise. As a result,
           366 CES/CEV should be contacted on every field exercise; both Solid Waste and Hazardous
           Waste Program Managers should be informed. The waste container must also include one of
           the following designators: "hazardous waste," "non-hazardous waste," or "pending analysis."
       2.1.5. Ensure containers for solid wastes will not have freestanding liquid and that wringers will
       be utilized whenever possible. If liquid wastes (e.g., used fuel, used oil, solvents/cleaners, etc)
       will be generated at the contingency/exercise location, prior coordination must be obtained from
       366 CES/CEV.

     2.1.6. Containers holding hazardous waste will always be kept closed except when waste is
     actively being added.
     2.1.7. Ensure a qualified person (APM or other trained person) is present on field exercises to
     oversee the environmental program.

     wastes, which are generated by "non-deployed" assets.
        2.1.8.1. Ensure generated wastes will be taken directly to the Central Collection Facility
        (CCF), Building 1296, immediately following the field exercise. Contact the CCF at
        208-828-2726/2396 or DSN 728-2726/2396. No wastes generated at the field exercise loca-
        tion will be returned to squadron collection points.
     2.1.9. Ensure the squadron brings enough waste collection containers, labels, and spill response
     supplies to maintain operations for duration of the field exercise.
     2.1.10. Ensure each Satellite Accumulation Point will have an APM and an alternate appointed by
     the unit commander.
     2.1.11. Ensure all HM are properly labeled, stored, and transferred to the field exercise location,
     if necessary.
        2.1.11.1. Ensure hazardous declarations for materials’ transportation are complete as required
        by certified personnel.
     2.1.12. Ensure the Environmental Impact Analysis Program (EIAP) process has been properly
     completed using AF Form 813 during planning stages of the proposed field exercise. Contact 366
     CES/CEVA at 208-828-6668 or DSN 728-6668 for more information.
  2.2. The 366th Civil Engineer Squadron (366 CES) will:

     at for more information.
     2.2.4. Oversee environmental program at the field exercise location.
     2.2.5. Ensure personnel with authorized training are present during the field exercise.
     2.2.6. Ensure HM response procedures are covered in Emergency Response plans.
     2.2.7. Ensure personnel establish and staff environmental programs and are deployed with 366
     CES.
