                                                Chapter 1

     AIR FORCE PURCHASES USING MILITARY INTERDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASE
                             REQUESTS POLICY

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides Air Force guidance and procedures for purchases using Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs), DD Form 448 and Acceptance of MIPR, DD Form 448-2.
This instruction supersedes all Air Force MIPR guidance and applies to all Air Force organizations
including Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard. This instruction does not address poli-
cies and procedures for MIPRs received by the Air Force from other activities.

1.2. Air Force MIPR Policy. The guidance, procedures, reviews, and approvals put forth in this instruc-
tion apply to all DD Forms 448 and MIPR requirements packages regardless of dollar value, purpose, and
operating/contingency locations.
    1.2.1. Acquisition planning includes developing the overall strategy for managing the acquisition.
    Therefore, before requesting the assistance of a servicing agency to perform acquisition activities, the
    Air Force requesting agency shall determine that an assisted acquisition is needed (e.g., expertise or
    acquisition resources are not readily available within the agency) and a servicing agency can provide
    the assistance required. The decision to use an interagency agreement shall be supported by a best
    interest determination. Refer to Attachment 7, Interagency Acquisition Determination and Findings.
    1.2.2. MIPRs may not be used to violate provisions of law or to circumvent conditions and limitations
    imposed on the use of funds. For example, MIPRs may not be used to extend the period of availability
    of the cited funds.
    1.2.3. Air Force funds that expire in a given fiscal year must be awarded to a contract or task order
    within 90 days of acceptance of the MIPR or by 30 September of the given fiscal year, whichever
    occurs first. If a contract or task order is not awarded by September 20th, for funds that expire in the
    given year, the Requiring Activity should reevaluate their requirements and deobligate funds as appro-
    priate, to allow use of the funds prior to expiration. For goods, delivery may not be specified to occur
    in the year subsequent to funds availability.
    1.2.4. The Requiring Activity program or project manager (PM) must ensure that purchases ordered
    using a DD Form 448/448-2, comply with all DoD acquisition and financial regulations as well as
    with DFAS and Air Force policies.
    1.2.5. The Requiring Activity PM must include DoD-unique clauses and comply with all DoD regu-
    lations, directives, and other requirements for all interagency (non-DoD) purchase agreements.
    1.2.6. The Requiring Activity PM must use the Automated Business Services System (ABSS) or
    another automated system that interfaces with ABSS to create DD Forms 448. Once created, the DD
    Form 448 must flow through ABSS for the required policy coordination and reviews implemented in
    this instruction. Funds certifiers will not certify nor will contracting specialists perform reviews on
    manually created MIPRs.
    1.2.7. An Air Force financial analyst must review and certify funds for every MIPR before the requir-
    ing activity program or project manager releases it to a DoD or non-DoD agency for acceptance.
       1.2.7.1. An Air Force contracting specialist must review any MIPR that will result in a contracting
       action, including unfunded planning MIPRs, and the attached requirements package before the
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           5


     requiring activity program or project manager releases it to a DoD or non-DoD agency for accep-
     tance. Air Force contracting review is not required for Air National Guard MIPRs.
  1.2.8. The Requiring Activity PM is responsible for managing the MIPR order process, for managing
  all goods and services procured by the MIPR or resulting contract, and for tracking funding through
  all stages of accounting until the order is complete and remaining funds are deobligated.
  1.2.9. The Requiring Activity PM will not approve advance payments or advance billings for goods
  or services orders unless explicitly required to do so by an appropriation or other law. The specific
  appropriation or law authorizing the advance must be cited on the obligation and/or interagency agree-
  ment documents for those few exceptions where advances are authorized.
  1.2.10. The Requiring Activity PM with responsibility for the MIPR funds and mission requirement
  must date and sign the DD Form 448 hard copy before sending the package to the assisting agency.
  1.2.11. The Requiring Activity program or project manager, or designated resource manager is
  responsible for printing the MIPR package from ABSS or other automated system and sending it to
  the assisting agency.
  1.2.12. Air Force MIPRs must adhere to the government-wide business rules set forth by the Office
  of Management and Budget. The specific business rule requirements are incorporated in the require-
  ments of this instruction at Attachment 5.
6                                                                   AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


                                               Chapter 2

                                     GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1. Purchase Options. There are various contract vehicles utilized to purchase goods and services.
MIPRS are not the only purchase option.
    2.1.1. Local Purchases Using the Government Purchase Card (GPC). Organizational GPC cardhold-
    ers may purchase authorized supplies, equipment up to $3,000 and non-personal services up to
    $2,500. Purchases up to $25,000 are also allowed in limited circumstances. Program and project
    managers (PMs) should see the requiring activity GPC holder for assistance.
    2.1.2. Local Purchase Using an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. The supporting Air Force con-
    tracting office can purchase authorized supplies, equipment, and non-personal services at any dollar
    amount. Always discuss your procurement needs with contracting office personnel before beginning
    the MIPR process. The contracting office personnel can provide in-person assistance throughout the
    award and performance of your requirement. An AF Form 9 is created in the Automated Business
    Support System (ABSS).
    2.1.3. Intra-Air Force Acquisition Using an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA). Other Air
    Force organizations may be able to provide available supplies and services or can procure supplies
    and services on a contract. When intra-Air Force support is available, Financial Management Analy-
    sis (FMA) or your Resource Advisor/Resource Manager (RA/RM) can provide assistance on using an
    AF Form 616.
    2.1.4. Intra-Agency Acquisition Using a DD Form 448. Other DoD organizations such as DLA,
    Navy, and Army, may be able to provide military-related supplies and services or can procure supplies
    and services on the Air Force’s behalf.
    2.1.5. Interagency (Non-DoD) Acquisition Using a DD Form 448. Interagency acquisitions may be
    used only when an interagency acquisition is in the best interest of the Air Force. Common examples
    of organizations used for interagency agreements are General Services Administration (GSA) and
    FedSource.

2.2. Assisting Agencies. There are two categories of assisting agencies, intra-agency and interagency.
    2.2.1. Intra-agency. Requirements are obtained from an activity within DoD. Example: An Air
    Force unit forwards a MIPR to the Army and an order is placed for supplies/services for the Air Force
    from an existing contract. The Army is the intra-agency assisting agency.
    2.2.2. Interagency. Requirements are obtained from an agency outside DoD. Example: Air Force
    unit forwards a MIPR to GSA and an order is placed for supplies/services for the Air Force from an
    existing contract. GSA is the interagency assisting agency.

2.3. MIPR Categories. There are two categories of MIPRs, reimbursable and direct cite. Both catego-
ries can be used on one MIPR. Generally the assisting agency and the PM negotiate whether the order
will be reimbursable or direct cite.
    2.3.1. Reimbursable Order (Category I): The assisting agency obligates its own funds to fill the order
    or perform the service. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) reimburse the assist-
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                           7


   ing/servicing agency using the requiring activity’s fund cites. The MIPR number is the source docu-
   ment number throughout the life of the acquisition.
   2.3.2. Direct Cite Order (Category II): The assisting agency directly cites the PM’s fund cite on the
   resulting contract. The DFAS pays the performing contractors directly from the requiring activity’s
   fund cite. The contract number is the source document number throughout the life of the acquisition.

2.4. MIPR Review. An Air Force financial analyst must review and certify funds for every MIPR before
the requiring activity PM releases it to a DoD or non-DoD agency for acceptance. For any MIPR that will
result in a contracting action, including unfunded planning MIPRs, an Air Force contracting specialist
must review the MIPR and the attached requirements package before the requiring activity PM releases it
to a DoD or non-DoD agency for acceptance. This review will help fulfill mission needs, ensure the best
value to the Air Force, and avoid common problems with MIPRs and interagency acquisitions that have
been noted by the General Accountability Office (GAO), Department of Defense Inspector General
(DoDIG), and Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA). Air Force contracting review is not required for Air
National Guard MIPRs.

2.5. MIPR Acceptance. Once an assisting agency receives a MIPR, it must formally accept or reject the
order represented by the MIPR. Assisting agencies will accept the order by completing the DD Form
448-2 and returning it to the PM within 30 days. The assisting agency and PM may use the 30 day period
to correct any weaknesses in the MIPR package before accepting the order.

                                                Chapter 3

                                  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Program Manager/Project Manager (PM). Although requiring activities may use different terms,
for the purpose this instruction, the term “PM” refers to the individual in the requiring activity with bud-
get authority that needs the support, services, or goods procured on the MIPR. Since requiring activities
have diverse missions, these activities may use different names for the individual with this responsibility.
For the purposes of the instruction, PM will represent other names performing the same function. The PM
shall ensure all MIPRs are properly prepared and coordinated in accordance with this instruction and must
manage the requirement throughout the MIPR life cycle. Specifically,
    3.1.1. The PM is responsible for preparing and ensuring the MIPR is properly prepared and pro-
    cessed. The PM must:
       3.1.1.1. Before preparing a MIPR, ensure the requirement is valid. Consult with Financial Man-
       agement Analysis (FMA, see paragraph 3.3.) and the Resource Advisor/Manager (RA/RM) see
       paragraph 3.2.) to determine bona fide need in terms of purpose, time and amount. Unlawful obli-
       gation and expenditure of appropriated funds can result in a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act
       (31 U.S.C. 1241).
       3.1.1.2. If a MIPR is going to result in contract action, consult with the supporting Air Force con-
       tracting office as soon as the requirement is identified to ensure an inter/intra-agency MIPR is in
       the best interest of the government.
       3.1.1.3. Create the DD Form 448 in ABSS or an automated system that interfaces with ABSS to
       ensure proper coordination and tracking of funds. Forms created in ABSS are distinguished by a
       “Generated by ABSS” marking in the bottom right corner of the DD Form 448.
       3.1.1.4. Include on the DD Form 448, a specific and definite description of the goods or service
       required along with the required start date, end date, and expiration date of the funding source.
       3.1.1.5. Ensure footnotes in Attachment 4, MIPR Footnotes (required footnotes), Attachment 5,
       Intragovernmental Business Rules For Use With Footnotes 2a and 2b, and Attachment 6, Inter-
       agency Agreement For Use With Footnote 2a, are in block 9b of the DD Form 448 are attached as
       required.

  direct cite orders) until they are closed. The PM shall:
     3.1.2.1. Ensure MIPR number is referenced on all documents received from the assisting agency.
     3.1.2.2. Ensure proper payment procedures are used for accounting of MIPR expenditures. See
     Chapter 6, PM and RA/RM Advance Payment/Advance Billing and Accounting Procedures.
     3.1.2.3. Identify a trained contracting officer representative (COR) to the assisting agency con-
     tracting officer before contract performance begins. The COR will ensure oversight of contractor
     performance/delivery/billing and will notify the PM of any discrepancies requiring resolution by
     the PM. The COR must complete Computing Learning Center 106, “COR with a Mission Focus”
     at www.dau.mil or attend training provided by the supporting contracting office.
     3.1.2.4. Promptly process, or ensure the designated COR processes receiving reports and invoices
     in accordance with procedures established by the PM and the assisting agency contracting officer.

     Reimbursable MIPR, submit a memorandum (reference Attachment 11, Example—Initial
     Request for DD Form 448-2 for Deobligation of Remaining Funds) to the assisting agency and
     request a DD Form 448-2 be provided to the PM for deobligation of excess funds. If the PM
     requests a DD Form 448-2 and the assisting agency does not provide it within 30 days, the PM
     will send a memorandum (reference Attachment 12, Example—final request for Dd Form 448-2
     for Deobligation of Remaining Funds) to the assisting agency informing that the funds remaining
     on the order will be deobligated in 30 days. After 60 days (30 days for original request and 30
10                                                                    AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008

   3.3.4. Ensure Attachment 5, Intragovernmental Business Rules for use with Footnotes 2a and 2b, is
   attached and filled in.
   3.3.5. Ensure funds are available and the accounting appropriation is correct.
   3.3.6. Certify funds and input commitment transactions for MIPRs into the accounting system. Note:
   Before certifying funds on commitment documents such as MIPRs, the funds certifier must complete
   funds certifying official training, have a training certificate and a DD Form 577, Appointment/Termi-
   nation Record – Authorized Signature on file, and be appointed in writing by the Comptroller.
   3.3.7. Perform follow-up actions with RA/RM on outstanding receiving reports.

3.4. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). DFAS is the DoD accounting firm and works
closely with the FMA to ensure the propriety of payments and the accuracy of accounting records. The
DFAS shall:
   3.4.1. Obligate funds in the accounting system using the DD Form 448-2, MIPR Acceptance for reim-
   bursable (Category I) MIPRs or using the contract for direct cite (Category II) MIPRs.
12                                                                   AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


     3.4.2. Review DD Form 448-2, Block 13, Remarks, for PM approval of advance payment or advance
     billing to ensure proper processing of “type vendor code” and “project code”.

     3.4.5. For Reimbursable, Category I MIPRs make payment to non-DoD agency for interagency
     acquisitions and reimbursement to DoD agency for intra-agency MIPRs.
     3.4.6. Make payment directly to company listed in contract for Direct Cite, Category II MIPRs.

3.5. Supporting Air Force Contracting Office. The supporting Air Force contracting office provides
business advice and acquisition support. Contracting office review is required on all MIPRs that will
result in a contract action. If you do not have an assigned contracting office, your FMA can add a con-
tracting office to your ABSS flow to facilitate electronic review. Required contracting office responsibil-
ities for MIPRs that will result in a contract action include the following:
     3.5.1. Provide business advice on an interagency or intra-agency acquisition decision to ensure it
     reflects an appropriate business approach. Encourage customers to seek advice prior to DD Form 448
     initiation.
     3.5.2. Review MIPR and the attached requirements package for completeness.
     3.5.3. Verify the adequacy of the PM’s description of the supplies to be acquired, or of the Perfor-
     mance Work Statement (PWS) describing the services required.
     3.5.4. Advise on assisting activity fees versus in-house procurement.
     3.5.5. Advise on other required documentation (sole source justifications, applicable DoD or Air
     Force terms and conditions, etc.) and other approvals as required.
     3.5.6. Advise on Determinations & Findings (D&Fs) for Economy Act requirements, reference
     Attachment 8, Example—Economy Act Determinations and Findings for Use With Footnote 9.
     3.5.7. Ensure non-DoD/Services Designated Official (SDO) D&F is completed, reference Attach-
     ment 7, Interagency Acquisition Determinations and Findings.
     3.5.8. Ensure footnotes in Attachment 4 (required footnotes), Attachment 5 (business rules), and
     Attachment 6 (interagency agreement) are in block 9b of the DD Form 448 or attached as required.
     3.5.9. For MIPRs that do not result in a contract action (e.g., host-tenant support reimbursements),
     contracting review is not required. For these types of MIPRs, a contracting specialist will click the
     “approve” button in ABSS without any review in order to flow the MIPR to FMA for review and
     funds certification. The supporting contracting office commander or chief may establish local proce-
     dures to identify MIPRs that do not require contracting review in order to reduce lead-time and elimi-
     nate review time at the contracting office. These local procedures must meet the full intent of this
     instruction, which is to ensure that ALL MIPRs resulting in a contracting action are reviewed by a
     contracting specialist.
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          13


3.6. MIPR Initiator. Any military or civilian can initiate a DD Form 448 to request purchase of goods or
services at the request of a PM; however, the PM is always responsible and accountable for the MIPR.
Additionally,
   3.6.1. The MIPR initiator must attend training from FMA and receive access to ABSS or an auto-
   mated system that interfaces with ABSS for DD Form 448 data workflow.
   3.6.2. The MIPR initiator’s name appears in Block 9b of the DD Form 448. However, this person
   does not have overall responsibility for the MIPR unless the initiator is also the PM.
14                                                                   AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008

                             SERVICE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Planning and Research. It is critical for the PM to contact the supporting Air Force contracting
office for advice on management and oversight requirements for service contracts.

4.2. Performance-Based Acquisition. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
Part 37.6., service acquisitions must be performance-based. The PM must ensure the Performance Work
Statement (PWS) is written in performance-based terms and is approved by the Services Designated Offi-
cial (SDO) in accordance with Air Force Management and Oversight of Acquisition of Services Process.
See your supporting Air Force contracting office for assistance.

4.3. Services Designated Official Approval. Air Force FAR Supplement 5337.5 addresses approval
requirements for service acquisitions. The supporting Air Force contracting office will assist in process-
ing the request for SDO approval. For interagency acquisitions, the PM will need to obtain one or two
approvals from the SDO:
     4.3.1. Approval to acquire services by a contract or task order awarded by a non-DoD agency.
     4.3.2. Approval to use a non-performance based Performance Work Statement (very rare).

4.4. Quality Assurance. MIPRs for services above $2,500 must address quality assurance requirements
(FAR 46.102(a)-(g) and 46.202) to ensure the services rendered meet contract requirements. The PM
must develop a plan outlining how he/she is going to assess contractor performance. The outline must
contain details on what standards the contractor will be held to, as well as detailed plans for oversight
and management of the contract. The supporting
Air Force contracting office can provide advice for quality assurance planning.

4.5. Severable Services. An agreement for severable services that are continuing and recurring in nature
and provide the Department a benefit each time the service is performed (e.g., maintenance and repair ser-
vices, scientific, engineering, and technical services). Title 10 U.S.C. 2410a permits the performance of
severable services to begin in one fiscal year and end in the next provided the period of performance does
not exceed one year. Thus the performance of severable services may begin during funds period of avail-
ability and may not exceed one year. Therefore, annual appropriations provided to a performing agency
that have expired shall be deobligated unless the performance of the services requested began during the
funds period of availability and the period of performance does not exceed one year. The annual appro-
priation from the earlier fiscal year may be used to fund the entire cost of the one-year period of perfor-
mance; however, an annual appropriation may not be used to enter into a severable services agreement
where the period of performance for services requested is entirely in the following fiscal year. In no
instance may the period of performance extend beyond September 30 of the subsequent year for services
funded with annual appropriations.

4.6. Non-Severable Services. Non-severable services must be funded with appropriations available for
new obligations at the time the contract is awarded. The period of performance may extend across fis-
cal years. Funds provided to a performing agency that become excess shall be deobligated when identi-
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                             15


fied. Refer to Attachment 11, Example—Initial Request for DD Form 448-2 for Deobligation of
Remaining Funds.

                                                Chapter 5

                                            AUTHORITIES

5.1. Statutory Authorities Versus Economy Act Authority. Assisting agencies are authorized to pro-
vide support services either under a specific statutory authority or under the Economy Act. Some agen-
cies outside of DoD are authorized by statute to provide acquisition support or other services to Federal
agencies. This specific authority allows the assisting agency to accept your MIPR and to provide the sup-
port you need. The Economy Act authorizes federal agencies to assist each other under certain circum-
stances, when the assisting agency does not have a specific authority but agrees to accept your order.
Your first choice for contract support should always be your supporting Air Force contracting office.
Some other agencies charge a fee-for-service. Further, some agencies have a poor track record for garner-
ing the best value for customers. For example, some agencies fulfill customer orders by ordering off GSA
schedule contracts. When this happens, the Air Force pays a fee-for-service to both the assisting agency
and GSA.
     5.1.1. Specific Statutory Authority. The Economy Act is the least used authority for purchasing
     goods and services from non-DoD agencies, as it applies only in the absence of a more specific inter-
     agency acquisition authority. Some agencies have a specific authority to assist other agencies. The
     PM must call the assisting agency to determine if the agency has a statutory authority to accept the
     order. The more commonly used Non-Economy Act authorities include, but are not limited to, the fol-
     lowing.
        5.1.1.1. Acquisition Services Fund. The Acquisition Service Fund was established by the General
        Service Administration Modernization Act that merged the General Supply Fund and the Informa-
        tion Technology Fund to carry out functions related to the used of the Acquisition Services Fund
        including any functions previously carried out by the Federal Supply Service and the Federal
        Technology Service managed by General Service Administration.
        5.1.1.2. Franchise Fund. Franchise Funds were first established by P.L. 103-356, Title IV, Section
        403 to provide common administrative support services on a competitive and fee basis. Franchise
        fund programs originated within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of
        Commerce, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Health and Human Services
        (HHS), Department of Interior, and Department of Treasury.
     5.1.2. U.S.C. 1535, Economy Act Authority. Cite this authority using Footnote 8 or 9 of Attachment
     4 if the agency does not have a specific statutory authority and, when required, prepare a Determina-
     tions and Findings (D&F) (refer to Attachment 8).
        5.1.2.1. DoD Economy Act Orders., Performance of a recurring requirement must be agreed to in
        a DD Form 1144, Support Agreement, with the assisting agency. For recurring requirements,
        determine if there is a support agreement between the two agencies. When there is no support
        agreement, the PM must work with the installation support agreement manager to negotiate a sup-
        port agreement for recurring support. See AFI 25-201, Support Agreement Procedures. No sup-
        port agreement is required for provision of (a) a single item or one-time service, (b) sale of
        Working Capital Funds (WCF) mission products and services, and (c) intragovernmental sales
        specifically directed or authorized by law.
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                          17


  5.1.3. Determinations and Findings (D&F) Requirement. Economy Act orders sent to a non-DoD
  agency require written approval in the form of a D&F signed by a Senior Executive Service (SES) or
  General Officer. A D&F is always required for Economy Act MIPRs going outside of the DoD.
  Include a D&F with MIPR documentation. In accordance with DoDI 4000.19, Interservice and
  Intragovernmental Support, paragraph 4.4., the head of the major organizational unit ordering the sup-
  port must approve the D&F. This authority may be delegated, although designees may not be lower
  than a SES, Flag, or General Officer. The supporting Air Force contracting office can advise the PM
  on the proper staffing of the D&F. See Attachment 8, Example—Economy Act Determinations and
  Findings for Use With Footnote 9, for a sample Economy Act D&F.

        ADVANCE PAYMENT/ADVANCE BILLING AND ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

6.1. Advance Payment Process. Advance payments are a transfer of funds to the assisting agency from
the requiring activity prior to service being rendered, and must be required by specific statutory authority
(reference general prohibition of advance payments per 31 U.S.C. Section 3324, and as explained further
in DoDFMR Volume. 4 Chapter 5). The assisting agency can request advance payment for services from
the requiring agency. Advance payments to non-DoD agencies must be approved by the PM prior to
acceptance of the MIPR by the assisting agency. Upon receipt of the MIPR acceptance, Block 13 will be
reviewed to ensure any statements inserted by the assisting activity are accurate to include verifying any
advance payment/billing information and money amount is authorized.
     6.1.1. Advance Payment Approved. The requiring activity will submit required documentation to
     DFAS for an advance payment. The advance payment is recorded in the accounting system as a neg-
     ative Unfilled Order Outstanding (UOO) and a positive Accrued Expenditure Paid (AEP) transaction
     under a type vendor “2” Program Summary Record/Funds Summary Record (PSR/FSR) and a project
     code of "9910" or "9940". Specific processing and coding requirements are provided in DFAS-DE
     7077.2-M, USAF Standard Base-Level General Accounting and Finance System: H069/BQ Software
     User Manual, Section 19, paragraphs 19.20 and 19.21.
     6.1.2. Accounting for the Advance Payment. As performance occurs, receiving reports and invoices
     must be forwarded to the applicable DFAS operating location for processing to draw down the
     advance amount from the type vendor “2” Detail Summary Record (DSR)/PSR and charge the type
     vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR in the accounting system. When the action procured by the MIPR is
     complete and/or the entire advance has been settled by performance, there should be no remaining
     UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR. Note: Upon contract award or obligation
     of the MIPR action, the entire amount of the obligation must be established in the accounting system
     as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor “4” or "5" PSR/FSR, as applicable.

6.2. Partial Advance of MIPR. If a partial advance payment/billing is authorized, the requiring activity
will forward a copy of the DD Form 448-2 to the DFAS operating location for processing.
     6.2.1. Accounting for the Partial Advance Payment. The DFAS operating location will process the
     DD Form 448-2 advance as a negative UOO and a positive AEP transaction using a type vendor “2”
     PSR/FSR and project code of "9910" or "9940". The UOO balance set up for the contract award or
     obligation of the MIPR action is not adjusted based on the advance payment. The entire amount of
     this obligation is reflected in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor
     “4” or "5" PSR/FSR, as applicable. These transactions will show up as separate line items on the
     Open Document List; the advance under a type vendor “2” DSR/PSR and a project code of "9910" or
     "9940", and the contract award or obligation of the MIPR under a type vendor “4" or "5" DSR/PSR,
     as applicable, without the project code of "9910" or "9940".
     6.2.2. Actions during Contract Performance. As performance occurs, the requiring activity forwards
     receiving reports and invoices to the applicable DFAS operating location for processing to draw down
     the advance amount from the type vendor “2” DSR/PSR and charge the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/
     PSR in the accounting system.
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             19


   6.2.3. Entire Advance is Settled. When the partial advance has been settled by performance, there
   should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR, and the AEP bal-
   ance should now be reflected in the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR. The remaining unexpended
   UOO balance in the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR is to support the additional payment(s) required
   to complete the MIPR action. DFAS operating locations will process the payment(s) against the “4”
   or "5" DSR/PSR through the final invoice.
   6.2.4. Final Invoice. Once payment for the final invoice has been processed against the type vendor
   “4” or "5" DSR/PSR, any remaining balance on the MIPR must be deobligated from the type vendor
   “4” or "5" DSR/PSR upon receipt of an amended DD Form 448-2 from the assisting agency. When the
   action procured by the MIPR is complete, and any remaining balance on the MIPR deobligated, there
   should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR and only an AEP
   balance in the "4" or "5" PSR/FSR.

6.3. Full Advance of MIPR. If a full advance payment/billing is authorized, the requiring activity will
forward a copy of the DD Form 448-2 to the DFAS operating location for processing. The DFAS operat-
ing location will process the DD Form 448-2 advance as a negative UOO and a positive AEP transaction
using a type vendor “2” PSR/FSR and project code of "9910" or "9940". The UOO balance set up for the
contract award or obligation of the MIPR action is not adjusted based on the advance payment. The entire
amount of this obligation is reflected in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type
vendor “4” or "5" PSR/FSR, as applicable. These transactions will show up as separate line items on the
Open Document List; the advance under a type vendor “2” DSR/PSR and a project code of "9910" or
"9940", and the contract award or obligation of the MIPR under a type vendor “4" or "5" DSR/PSR, as
applicable, without the project code of "9910" or "9940".
   6.3.1. Actions during Contract Performance. As performance occurs through the final invoice, the
   requiring activity forwards receiving reports and invoices to the applicable DFAS operating location
   for processing to draw down the advance amount from the type vendor “2” DSR/PSR and charge the
   type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR in the accounting system.
   6.3.2. Final Invoice. Once the final invoice has been processed, any remaining balance on the
   advance must be collected back from the assisting agency and then any remaining balance on the
   MIPR must be deobligated from the type vendor “4” or "5" DSR/PSR upon receipt of an amended DD
   Form 448-2 from the assisting agency. When the action procured by the MIPR is complete, and any
   excess advance collected back from the assisting agency and any remaining balance on the MIPR
   deobligated, there should be no remaining UOO and AEP balances in the type vendor "2" DSR/PSR
   and only an AEP balance in the "4" or "5" PSR/FSR.

6.4. Recording of Contract Award for Direct Cite MIPR. The FMA office sends the contract award
document for Category II direct cite MIPRs, to the applicable DFAS operating location for processing the
obligation in the requiring activity's accounting records. The funds are obligated in the accounting system
using the Doc ID of the contract award document.

6.5. Recording of Obligation for Reimbursable MIPRs. The funds are obligated in the accounting
system using DD Form 448-2, MIPR Acceptance, with a Doc ID “MIPR”. The entire amount of the obli-
gation is established in the accounting system as a positive UOO balance under a type vendor “4” or "5"
PSR/FSR, as applicable, without the project code of "9910" or "9940".
20                                                                AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


6.6. Monthly Validation Process. The PM or RA/RM must validate all outstanding MIPRs on a
monthly basis to ensure timely processing of invoices and timely deobligation of excess funds. The PM
or RA/RM should run a query at the end of each month using the Commander’s Resource Information
System (CRIS). (Contact your base FMA on procedures to acquire access to CRIS). The CRIS query for
an ODL should include at a minimum the following “data elements” and “account balances” to ensure all
outstanding MIPRs are retrieved:
     6.6.1. For advances: Type Vendor Code “2”, Commitment Balance “COM”, Unfilled Orders Out-
     standing “UOO” (obligation), Accrued Expenditure Unpaid “AEU”, Accrued Expenditure Paid
     “AEP”.
     6.6.2. For Category I MIPRs. Doc ID “MIPR”, Commitment Balance “COM”, Unfilled Orders
     Outstanding “UOO” (obligation), Accrued Expenditure Unpaid “AEU”, Accrued Expenditure Paid
     “AEP”.
     6.6.3. For Category II MIPRs (recorded under the contract number): Type Vendor Code “4” or "5",
     Commitment Balance “COM”, Unfilled Orders Outstanding “UOO” (obligation), Accrued Expendi-
     ture Unpaid “AEU”, Accrued Expenditure Paid “AEP”, but consult assisting DFAS operating loca-
     tion for criteria to narrow scope of CRIS query, if required.
     6.6.4. Monthly Validation. When performing the monthly outstanding MIPR validation, it is impor-
     tant for the PM or RA/RM to work with their base FMA office to confirm their balances and work any
     discrepancies with the DFAS operating location. Also work with the assisting agency to correct any
     billing discrepancies or adjustments that require an amended DD Form 448-2. This will ensure
     invoices are processed in a timely manner and also allow for the timely obligation/deobligation of
     funds. Note: Data elements “Type Vendor Code” (2) should only be used in the CRIS query when an
     advance payment has been authorized for the MIPR.

6.7. Stages of Accounting.
     6.7.1. Commitment Balance (COM) - Initial reservation of funds prior to MIPR acceptance
     6.7.2. Unfilled Orders Outstanding (UOO) – Funds are obligated via MIPR acceptance or awarded
     contract.
     6.7.3. Accrued Expenditures Unpaid (AEU) – Services or goods have been received, but not paid.
     6.7.4. Accrued Expenditures Paid (AEP) – Services or goods have been received, invoiced and paid.

Terms
Acquisition—The acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supplies or services (including
construction) by and for the use of the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the
supplies or services are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated.
Acquisition begins at the point when agency needs are established and includes the description of
requirements to satisfy agency needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award of contracts, contract
financing, contract performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions
directly related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract.
Acquisition Planning—The process by which the efforts of all personnel responsible for an acquisition
are coordinated and integrated through a comprehensive plan for fulfilling the agency need in a timely
manner and at a reasonable cost. It includes developing the overall strategy for managing the acquisition.
Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS)—T h o s e s e r v i c e s p r o v i d e d u n d e r c o n t r a c t b y
nongovernmental sources to support or improve: organizational policy development; decision-making;
management and administration; program and/or project management and administration; or R&D
activities. It can also mean the furnishing of professional advice or assistance rendered to improve the
effectiveness of federal management processes or procedures (including those of an engineering and
technical nature). In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice,
opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training, and the day-to-day aid of
support personnel needed for the successful performance of ongoing Federal operations. All advisory and
assistance services are classified in one of the following definitional subdivisions:
     1. Management and professional support services, i.e., contractual services that provide assis-
        tance, advice or training for the efficient and effective management and operation of organiza-
        tions, activities (including management and support services for R&D activities), or systems.
        These services are normally closely related to the basic responsibilities and mission of the agency
        originating the requirement for the acquisition of services by contract. Included are efforts that
        support or contribute to improved organization of program management, logistics management,
        project monitoring and reporting, data collection, budgeting, accounting, performance auditing,
        and administrative technical support for conferences and training programs.
     2. Studies, analyses and evaluations, i.e., contracted services that provide organized, analytical
        assessments/evaluations in support of policy development, decision-making, management, or
        administration. Included are studies in support of R&D activities. Also included are acquisitions
        of models, methodologies, and related software supporting studies, analyses or evaluations.
     3. Engineering and technical services, i.e., contractual services used to support the program office
        during the acquisition cycle. As defined in OMB Circular A-109, provides such services as sys-
        tems engineering and technical direction to ensure the effective operation and maintenance of a
        weapon system or major system and provides direct support of a weapon system that is essential
        to research, development, production, operation or maintenance of the system.
Anti-Deficiency Act—Consists of several statutes that authorize administrative and criminal sanctions
for the unlawful obligation and expenditure of appropriated funds consisting of: obligation and expense
of appropriations only for a proper purpose; within the time limits applicable to the appropriation (e.g., O
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                                  25


& M funds are available for obligation for one fiscal year); for bona fide needs that arise during the
appropriation period of availability; and obligate more than the amount appropriated by Congress.
Assisted Acquisition—A contract awarded or a task or delivery order placed on behalf of an agency by
another agency whether or not subject to the Economy Act.
Assisting Agency/Activity—An agency or activity authorized to award contracts or orders for DoD
federal agencies/activities. Also referred to as a assisting, supporting, or supplying agency/activity.
Examples are GSA, GovWorks, FedSource, Veteran’s Administration, and National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA).
Automated Business Services System (ABSS)—A FM system that automates the creation of financial
documents (e.g., Purchase Requests, MIPRs, MORDS, etc.) and electronically routes those documents
through the approval process. It provides electronic interfaces to the Air Force standard accounting
systems, as well as the Air Force standard contracting systems, to cut down on the occurrence of data
input errors.
Business Event Transaction Code (BETA)—Indicates the type of activity being reported (payments,
collections, borrowings, etc.) in the Government wide Accounting System (IPAC).
Bona fide Need Rule—States that a fiscal year’s (or period’s) appropriation may only be obligated to
meet a legitimate need arising in, or in some cases arising prior to but continuing to exist in, the fiscal year
(or period) for which the appropriation was made. This rule has a statutory basis in 31 U.S.C. Sec 1502.
Business Partner Number (BPN)—Identifies a government entity for the purpose of intra-governmental
transactions. Air Force uses the BPN in a number of different circumstances and systems. It replaces the
Stock Record Account Number (SRAN) in the first six positions of commitment documents (example: AF
Form 9 and MIPRs).
C4 Systems Requirements Document (CSRD), AF Form 3215—PMs may use this form to submit and
process communications-related requirements. See AFI 33-103, Requirements Development and
Processing, to seek approval from the supporting communications squadron or program office
communications experts to purchase information technology or telecommunications requirements. An
approved AF Form 3215 is also called a technical solution.
Commitment—A specified amount of available funds reserved in the accounting system to fund an
identified requirement. Once committed, funds are not available for other funding needs. The three most
commonly used commitment documents are the AF Form 9, AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization and,
prior to its acceptance by the assisting agency, DD Form 448.
Contracting Office—For the purposes of this instruction the contracting office is the office designated to
support the requiring activity for contracting actions and advice.
Contracting Officer Representative (COR)—An individual designated and authorized in writing by
the contracting officer to perform specific technical or administrative functions. CORs must be
designated in writing and provided to the contractor. The contracting officer will specify the extent of the
COR’s authority to act on behalf of the contracting officer. The COR is not authorized to make any
commitments or changes that will affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other term or condition of
the contract.
Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)—The accounting agency for DoD and is also
responsible for the payment of all DoD contracts.
26                                                                     AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


Delivery Order—A delivery order is an order for supplies placed against an established contract.
Determinations and Findings (D&F)—A special form of written approval by an authorized official that
is required by statute or regulation as a prerequisite to taking certain contract actions. The “determination”
is a conclusion or decision supported by the “findings”. The findings are statements of fact or rationale
essential to support the determination and must cover each requirement of the applicable statutes or
regulations. A D&F for an Economy Act order has findings that support the determination that an intra- or
interagency order is in the best interests of the government.
Direct Acquisition—A task or delivery order placed by an Air Force contracting officer against a
contract established outside DoD.
Direct Cite Order—An order that provides direct funding authority to the assisting agency to “cite
directly” the line of accounting of the requiring activity. Also known as a Category II MIPR.
Economy Act Order (Title 31, U.S.C. Section 1535, FAR Part 17.5)—Authorizes federal agencies to
order goods or services from or through other federal agencies and to pay the actual costs of those goods
or services provided: funds are available, the head of the requiring activity or unit decides the order is in
the best interest of the U.S. Government, the agency or unit asked to fill the order is able to provide the
ordered goods or services, the head of the agency decides that the ordered goods or services cannot be
provided as conveniently or economically by a commercial enterprise.
Fund Certifying Official—The individual in Financial Management Analysis (FMA) who executes the
funds authorization portion of a DD Form 448, blocks 14-17, or other equivalent forms. This official is
responsible for the execution and oversight of funding to a non-DoD organization in support of an order
for supplies or services, certifying that funds for the procurement are properly chargeable to the
allotment(s) provided, and that the available balances are sufficient to cover the estimated price of the
order.
Independent Government Estimate (IGE)—An estimate of the cost or price of an acquisition
developed by the requiring activity. Used for establishing the amount of funding required to begin an
acquisition and to establish a basis for negotiation of price proposals received from offerors.
Interagency Agreement—A written agreement between an Air Force requiring activity and a federal
assisting agency for the Air Force to purchase specific goods or services under agreed terms and
conditions. The interagency agreement must be signed by the requiring activity program/project manager
with budget authority and bona fide need for the support, services, or goods procured on the MIPR.
Interagency MIPR—An acquisition in which an Air Force activity obtains supplies/services from an
agency outside the DoD using a DD Form 448 to order and fund the requirement.
Intra-agency MIPR—An acquisition in which an Air Force activity obtains supplies/services from an
agency within DoD using a DD Form 448 to order and fund the requirement.
Justification and Approval (J&A)—Justification and Approvals for the use of other than full and open
competition. Explains the rationale and documents higher level approval for sole source or limited
competitions as required by the Competition in Contracting Act.
Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)—T h e p r i m a r y d o c u m e n t u s e d b y t h e
Department of Defense to order goods or services from other DoD Services or Components, as well as
other Government activities outside the DoD. The goods or services may be provided from in-house
AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                             27


resources or may be procured from commercial sources. The Air Force uses the AF Form 616 for orders
between Air Force units.
Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) Acceptance—O n c e a n a s s i s t i n g a g e n c y
receives a MIPR, it must formally accept or reject the order represented by the MIPR. Agencies accept
the order by completing the DD Form 448-2 and returning it to the requiring unit within 30 days to the
Program Manager.
Non-severable—A deliverable item that is a single end product or undertaking, entire in nature that
cannot be feasibly subdivided without losing its identity. A non-severable service is one that goes toward
a defined end result. For example, a contract to re-carpet or paint an office is non-severable—the
customer needs the whole thing done, i.e., the end result of the service. Also, performance of a research
study with a final report would be a non-severable service. See also Severable.
Non-severable Work—and Services--Must be delivered whole or to completion to realize any benefit
and fulfill the requirement. A simple example would be a contract for the construction of a bridge across
a river that would start on January 1, 2006 and complete on December 31, 2006. If the contract was
terminated, prior to completion, (June 30, 2006), no benefit would be realized because only half a bridge
would exist and it would not fulfill the original requirement to move traffic from one side of the river to
the other. When considering whether an effort is severable or non-severable, careful consideration must
be given to the original need that generated the requirement. In the simple example of a severable service,
specifying that a report on the amount of garbage removed as of December 31, 2006, does not
automatically convert the work and services provided to non-severable. In general, services tend to be
severable while the construction and/or delivery of goods tends to be non-severable.
Obligation—(related to MIPRs)--The liability to pay for the cost of goods and services to be delivered
under a purchase order or contract. The DD Form 448-2 is the obligating document for Category I,
Reimbursable MIPRs and the contract award document is the obligating document for Category II, Direct
Cite MIPRs.
Open Document Listing (ODL)—A computerized list of open commitments (COM), obligations
(UOO), and accrued expenditures unpaid (AEU) extracted from the General Accounting and Finance
System. The RA/RM can request a list at any time. The list enables the PM to monitor and manage open
commitments and obligations. The ODL is a useful tool to help you successfully manage your funds.
Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA)—An acquisition for services that is structured
around the results to be achieved as opposed to the manner by which the work is to be performed. A
PBSA must state measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.)
and state the method of assessing contractor performance against performance standards and may have
performance incentives where appropriate.
Period of Availability—The period during which funds are available for commitment, obligation, and
execution before they expire and are unusable. Also see Bona Fide Need Rule.
Performance Work Statement (PWS)—Describes the required performance results in clear, specific
and objective terms with measurable outcomes for a performance-based services acquisition (PBSA).
Also known as a Statement of Work (SOW).
Project Order—An order issued under the authority contained in 41 U.S.C. 23. Project orders are issued
by and accepted for performance in a DoD owned and operated establishment. When placed with, and
accepted by, a DoD establishment, the project order serves to obligate appropriations in the same manner
28                                                                   AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


as orders or contracts placed with commercial enterprises. The activity receiving a project order must be
capable of manufacturing the goods or supplying the services requested on the order and not simply a
conduit or middleman for funds used to procure the goods or services.
Reimbursement—Funding received by an assisting agency for the cost of goods or services furnished to
others, for credit to the assisting agency’s own appropriation or other fund account.
Reimbursable Order—The assisting agency finances an Air Force purchase of goods and services and
bills the Air Force for reimbursement. Also known as a Category I MIPRs.
Requiring Activity—The unit/activity requiring goods or services, provides funding to fulfill the
requirement, and requests assistance from an assisting agency. Also referred to as the requiring,
receiving, or requesting agency/activity.
Services Designated Official (SDO)—the individual authorized IAW the FY02 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 2330(a)(2)(A) to exercise responsibility for the management and
oversight of the acquisition of services. These responsibilities include ensuring services acquisitions are
performance-based; approving, in advance, any acquisition that is not performance-based; and approving
the acquisition of services procured through the use of a contract or task order being awarded by an
agency other than DoD.
Severable—A deliverable item that has an end product or undertaking that if ended suddenly the
government has received the full value of the service up to the time it ended. For example, 24-hour
computer help desk support is severable because complete service is received at the end of each day.
Severable work and services can be stopped prior to the originally planned term and the requiring activity
still received benefit. A simple example would be a contract for weekly garbage removal from January 1,
2006 to December 31, 2006. If the contract was terminated in mid-term, (June 30, 2006), the benefit of
having the garbage removed from January to June 2006 would still be realized. See also Non-severable
and Severable versus Non-severable.
Severable versus Non-severable Services—A designation describing the type and term of material,
work, or services. It differentiates as to whether any benefit is received by the requiring activity
throughout the period while materials, work, or services are being provided (severable) or whether the
benefit comes at the end of the period of the contract (non-severable).
Statement of Work (SOW)—A detailed description of the services a contractor is required to perform,
written by the PM or designee, that describes the desired results, performance measures, and other
instructions as necessary. The SOW establishes the bona-fide need of the government. For assistance in
drafting a SOW, see the assisting contracting office.
Support Agreement—A written agreement that establishes the roles and responsibilities for recurring
support between the requiring activity and the assisting agency. Support agreements may be intra-agency
(between DoD federal agencies) or interagency (between DoD and non-DoD federal agencies). Also may
be referred to as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
Task Order—A task order is an order for services placed against an established contract.

   1 PM Identifies Requirement Identify needed support, supplies, or services to be purchased and
      (Market Research)        conduct market research to determine potential sources. Contact
                               the supporting Air Force contracting office for assistance.
                               Document your market research.
   2 Obtain RA/RM or FMA       The PM should contact the RA/RM or FMA who will confirm
      Business Advice          funding availability and if funding is appropriate for the
                               acquisition (purpose, time, and amount).
   3 PM Obtains Contracting    Contracting business advice is essential. When the requirement is
      Business Advice          identified, the PM should contact the supporting Air Force
                               contracting office to discuss the requirement. Contracting can
                               advise whether the desired goods or services can be best
                               purchased by the contracting office or by another agency using a
                               MIPR. The contracting office will recommend a sourcing
                               strategy that considers such factors as satisfying customer
                               requirements, cost effectiveness and price, delivery schedule,
                               availability of a suitable existing contract (within or outside DoD),
                               contract administration, small business opportunities, compliance
                               with DoD acquisition regulations and acquisition lead time. If a
                               MIPR is determined to be the appropriate purchase request
                               vehicle, the contracting office will help to confirm with a
                               contracting officer from the assisting agency that the supplies or
                               services to be provided are within scope of the assisting agency
                               contract and any unique Air Force or DoD contract terms and
                               conditions are incorporated into the resultant order to comply with
                               applicable statutes, regulations and directives (e.g., requirement of
                               DFAR 225.7002-1 that certain items procured with DoD funds be
                               of domestic origin). In addition, the contracting office will advise
                               the requiring activity of other required supporting documentation,
                               such as certification of proper use of non-DoD contracts. See

   4 Determine Applicable      Contact the assisting agency to determine if the order is authorized
      Authority                by a specific statutory authority or if it must be approved under the
                               Economy Act Authority.
  4A Specific Authority        When a specific statutory authority applies, the assisting agency
                               must cite the applicable statute on the DD Form 448-2. See
                               Paragraph B of Attachment 6.

                                     an automated system that interfaces with ABSS. FMA will
                                     provide ABSS training to new users. FMA will also establish the
                                     proper document flow for your organization. Anyone with the
                                     need to create MIPRs can use ABSS after completing training.
                                     Most often, the RA/RM or PM will use ABSS to create the MIPR.
                                     Sometimes another person, a MIPR initiator, will create the
                                     MIPR. Regardless of who creates the MIPR, the PM retains
                                     responsibility for procuring the requirement and tracking the
                                     funds spent. Once the MIPR has been created and approved in the
                                     requiring activity, the ABSS flow will send the MIPR and
                                     attachments to the supporting Air Force contracting office. See

                                specialist does not approve/disapprove the package. Rather, the
                                PM retains the responsibility for completeness and compliance.
                                See Attachment 3 for a review checklist. For MIPRs that do not
                                result in a contracting action, a contracting specialist will flow the

            INTERAGENCY ACQUISITION DETERMINATIONS AND FINDINGS
Applicable for assisted and direct acquisitions when MIPR value exceeds $100K
A7.1. For acquisition of services, the Services Designated Official (SDO) must approve the Determina-
tions and Findings (D&F) before the MIPR is sent to the non-DoD agency. The supporting Air Force con-
tracting office can determine who the appropriate SDO level is for your MIPR.
A7.2. For acquisition of supplies, the program/project manager for the acquisition must justify a
non-DoD acquisition and sign the certification. For direct acquisitions, the Air Force contracting officer
must also sign the D&F.
A7.3. Retain the D&F with other MIPR documentation. The documentation supporting the D&F must
justify the requirements below:

                                        MIPR #______________________________
1. I have reviewed the requirement for (insert description of supply or service to be procured) that (insert Air Force
requiring activity) intends to place with (insert agency) as an interagency acquisition. My review produced the following
findings:


    a. Use of a non-DoD contract is in the best interest of the Air Force considering the factors of satisfying customer
requirements, cost effectiveness and price, delivery schedule, non-availability of a suitable contract within DoD, contract
administration, small business opportunities, and any other factors as applicable.


   b. The supplies/services to be provided are within the scope of the contract to be used. (Coordinate with the non-DoD
Contracting Officer to verify the requirement is within the scope of the assisting agency's selected contract.)


  c. Funding appropriation is legal and proper for the acquisition and used in accordance with any appropriation limitations.
(FMA will validate that the funds are appropriate for the acquisition.)


    d. Terms, conditions and requirements unique to DoD or the Air Force are included in the acquisition package for the
assisting agency to incorporate into the resultant order or contract to comply with applicable statutes, regulations and
directives (e.g., the requirement that the items listed in DFARS 225.7002-1 and procured with DoD funds be of domestic
origin, unique identification requirements, etc.).


2. Given the findings outlined above, I hereby determine that it is in the best interest of the Government to place an order for
(insert requirement) with (insert agency).

                             MIPR #______________________________

1. I have reviewed the requirement for (insert description of supply or service to be procured) that
(insert Air Force requiring activity) intends to place with (insert agency) as an order under the Economy
Act. My review produced the following findings:

     a. The assisting agency has confirmed it does not have a specific statutory authority to fill this
     request. The assisting agency has agreed to accept the request under the authority of the Economy
     Act;

     b. The supplies or services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting
     directly with a private source;

     c. The action does not conflict with any other agency's authority or responsibility (see FAR
     Part 8);

(Insert at least one of the three statements below for Economy Act orders that require contract action
by the assisting agency to show which circumstances apply.)

     d. The acquisition will appropriately be made under an existing contract of the assisting agency,
     entered into before placement of the order, to meet the requirements of the assisting    agency for
     the same or similar supplies or services;

     d. The assisting agency has capabilities or expertise to enter into a contract for such supplies or
     services which is not available within the requesting agency;

     d. The assisting agency is specifically required by law or regulation to purchase such supplies   or
     services on behalf of other agencies.

(Insert the following if the work will be performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development
Center)

     e. The work will be performed by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center
     (FFRDC). Performance by the FFRDC will not place the assisting agency and the FFRDC in direct
     competition with private sources;
44                                                                  AFI65-116 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


(Insert the following if the work was previously performed by Government personnel and will now be
performed by a contractor under an assisting agency's contract, or if the work was previously
performed under a contract and will now be performed in house by the assisting agency. )

     f. The requiring activity has complied with the requirements of FAR 7.3, Contractor Versus
     Government Performance.

2. Given the findings outlined above, I hereby determine that it is in the best interest of the Government
to place an order for (insert requirement) with (insert agency) under the authority of the Economy Act.
