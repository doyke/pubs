Thermal Stress—Stress on an individual caused by either extreme heat or cold that could result
in injury or illness.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature—The measurement of environmental factors which nearly
correlate with deep body temperature and other physiological responses to heat. The
SCOTTAFBI48-105 11 APRIL 2011                                                                  5


determination of WBGT requires the use of a black globe thermometer, a natural (static) wet-
bulb thermometer, and a dry-bulb thermometer.
Equivalent Chill Temperature—Wind chill cooling rate and the cooling power of air are
critical factors. Cooling rate is defined as heat loss from a body due to the air temperature and
wind velocity upon the exposed body. Higher wind speeds and lower temperatures in the work
area require a greater insulation value of protective clothing.

                              GUIDELINES FOR HEAT STRESS

A2.1. Types of Heat Stress, Symptoms, and First-Aid Measures:
     A2.1.1. Sunburn: Caused from overexposure to sunlight or ultraviolet lamps.
        A2.1.1.1. Symptoms: Redness, painful skin, swelling of skin and blistering.
        A2.1.1.2. First-Aid Measures: Remove from sun, drink fluids, take analgesics for pain
        relief, apply moisturizing creams; if blisters are present, and do not break them open.
     A2.1.2. Fainting: Experienced in unacclimated individuals.
        A2.1.2.1. Symptoms: Sweating, weakness, lightheadedness, numbness, blurred vision,
        and ultimately loss of consciousness.
        A2.1.2.2. First-Aid Measures: Remove from heat, drink fluids, rest and keep head in a
        low position.
     A2.1.3. Cramps: Caused by internal electrolyte imbalance.
        A2.1.3.1. Symptoms:      Painful spasms of arm and leg muscles and abdomen; often
        vomiting and fatigue.
        A2.1.3.2. First-Aid Measures: Rest, cool environment and drink electrolyte solutions
        (sports drinks).
     A2.1.4. Heat Exhaustion: May or may not have an elevated temperature and will likely have
     weakness, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, and a headache.
        A2.1.4.1. Symptoms: Profuse sweating, pale, moist cool skin, rapid pulse, weakness,
        fatigue, thirst, giddiness, headache, and confusion.
        A2.1.4.2. First-Aid Measures: Rest and fluids (water) and electrolyte (sports drinks)
        replacement.
     A2.1.5. Heat Stroke: Internal temperature control mechanism no longer working.
        A2.1.5.1. Symptoms: May either be sweating or have dry skin, have irritability,
        confusion, bizarre behavior, combativeness, hallucinations, seizures, or coma.
        A2.1.5.2. First-Aid Measures: Heatstroke is a life-threatening emergency. Call 911 for
        immediate transport to a medical facility. Once heatstroke is suspected, efforts to lower
        the body temperature should be initiated immediately by whatever means available. A
        delay in cooling contributes to the mortality rate associated with heatstroke.
A2.2. Risk Factors:
     A2.2.1. Forty years of age or more.
     A2.2.2. Pregnancy.
     A2.2.3. Fifteen pounds or more above optimal weight.
     A2.2.4. Chronic diseases (heart disease and/or diabetes).
     A2.2.5. Lack of physical conditioning.
SCOTTAFBI48-105 11 APRIL 2011                                                                    7


   A2.2.6. Drugs/medications (e.g., cold medications and/or antihistamines).
   A2.2.7. Alcohol consumption.
   A2.2.8. Previous episodes of heat stress.
A2.3. Prevention:
   A2.3.1. Ensure all personnel are educated on the signs and symptoms of heat stress, WBGT
   and measures to protect themselves.
   A2.3.2. Adjust work schedules so heavy work is done early in the morning or after sunset
   when temperatures are cooler.
   A2.3.3. Encourage early reporting of heat-stress symptoms.
   A2.3.4. Maintain proper hydration. Drink small amounts of water frequently for best results.
   A2.3.5. Do not use salt pills, unless under the direction of a healthcare provider.
   A2.3.6. Wear appropriate clothing. Loose, breathable clothing, such as cotton, is
   recommended when possible. Personnel should wear sun protection, either light-colored
   clothing or sunscreen. If personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn, precautions
   should be taken to account for the extra heat loading caused by the PPE.
A2.4. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature. WBGT is the temperature index used in hot conditions
that combines dry temperature, humidity, and radiant heat to describe the stressors on human
beings. The WBGT is the industry standard for occupational exposure and is designed to protect
the average healthy worker. Protection factors are based on work exertion, consisting of work-
rest regimens based on the WBGT temperature and work exertion or amount of heat produced by
the body.

                            GUIDELINES FOR COLD STRESS

A3.1. Types of Cold Stress, Signs and Symptoms and First-Aid Measures:
   A3.1.1. Trench foot: Exposure to wet and cold.
      A3.1.1.1. Symptoms:      Blood vessels contract, feet turn blue, ulcers may form and
      gangrene.
      A3.1.1.2. First-Aid Measures: Remove wet socks, gently wrap, and keep feet warm, dry,
      and elevated.
   A3.1.2. Immersion foot: Due to immersion in cold water.
      A3.1.2.1. Symptoms: Same as above although feet may appear white, blue, or purple.
      A3.1.2.2. First-Aid Measures: Same as above. It is important to seek immediate
      medical attention. In the interim, keep the area warm and insulated to avoid re-freezing.
   A3.1.3. Frostbite: Freezing of tissue in 24 hours, swelling, and edema, blistering; after 7-10
   days the affected tissue turns black and sloughs off.
      A3.1.3.1. Symptoms: Appearance is white to blue/purple; stinging, burning, throbbing
      or shooting pains in the affected tissue.
      A3.1.3.2. First-Aid Measures: Seek immediate medical attention, get in warm area,
      remove wet clothing, and thaw affected tissue by misting with clean warm water between
      104 degrees to 107 degrees F. Do not use hot water, campfires, heaters, or rub frostbitten
      tissue with snow. Give hot drink (no alcohol); thawed skin will be painful, turn
      red/purple and soft. Avoid refreezing by keeping the area warm and dry.
   A3.1.4. Hypothermia: Core body temperature of less than 95 degrees F.
      A3.1.4.1. Symptoms: 89.6 – 95 degrees F constitute mild hypothermia; below 89.6
      degree F gives way to the slowing stage. Shivering until core temperature decreases to
      86 degrees F; greater risk for dysrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms) as body temperature
      decreases; slowed vital signs, confusion, rigid muscles > 80 degrees F, and limp muscles
      < 80 degrees F.
      A3.1.4.2. First-Aid Measures: Accidental hypothermia caused purely by environmental
      exposure may be discharged after re-warming using endogenous heat produced by
      metabolism or heated air forced through slits, provided they are asymptomatic and can
      return to a warm environment. Most other patients require immediate medical attention.
      If excessive shivering or no longer shivering, remove from cold and wind, remove wet or
      constrictive clothing, rewarm gently, do not permit exercise, give hot fluids by mouth and
      no alcohol. Both inhalation re-warming and administration of heated fluids should be
      used in all patients.
A3.2. Risk Factors:
   A3.2.1. Forty or more years of age.
   A3.2.2. Circulatory disease or poor circulation.

   A3.2.3. Drugs/medication (morphine, barbiturates).
   A3.2.4. Alcohol consumption.
   A3.2.5. Prior episode of cold stress.
A3.3. Prevention:
   A3.3.1. Ensure all personnel are educated on the signs and symptoms of cold stress, ECT,
   and measures to protect themselves.
   A3.3.2. Proper eating and drinking habits help the body maintain normal temperature. When
   exposed to extreme cold, eat high calorie meals and drink lots of fluids.
   A3.3.3. Wear appropriate clothing. Loose fitting, layered clothing is the best. Synthetic
   insulating materials (polypropylene, gortex) are recommended because they help keep
   moisture away from the body. Outer layer should be wind and rain resistant. Remove wet
   clothing.
   A3.3.4. Encourage early reporting of symptoms of cold stress.
   A3.3.5. If possible, erect windbreaks, provide heating units.
A3.4. ECT Index. This index takes into account both the temperature and wind speed. The
greater the wind speed, the greater the cooling effect on exposed skin. The following guidelines
are for individuals working outside for prolonged periods of time:

Table A3.1. ECT Index.
ECT (Degrees F)               Clothing Requirements and Other Recommendations
<40                           Field jacket
                              Leather gloves
<30                           Cover metal tool handles with thermal insulation
<25                           Field jacket
                              Leather gloves
                              Thermal underwear
<10                           Parka
                              Leather gloves with thermal inserts
                              Thermal underwear
                              No prolonged sitting or standing
                              No skin contact with bare metal surfaces
                              Prohibit use of unprotected metal chairs
                              Implement the ―Buddy System‖
At or below -20 degrees F, the above recommendations apply with work-rest regimens. Rest
should take place in a heated area.
-20 to -29 F                  work 45 min, rest 15 min
-30 to -39 F                  work 30 min, rest 30 min
-40 to -49 F                  work 15 min, rest 45 min
-50 F and less                restricted
