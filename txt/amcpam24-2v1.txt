This pamphlet series enables application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation –
Part III Mobility, Appendix V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-
402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all United
States Air Force (USAF), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Air National Guard (ANG) and
Department of Defense (DOD) agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets
contained herein, in accordance with DOD, inter-service, and/or Major Command (MAJCOM)
agreements. This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic
information, data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and
individual movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment
and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be
noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary
widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the Department of Defense (DOD). Ensure all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained In
Accordance With (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS).

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan commercial aircraft during CRAF activation. While most guidelines in this pamphlet
are similar to those used in routine/non-activation operations involving commercial carriers,
some changes come into play during actual CRAF activations.
1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 4 contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each sub-
volume addendum addressing a different aircraft series or type. Each can be referenced
separately from another; however, each addendum must be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.
1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in Attachment 1.
1.6. Responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities of various agencies supporting the CRAF
program are beyond the scope of this publication; a more detailed explanation can be found in
AMCI 10-402. The intent of this section is to give general guidance on what may be expected in
the load planning process when assigned a CRAF carrier for movement.
   1.6.1. USTRANSCOM. The Commander, US Transportation Command (TCCC), with the
   approval of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), can activate any of the three stages of the
   CRAF. Per Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Department of Transportation (DOT)
   concurrence is required for allocation of aircraft for CRAF Stage III activation. CRAF
   aircraft may be selectively activated and used up to the full numbers composing whichever
   stage has been approved by the SECDEF. In addition, USTRANSCOM, through TCAQ-C
   generates, manages, and maintains the contracts and admission process into the CRAF
   program.
   1.6.2. Contract Administrators. The Air Mobility Command Instruction (AMCI) 10-402
   Civil Reserve Air Fleet and United States Transportation Command Instruction
   (USTRANSCOMI) 24-9 Civil Airlift Programs provide the policies and procedures for
   management of commercial airlift and CRAF related contracts, agreements, and programs.
   USTRANSCOM maintains overall administration of CRAF contracts, while the TCAQ-C
   Operating Locations (OL) generally manages the administration of their geographic or
 6                                                           AMCPAM24-2V1 6 AUGUST 2014

     (i.e., use of their service’s movement validation process) to make airlift requests, the
     following table is provided for information.

                                       LOAD PLANNING

2.1. General Principles. This pamphlet will NOT make you an AMC certified Load Planner,
nor is it intended, in any way, to replace AMC’s Equipment Preparation and/or Airlift Planners
Course. Some basic load planning concepts will be touched upon. The focus of this chapter,
however, is to expand on the similarities and the differences of commercial airlift versus military
airlift load planning. Sub-topics will be expanded upon in their own chapters.
2.2. Definitions and Meaning.
     2.2.1. CRAF. The CRAF is a voluntary contractual program where civil carriers agree to
     augment military airlift during a crisis in exchange for peacetime defense business. During
     peacetime, regional contingencies, and major exercises, CRAF carriers voluntarily contract
     to fulfill personnel and cargo movement requirements. CRAF carriers are contracted daily to
     fly various categories of airlift, to include channel airlift, SAAMs, exercise support,
     contingency support, and charter airlift. This augmentation is crucial to all common-users
     since it allows USTRANSCOM to continue to meet routine scheduled and surge
     commitments simultaneously. When needed, carriers participating in the CRAF program can
     be activated in one of three stages with each stage providing greater airlift capacity. These
     stages include Stage I—Committed Expansion (Regional Crisis or Small- Scale
     Contingency); Stage II—Defense Airlift Emergency (Major Theater War); and Stage III—
     National Emergency (Multiple Theater Wars and National Mobilization). CRAF carriers
     must be a U.S. entity or citizen owning U.S. registered aircraft that are certificated under
     Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FAR Part 121 rules. These aircraft are allocated by
     the DOT in accordance with DOD requirements and aircraft capabilities into segments, such
     as international (long-range, short-range, cargo, and passenger), national, and other segments
     as mutually agreed upon by the DOD and the DOT.
     2.2.2. Long-Range International. The standard long range capability is 3,500NM for both
     passenger and cargo aircraft while carrying a productive payload. A productive payload is
     75% of the aircraft’s maximum payload.
     2.2.3. Historic Usage. Up to 93% of all passengers and approximately 40% of all cargo
     moved via CRAF during its Stage II activation for Operation DESERT STORM and its Stage
     I (passenger only) activation for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. Furthermore, historical data
     has shown that CRAF typically operates at a sustainment average of 87% of the maximum
     allowable cabin load (ACL) listed in this pamphlet.
     2.2.4. Meaning for Load Planning. While some, if not most carriers, are a part of the CRAF
     year in and year out, one cannot necessarily count on any one particular carrier’s fleet for a
     given movement plan. Also, a consideration is that carriers may offer different airframes to
     the CRAF or even update their fleet since their last usage.
     2.2.5. Load Planning Factors. History has proven that the CRAF is a vital part of DOD’s
     airlift capability. However, the safe planning factor to use is 90% of the maximum ACLs
     listed until the Guaranteed ACL (GACL) for a given movement is known. This can be
     derived by referencing the carrier’s contract GACL.
AMCPAM24-2V1 6 AUGUST 2014                                                                        9


2.3. Aircraft Safety Considerations. It must be remembered that most civilian aircraft and
aircrews will not have defensive/protective equipment. The CRAF Enabling Concept described
in AMCI 10-402 allows for CRAF assets to transit Intermediate Staging Bases (ISBs) before
going into any particular area of responsibility, area of operations, or theater of operations. Even
with additional protective measures and support issued at ISBs, CRAF assets may still NOT be
allowed to fly directly to a planned offload location, dependent on the threat level.
2.4. Loading Restrictions. See: Chapter 3 – DIMENSIONAL PLANNING FACTORS
2.5. Center of Balance Considerations. The carrier is responsible for load planning, weight
and balance, secure fastening, and any required special handling. The carrier will ensure cargo
loaded is secure and in accordance with FARs and individual aircraft CG limits. This applies
even when cargo is loaded by government personnel. When an aircraft is overloaded, the carrier
shall decide the number of passengers, weight, or articles that shall be carried. The passenger
ACL will be reduced with the concurrence of the administrative contracting officer (ACO).
2.6. Ease of Onload/Ease of Offload Considerations. See: Chapter 4 – MATERIAL
HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE)
2.7. Cargo Categories and Considerations. See: Chapter 5 – ROLLING STOCK / LOOSE
CARGO CONSIDERATIONS and: Chapter 6 – PALLETIZED CARGO CONSIDERATIONS
   2.7.1. Bulk. General cargo, typically loaded on 463L pallets (108 inches by 88 inches) or
   containers. CRAF cargo aircraft will at a minimum, arrive at onload site with their main
   decks prepared for 463L pallets and lower lobes ready for bulk (floor loaded) cargo.
   2.7.2. Oversize. Cargo exceeding the usable dimension of a 463L pallet loaded to the design
   height of 96 inches, but equal to or less than 1,000 inches in length, 117 inches in width, and
   105 inches in height. This cargo is air transportable on most civilian contract cargo carriers,
   but dimensional compatibility must be checked.
   2.7.3. Outsize. Exceeds oversize dimensions (over 1,000 inches long, 117 inches wide,
   and/or 105 inches high in any one dimension) and requires the use of a C-5 or C-17 aircraft
   or surface transportation. Exception: Dependent on the actual piece of cargo, certain series
   of B747 and/or AN-124 may be able to accept it.
   2.7.4. Rolling Stock. Equipment that can be driven or rolled directly into the aircraft cargo
   compartment. Most civilian aircraft will not accept rolling stock. Those that do, will usually
   want it pre-loaded on a pallet sub-floor. Check individual addenda.
   2.7.5. Special. Items requiring specialized planning/preparation and handling procedures,
   such as mail, satellites, hazardous cargo, or nuclear weapons. Check with individual CRAF
   carrier representative (CASS) for detailed information regarding special cargo.
2.8. Hazardous Cargo (HAZMAT) Considerations. Airlift of military HAZMAT utilizing
contract air carriers during CRAF activation is authorized IAW Department of Transportation
Special Permits (DOT-SP) 7573 and 9232, and is prepared IAW DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, App. J
and App. BB, and AFMAN24-204(I), Attachment 23. However, if contract airlift is used for
other than a national emergency, ensure hazards are prepared IAW 49 CFR 100-199. See
AMCI10-402; Section 10M – “DOT Exemptions”, for detailed CRAF HAZMAT procedures.
2.9. Passenger Considerations. See Chapter 7 – PASSENGER CONSIDERATIONS.

2.10. Restraint Criteria. Air Transportability Test Loading Activity (ATTLA) standards for
restraint criteria are listed in Table 2.1. While these limits apply to securing loads onto USAF
military cargo aircraft, they can be used as a guide for CRAF aircraft. NOTE: These are
minimum levels of restraint. Individual carriers can require more than this, if deemed necessary.

Table 2.1. Restraint Criteria.
 Direction                        Level                      Input Condition
 Forward (fwd) 1                     3G           Hard landing or sudden deceleration
 Aft or rear                       1.5G                   Sudden acceleration
 Lateral (side)                    1.5G                         Skidding
 Up (vertical)                       2G                     Extreme turbulence
 Down 2                             4.5G                       Hard landing
 1. If personnel are located in front of cargo, the cargo item(s) must be restrained to 9Gs
 forward.
 2. Primary cargo must be restrained by cargo floor; secondary cargo must be restrained
 by primary cargo.

2.11. Commercial Aircraft Ground Times. TACC planners and controllers will ensure
commercial contracted cargo mission ground times are be based on narrow body or wide body
aircraft types as listed in Table 2.2 and commercial contracted passenger mission ground times
are based on contracted allowable cabin load (ACL) as listed in Table 2.3.
   2.11.1. Station Delay. When a commercial aircraft departs a station in delay, TACC/XOC
   controllers will contact the commercial carrier and USTC/TCAQ. The commercial carrier
   will provide a plan that attempts to return the mission back onto the originally scheduled
   times as allowed by follow-on arrivals, slot times, and mission needs. TACC/XOC
   controllers will ensure prior coordination with applicable agencies (Air Mobility Command
   Center, Command Post, Base Ops, Aerial Port, Etc...) is accomplished and appropriate
   deviation codes are accurately applied to all mission types.

                                           Chapter 3

                          DIMENSIONAL PLANNING FACTORS

3.1. Types. As previously discussed, civilian airframes vary widely from carrier to carrier and
quite often, within a carrier’s own fleet. It is not uncommon that notable variations occur
between the same type, model, and series of civil aircraft, depending upon the needs of the
carrier. Therefore, use the information in this publication for general planning purposes only.
Specific information (such as the number of passenger seats) may not be known until a specific
aircraft arrives at the onload station.
   3.1.1. Body Types. Generally, there are two basic body types – narrow and wide-body.
       3.1.1.1. Narrow-body. Narrow-body aircraft have a cabin diameter of approximately 10-
       13 ft. across and two rows of passenger seats (2-6 abreast) with a single center aisle.
       3.1.1.2. Wide-body. Wide-body aircraft have a wider cabin diameter (about 16-20 ft.
       across), have twin aisles for passengers (seating up to 11 abreast) and are more often used
       to ship cargo than narrow-body aircraft.
   3.1.2. Compartments.
       3.1.2.1. Types. The FAA defines the various compartments in an aircraft from Class A-
       E based on ventilation, fire detection/protection, and accessibility. When planning for
       loading, most compartments are simply referred to as: passenger, cargo, bulk, and
       baggage compartments. Furthermore, geographic locations are also attached (e.g.,
       forward lower cargo compartment, main deck). The words “deck” and “lobe” are
       virtually synonymous with compartment.
       3.1.2.2. Dimensions. Most civilian aircraft do NOT present a uniform loading dimension
       throughout each compartment. Expect narrowing/tapering along any compartment shape.
       Potentially, cargo needs to be contoured to fit into a given compartment, so cargo/pallet
       buildup and placement needs to account for this.
   3.1.3. Passenger Compartment Categories. There are primarily three categories that are
   referred to: passenger, freight, and COMBI. While all three categories can ship both cargo
   and passengers, the main difference is in how the main deck/passenger compartment is
   configured. For example, if the main deck is configured in COMBI mode, it means it will
   hold both cargo and passengers. NOTE: The COMBI mode will have the most variations in
   configuration.
3.2. Carrier Information. The carrier shall provide the following minimum information to 618
AOC (TACC) no later than 24 hours prior to departure time: type aircraft; tail number; ACL in
passenger seats and pounds for all scheduled segments; cube allowable in the belly
compartments and belly weight by compartment.
3.3. Manufacturer Specifications. The dimensional information presented in these pamphlets
has been derived from the manufacturers’ factory specifications. While a relatively good basic
starting point, all dimensions should be verified, since many civilian airframes have been
modified. Door opening dimensions, cargo compartment/lobe height, length, width, and seating
are subject to change with each airframe.
AMCPAM24-2V1 6 AUGUST 2014                                                                    13


3.4. Loading time. The clearance available during loading influences both the amount of time
necessary to load an item and the skill level required of the loading crew. In general, whenever
minimum clearance between the item and the aircraft structure exists, ground maneuvering and
flight operations are influenced. When the dimensions listed in the AMCPAM 24-2 Series
become an issue with the dimensional compatibility of an item of cargo, the loading times listed
in Table 2.2 should be questioned.
3.5. Unauthorized Dimension Restrictions. Prior to positioning the aircraft for flight, the
carrier shall remove all unauthorized cube restrictions from the cargo compartment. As
applicable, aircraft must be equipped with cargo sill guards when on/offloading cargo.
3.6. Permissible Reductions of ACL. Carriers are allowed 3% of available ACL, by weight,
for necessary self-support.
3.7. Air Transport Certification Requirement. Just because an item is shipped via CRAF
assets, it does NOT exempt it from being certified for air transport with ATTLA if it is deemed
an “air transportability problem item” by exceeding ANY of the following parameters. Contact
ATTLA at attla@wpafb.af.mil for further guidance.

Table 3.1. ATTLA Certification Parameters.
 Length: 20 ft. (240 in)                      Load Concentration: 1,600 lbs. per linear ft.
 Width: 8 ft. (96 in)                         Floor contact pressure: 50 psi
 Height: 8 ft. (96 in)                        Axle loads: 5,000 lbs.
 Weight: 10,000 lbs.                          Wheel loads: 2,500 lbs.
 Other: Any item that requires special equipment or procedures for loading.

                                           Chapter 4

                      MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT (MHE)

4.1. Definitions.
   4.1.1. Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS). A key element of air mobility and
   provides responsive, worldwide support to airlift and air refueling operations. The three core
   functions provided through the GAMSS are: command and control, maintenance, and aerial
   port. GAMSS is normally provided by AMC at Fixed, Enroute, and Mobile locations.
   4.1.2. MHE. Describes equipment used in packaging, handling, or transporting cargo in
   preparation for air shipment. Although this allows for a wide variety and can be a catch-all
   phrase, this chapter focuses mainly on the types that will enable on/offloading of cargo
   and/or passengers onto CRAF aircraft.
4.2. Responsibilities. The finest movement plans in the world have often been delayed due to
lack of proper MHE and poor coordination of GAMSS elements. Although the following
describes basic responsibilities for MHE coordination, taking the extra precaution to personally
ensure all necessary MHE requests are accomplished will make both on/offloads easier.
   4.2.1. AMC. CRAF logistics support during activations will be coordinated with the AMC
   Crisis Action Team (CAT) and will be monitored by TCAQ and HQ AMC/A3B. 618 AOC
   (TACC) will be responsible for assuring availability of adequate cargo and passenger MHE,
   to support planned workload at all on-load and off-load locations. During periods of CRAF
   activation, AMC CAT will position any CRAF carrier-specific MHE that exceeds the
   contractor capability to position. Outside of times of activation (i.e., normal, commercial
   augmentation airlift support), positioning of carrier-specific MHE remains the responsibility
   of the carrier.
   4.2.2. Military Host/Supporting Installation. The host/supporting installation will (1) provide
   Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG) and support deploying mobility forces
   as requested (i.e., MHE, container handling equipment, manpower, fuel, or staging facilities),
   and (2) be the primary provider of mobility forces and MHE support when the aerial port/air
   terminal is the host.
       4.2.2.1. Use of Government-furnished MHE. Government-furnished MHE will be used
       at military on/offload airfields whenever possible.
   4.2.3. Individual CRAF Carrier (Contractor).
       4.2.3.1. Use of Existing Carrier Assets. To the maximum extent possible, logistics
       support of CRAF aircraft will be provided by the participating carrier and obtained from
       existing carrier assets. Shortages in such support may be supplemented by carrier
       contract and/or arrangements with other sources. If CRAF carriers cannot support
       themselves, requests for assistance should be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3B.
       4.2.3.2. Additional Tiedown Equipment. When additional tiedown equipment is
       necessary to secure the loaded pallet to the aircraft, and prior coordination is made, the
       contractor shall furnish it.
AMCPAM24-2V1 6 AUGUST 2014                                                                       15


       4.2.3.3. Commercial Pallets. In some cases, military necessity may require hand loading
       of cargo. When required, contractors shall furnish commercial pallets to be used as a
       subfloor for the lower lobes. Notification will be provided by the ACO.
       4.2.3.4. Special MHE. Special handling equipment (which is not commonly used on
       military aircraft), such as tow bars, may not be available at military installations and must
       therefore, be furnished by the contractor. Contractor shall also furnish personnel to
       operate and maintain such equipment. Positioning of contractor MHE will normally be
       the contractor's responsibility.
   4.2.4. Users of CRAF Airlift Assets.
       4.2.4.1. User-Furnished Cargo Equipment. Cargo handling equipment, including 463L
       pallets and associated cargo restraining nets and tiedown equipment will be furnished by
       military customers being moved.
       4.2.4.2. User-Furnished Services. The following will normally be provided by the user
       of CRAF assets whenever possible, unless on/offload locations have GAMSS/civilian
       aerial port assets to handle the movement:
       • Passenger processing, manifesting, and documenting
       • Baggage handling (weigh, tag, load and unload)
       • Cargo manifesting and on/offloading
4.3. CRAF MHE Compatibility. In the past, most military MHE was designed to be
specifically used on military airlift assets; however, this is no longer the case. Even still, some
models of MHE may or may not be suitable for use on CRAF assets. See Attachment 2 and
Attachment 3 for a guide to assist in planning for MHE needs with particular airframes.
4.4. MHE Characteristics. A detailed description of various MHE types and characteristics
can be found in AMCI 10-202V4, CL-1.
4.5. Conclusion. AMC’s inventory of MHE is quite large; however, most MHE is dedicated to
AMC’s fixed or enroute aerial ports for daily operations. If the need arises to reposition MHE to
on/offload locations it will be expensive, time consuming, and most likely occupy a tremendous
amount of available military airlift cargo space. Therefore, the user of CRAF assets needs to
provide as much MHE from local sources as possible. By the same token, it must be
remembered to plan and coordinate for the use of MHE at deployed locations. Cargo that cannot
be removed and transported from the airplane after it arrives is of little value. If MHE support is
required, contact an affiliated ALCF/CRE/CRG unit or AMC CAT as early as possible to
arrange for assistance and coordination.

                                            Chapter 5

                ROLLING STOCK / LOOSE CARGO CONSIDERATIONS

5.1. Floor Loading Overview. The non-structural nature of many commercial aircraft floor
surfaces requires cargo to be palletized or loaded upon a palletized or wood-shored subfloor.
The air carrier’s procedures should address the airplane’s floor load limits (area load or linear-
running load limits) if the air carrier allows cargo to be loaded directly on the airplane’s floor.
Wheeled cargo/loose cargo can be loaded directly aboard the aircraft when a subfloor is
installed. This subfloor can be either: a 463L pallet (HCU-6/E), a commercial pallet, or other
type shoring. Normally, the 463L (HCU-6/E) pallet is used in military airlift operations.
   5.1.1. Commercial Pallets. In some cases during CRAF activation, military necessity may
   require hand loading of passenger baggage on commercial aircraft. Should the need arise
   contractors shall be required to furnish commercial pallets to be used as a subfloor for their
   lower decks/lobes. Notification will be provided by the Contracting Officer.
   5.1.2. Shoring. Shoring is a material used to distribute a load over a larger area. Thus it is
   possible to carry a load with a higher weight concentration than normally would be allowed.
   Shoring will only increase the area over which a load is distributed to whatever area is
   obtained by extending a plane drawn downward and outward, at an angle of 45°, until it
   intersects the surface on which shoring rests. Both plywood and dimension lumber are
   commonly used for shoring purposes. Shoring, when used as a subfloor, must consist of
   wood at least thick enough to support the load distribution, but generally a minimum of ¾
   inch is used. The air carrier’s procedures should address how to distribute (shore) the weight
   of cargo having a load bearing weight greater than a floor load limit. The user of CRAF
   airlift assets will provide shoring as required.
5.2. Actual Weights. All items transported in the cargo compartment of a commercial aircraft
will be weighed and actual (not planned) weights will be provided to the contractor.
5.3. Bulk vs. Loose/Floor Loaded Cargo. It must be noted that the military definition of bulk
cargo (see paragraph 2.7.1) differs from what the FAA defines it as. According to FAA AC 120-
85, bulk cargo is generally defined the same as what the military would term loose/floor loaded
cargo. This distinction is important in that a civilian carrier cargo compartment will be
categorized as either a “bulk load” or “non-bulk load” compartment. There may be certain
cargo compartments that can ONLY accept loose/floor loaded cargo.
   5.3.1. Bulk Load Compartment. A compartment that has provisions that prevent bulk cargo
   from: (1) shifting and damaging airplane systems/structures, and (2) shifting to the extent
   that the airplane CG exceeds the certified limits to include the requirement that the
   construction of the airplane ensures that unrestrained cargo, when subjected to the flight,
   ground, and landing forces, cannot damage airplane systems/structure by impact.
   5.3.2. Non-bulk Load Compartment. A compartment that protects an airplane’s systems and
   structures by a cargo restraint system. The load restraints will ensure that the cargo structural
   loads are only applied to the airplane through the load-airplane interface of the cargo restraint
   system. The cargo restraint system may include barriers, unit load devices (ULDs), nets,

                                           Chapter 6

                       PALLETIZED CARGO CONSIDERATIONS

6.1. Overview. This chapter will discuss any unitized load, which has been assembled and
packaged in such a way as to move from source to destination (or as far forward as practical)
without the need to break down or reassemble it for air transport. It is concerned with both
containerized and palletized loads meant to be secured by an aircraft rail and locking system.
6.2. Military 463L Cargo Handling System. 463L is the common designation for a family of
air cargo handling equipment. The 463L system consists of separate, but interdependent,
equipment families including: air terminal Mechanized Material Handling Systems (MMHS),
on-board aircraft cargo handling systems, ground handling equipment, pallets, and nets.
   6.2.1. 463L Pallet Use. Normally, the HCU-6/E pallet is used in military airlift operations;
   however, CONEX and ISU containers with their own or incorporated integral base to lock
   into a 463L rail system can also be used. CRAF aircraft shall be equipped with
   mechanized roller systems or rail systems that are compatible with 463L configured
   pallets and equipment.
6.3. Civilian Cargo Handling System. The theme of this AMC pamphlet is paraphrased here.
Civilian cargo handling systems are not standardized and can vary widely, even within each
carrier’s fleet. However, even though each carrier is given wide latitude on developing a cargo
handling system, most will use some form of restraint system designed for ULDs.
   6.3.1. Unit Load Device (ULD). A ULD is any type of freight container, aircraft container,
   or aircraft pallet with a net that is capable of being locked into the aircraft cargo restraint
   system. A ULD may or may not be certified by government airworthiness authorities.
       6.3.1.1. Certified ULD. Considered as a removable aircraft hold, structurally capable of
       fully restraining the load contained within, and/or providing adequate protection to the
       aircraft systems and structure.
       6.3.1.2. Non-certified ULD. Not considered as a removable aircraft hold, and can only
       be loaded into aircraft holds that are compartment restraint certified and pursuant to the
       aircraft’s weight and balance manual. For containers, the base plate must be structurally
       attached to and an integral part of the assembly and the ULD must be capable of fully
       containing or restraining the cargo or baggage contained within.
       6.3.1.3. ULD Types. The two ULD types are pallets and containers. ULD pallets are
       rugged sheets of aluminum with rims to lock onto cargo net lugs. ULD containers (a.k.a.
       “cans” or “pods”) are closed containers made of aluminum or a combination of aluminum
       frame and fabric walls/door and may be contoured to fit a specific compartment’s profile.
6.4. Meaning for Load Planning. Although the military uses 463L pallets/containers for
movements, be aware that most CRAF aircraft pallet capacities listed herein are measured by
how many IATA code PAG- / P1P- type LD7s (88 inches × 125 inches) that can be stored.
LD7s also inexplicably come in two different floor dimensions (96 inches × 125 inches as well
as 88 inches × 125 inches).

6.5. Actual Weights. All items transported in the cargo compartment of a commercial aircraft
will be weighed and actual (not planned) weights will be provided to the contractor.

                                            Chapter 7

                              PASSENGER CONSIDERATIONS

7.1. Overview. Passenger planning for CRAF airlift assets is, for the most part, much easier
than cargo planning. Passengers on CRAF airlift will be planned for and processed much the
same as on military airlift, with only the major differences listed below.
7.2. Passenger Weights. The following weights and procedures apply to individuals
transported on AMC-chartered commercial aircraft as per DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, App. V.
Actual weights will always be used when manifesting passengers on commercial aircraft.
   7.2.1. Planning Weights. The weights in Table 7.1 are for planning purposes only. No
   standard body weights will be used for troops transported on commercial aircraft.

Table 7.1. Planning Weights.
       Troop Type                             Equipment                      Planning Weight
 Non-combatant equipped                                                     175 lbs.
 Combat-equipped              carry-on bag only                             210 lbs.
 Combat-equipped                               web gear        weapon       210 lbs.
 Combat-equipped              carry-on baggage web gear        weapon       230 lbs.
   7.2.2. Actual Weights. Use actual scaled weights of individuals with uniform, boots, helmet,
   weapon, web gear, and hand-carried bag.
   7.2.3. Interrogated Weights. If scales are not available, interrogated weights of individuals
   can be used. After asking each individual their weight, use the following additive item
   weights in Table 7.2 as necessary to determine total weight of the traveler.

Table 7.2. Additive Interrogated Weights.
                       Equipment            Use for Interrogated Weight
                       Boots                5 lbs.
                       Helmet               5 lbs.
                       Uniform              5 lbs.
                       Web gear             12 lbs.
                       Weapon               10 lbs.
                       Hand-carried bag     20 lbs.
7.3. Seating Charts. The seating charts listed in the accompanying volumes for individual
airframes are meant for standard planning. A variety of seating configurations are possible, even
without modifications to the seat rails. The exact seating number will be given when a particular
airframe is assigned.
7.4. Seating Troops. Depending on the status of CRAF airlift (e.g., contract, charter, CRAF
activation), as well as the point of embarkation (i.e., military or civilian airfield), seats may or
may not be assigned by use of boarding passes. The troop commander should be prepared, in
addition to their normal duties, to assign seats.

7.5. TSA Requirements. On or offload at a civilian airfield may require troops/passengers to
follow the guidelines for travel by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Carry-on
restrictions apply to all passengers required to process through the AMC passenger terminal or
equivalent when at a non-AMC location. For most recent TSA travel guidelines, go to
http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information.
7.6. Individual Weapons and Combat Issue.
   7.6.1. Overview. For shipping individual weapons, follow DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, App.
   BB, Procedures for Transporting Weapons, Ammunition and Hazardous Materials
   (HAZMAT) Aboard Commercial Aircraft in Scheduled Service and Department of Defense
   (DOD) – Owned or Controlled Aircraft.
   7.6.2. General Guidance. Although users of CRAF airlift must follow the appropriate
   procedures listed in the publication above, the following is meant to provide additional
   guidance in shipping individual weapons.
       7.6.2.1. Weapons. The weapons talked about are individual, government-issue weapons.
       Crew-serviced weapons (e.g., M-240, 50 cal) must be transported as baggage or cargo.
       7.6.2.2. Options. The only two options available for shipping individual weapons are:
              (1) Stowing inoperable, unloaded firearms with troops in the passenger
              compartment and shipping ammunition as baggage or cargo; or

              (2) Shipping assembled, unloaded, and containerized firearms and ammunition as
              baggage or cargo. Barring the highly unlikely event of using a CRAF airlift asset
              to ship troops directly to an area of immediate engagement of enemy forces, there
              is NO option of having troops in the passenger compartment with their basic
              combat load.
       7.6.2.3. Use. Option (1) may only be exercised when the total cabin load of the aircraft
       consists exclusively of DOD-sponsored forces in support of training exercises or
       contingency operations, and when authorized in the operations plan or mission directive.
       7.6.2.4. Authority. The authority for allowing troops to travel with inoperable, unloaded
       firearms in the passenger compartment will come from the Combatant Commander,
       based on needs of the movement. The troop/movement commander does not make this
       determination solely on the basis of ease of loading. Furthermore, advance coordination
       and approval with the contract carrier, civilian airfields and facilities, and individual
       aircraft commanders must all be obtained.
7.7. Loading of Baggage. In addition to following the guidance in Chapter 5, the guidance
provided below is meant to aid in planning how to load baggage on an all-passenger configured
aircraft.
   7.7.1. Loading of Passenger Baggage. There are at least four different methods for the
   loading of baggage into civilian aircraft. They include commercial baggage containers, tri-
   wall containers, bulk loading by hand, and palletizing.
       7.7.1.1. Commercial Baggage Containers. Baggage containers normally are not the most
       desirable for contingency deployments. The use of commercial baggage containers
       normally requires that the loading of bags be delayed until the aircraft arrives at the
AMCPAM24-2V1 6 AUGUST 2014                                                                  21


     onload location and may require specialized MHE be brought in to load the containers.
     However, in the event that commercial baggage containers are used, carriers will furnish
     the appropriate type.
     7.7.1.2. Tri-Wall Containers. Tri-wall containers are essentially pre-built boxes that can
     be used as baggage containers. These are normally available through transportation
     facilities on military installations. Loading may be accomplished using a forklift or K-
     loader. For ease of handling, use the smallest tri-wall container available, with
     consideration for size of contents and shape of the compartment it will be loaded in.
     7.7.1.3. Loose (Bulk) Loading by Hand. Bulk-loading baggage by hand can be an
     efficient use of available personnel and equipment under a contingency situation. Hand-
     loading requires minimal MHE. Hand-loading also permits the weighing and loading of
     bags onto flatbed trucks or similar type vehicle prior to aircraft arrival.
     7.7.1.4. Palletizing. The use of 463L pallets (HCU-6/E) as a baggage pallet on civil
     aircraft is possible, but is dependent on type aircraft and which compartment will be used
     for loading.
  7.7.2. Assumptions. All four of these methods assume that normal loading is done by the
  military at noncommercial fields and that loading teams are readily available. It also
  assumes that in some instances passengers/troops will help or be the loading teams. When
  using any vehicle for this purpose, remove the rear and/or side panels prior to the
  on/offloading the truck at the aircraft and pre-position a chock before backing to prevent
  vehicle from striking the aircraft fuselage. With any of these methods, prior coordination is
  essential to a smooth loading operation.
