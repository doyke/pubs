 2                                                        AFRLI36-281 26 NOVEMBER 2013


reflect the updated scoring criteria. Added Figures A2.4 to A2.6, AFRL Fellows scoring
criteria.
1. Overview. The AFRL Fellows Program recognizes our most outstanding scientists and
engineers (S&Es) for either research and development (R&D) or exceptional technical program
management. Selection as an AFRL Fellows is the laboratory’s highest award. The intent is to
recognize selectees for exceptional career accomplishments.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     2.1. AFRL Chief Technologist (AFRL/CZ) is responsible for administration of the AFRL
     Fellows Program.
     2.2. Any member of AFRL may suggest someone for consideration as an AFRL Fellows
     through the potential candidate's home Technology Directorate (TD)/711th Human
     Performance Wing (711 HPW). The home TD/711 HPW will define the processes by which
     it will consider all suggested individuals and identify those to be nominated by the TD/711
     HPW.
     2.3. AFRL/CZ is responsible for impaneling a Fellows recommendation committee. The
     committee is chaired by the AFRL/CZ and will normally have as members the AFRL
     Research Council, but may include AFRL Fellows, senior (TD/711 HPW level) management,
     and distinguished academia and/or industry S&Es, as deemed necessary by AFRL/CZ.
     2.4. For nominations containing classified materials, the nominating TD/711 HPW will
     prepare an addendum to the nomination package classified at the secret level. That
     addendum will characterize the impact of the work in terms of scientific achievement or
     program leadership. Any addendum classified at or below collateral secret will be provided
     to all cleared recommendation committee members.
     2.5. The Fellows recommendation committee is responsible for forwarding Fellows
     recommendations to AFRL/CZ.
     2.6. Final selection of Fellows is the responsibility of the AFRL Commander (AFRL/CC).
3. Policy.
     3.1. Each year, the AFRL Fellows Award is conferred on selected exceptional individuals,
     military and civilian. The Fellows Award is designed to recognize very distinguished and
     exceptional achievements within the AF R&D community performed at AFRL.
     3.2. The selection rate normally will not exceed 0.2 percent of the professional technical
     staff (PTS) per year. In addition, total active Fellows will not exceed 4 percent of the PTS.
     The number of new Fellows nominees will not exceed two per TD/711 HPW, per year.
     3.3. AFRL Fellows selectees are honored at a special ceremony each year. Fellows status is
     a lifetime award.
     3.4. Those selected as AFRL Fellows receive national recognition and attention. They also
     receive special rights and privileges as appropriate for having received the laboratory’s
     highest honor. The names of all AFRL Fellows, by year inducted, are prominently displayed
     in the AFRL Headquarters (HQ) building and other locations as appropriate.
AFRLI36-281 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 3


   3.5. At the induction ceremony, new Fellows receive a medal and other recognitions. In
   addition, Fellows are eligible for a Special Act or Service Award (civilian) or Scientific
   Achievement Award (military) in accordance with applicable AF directives. Fellows
   continue to receive consideration for other AFRL monetary and honorary awards.
   3.6. All new Fellows will receive a 2-year research grant of $150K per year from their
   TD/711 HPW.
4. Eligibility.
   4.1. Each S&E, military or civilian, assigned as a member of the active Federal service to
   AFRL for the past 3 consecutive years and having at least seven years active Federal service
   is eligible for the AFRL Fellows award. The seven years of active Federal service may
   include up to the allowable 4 years as an Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) employee
   within AFRL. The work being recognized must have been performed at AFRL or its
   predecessor laboratories. All PTS grade structures are eligible for Fellowship.
   4.2. AFRL directors and chief scientists are only eligible for Fellows awards based on
   accomplishments prior to their appointments to these positions. Such nominations are
   expected to be very rare events and must be handled carefully to avoid any real or perceived
   conflict of interest. A nominated chief scientist will not serve on that year’s Fellows
   recommendation committee. An AFRL director must be nominated by another AFRL
   director.
5. Procedures.
   5.1. AFRL/CZ will work with AFRL/CC to establish a schedule for each year’s selection
   process and issue a call for nominations, typically in early February.
   5.2. Nomination packages are due to AFRL/CZ by a date specified in the call, typically in
   April. AFRL/CZ will subsequently impanel the Fellows recommendation committee to
   evaluate the candidates under consideration. That panel shall base its deliberations on
   individual scoring of each candidate using a single scoring process approved by the AFRL
   Research Council. Rankings of the candidates by each member of the panel attending the
   scoring session shall be done using that scoring system.
   5.3. Nomination package formats should conform to Attachment 2.
   5.4. AFRL/CZ will present the committee’s recommendations to AFRL/CC, typically in
   June.
   5.5. AFRL/CC’s final selection of Fellows will be announced prior to the induction
   ceremony banquet, typically held in September.
   5.6. The time interval between nomination submission and the induction ceremony will be
   compressed, as much as feasible, while ensuring adequate time for review and ceremony
   preparations and will typically be less than 24 weeks.
6. Role of Fellows. Fellows may be called upon to lead and take part in special activities and
events to enhance R&D programs throughout AFRL.
7. Prior Fellows. Former Armstrong Laboratory, Wright Laboratory, Philips Laboratory, Rome
Laboratory and Air Force Office of Scientific Research Fellows, and any Fellows of their
predecessor organizations, are Fellows of AFRL.

8. Emeritus Fellows.
     8.1. Upon an honorable retirement, reassignment, or resignation, Fellows become Emeritus
     Fellows.
     8.2. Emeritus Fellows will not be tallied under the limiting quota for active AFRL Fellows.

                   FELLOWS NOMINATION AND SELECTION GUIDE

A2.1. Concept and Philosophy. Fellows status in AFRL should be attainable by any AFRL
eligible S&E. There are five categories of S&Es under the Laboratory Personnel Demonstration
Program (LPDP):
     A2.1.1. Supervisor or manager.
     A2.1.2. Program manager.
     A2.1.3. Bench S&E.
     A2.1.4. Support S&E.
     A2.1.5. Plans and Programs S&E.
A2.2. Fellows Process. The Fellows nomination and selection process permits any of these
S&E job categories to be equally viable.
A2.3. Evaluation. The AF, through the LPDP, has already established a structure to evaluate
the contributions of S&Es in these job categories, including substantiating factors and key
elements. In addition, AFRL has trained supervisors and employees in this system, including
substantiation of the contributions.
A2.4. Selection Procedures. Fellows selection procedures explicitly incorporate the best
elements of the Laboratory Personnel Demonstration (Lab Demo) procedures into this Fellows
selection guide. This is justifiable and efficient since both are intended to measure the
contribution or impact of an employee’s accomplishments in AFRL, the AF, and other
organizations.
A2.5. Nomination Categories. Nominations are made in one of three achievement categories.
     A2.5.1. Research achievements.
     A2.5.2. Technology development and transition achievements.
     A2.5.3. Program and organizational leadership achievements.
A2.6. Intent of Specifying Nomination Categories. The intent of specifying the nomination
categories is to make explicit the fact that nominees may achieve Fellows status through different
types of AFRL-significant activities. Each of these achievement categories will have its own
unique scoring basis to provide consistent comparisons between the categories.
A2.7. Nomination & Recommendation Factors. Three factors will be used in the assessment
of the nominees.
     A2.7.1. Four of the following factors will be scored for all nominees.
        A2.7.1.1. Communications and reporting.
        A2.7.1.2. R&D business development.
        A2.7.1.3. Technical problem solving.
        A2.7.1.4. Technology transition and transfer.
AFRLI36-281 26 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     7


       A2.7.1.5. Corporate resource management.
       A2.7.1.6. Quality of endorsements by references.
   A2.7.2. Two of these factors will be “mandatory” for nominees in each category while a
   third factor that also best represents the nominee is to be drawn from the remaining three
   factors.
       A2.7.2.1. Technical problem solving and communications and reporting (mandatory for
       paragraph A2.5.1 nominee).
       A2.7.2.2. Technology transition and transfer and communications and reporting
       (mandatory for paragraph A2.5.2 nominee).
       A2.7.2.3. Corporate resource management and R&D business development (mandatory
       for paragraph A2.5.3 nominee).
A2.8. Additional Supporting Materials. These materials will be used to provide additional
context and clarification for the derivation of candidate rankings. The following two elements
will be considered:
   A2.8.1. The nominating TD’s/711 HPW chief scientist’s assessment of the impact that the
   nominee’s accomplishments have had on AFRL, the AF, Department of Defense (DoD), and
   the nation. Limit is two pages with a minimum font size of 11 pt.
   A2.8.2. Up to five external letters of support for the nomination. These letters will be from
   outside AFRL and will be from independent sources who know the candidate’s contributions
   or impact. Such letters will be solicited well in advance of the Fellows committee meeting
   by the TD/711 HPW or the chief scientist of the candidate’s TD/711 HPW. Such letters will
   be solicited from non-AFRL experts in the same area of research or program activity,
   principal customers for the research or programs, or users of the products coming from the
   candidate’s work. The best letters are from authoritative sources that are independent of the
   candidate. The solicitation letter shall request an assessment of the candidate’s contributions
   to the USAF based on the selected category, factors, and associated criteria contained herein.
   Refer to Figure A2.1 The letter needs to clearly assess the impact of research, technology
   transitions, or leadership on scientific or engineering state-of-the-art, professional practices
   and standards, national policy, customer capability, or other technically significant factors
   appropriate to the category of the nomination as specified in the communication to the
   potential letter write using one of the three categories in paragraph A2.1 The letter should
   clearly assess the impact of scientific or technical work on the state-of-the-art, professional
   practices and standards, national policy, customer capability, or other technically significant
   factors appropriate to the category of the nomination.

Figure A2.1. Solicitation Letter
 Dear [Name of solicited supporter]:

 I am writing to solicit your assessment of (candidate’s name) who is being nominated for the
 distinguished title of Air Force Research Laboratory Fellow. This ranking is applied to only 0.2
 percent of the Professional Technical Staff of the laboratory in any given year and the total number of
 active AFRL Fellows must be less than 4 percent of this staff number. Thus, this distinguished title is
 commensurate with Fellowship in the leading professional societies and is conferred only after very
 careful consideration by a team consisting of the AFRL chief scientists and selection by the AFRL
 Commander (AFRL/CC). Each new AFRL Fellow is recognized annually by a banquet honoring the
 new Fellows, a medal, and significant discretionary research funding for 2 years following the honor.

         [Candidate’s name] is being nominated under the following category: (scientific achievement,
 technology development and transition, or scientific or technical leadership). The candidate’s
 nomination form and summary resume are attached for your information. I ask that you address the
 impact of the candidate’s work on (one or more of the following: the DoD, the state-of-the-art,
 professional practices and standards, national policy, or other technically significant factors; this
 section should be amplified as appropriate to the criteria called for in the Fellows nomination criteria).
 Please estimate the candidate’s relative standing in comparison with such persons known to you.
 Please state the nature of your knowledge of and relationship to the candidate including any past or
 current funding from or through the candidate. Any other comments that you can make in support of
 (candidate’s name] are very welcome!

          I hope that you are willing to provide this very critical input in support of (candidate’s name).
 Please forward your letter to me by (date suspense). In the event that this nomination is not successful
 this year, we will retain your letter for up to 2 more years.

          Thank you again for considering my request.

 Sincerely,



A2.9. Procedure to be used in Recommending Fellows.                   For each nominee, the
recommendation committee members will individually score each of that candidate’s three

 10                                                       AFRLI36-281 26 NOVEMBER 2013


           A2.10.3.7.4. Professional society memberships and positions.
   A2.10.4. Classified Addendum (Secret Level Only). The proactive consideration of
   candidates carrying out classified work is encouraged. Our staff supporting the nation in
   classified research necessarily foregoes standard channels of recognition and accolade in the
   external community that are available to their peers. It is, therefore, important to ensure that
   within AFRL they can be appropriately recognized and rewarded for their contributions. In
   cases where a significant portion of a nominee’s contributions are in classified areas, a
   separate addendum (2 pages maximum) will be prepared covering classified aspects of the
   work and the significance of the contributions. This addendum will be handled under
   appropriate security protocols.

 Work history/accomplishments: My career with the AF laboratory system began in 1980
 as a data collector in the Liquid Rocket Fuel Viscosity Branch of the Rocket Science
 Laboratory. I have served as team leader, branch chief, and chief technical advisor to the
 commander. I developed the process to remotely determine the viscosity of highly
 flammable rocket fuel, using psionic detectors, which has become a standard procedure in
 the rocket science business (see US Patent 4, xyz, abc below). I have done all sorts of other
 wondrous stuff that was published, presented, and transitioned to operational weapons
 systems. During my career I have earned 54 patents and published 89 journal articles,
 technical reports, and proceedings (see partial listing in attachments).
