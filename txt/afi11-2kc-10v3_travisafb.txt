9.12. (Added) 60th Air Mobility Wing (AMW) and 349th AMW Local Procedures. This supplement
applies to all assigned and attached Travis AFB aircrews that participate in KC-10A flight operations.
9.12.1. (Added) Mission Planning.
9.12.1.1. (Added) All KC-10 sorties should be mission planned no later than the duty day prior to the sor-
tie. Accomplish a computer flight plan using Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) to check mission
timing and fuel requirements for all sorties outside of the local radar pattern. Coordinate training and for-
mation requirements, if applicable. Check crew currency products for overdue items. Review the Opera-
tional Risk Management (ORM) Aircraft Commander Risk Assessment worksheet. Confirm all
crewmembers have been notified and phone numbers on the mission set-up sheet are correct.
9.12.1.2. (Added) Air Refueling Coordination. Crews should make every effort to contact tanker and
receiver units to pre-coordinate training or evaluation requirements. When scheduled to air refuel with a
Travis AFB tanker or receiver and prior coordination is unsuccessful, attempt contact on Travis Com-
mand Post frequency - UHF 349.4 (Preset Channel 11) during preflight activity.
9.12.1.3. (Added) Confirming Mission Fuel Loads. Aircraft commanders (or flight planner-349 AMW)
will verify scheduled fuel load on all missions and locals and coordinate changes to fuel loads NLT 1600L
the day prior to flight.
9.12.1.4. (Added) Planning Fuel Reserves.
9.12.1.4.1. (Added) Local sorties not requiring an alternate should plan on having 25,000 lbs. of useable
fuel at the IAF (Req’d O/H Dest). Useable fuel does not include any identified trapped body tank fuel. It
also does not include any ballast fuel required to prevent exceeding CG limits (Wing Air Refueling Pod
(WARP) modified aircraft). When an alternate is not required, the flight engineer will document 10K
additional overhead fuel requirement in the alternate block of AF Form 4091, Mission Data Worksheet.
A time is not required in this block if an alternate is not required.
9.12.1.4.2. (Added) For local sorties requiring an alternate, insert the required alternate fuel and time in
the alternate block of section 34. To standardize the IAF fuel figure of 25K lbs. of useable fuel, do not
place less than 10K in the alternate block.
9.12.1.5. (Added) The AF Form 4091 is designed to combine mission information on a single worksheet
for mission planning, preflight, in-flight, and post-flight activity. Time/Fuel Analysis portion of AF Form
4091 meets the fuel planning requirements of AFI 11-202, V3, General Flight Rules. Prior to engine start,
aircraft commanders will coordinate destination alternate requirements with the flight engineer, review
and initial section 34 on the IMT 4091.
9.12.1.6. (Added) Alternate Airfields: The following is a list of airfields that are appropriate to use as
alternates for planning purposes.

NOTES:
  1. (Added) Departing MAP
   2. (Added) HDG is magnetic heading from Travis AFB
   3. (Added) DIST = ground distance
   4. (Added) Includes climb, cruise, descent, + 15 minutes holding at max endurance at sea level
   5. (Added) Final landing = 12,000 lbs.
   6. (Added) 50 knot headwind
   7. (Added) GW=300,000 lbs.
   8. (Added) The crew must account for any performance degradation (i.e., WARP, etc.)
   9. (Added) Do not use alternate divert fuel for normal cruise unless all planning factors are met
9.12.1.6.1. (Added) The above fuel computations do not alleviate aircrew responsibility for checking
indirect routings, weather, NOTAMS, stronger than normal winds, WARP drag index, and cruising at
hemispheric altitudes, when planning an alternate airfield fuel requirement.
9.12.1.7. (Added) PFPS Guidance. For drag index on computer flight plans, use figure 1-14 in T.O.
1C-10(K) A-1-1, Flight Manual Performance Data. There is additional PFPS information available on
the Travis AFB Crewdog Web Page at https://w3.travis.af.mil/crewdog.
9.12.1.7.1. (Added) For WARP aircraft change your empty gross weight from 250,000 to 255,000
pounds. When alerted to a WARP installed aircraft, complete a new flight plan at show time using the cor-
rect weights and drag indexes. If a new fuel load is required, notify Command Post as soon as possible.
9.12.1.7.2. (Added) Double the drag index for WARP configurations since there are two pods installed
on an aircraft. Therefore, the drag index for a clean wing with the hose and drogue retracted is 10. The
drag index for a clean wing with the hose and drogue deployed is 27.
4                                                        AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.1.7.3. (Added) Use a drag index of 18.5 for tanker air refueling (16.5 - boom deployed, 2.0 - sighting
door open).
9.12.1.7.4. (Added) For slow speed air refueling with slats or slats/flaps extended, the drag index does not
apply since the aircraft is now in a flight envelope that PFPS does not recognize. Use the “Manual” cruise
flight mode under these circumstances. Set the fuel flow to 23,000 lbs/hr for any slow speed AR below
510,000 lbs. gross weight and 27,000 lb/hr for gross weight above 510,000 lbs. requiring the slats or slats/
flaps to be extended.
9.12.1.7.5. (Added) For receiver air refueling use a drag index of 44 from the ARCP to AR Exit point.
9.12.1.7.6. (Added) Use a manual fuel burn of 18,000 lbs/hr during transition.
9.12.1.7.7. (Added) When using the Navy Wind PFPS Route utility, set the takeoff date and time in PFPS
before requesting en route wind data. Even though the Navy utility allows you to change the date within
their software, it doesn't always change it, and may result in improper winds applied to your route. You
will know the wrong winds were applied by seeing the wrong hour forecast message or a message stating
climatologic winds were applied when it should be a 6-hour incremental forecast.
9.12.2. (Added) Transition Training.
9.12.2.1. (Added) Off-station transition may be accomplished at any military airfield or joint use airfield.
(349th OG: requires Sq/DO or higher authority approval for military airfields not listed in this chapter).
Additionally, transition may be accomplished at any civil base listed in the subsequent paragraphs.
Approval authority for transition at civil fields not listed in this chapter is the squadron operations officer,
Flight Training Unit (FTU) Chief, or higher authority. The following paragraphs contain additional
restrictions not published in the Airfield Suitability Report and Restrictions (ASRR), DOD FLIP, etc.
This information is additional guidance (subject to change without prior notice), and does not preclude the
need for thorough mission planning and airfield study. Aircraft commanders will review NOTAMs, IFR
Supplement, AP/1, bird avoidance models and the ASRR for the transition field. Use Noise Abatement
procedures to the maximum extent possible at all off-station transition bases.
9.12.2.1.1. (Added) Travis AFB. Runways at Travis AFB are not grooved or porous. Therefore, the stan-
dard RCR is 10 for takeoff and eight (8) for landing when the runway is wet. There is a priority system
during the periods of limited aircraft in the pattern. If there is a conflict concerning the number of aircraft
in the pattern, ATC will send one aircraft into holding, and inform Command Post of the situation. Com-
mand Post will contact aircraft in the pattern to determine priority and inform ATC of the lowest priority
aircraft. The aircraft with the lowest priority will make intentions known to ATC and Command Post (full
stop, depart area, hold, or full stop to taxi-back). If departing Travis due to pattern saturation, advise
Travis Command Post of intentions.

9.12.2.1.2. (Added) Beale AFB. Available for use between 0600L and 2300L. Transition training is per-
mitted on a case-by-case basis. The PAR is not normally available on weekends and after 2200L during
the week. Do not over fly the Pave Paws radar site east of the field. Coordinate with Beale Command Post
or Supervisor of Flying (SOF – 139.9/240.225) to avoid conflict with priority traffic.
9.12.2.1.3. (Added) Redding MAP. Low approach approved only. Avoid over flight of residential hous-
ing. For non-precision approaches, plan your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high
power settings. Hours of operation are 0630-2130.
9.12.2.1.4. (Added) Sacramento International Airport (SMF). Available between 0700L and 1900L,
Monday through Friday only. Only one heavy aircraft at SMF at a time. Approach work is limited to one
hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. Do not overfly the tower and passenger terminal
areas. Circling maneuvers for training are not authorized. Plan instrument approaches to 16L/34R when
available. If non-precision approaches are flown, plan your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low alti-
tude flight at high power settings. When executing climb out from an IFR or VFR approach (Runway
16R), start your turn immediately after crossing the I-5 freeway to cross the river south of the I-5 bridge.
Coordinate with TRACON to fly a flight path west of the homes located along the river. Call Northern
California TRACON (916) 336-4001, prior to departing Travis to determine SMF arrival/departure work-
load limitations. Aircrews are limited to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pattern and must avoid overfly-
ing residences along the river to the west. Pilots are responsible for monitoring time in traffic and
departing the airfield after reaching the one-hour time constraint. ATC controllers may be willing to clear
you for more than the allotted time. Do not overfly the one hour of allotted time.
9.12.2.1.5. (Added) Sacramento Mather Airport (MHR). Available between 0700L and 1900L, Monday
through Friday only. No more than one heavy aircraft at MHR at a time. Approach work is limited to one
hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. No more than two touch and go landings per aircraft
due to deteriorating runway pavement. Do not overfly the tower. Delay configuration on instrument
approaches (but maintain within safe parameters at all times). Do not fly ‘50 flap’ approaches. Flap con-
figuration in the VFR pattern is not restricted unless flying a significantly extended pattern (final longer
than 3 miles). Circling maneuvers for training are not authorized. If non-precision approaches are flown,
plan your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings. When intercepting
final for the ILS/visual Runway 22L approach, plan your turn to intercept final at or south of US 50.
Avoid overflying residential areas north of US 50. Call Northern California TRACON (916) 366-4001,
extension 222 prior to departing Travis to determine MHR arrival/departure workload limitations. Air-
crews are limited to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pattern and must avoid overflying noise sensitive
areas to the north and northeast of 22L final approach course. Pilots are responsible for monitoring time
in traffic and departing the airfield after reaching the one-hour time constraint. ATC controllers may be
willing to clear you for more than the allotted time. Do not overfly the one hour of allotted time.
9.12.2.1.6. (Added) Stockton MAP. Airfield hours for transition are 0800-1500 Local. Expedite climb for
noise abatement. Remain at or above 1500 feet MSL within 15 NM of Sharpe AAF (4 1/2 miles south of
the airport). Do not over fly San Joaquin General Hospital (1 1/2 miles northwest of the airport) or the city
of Manteca (2 miles south of the airport). Normal transition is on Runway 29R. Requests for circling
approaches or transition outside of the 0800-1500L window can be made with the airfield manager.
9.12.2.1.7. (Added) Palmdale (AF Plant 42). Runway 25 is approved for IMC and nighttime operations
provided the ILS is operational and flown. Runways 4, 7 and 22 are restricted to Day/VMC operations.
9.12.2.1.8. (Added) Vandenberg AFB, CA.
6                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.2.1.9. (Added) NAS Lemoore, CA.
9.12.2.1.10. (Added) NAS Fallon, NV.
9.12.2.1.11. (Added) Edwards AFB, CA. During transition stay within R-2515. Flight through R-2508
will be avoided.
9.12.2.2. (Added) Transition with Cargo. Cargo will not be carried during touch-and-go’s and/or multiple
practice approaches. Static display box, tow-bar, tie-down equipment box, engine covers, and empty pal-
let sub-flooring are not considered cargo.
9.12.2.3. (Added) Transition on Operational Missions. Normally, touch-and-go landings will not be per-
formed on operational missions. However, touch-and-go’s may be performed for currency on the deploy-
ment or redeployment legs only if it does not affect mission accomplishment. There are several areas to
consider before doing a touch-and-go, i.e., brake/tire wear, antiskid operation, passengers and/or cargo,
etc.
NOTE: (Added) Off-station transition on operational missions will not be conducted without 60 OG/CC
(349OG/CC for AFRC) approval.
9.12.2.4. (Added) Tactics training is authorized at the following airfields: Travis AFB, NAS Lemoore,
NAS Fallon, Beale AFB, Palmdale, Vandenberg AFB, Al Dhafra AB, and Diego Garcia NSF. If tactics
training is conducted off-station, coordinate with the airfield prior to departure. Tactics training is encour-
aged primarily at Travis AFB.
9.12.2.5. (Added) Unauthorized Transition Airfields. Transition training is not authorized within the San
Francisco Class B Airspace. These airfields include Metropolitan Oakland IAP, Moffett Field Federal
Airport and San Francisco IAP.
9.12.3. (Added) Local Procedures.
9.12.3.1. (Added) Engine Start Procedures for Parking Spots 516/517/518. Aircraft parked in spots 516
and 518 must be towed prior to engine start. Crews will not start the #2 engine in spot 517. Heavy aircraft
requiring all three engines to taxi will be towed out of spot 517 prior to engine start.
9.12.3.2. (Added) Parking Spots/Jet Blast. The first 90-degree turn out of parking spots 412, 422, and 432
are located on the edge of the ramp next to the fuel pump area and several buildings subjecting these
buildings to potentially hazardous conditions if more than idle power is used. Loose gravel next to the
ramp may blow into the buildings and damage them or any personnel that might be in the area. Use the
following procedures when taxing off these spots:
9.12.3.2.1. (Added) Carry enough speed into the first turn so that power above idle is not required.
9.12.3.2.2. (Added) If, in the pilots opinion, the turn cannot be completed with idle power (due to heavy
gross weight, etc., the aircraft should be towed out of the parking spot).
9.12.3.3. (Added) Do not taxi between spots H-13 and H-14 (Hot Cargo Pads). The area is not stressed
for KC-10s.
9.12.3.4. (Added) Per Travis AFB MXGOI 21-116 paragraph 5.1.2., KC-10 parking spots 210, 211,
212A, 220, 221, 222A, 230, 231, 232, 261, 262, 271, 272A, 281, 282, 290, 291, 292, support equipment
boxes will only contain the following equipment during aircraft launch and recovery actions: B1-1 and
B-5 stands, one power unit, fire bottle and required aircraft chocks.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                   7


9.12.3.5. (Added) Controlled Takeoff Times. Aircrews may coordinate with Travis Command Post for
controlled takeoff times. If a mission is falling behind in the pre-launch sequence of events, Travis Com-
mand Post will coordinate the takeoff priority with ground and tower control, and advise the aircrew.
Inform Ground Control of the controlled takeoff time at request for engine start.
9.12.3.6. (Added) Monitoring Command Post Radios in the Local Pattern. Crews will monitor Command
Post's UHF frequency (349.4) in-flight (normally a crewmember other than the pilots in primary crew
positions). Block times, MX status, checking on tanker/receiver status, etc., will be made on UHF.
9.12.3.7. (Added) Traffic Advisory Procedures for Travis TACAN A and B Approaches. All aircrews
flying the Travis TACAN A or B approaches (or otherwise operating in the vicinity of Rio Vista Airport)
will make every effort to self-announce their aircraft position and/or intentions on the UNICOM fre-
quency. Example: (called in-the-blind on 122.8 approaching lead radial to final approach course on
TACAN-A) "Rio Vista traffic, Quest 52, heavy KC-10, 2 miles south of Rio Vista airport, 3000 feet,
descending to 1800 feet, turning west to Travis AFB, for Rio Vista traffic.” Use generic VFR terminology
to relay your position relative to Rio Vista Airport. Using an additional crewmember to make these radio
calls will minimize distraction from normal duties.
9.12.3.8. (Added) Mid-Air Collision Potential. The heavy congestion in the Travis traffic pattern requires
extreme vigilance from every crewmember. High volume VFR traffic to and from airports in the area and
along I-80 requires dedicated clearing. VFR flight activity increases on weekends.
9.12.3.9. (Added) Radio Terminology. "To Follow" and "Traffic Is” is terminology used frequently by
Travis Approach Control to convey your position in traffic sequencing. You will always be turning
behind the traffic, regardless of runway, unless specifically cleared otherwise (e.g., terminology such as
“traffic is...turn inside of that traffic” may be used). The following information is provided:
9.12.3.9.1. (Added) “TO FOLLOW” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is making an approach to
the same Runway. Example: “Quest 42, number 2 to follow a heavy C-5, 4 mile final, Runway 21L.
Report base behind that traffic.” Your instructions are that you are number two behind a C-5 to the same
Runway 21L.
9.12.3.9.2. (Added) “TRAFFIC IS” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is making an approach to a
different runway. Example: "Orca 33, you’re number one, 21L, traffic is a heavy C-5 5 mile final 21R.
Report base 21L behind that traffic.” You are the first airplane to 21L but will turn behind the C-5 going
to 21R.
9.12.3.10. (Added) Local Mission Cancellation/Termination. Mission cancellation authority rests with
the flying squadron leadership (Operations Officer for 60 AMW; Aircraft Commander for 349 AMW).
Coordinate early termination through Travis Command Post. Sorties may be terminated prior to sched-
uled duration if training is complete. Aircraft commanders will obtain approval from Travis Command
Post if they wish to continue flying beyond scheduled landing time.
9.12.3.11. (Added) Thunderstorm and Lightning at Travis AFB.
9.12.3.11.1. (Added) In accordance with Travis AFBI 15-101, Weather, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Air-
craft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities, the Travis Base Weather Station will issue thunder-
storm and lightning activity weather information through command post, tower and ATIS. A Weather
Watch for Lightning is issued 30 minutes prior to thunderstorm activity within a 5 NM radius of Travis
AFB. A Weather Warning for Lightning is issued when lightning is observed within 5 NM of Travis AFB.
8                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.3.11.2. (Added) During a Weather Warning for Lightning, personnel in affected locations will cease
all outside activities and seek shelter. Enclosed aircraft, buses and other vehicles with metal tops and bod-
ies are considered suitable shelter during thunderstorm activity. Wheel wells are extremely hazardous
during thunderstorms and should be avoided.
9.12.3.11.3. (Added) In accordance with 660 AGS MOI 21-107, Severe or Inclement Weather, when
lightning is within 5 NM, maintenance will stop all flight line operations and evacuate the flight line until
the termination of the lightning hazard. Furthermore, AVPOL will cease all fueling operations.
9.12.3.11.4. (Added) Aircrews that have not arrived at the aircraft will remain indoors or in the crew bus
until the lightning threat passes. Crews will be notified of the lightning threat by the most expeditious
means (e.g., maintenance truck, crew chiefs, or command post). If already at the aircraft, the crew will
remain in the aircraft with all doors closed and at least one door armed for emergency evacuation. The
crew may continue interior preflight duties (up to engine start) while awaiting lightning hazard passage.
In the event an aircraft lands during lightning threat periods, the tower will direct taxi operations. The
crew can expect parking delays upon clearing the runway.
9.12.3.12. (Added) Fire Department Frequency. When an aircraft notifies tower of an IFE requiring fire
department response, the tower should pass the emergency aircraft to the fire department frequency
(349.7) after the aircraft has come to a complete stop. Aircrews will monitor/use this frequency to coordi-
nate actions with the on-scene Fire Chief. Aircrews will also remain on the tower/ground control fre-
quency until the emergency has been terminated.
9.12.4. (Added) Aircrew Procedures.
9.12.4.1. (Added) Aircraft Taxi/Observer Procedures. Aircraft commanders requesting the assistance of
a crewmember to monitor the taxi from a forward (1 L/R) or mid-cabin (2 L/R) door should not com-
mence taxiing until communications are established and cleared to taxi by the observer. Open the door
only as much as required to safely monitor taxi. Taxi observer will not stand or kneel directly in front of
door opening.
9.12.4.2. (Added) Use of UHF Radios. UHF radio frequencies should be used to the maximum extent
possible when conducting transition at Travis AFB. This does not preclude the use of VHF radios when
specifically assigned one by ATC, nor does it preclude VHF radio use for safety reasons, training, etc.
9.12.4.3. (Added) Crews must review maintenance write-ups and aircraft forms to ensure accurate report-
ing of maintenance problems. Specifically, any write-up requiring engine-runs, aircraft jacking, or towing
must be relayed through command post to ensure a proper parking location is assigned. When in doubt as
to the need of special parking, ask command post to relay the problem to a maintenance supervisor for
guidance. This will alleviate the need to tow or double-block airplanes incorrectly assigned to parking
spots unsuitable for the required maintenance. Communication by aircraft commanders to the command
post is key to a speedy recovery of airplanes requiring maintenance upon return to Travis AFB.
9.12.4.4. (Added) Seat changes for primary crewmembers will not begin on departure until the aircraft
reaches 1,000 feet AGL. Seat changes will not be made during flap extension or retraction.
9.12.4.5. (Added) Crews will ensure that the headset communications cord is connected through the oxy-
gen mask communications cord during operations in all primary crew positions (including the ARO). In
the event that an oxygen crew communications cord is inoperative, attempt to switch quick-don masks.
Write-up the problem in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy Sheet, and annotate the mask
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                    9


control number in the write up. This enables Life Support to easily identify the faulty mask. Plugging the
headset communications cord directly into the communications panel is not permitted.
9.12.4.6. (Added) Opportune Air Refueling/Cargo Missions. Aircrews will contact Current Operations,
60OSS/OSO, before requesting opportune missions from TACC that will extend the TDY beyond the
scheduled return time (SRT) to de-conflict scheduling of the crew/aircraft.
9.12.4.7. (Added) Aircraft commanders will ensure the main landing gear chocks are in place prior to the
release of the parking brake. The ground crew may chock the nose wheel during initial parking as an addi-
tional safety measure, but are required to advise the aircrew when the main landing gear chocks are in
place. The nose wheel chock, by itself, does not adequately satisfy the chocking requirement of the air-
craft.
9.12.4.8. (Added) Seat Release for Space-A PAX. Aircraft commanders are responsible for ensuring
command post is aware of any requirements that would preclude Space-A travel. This can be done during
mission planning by calling air operations and having them put remarks in the MIS. Unless you call com-
mand post and let them know you will not be releasing seats, they will automatically release seats to pas-
sengers for any mission departing Travis for off-station destinations. Refer to AMCI 11-208 regarding
seat release policy for AMC aircraft. Aircraft commanders will provide the CP or AMCC personnel with
timely information concerning planned destination(s), number of seats available, and departure time for
the next mission. They will, in turn, relay this information to ATOC.
9.12.4.9. (Added) Final Passenger Count. The Passenger Terminal does not normally have a final passen-
ger count until 1+40 prior to takeoff. Passenger numbers can be requested from Command Post prior to
that time, but critical decisions that may impact mission accomplishment should only be based upon the
final passenger count. Questions regarding the passenger count, or if a baggage pallet will be used, should
be directed to Command Post.
9.12.4.10. (Added) Off-station Logistics Support.
9.12.4.10.1. (Added) The TACC Logistic Group Readiness Control (LGRC) is the AMC logistics com-
ponent of the command and control system that works in unison with the director of operations and mis-
sion management. AMC TACC/LGRC will support all KC-10A aircraft that are Non Mission Capable
(NMC) away from home station.
9.12.4.10.2. (Added) For operational matters, coordinate with the appropriate TACC operations director-
ate. For logistics support call LGRC. When at non-AMC locations, direct contact with the TACC is
appropriate. LGRC will evaluate and pass information from this call (i.e., request for parts, MRT or
equipment) to the home station through the appropriate base Maintenance Airlift Control Center (MACC)
that is tasked to support the aircraft recovery.
9.12.4.10.3. (Added) LGRC has overall responsibility for recovery of NMC aircraft from the time of
notification until the aircraft is in the “green”. Therefore, aircrews must ensure the LGRC is kept in the
loop regarding maintenance status, recovery options, and actions. Allow LGRC the opportunity to aid in
resolving the problem.
9.12.5. (Added) Formation.
9.12.5.1. (Added) Formation procedures will be IAW Chapter 18 of this instruction, T.O. 1-1C-1-32,
Flight Crew Air Refueling Procedures, and T.O. 1-1C-1-33, Flight Crew Tanker Air Refueling Proce-
dures. The following guidelines will be used for flight planning:
10                                                       AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.5.1.1. (Added) All aircraft departing Travis AFB in formation will file departures to the Williams
(ILA) VORTAC. Formations with activity scheduled to the south should file to the Williams (ILA)
VORTAC and then to the next flight planned fix. The formation leader will not request clearance off of
the departure and direct to the next position for timing purposes prior to cell breakup.
9.12.5.1.2. (Added) When operating in the Oakland ARTCC, do not request a breakup clearance until at
final level-off altitude and at or beyond the ILA VORTAC. The transition between the Oakland low sec-
tor controller and high sector controller begins at FL230. FL210B230 is normally the highest level-off
block for the low sector and FL240B260 is the lowest available for the high sector. Crews should plan
final level-off altitudes to ensure all cell members are in position and at the filed level-off altitude prior to
the breakup fix.
9.12.5.1.3. (Added) When planning a formation departure using a departure transition point, followed by
direct to another point that is also a departure transition point (e.g., TEALL1.ILA FMG), ARTCC com-
puters may override your request and issue you the departure that takes you to the second point (e.g.,
TEALL1.FMG). Request that Clearance Delivery amend the clearance.
9.12.5.1.4. (Added) Los Angeles Center requests formations that intend to break-up at the southern end
of the Beatty corridor plan to do so prior to the Beatty VORTAC. In all cases, avoid break-ups at or near
the Boulder City VORTAC where traffic is heavy. If an aircraft needs to depart the formation and return
north, you should depart the formation but continue to the Boulder City area and take one of the following
two options:
9.12.5.1.4.1. (Added) Turn Southwest towards Hector VORTAC and proceed to Palmdale, Shafter, and
proceed northbound.
9.12.5.1.4.2. (Added) Turn Northeast towards KSINO on J107 then proceed north, east of the restricted
areas.
9.12.5.1.4.3. (Added) In all cases, avoid 180 degree turns near Boulder City VORTAC.
9.12.5.1.4.4. (Added) Minimize the altitude blocks as much as possible from Beatty to Peach Springs
9.12.5.1.5. (Added) When accomplishing random air refueling advise the ARTCC of your intended point
of termination and end air refueling request.
9.12.5.2. (Added) Sympathetic Delays and Alternate Missions. The formation leader will thoroughly
brief a contingency plan should any aircraft in the formation be unable to make the scheduled takeoff
time. This also applies to briefing alternate missions in the event the scheduled activity changes. Aircraft
commanders should give copies of their flight plans to all other aircraft commanders. This will allow all
crews to fly any mission if cancellations dictate. Aircraft commanders not qualified to be lead aircraft will
notify the lead aircraft commander during mission planning.
9.12.5.3. (Added) Communications. All aircrews should accomplish HAVE QUICK (P260) and Secure
Voice (P270) on formation local training missions. Unauthorized UHF frequencies will not be used to
conduct HAVE QUICK and/or Secure Voice training (e.g., 300.0 or 300.025) IAW the Federal Commu-
nication Commission (FCC). Travis has the frequencies 311.0 and 321.0 available for this training. The
approved VHF interplane frequencies for Travis KC-10s are: Primary - 138.875 and Secondary - 139.925
(use the secondary frequency when transiting the Beatty corridor to avoid radio interference).
9.12.6. (Added) Non-Engine Running Crew Change (NERCC) Missions.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                   11


9.12.6.1. (Added) NERCCs are missions where crews are changed in minimum time between landing and
subsequent takeoff. Plan a one-hour ground time for taxi in, crew change, and taxi out. Hold maintenance
involvement to an absolute minimum (i.e., check aircraft, assist crews in changeover, etc.). Missions
involving aircrew qualification training (FTU) and AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/
Evaluation Program, evaluations should not be scheduled for the second half of a NERCC mission.
NERCC missions will be annotated on the weekly flying schedule.
9.12.6.2. (Added) Inbound Crew. Prior to landing, the inbound crew will advise Travis Command Post of
their maintenance status, fuel status, gross weight, landing CG, and expected block time for coordination
with the outbound crew. Leave the Flight Information Publications (FLIP) on the aircraft.
9.12.6.2.1. (Added) The inbound boom operator will complete a Load Management Computer (LMC)
strip tape or a DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F, with actual fuel readings and
the total number of outbound crewmembers verified through the Travis Command Post. Give both copies
to the outbound boom operator. Complete the AF Form 791, Aerial Tanker In-flight Issue Log, if
required, and turn in with the mission paperwork. The inbound boom operator will inform the outbound
boom operator of the time since the boom hydraulic system was pressurized.
9.12.6.2.2. (Added) After starting the APU and parking the aircraft, the inbound crew will complete the
Parking-Engine Shutdown Checklist, check the INU error rates, and align the INUs. Do not accomplish
the Leaving Aircraft Checklist.
9.12.6.2.3. (Added) The inbound aircraft commander will close out the aircraft maintenance forms and
brief the outbound aircraft commander on aircraft status. Maintenance personnel will complete an excep-
tional release, if required.
9.12.6.2.4. (Added) The inbound crew will not take the aircraft maintenance forms. The inbound crew
will proceed to maintenance debrief to brief the status of the aircraft and receive a MMCS number on the
AFTO Form 781, Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. If the outbound crew is not at the aircraft
when the inbound crew is ready to depart, the inbound aircraft commander or designee will remain at the
aircraft until the outbound crew arrives.
9.12.6.3. (Added) Outbound Crew. Check aircraft status and fuel load with Travis Command Post, obtain
parking spot, and expected block time. Additionally, the outbound aircraft commander will request the
crew bus to wait for the inbound crew at the aircraft, if appropriate.
9.12.6.4. (Added) The outbound crew will meet the aircraft and receive a maintenance status update from
the inbound crew. The outbound flight engineer will perform an exterior inspection and check the CAC.
The entire outbound aircrew will perform interior inspection scans to verify proper switch positions. The
Cockpit Preparation Checklist and subsequent normal checklists will be accomplished. The outbound air-
crew is responsible for CG and TOLD calculations. Consider brake temperatures when verifying takeoff
data. The outbound aircraft commander will sign the DD Form 365-4.
9.12.7. (Added) C-Check Procedures.
9.12.7.1. (Added) Configurations. When aircraft are taken to "C" check, work orders sometimes require
removal of specific equipment depending on whether the aircraft is to be weighed or not. If the aircraft is
not to be weighed, only the maintenance T.O.s are removed from the crew chief box, all else remains
onboard. If the aircraft is to be weighed the crew chief box will be empty except for 10 cargo straps and
the doorsill conveyor. All fleet service equipment such as pillows, blankets, pax kits, and water jugs,
along with all equipment in the California panel and other galley areas will be removed. Remaining
12                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


onboard should be: the M.E.L., aircraft weight and balance book, 3 engine covers, and an empty pallet in
13L. Interior or exterior paint schedule may dictate removal of other items. It is advisable that all boom
operators cross check the inventory worksheet prior to departure from home station to ensure actual air-
craft inventory is reflected. (The worksheet will be included in the paperwork the pilot picks up from
maintenance). This will save valuable time when the contractor checks inventory at the input station.
Maintenance configuration checklists account for the removal of the equipment listed above and the
appropriate changes to the DD Form 365 Charts A and C. This enables the boom operator to compute an
accurate Form F. Waivers are not required.

Table 9.3. (Added) Life support equipment removed from the aircraft for C-Check Inputs.
Adult Child Life Preserver (all)                                                     21 each

9.12.7.2. (Added) It is the responsibility of the crew chief, aircraft commander or designated representa-
tive to notify the applicable squadron Aircrew Life Support when the crew compliment is larger than
seven personnel in order to provide extra life support equipment for each squadron C-Check Input, as nec-
essary. When the aircraft arrives at the C-Check facility, the aircraft commander or designated represen-
tative with the C-Check personnel will make every effort to insure that life support equipment is properly
stored and returned to the designated aircraft upon completion of the C-Check.
9.12.7.3. (Added) Functional Check Flights (FCF). FCFs are conducted IAW T.O. 1C-10(K) A-6CF-1,
Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedural Manual, T.O. 1-1-300, Acceptance and Functional
Check Flight and Maintenance Operational Checks, and AFI 11-2KC-10V3, Ch 5. Non-FCF crews will
not perform FCFs at C-Check or on local sorties. Reference the above regulations and contact 60 OGV for
further guidance when requested to perform in-flight checks of completed maintenance.
9.12.8. (Added) Fuel Procedures.
9.12.8.1. (Added) TDYs. When away from home station, all ground and in-flight fuel receipts will be
placed in the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log. This form is maintained in the aircraft
forms binder. Write the aircraft commander’s name, rank, mission number, squadron and date below the
last entry on the AF Form 664. If the crew changes, the AC will draw a line under the last entry of his/her
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                    13


mission. Write “Last entry by Squadron on Date, Print Name and Rank” then sign entry. The crew taking
over the aircraft will start entries on the next open line.
9.12.8.2. (Added) AVCARD Procedures.
9.12.8.2.1. (Added) Research the AVCARD Web site for “Government Into-Plane Contractor” at all
commercial locations to ensure the lowest rate available. The AVCARD can be used to purchase all Fuel,
Oil and Ground Services required during a mission.
9.12.8.2.2. (Added) The aircraft commander will ensure the AVCARD and indentaplate are in the aircraft
forms. If either card is not present at home station notify the maintenance supervisor. Maintenance super-
vision will order a new AVCARD prior to mission departure and provide the crew with a card number to
use during the remainder of the mission.
9.12.8.2.3. (Added) If the card is lost en route, make an entry on the AF Form 781A. Include all relevant
details (e.g., “BP vendor at EGPK [Mr. Driver] misplaced card. Ensuing search failed to recover Card.”).
If the card is missing from a deployed aircraft, inform maintenance and document the missing card in the
781As, stating that it was missing upon your arrival at the aircraft. Call 1-800-AVCARD-1; inform the
AVCARD technician the AVCARD for your aircraft is lost. The technician will give you a card number
to use for the remainder of the mission. Insure a new card is ordered upon mission return. Use the AF
Form 315, USAF Avfuels Invoice, and AF Form 15, USAF Invoice, only as required at subsequent
stops.
9.12.8.2.4. (Added) If you cannot obtain a card or a card number and the fuel vendor will accept nothing
else, call TACC and inform them of your situation.
9.12.8.3. (Added) AF Forms 15 and 315 Procedures (when not able to use AVCARD).
9.12.8.3.1. (Added) Trip kits issued by the squadron contain AF Forms 15, 315 and TRAVISAFBI
23-102, Aviation Fuels (AVPOL) Management Program. TRAVISAFBI 23-102 contains guidance and
instructions for using these forms. Aircraft Commanders and Flight Engineers should review AFI 23-202,
Buying Petroleum Products and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station, and TRAVISAFBI 23-102 to
ensure they understand the proper procedures for completing and documenting aircraft fuel purchases.
9.12.8.4. (Added) JP-8 + 100 Fuel.
9.12.8.4.1. (Added) JP-8 + 100 is used for high temperature stability and cleans deposits in turbine
engines. It is used at AETC, ACC, and ANG bases. JP-8 + 100 is not authorized for use in KC-10 aircraft.
Bases issuing JP-8 + 100 have separated it from their normal “clean” fuel and are aware that transiting air-
craft are not to receive this product.
9.12.8.4.2. (Added) If the onload of JP-8 + 100 is unavoidable due to an extreme operational necessity,
the aircraft commander will sign an AFTO Form 148 (Acknowledgement Form presented by fuels per-
sonnel) prior to the fueling operation. If JP-8 + 100 is inadvertently received or absolutely must be used,
enter the quantity onloaded in the AFTO Form 781A and notify HQ AMC/DOV via TACC for further
guidance.
9.12.8.5. (Added) In-flight Fuel Jettisoning.
9.12.8.5.1. (Added) Fuel Jettisoning is done IAW prescribed technical orders, FAAO 7110.65, and MAJ-
COM directives, and accomplished clear of populated areas. Aircrew will coordinate with RAPCON/
Oakland ARTCC for area and altitude. If the emergency dictates, the recommended fuel jettison holding
pattern instructions within Travis airspace boundaries are Hold Northwest of the TZZ R-324, 16 DME Fix
14                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


(N 38 30 10.00 W 121 52 48.48), four min. (15 NM) legs. Altitudes 10,000 feet or below will allow air-
craft to remain within Travis delegated airspace. Altitudes above 10,000 feet will require a clearance with
Oakland ARTCC.
9.12.8.5.2. (Added) If the aircraft commander decides the situation does not warrant fuel dumping in the
local area, RAPCON will vector the aircraft to W-513, west of Sausalito VORTAC. Oakland ARTCC
will give clearance to enter. This area will keep the aircraft in the immediate vicinity of Travis; if the sit-
uation deteriorates further, an eastbound turn will place the aircraft on final for San Francisco Interna-
tional Airport. The coordinates for the center of this area are N37 50.0 W123 30.0.
9.12.8.5.3. (Added) Pilots will proceed to the selected fuel jettison area and determine if the airspace
below is clear of traffic. When jettisoning fuel, aircrews must comply with AFI 11-2KC-10 V3, paragraph
5.17.
9.12.8.5.4. (Added) When fuel dumping is necessary, the recommended fuel dump area will be used
unless doing so compromises the safe recovery of the aircraft. If circumstances prevent aircraft from uti-
lizing the designated fuel dump area, every effort will be made (within safe operation) to dump off federal
airways and away from urban areas, agricultural regions, or water supply sources.
9.12.8.5.5. (Added) Annotate amount of fuel jettisoned and a brief reason on an AF Form 791, reference
TRAVISAFBI 23-102, Aviation Fuel Management Program.
9.12.9. (Added) Crew Communications.
9.12.9.1. (Added) On formation sorties, crews will check out a loaded KYK-13 that includes (if
required): M4, Secure Voice, and HQUS.
9.12.9.2. (Added) For operational missions, coordinate with Crew Comm 24 hours in advance. Weekend
and Monday departures will call NLT Friday 1200L. Crews will receive a KYK-13, a KOI-18 (loader), a
cable, applicable COMSEC, the training guide (handout) and batteries.
9.12.9.3. (Added) Crewmembers picking up COMSEC from Crew Comm or Base Ops will have their ID
card and flight orders available at pickup to expedite clearance verification.
9.12.10. (Added) Aircraft Documentation and Forms.
9.12.10.1. (Added) Life Support Documentation. All items on the AFTO Form 46, Pre-positioned Life
Support Equipment (LSE), have been installed and inventoried by life support personnel. Aircrews are
not required to physically inventory those items. However, boom operators accomplishing the aircraft
preflight/thru-flight will perform a cursory inspection to ensure sufficient quantities are available for the
mission. The AC or designated aircrew representative (boom operator normally) will inventory and
assume responsibility (by signing and dating the AFTO Form 46) for LSE while in command of the air-
craft and throughout the entire mission. Conduct inventory prior to departing home-station and following
en route crew changes by reviewing, signing, and dating the AFTO Form 46 IAW AFI 11-2MDS-series,
Volume 3. Perform preflight inspections of aircraft-installed LSE IAW appropriate Air Force TOs, air-
craft manuals, higher headquarters publications, and local policies. This acknowledges that the cursory
inspection has been accomplished.
9.12.10.1.1. (Added) Life support items coming due while an aircraft is on alert status or away from
home are placed on a Red Dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns to home station before upgrading
to a Red X, IAW T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies,
and Procedures.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                      15


9.12.10.2. (Added) Maintenance Equipment Documentation. All items on the AMC Form 222, Aircraft
Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, have been physically inventoried by maintenance. Aircrews are not
required to physically inventory those items. However, when accomplishing the aircraft preflight/
thru-flight, a cursory inspection is required to ensure sufficient quantities are available for the mission.
9.12.10.3. (Added) AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet,
Procedures. AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, paragraph 8.4., provides specific criteria on when to complete
an AMC Form 97. The form is a tool used to collect information solely for the purpose of mishap preven-
tion. Information provided is not protected under the promise of confidentiality. Contact 60 AMW/SE or
349 AMW/SE regarding questions concerning military safety privilege. IAW these regulations, report
mishaps as soon as possible, before the end of the current Crew Duty Time (CDT) using guidance in AFI
11-2KC-10, Volume 3, paragraph 8.4.
9.12.10.3.1. (Added) 60 AMW and 349 AMW crews will adhere to the following guidelines:
9.12.10.3.1.1. (Added) Immediately notify the nearest C2 facility and your squadron commander or oper-
ations officer.
9.12.10.3.1.2. (Added) If there is any damage or injury, immediately notify the nearest Flight Safety
Officer (FSO). At Travis AFB, on-call FSOs are available through 60 AMW/CP or 349 AMW/WOC.
9.12.10.3.1.3. (Added) Fax or email the completed AMC Form 97 to 60 AMW/SE (837-1104 or
60amw.FlightSafety@amc.af.mil) and 60 AMW/CP (837-5950) before the end of the current Crew
Duty Time (CDT). An electronic version of the AMC Form 97 is available on the 60 AMW/SE website at
https://w3.travis.af.mil/safety/.
9.12.10.3.1.4. (Added) 349 AMW crews will fax or email a copy to 349 AMW/WOC (837-0824/1945 or
349AMW.CP@amc.af.mil).
9.12.10.3.2. (Added) If unable to fax or email from the location of the incident, promptly transmit it at the
first opportunity. L Band email is an effective option.
9.12.10.3.3. (Added) If a Travis crew is flying another wing’s aircraft and an AMC Form 97 is required,
use the notification guidelines in paragraph 9.12.10.3.1. (Added) and fax a copy of the form to the safety
office of the wing owning the aircraft.
9.12.10.3.4. (Added) Compliance with the above procedures provides timely mishap reporting to com-
manders, enables the command posts and safety offices to accomplish necessary reporting, and initiates
safety channel investigation to prevent similar mishaps. If there is any damage or injury, the crew should
not be released prior to contacting an FSO.
9.12.10.4. (Added) AFTO Form 781, Clearing Red X Symbols. 60 LG authorizes the flight engineer to
clear Red X symbols on their airplane at en route stations when qualified maintenance personnel are not
available to satisfy these requirements. This authority is limited to those items listed in the exception note
of AFI 11-2KC-10V3. Clearance of any other Red X entry will require approval from the 60 LG/CC or
designated alternate. The technician/crew chief accomplishing the work should sign the "Corrected By"
block and the flight engineer should sign off the "Inspected By" block and initial the symbol. Use call
back procedures through Travis Command Post. Reference T.O. 00-20-1 and AMC1, Aerospace Equip-
ment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures, for further guidance.
9.12.10.5. (Added) Mission Numbers and Symbols.
16                                                    AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.10.5.1. (Added) Mission numbers are listed for each leg on the AMC Form 59, AMC Mission
Tracking. The related mission symbol is derived from this number. Current Operations will strive to pro-
vide crews with correct mission numbers and symbols prior to their departure from Travis.
9.12.10.5.2. (Added) The Wing Operations Plan (WOP) monthly supplement contains a matrix to deter-
mine the mission symbol using the mission number. If launched from alert status, recut while off station,
or not given a mission symbol, use this matrix to derive the correct mission symbol. There must be a valid
12-digit mission number to determine your 3-digit mission symbol. Query command and control for this
12-digit mission number when recut. If unable to compute a mission symbol, contact Current Operations.
9.12.10.5.3. (Added) Mission symbol information changes frequently; the matrix in the current month’s
WOP must be used to derive the proper mission symbol. All squadron mission kits should include the
monthly WOP.
9.12.10.5.4. (Added) The mission number and mission symbol on the flight authorization is normally for
the first leg only. A common mistake is to use the same mission information for positioning, execution
and depositioning legs.
9.12.10.6. (Added) AFTO Form 781, Debrief Process.
9.12.10.6.1. (Added) Aircrews will report to Maintenance Debrief. Debrief will attempt to input all
required data from the AFTO Form(s) 781 into G081 while the crew is debriefing the sortie. After AFTO
Form 781 data is input into G081, Debrief will apply the proper MMICS number and initials on the orig-
inal AFTO Form(s) 781 and return the AFTO Form(s) 781 to the crew. The crew will hand carry the
AFTO Form(s) 781 to their squadron for disposition. NOTE: Anytime a crew “deadheads” home with
AFTO Form(s) 781 the crew must take all original AFTO(s) 781 to Maintenance Debrief.
9.12.10.6.2. (Added) If Maintenance Debrief is unable to enter the AFTO Form(s) 781 data into G081
while the aircrew is debriefing maintenance, Debrief will make unofficial copies of the affected form(s)
for the aircrew. Copies will be stamped in red ink “Unofficial copy-not for flight records use.” Debrief
will also annotate on the unofficial copy(s) the reason the data could not be entered into G081. If AFTO
Form 781 data cannot be entered into G081 due to mission symbol/number conflict, the aircrew should
attempt to correct the error. If the aircrew cannot resolve the conflict, Debrief and 60 OSS Current Oper-
ations will resolve the conflict during normal duty hours. Aircrew delays at Maintenance Debrief to pro-
cess G081 should be kept to a minimum.
9.12.11. (Added) Air Refueling.
9.12.11.1. (Added) Air refueling will not be conducted during departure climb out or descent for
approach except in emergency situations. Air refueling may be accomplished during intermediate climbs/
descents provided the activity is briefed.
9.12.11.2. (Added) Receiver and tanker timing criteria for a point parallel or en route rendezvous are con-
tained in FAA 7610.4J, Ch 10, Aerial Refueling. Any timing outside the appropriate windows must be
coordinated with receiver unit and track schedulers. ARTCC is not the approval authority for entry/exit
time changes. They can only deconflict traffic where you delay, not the track itself.
9.12.11.2.1. (Added) Aircrews should not change an en route rendezvous into a point parallel (or vice
versa) resulting in changes to their scheduled entry/exit times or ARCT over the ARCP without prior
coordination through scheduling. Track schedulers may schedule other aircraft on the track at the same
altitude with minimum spacing.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                  17


9.12.11.2.2. (Added) To avoid air refueling communications from interrupting other aircraft rendezvous,
crews will use the communications plan for the active air refueling track (for example, on AR-7BA,
switch to the communications plan for AR-7A at the turn). When an interplane frequency is used as the air
refueling frequency on an AR track or anchor, monitor the frequency on the communications plan for the
associated track or anchor.
9.12.11.3. (Added) Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft under Foreign Military Sales. Crews will anno-
tate the AF Form 3578, Tanker Activity Report, with the proper six-letter alpha-numeric Foreign Mili-
tary Sales case number. The case number will be annotated in the "Receiver Unit" block of the form. If the
Foreign Military Sales missions are attached to a CORONET movement, annotate the CORONET identi-
fier on the AF Form 3578 in the remarks section (i.e., CE-100). This information is also required on the
AF Form 791.

Table 9.5. (Added) Foreign Military Sales Case Numbers.
National Air Force         Squadron       Location                             Case Number
Singapore Air Force        425 FS         56 FW Luke AFB, AZ                   FN-D-NCO
Singapore Air Force        428 FS         56 FW Luke AFB, AZ                   SN-D-NCP
German Air Force           N/A            49 FW Holloman AFB, NM               GY-D-NBQ

9.12.11.4. (Added) B-1B Conflict in Air-Refueling Procedures. The B-1B's current rendezvous visibility
requirements allow them to close to 1/2 mile and 500 feet below rendezvous altitude without having
visual contact with the tanker. Their manual says, "Rendezvous closure will not be continued inside 1/2
NM range (2 NM for multiple receiver formations) unless visual contact is established with the tanker(s)".
This is in direct conflict with the T.O. 1-1C-1-33 which requires rendezvous closure to be discontinued at
1 NM and 1000 feet below tanker rendezvous altitude until visual contact is established with the tanker.
Until the B-1B's Tech Order is revised, comply with T.O. 1-1C-1-33 procedures. When scheduled for a
B-1B refueling pre-coordinate these procedures in the event the rendezvous is conducted in IMC condi-
tions (make sure they are aware of the 1 NM and 1000 feet below restriction).
9.12.12. (Added) Functional Check Flights.
9.12.12.1. (Added) 60 OG/OGV is the OPR for all Functional Check Flights (FCF). FCFs will be flown
by FCF-trained crewmembers certified by the 60 OG/CC. AR634, located within W283 and W285, is the
Travis AFB designated FCF airspace.
9.12.13. (Added) Boom Operator Procedures.
9.12.13.1. (Added) General Procedures. If cargo is transported, identify a second fully qualified boom
operator as the cargo boom. The cargo boom will accomplish the cargo checklist, pre-mission coordina-
tion with the appropriate agencies, and assure the passenger information required for the DD Form 365-4
is provided to the primary boom. The cargo boom will be the primary crewmember responsible for pas-
sengers and accomplish all required customs and agriculture procedures. The cargo boom will also brief
the aircraft commander on any hazardous or special cargo on the aircraft IAW AFJMAN 24-204, Prepar-
ing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments.
9.12.13.1.1. (Added) For load briefing information at Travis AFB refer to the Wing Operations Plan
Sequence of Events (SOE) O, Y, or Z.
9.12.13.2. (Added) KC-10 Non Standard Configuration.
18                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.13.2.1. (Added) A nonstandard configuration only exists after addition of aircraft equipment not ref-
erenced on the DD Form 365-1 “Chart A” Basic Weight Checklist Record and AFI 11-2KC-10 Vol. 3,
Chapter 25. The addition of equipment that is not listed in DD Form 365-1 “Chart A” that has not been
tested or certified for use in the KC-10 also constitutes a non-standard configuration. Example: strapping
computer equipment to a DV table for use in-flight, placing equipment in emergency aisle space, and
using equipment for other than its intended use. This requires a waiver from HQ AMC.
9.12.13.2.2. (Added) When a DV mission is scheduled, the configuration will be cited in the mission
directive published by special airlift. The crew chief will assure that all configuration changes are com-
pleted, initial the checklist and post it in the binder behind the latest Chart "C." The boom operator will
amend the last chart "C" entry with the weight and moment change and enter this as the basic weight and
moment on reference line 1 of the DD Form 365-4.
9.12.13.2.3. (Added) Removal/Addition of Aircraft Equipment. Missing/removed items, which are con-
sidered part of the normal aircraft configuration, such as the Z-LAV, pieces of the walkway, or sets of
seats, do not constitute a non-standard configuration. If these items are onboard but strapped to a pallet or
are completely removed from the aircraft, it is a matter of making an adjustment to the aircraft weight and
balance computation (Refer to “Chart A” for weights/moments of these items). When carrying more than
the normal (4) IAU pallets, treat any additional IAU pallet as cargo. This also does not constitute a
non-standard configuration and may be carried as such. When the additional pallets are onboard and there
is other cargo manifested as hazardous, you must check its compatibility with regard to the oxygen gener-
ating units on the IAU. Additional IAU pallets are still considered aircraft equipment and do not need to
be manifested as cargo, nor do they require shipper’s declarations for dangerous goods.
9.12.13.2.3.1. (Added) Configuration waivers are needed any time you place equipment in aisle spaces,
equipment that hinders access to emergency equipment/oxygen, aircraft seats installed facing aft, cargo
barrier nets/environmental curtain not installed in correct position, and the cargo handling system used
not as designed (i.e., moving rails, lock pawls, etc.). This list is not comprehensive. Anytime a piece of
equipment is installed in a place it was not designed for, or if it will hinder evacuation of the aircraft, a
waiver is required. The addition of equipment that is not listed in DD Form 365-1, Basic Weight Check-
list Record, Chart A, that has not been tested or certified for use in the KC-10 also constitutes a nonstand-
ard configuration.
9.12.13.3. (Added) Wide Body Aircraft Main Deck Loaders.
9.12.13.3.1. (Added) TA-40 Tunner Loader. This loader has an adapter that is used for loading the lower
lobe of a B-747. It protrudes out from the front edge of the loader but does not run the entire length of the
loader platform. When positioned against the door of the KC-10 there is a gap on the loader operator’s
side of the loader approximately 40 inches long and 20 inches deep from the doorsill to the loader. This
may present a safety hazard. If it does, the boom operator is authorized to request that the TA-40 operator
remove the extension, thus eliminating the gap.
9.12.13.3.2. (Added) 9-Ton High-Lift Truck. Use of this vehicle for loading the KC-10 presents some
special challenges. Currently there is very little information available on usage of this truck as a loader,
use extreme caution. (Reference the Boom Operator In-flight Guide for further guidance).
9.12.13.3.3. (Added) Procedures for Transporting Cargo on 25K, 40K, and 60K Loaders. These proce-
dures are to enhance the fall protection at the rear of the 25K, 40K, and 60K loaders. Individuals will not
proceed past the last pallet lock on the 25K and the 60K loader, and individuals will not proceed past the
second to the last pallet lock on the 40K loader. If conditions necessitate personnel to proceed past the last
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                      19


pallet lock on the 25K, 60K loader and the second to the last lock on the 40K loader, the deck must be
lowered to its lowest position or fall protection (a safety harness attached to a tie down point on the loader
deck) must be used. After the first two pallets on the 25K, four pallets on the 40K, and five pallets on the
60K loader have been loaded onto the aircraft, a load team member will disengage the pallet locks and
remove the supplemental restraint from the last pallet. The load team members will then pull the pallet up
to the next pallet position on the 25K and the 40K loader before pushing it onto the aircraft. On the 60K
loader, the operator will use the power conveyers to load the pallets onto the aircraft.
9.12.13.4. (Added) Pallet Position 13L. The DD Form 365-3 Chart C’s for 60 AMW KC-10s have been
amended to remove items incorrectly listed at station 1883. The following information is provided for
including the movable equipment located on the pallet in position 13L on the DD Form 365-4 Form F:

TOTAL                                                                         982 lbs

9.12.13.5. (Added) Cargo Boom Supervisor/Enhanced Boom Operators. The following procedures are
designed to assist in load planning, marshalling, and cargo loading during contingencies.
9.12.13.5.1. (Added) Cargo Boom Supervisor. The 60 OGV Boom Operator, or designated representa-
tive, will perform cargo boom supervisor duties. Duties will include reviewing the load plan and visually
checking the chocks prior to the Enhanced Boom Operator’s arrival. The Cargo Boom Supervisor will
provide assistance during the loading operation.
9.12.13.5.2. (Added) Enhanced Boom Operators. Current operations will task the squadrons with the
requirement for Enhanced Boom Operators with a MIS during contingencies, ORIs and CREs. Enhanced
boom operators will follow the WOP SOE Y procedures to include the load briefing at Base Operations
and then proceed to the aircraft and accomplish all TO 1C-10(K) A-9 cargo loading procedures/require-
ments. After the load is completed, all paper work and computations will be left on the flight engineer’s
table.
9.12.13.5.3. (Added) Notification Procedures. Travis ATOC will determine load time and notify Travis
Command Post. The command post will alert the squadron mission controller who in turn will alert the
Enhanced Boom Operators. Enhanced Boom Operators will be alerted in time to allow them to be in place
at the aircraft at the scheduled load start time.
20                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.13.5.4. (Added) Crew Rest Requirements. Crewmembers meeting the crew rest criteria defined in
AFI 11-202, Vol. 3 may perform aircraft generation activities (preflight, load, start, and taxi as described
in AFI 11-202 Vol.3) without having formally been placed in crew rest. Activities involving aircraft gen-
eration shall not exceed a 12-hour duty day. Crew duty day begins at the start of official duties unless
noted as follows. For crewmembers who have less than 12 hours crew rest but greater than eight (8) hours,
OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority. This authority should be used judiciously and individual
crewmembers must evaluate their ability to mentally and physically perform required crew duties. Under
normal day-to-day operations, the OG/CC should ensure crewmembers are afforded 12 hours rest for air-
craft generation activities, but in some extreme cases, it may be necessary to begin these duties with less
than 12 hours rest. Waiver for rest periods of less than eight (8) hours still rests with the MAJCOM/DO or
ANG/DO as appropriate. Crew duty day for aircraft generation activities begun with less than 12 hours
rest is limited to 10 hours. This 10-hour period begins at crew show time.
9.12.13.6. (Added) Hazardous Materials.
9.12.13.6.1. (Added) The only document that will be used to certify hazardous materials is the Shipper’s
Declaration for Dangerous Goods. The DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record, will not be used
as a hazardous materials certification document for vehicles and wheeled support equipment during
mobility/contingency operations.
9.12.13.6.2. (Added) Lithium Batteries. The recommended fire agents listed in AFJMAN 24-204, are
water, CO2 or a class D fire extinguisher. These agents will only help reduce the intensity of the fire until
the lithium expends itself. Shipping agencies have advised crews to use aircraft potable water systems as
fire suppressants. The use of any water is not recommended on KC-10s because water presents a hazard
to electronic equipment located in the center accessory compartment and the ARO compartment. AFJ-
MAN 24-204, paragraph 1.10, Protective Equipment, states that the shipper must provide any special
equipment required. If they do not, the boom operator can refuse to carry the dangerous goods.
9.12.13.6.3. (Added) Hazardous Materials in ISU-90 Containers. Recent real-world events saw an
increase in the use of the ISU-90 container. In some cases, ISU containers were found “Stuffed” with haz-
ardous materials without regard to in-flight accessibility. Unless load planned to allow ready in-flight
access in event of an emergency, hazardous materials will be removed from the container. AFJMAN
24-204 clearly identifies this requirement and the few hazardous materials exempted from being accessi-
ble. Some containers have built-in “HAZMAT” access panels. However, when these containers are uti-
lized, any hazardous materials (except those identified in AFJMAN 24-204) must be positioned to permit
access through the panel. Hazardous materials in the high side of the container are inaccessible unless the
adjacent pallet position is left empty to facilitate opening the doors. If the person responsible for the con-
tainer is not on board, the key or combination for locks on containers must be on the container adjacent to
the lock. AMC inspectors and aircrew are authorized access on all cargo containers placed on AMC air-
craft except when waived by HQ AMC/DO for security reasons.
9.12.13.6.4. (Added) Plastic Jerry Cans. POP approved plastic Jerry Can filler spouts have leaked during
steep aircraft climbs. Investigations revealed that while the container caps felt snug, they could be tight-
ened further. In addition the Jerry Cans were completely full. Aircraft are subject to extreme ascents/
descents, particularly during tactical operations. While the shipper is ultimately responsible for proper
preparation of cargo, AMC “INSPECTORS” should periodically spot check Jerry Can caps. Recommend
caps be tightened/checked to reduce possibility of leaks.
9.12.13.6.5. (Added) The KC-10 aircraft will not be used for transportation of hazardous waste.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                     21


9.12.13.7. (Added) Customs procedures. When required, make sure all aircraft doors remain closed until
a customs agent requests them to be opened. When delays are encountered, maintenance personnel may
deplane to accomplish required after-landing maintenance actions. When returning to the United States,
the aircraft commander or designated representative will make sure the crew completes their individual
customs declaration prior to the outbound customs inspection.
9.12.13.7.1. (Added) Permits to Proceed. If there is only one copy of the thru-load manifest, it should
remain with the Permit to Proceed package. If Aerial Port personnel insist on taking the thru-load mani-
fest, include a statement along with the individual’s name and rank with the Permit to Proceed package.
9.12.13.8. (Added) Passenger movement. With aircraft commander approval, passengers may observe air
refueling when they are escorted by a crewmember to and from the ARO station. Primary crewmembers
will be notified when passengers are in transit between the passenger compartment and the ARO station.
Brief passengers on the use of the quick-donning oxygen system. The total number of individuals in the
ARO compartment at any one time will not exceed the number of seats with seat belts and operable oxy-
gen regulators.
9.12.13.9. (Added) KC-10 Documentation Procedures.
9.12.13.9.1. (Added) Contingency Mission Cargo Manifests. For mobility movements, the following
guidance exists for cargo and hazardous materials preparation and documentation: AFJI 24-108, Move-
ments of Units in USAF Aircraft, and AFJMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air
Shipment. A cargo manifest is required and can be a computer-generated form or a manual manifest. Nor-
mally the Computer Assisted Load Management (CALM) printout is available from the Tanker/Airlift
Control Element or Mission Support Team at the deployment site. If it is not available, a DD Form 2130-6
or DD Form 2130 -7 will be used for the appropriate aircraft configuration. Instructions for the airlift user
to complete the manifest are in AFJI 24-108, Attachment B. For any Section 3 move, the CALM plan,
AMC Load Sequence Planning Worksheet, or DD Forms 2130-6 or –7 are acceptable manifests. Do not
accept a DD Form 2133 (JI Form) as a manifest! This only certifies that the cargo was inspected.
9.12.13.9.2. (Added) CALM Load Plans/AMC Load Sequence Planning Sheet. The use of the load plan-
ning sequence sheet instead of the CALM load plan is becoming more wide-spread and is an authorized
load planning worksheet. The CALM load plan will mostly be used for Tactical/Contingency/Mobility
operations. For channel cargo, a manifest is still required.
9.12.13.9.3. (Added) Shippers Declaration Form. AFMC message 131320Z-changed paragraph A17.3 of
AFJMAN 24-204 to read: “complete and sign at least two (2) copies of the Shippers Declaration Form”.
This change only applies to chapter 3 moves. All other operations still require compliance with paragraph
A17.2.2 requiring three (3) original copies.
9.12.13.9.4. (Added) Certification, Marking and Labeling Deficiencies. The item below is not incorpo-
rated into AFJMAN 24-204, dated 1 March 1997.
9.12.13.9.5. (Added) The DD Form 1387-2, Cargo Manifest, will be utilized for identifying special han-
dling instructions of classified, sensitive, and non-hazardous items, and if required, signature service pro-
tected items.
9.12.13.9.6. (Added) When a DD Form 2130, Series Load Plan, or similar automated product is used to
manifest cargo, the controlled items of the shipment will be specifically identified on the associated load
list or on the load plan. Do not transport controlled items using only the transportation control number
(TCN) assigned to the entire pallet, since visibility of the specific item may not be possible.

9.12.13.9.7. (Added) Aircrew members may still encounter the DD Form 1907, Signature and Tally
Record, when transiting non-AMC bases. At these locations, it may be used instead of the cargo manifest
to transfer shipments.
9.12.13.9.8. (Added) AF Form 4069, Tie Down Equipment Checklist. IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol 11,
Ramp Services will initiate an AF Form 4069 for each home-station aircraft departing Travis AFB. An AF
Form 4069 will be accomplished on all other missions.
9.12.13.9.8.1. (Added) Boom operators will make a concerted effort to exchange tie down equipment on
a one-for-one basis. If this is not possible, annotate the AF Form 4069.
9.12.13.9.8.2. (Added) APS will inventory aircraft tie down out of home station. Each en route station
will inventory aircraft and annotate the AF Form 4069, Section IA and Section III with the item/amount
of increase or decrease, station, date, and reason for changes.
9.12.13.9.8.3. (Added) Aircraft arriving will ensure the AF Form 4069 is completed (signed) IAW locally
established procedures. The ramp crew will conduct an inventory on all inbound aircraft and document
the AF Form 4069 and return it to the ramp service office.
9.12.13.9.8.4. (Added) KC-10 aircraft will have an AF Form 4069 in a red folder located in the KC-10
crew chief box for all missions other than locals. On local missions the boom operator will inventory the
tie downs and make adjustments to the Weight and Balance Form F reflecting the correct number of tie
downs on board. IAW AFI 11-2KC-10V3 KC-10, Operations Procedures, the KC-10 will have the mini-
mum daily requirements of tie downs for local missions. This includes 30 chains, 30 devices, and 30
cargo straps. If unable to correct this prior to takeoff, annotate this in the aircraft forms and notify 60 OG/
OGV after landing. Contact 60 OG/OGV on-call boom operator if you have any questions or note any
deviations from the above procedures.
9.12.13.10. (Added) KC-10 Equipment and Procedures Interpretations.
9.12.13.10.1. (Added) Cargo Barrier Net. Crews departing home station will ensure they have a fully
operational cargo barrier net regardless of cargo status. HQ AMC will no longer issue waivers to allow
use of the net when components are missing.
9.12.13.10.2. (Added) Restraint of Cross Track Assemblies #2L and R Doors. Use a minimum of four P/
N AZZ7410-1 Equipment Restraint Assemblies to secure cross track assemblies at the #2L/R doorways
(when using the IAU). Since cross tracks are being used for guide rail purposes and not flight restraint
limits, four symmetrically positioned restraint assemblies meet the required ground restraint criteria. Any
time the cross tracks are used for flight, each will have eight restraint assemblies.
9.12.13.10.3. (Added) Use Door Sill Conveyor. The doorsill conveyor is required to be installed for IAU
installation/removal IAW T.O. 1C-10(K) A-2-25, Organizational Maintenance—Equipment Furnishing
(DOUGLAS), maintained on each aircraft. Dash 21 personnel loading/unloading the IAU are required to
install it. Doorsill conveyors that are missing excessive numbers of bumpers on the back can cause dam-
age to the door seal and aircraft skin, especially if they are all missing from the same area. Advise main-
tenance of the missing bumpers so they can be replaced or another conveyor assembly obtained.
9.12.13.10.4. (Added) ESK Bins. DOD 4500.9R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part III, Mobility,
11 Apr 97 provides guidance on containers. The only container certified to meet T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9,
Cargo Loading Manual restraint criteria is the ISU 90 series. These containers have an integral design
that will secure up to 10,000 pounds of cargo to a 1.5 G forward, aft, left, or right load and a 2G vertical
load. All other containers must be serviceable and be properly palletized. In the case of the ESK Bins
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                                            23


(white Fiberglass container with red vinyl doors), there are several problems. The doors were only
designed as dust and moisture barriers. There is no tech data certifying the maximum weight or restraint
capability of the doors. In addition, there is no means for securing the cargo inside these containers. The
method of securing these containers to a pallet with two straps does not meet the basic restraint criteria in
the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9. This only provides vertical restraint. Should the aircraft experience a 1.5-G load
factor the containers and contents will be allowed to shift. The best means to secure the containers is the
use of two HCU-7/E side nets and the HCU-15/C top net.
9.12.13.10.5. (Added) Weissenfel MB-1 Chain Compatibility. Compatibility problems have been identi-
fied with the Weissenfel MB-1 chain and chains manufactured by other contractors. The Weissenfel chain
is identified by the word W- ITALY stamped on the chain hook. Problems noted have included; Weissen-
fel chain hooks not connecting to other manufacturers’ chains when constructing chain assemblies and
chain bridles, and individual chain links on the same chain not locking in the MB-1 chain pocket when
tested with a sampling of different tie down devices. The chain and device may appear to be secure, how-
ever, even hand force on the chain and device may allow the chain to unlock and slide out of the chain
pocket. If this happens, insert a different link of the chain into the device and check to see that the chain is
locked properly. Until final resolution has been determined with the item manager, do not intermix Weis-
senfel chains on the same chain assembly or chain bridle with chains from a different manufacturer. As
always, ensure all tie down chains and devices are closely inspected to ensure the chains are fully seated
and locked in the tie down device chain pocket.
9.12.13.10.6. (Added) Aircraft Equipment Stowage Container. AFI 11-2KC-10V3, Chapter 25, Table
25.1 lists KC-10 aircraft equipment that is required to be onboard. There are provisions for stowing these
items in the aircraft equipment stowage container at station 1970. They are accounted for by line entries
222.2, 227 and 228 in the DD Form 365-3 Chart C. If items (vacuum cleaner, hazardous materials protec-
tive equipment kit and toolbox) are not in or cannot be placed in the container there is unauthorized equip-
ment onboard the aircraft, which has not been accounted for in the DD Form 365-3 Chart C. If this is the
case the following 781entry is required. “Excess equipment is stowed in aircraft equipment stowage con-
tainer which invalidates aircraft weight and balance computations.”
9.12.13.10.7. (Added) Use of Insecticide Aboard AMC Aircraft. For revised information refer to
11-2KC-10 Vol 3 and Aircrew Border Clearance Guide dated 1 Apr 98. Additional information can be
found in AFI 48-104, Medical and Agricultural Foreign/Domestic Quarantine. Do Not Spray with pas-
sengers onboard unless mandated by the Foreign Clearance Guide.
9.12.13.10.8. (Added) Center Guide Rail in Pallet Position 4 when IAU is Installed. The center guide rail
should be installed during loading to guide pallets into roller channels. The center guide rail will be
removed for flight any time the IAU is installed. The rail may be stored on a pallet or placed in conveyor
assembly slots near pallet position 9L. Ensure the rail locks are on the onboard left side of the aircraft to
prevent jamming of the rail.
9.12.13.11. (Added) KC-10 Joint Task Force Command Module (JTF/CCM).
9 . 1 2 . 1 3 . 11 . 1 . ( A d d e d ) C o n f i g u r a t i o n C h a n g e / C a r g o H a n d l i n g C o m p o n e n t s . T. O .
1-1C-10(K)A-2-25TP-7, Configuration Change and Cargo Handling Components, directs removal of
existing cargo handling components and installation of new cargo handling components. The configura-
tion change will be made on the DD Form 365-4 Form F by using the information provided in the config-
uration change checklist. This checklist will be found in the aircraft weight and balance binder opposite
the latest Chart C. The following loading guidance applies:
24                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.13.11.1.1. (Added) The cargo door must be open to the full open position for loading of the JTF/
CCM module.
9.12.13.11.1.2. (Added) Seven pallets will be loaded in 13L, 12 L&R, 11 L&R and 10 L&R. Some will
be for pre-palletized equipment some will be for the sub-floor. All rings must be in the up position for the
pallets that do not have pre-palletized equipment. To the maximum extent possible, use pallets to secure
equipment and baggage. If sufficient pallet space is not available, floor loading is permitted IAW, -9 pro-
cedures on page 5A-1.
9.12.13.11.1.3. (Added) Ensure the repositioned center guide rails and twenty-four cross track assemblies
secure the module. This side and vertical restraint equipment must be centered on each unit of the module.
The module has hard rubber bumpers, which snug it against the fore and aft locks and prevent it from
shifting. There are no lips on the fore and aft edge of the module and the fore and aft locks are for longi-
tudinal restraint only. The restraint requirement for all equipment and cargo on the six-pallet sub-floor is
9 Gs in the forward direction because passengers are in the cargo compartment.
9.12.13.11.1.4. (Added) The weight of each section of the module is marked on data plates located on the
left side at the center of balance of each unit. This data will be used to complete the DD Form 365-4.
9.12.13.11.1.5. (Added) There are several models of galley pallets. The weight of the galley pallet will be
provided for inclusion in the DD Form 365-4. At present there are no waivers for alternative methods of
restraint. Until there is a waiver provided from AMC for methods not listed in the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9, use
only authorized devices to provide the required restraint cited in the T.O. 1C-10(K) A-9, Section 5D.
9.12.13.11.1.6. (Added) Oxygen Requirement/Placement. If you fly with the JTF/CCM, it will have
approximately 20 Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS). These are provided by life support and
will include two (2) P5 masks and an EPOS demo kit. Normal placement of the bottles/EPOS is as fol-
lows:
9.12.13.11.1.6.1. (Added) Ten are pre-positioned in the Command Module to be used during depressur-
ization emergencies.
9.12.13.11.1.6.2. (Added) Two are for stewards performing duties in areas where oxygen capability does
not exist.
9.12.13.11.1.6.3. (Added) Eight will be preposition on the rope in the cargo compartment.
9.12.13.11.1.7. (Added) Flight Attendant Brief. Stewards that fly with us on DV missions are assigned to
various stations: Andrews AFB, McDill AFB, and Yokota AB. The flight attendants from Yokota have
current AF Form 8s and are qualified in the KC-10. These KC-10-qualified attendants can carry out their
duties unsupervised. This includes passenger briefings and manning doors 2 L/R for takeoff and landing.
Treat them as part of the team and take into account their needs for smooth mission completion.
9.12.13.11.1.8. (Added) Emergency Shutdown. When considering the emergency shut down procedures
there could be two possible situations. In the first case, you could have only the JTF/CCM where power
distribution is from the floor outlet directly to the JTF/CCM. In the second case, you might have both the
JTF/CCM and the COMM Module where power distribution is from the floor outlet, through the COMM
Module and subsequently to the JTF/CCM.
9.12.13.11.1.8.1. (Added) In the case of a JTF/CCM only, EMERGENCY SHUT DOWN PROCE-
DURES involves two steps. There is a RED emergency button, located inside the JTF/CCM to the right
of the entry door. Pushing this button will disconnect power to the JTF/CCM. Power from the floor to the
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                      25


JTF/CCM can be removed by opening the CARGO COMPT AUX PWR circuit breaker on the flight engi-
neers upper main circuit breaker panel.
9.12.13.11.1.8.2. (Added) When carrying both the JTF/CCM and the COMM Module, an emergency
shutdown procedure involves three steps. The RED emergency button located inside the JTF/CCM dis-
connects power to the JTF/CCM. Disconnecting power to the COMM Module involves depressing the
RED button on the circuit breaker panel which is located to the left of the enter door. Power from the floor
to the JTF/CCM can be removed by opening the CARGO COMPT AUX PWR circuit breaker on the
flight engineers upper main circuit breaker panel.
9.12.13.12. (Added) Movement of Large-Bodied Passengers. When carrying passengers who do not fit in
a single aircraft seat using a single seatbelt, seatbelt extensions are not approved. The use of cargo straps
and alterations of the seat configuration (i.e., raising/removing the arm rests, removing the seat cushion,
etc.) are also not authorized. There will be times when large-bodied passengers cannot be accepted for
flight aboard AMC aircraft, due to flight safety considerations. It is the passenger terminal’s responsibil-
ity to ensure these passengers are not manifested on aircraft where they will not fit. If someone in this cat-
egory makes it to the aircraft, use the utmost tact and diplomacy as this is a very sensitive issue.
9.12.14. (Added) Travis Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan.
9.12.14.1. (Added) When Phase II is in effect, Current Operations will make every effort not to schedule
departures or recoveries for missions during the designated BASH window.
9.12.14.1.1. (Added) Total number of missions scheduled that fall within an identified BASH window
will be annotated and approved (for scheduling purposes) in the monthly Wing Operations Plan. Addi-
tionally, missions will be reviewed and approved at the Air Operations Directive meeting.
9.12.14.1.2. (Added) If mission requirements dictate a departure during this period, Current Operations
will task Airfield Management to visually inspect the departure runway for birds 20 minutes prior to the
scheduled takeoff time (see 60 AMW OPLAN 91-212, BASH Plan, for more details). All takeoffs during
this period require 60 OG/CC approval.
9.12.14.1.3. (Added) Prior to transitioning at NON-DOD airfields, planner/aircrews will obtain any
available bird activity information. Aircrews experiencing high bird activity at these locations will advise
their respective safety office BASH representative.
9.12.14.1.4. (Added) At military or civilian airfields that do not have BASH programs, aircrews will use
the Bird Hazard Condition (BHC) definitions and the operational restrictions as a guide when assessing
the risk of bird hazards to flight operations.
9.12.14.2. (Added) Bird Hazard Conditions defined.
9.12.14.2.1. (Added) SEVERE - High wildlife population (as a guide, more than 15 large birds or 30
small birds) on or immediately above the active runway or other specific locations (taxiways, in-field
areas, and departure or arrival routes) that represents a high potential for a strike. Keep in mind a single
bird in a critical location may elevate the BWC to SEVERE.
9.12.14.2.2. (Added) MODERATE - Increased wildlife population (approximately 5 to 15 large birds or
15 to 30 small birds) in locations that represent an increased potential for a strike.
9.12.14.2.3. (Added) LOW - Sparse bird activity within 15 NM of the airport.
9.12.14.3. (Added) Aircrew Procedures.
26                                                      AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


9.12.14.3.1. (Added) Anytime the Travis BHC is SEVERE, all flight operations (takeoffs, landings and
approaches) are prohibited. Airborne aircraft will divert or hold. Deviations require 60 OG/CC (or higher)
approval.
9.12.14.3.1.1. (Added) Aircrews requesting waivers while at NON-AMC locations will coordinate with
the AMC/DO through the TACC. Recommended guidance during SEVERE BHC is to delay departures
and arrivals until bird watch condition is MODERATE or less.
9.12.14.3.1.2. (Added) In all cases, operational mission priority must be weighed in determining waiver
approval. When a waiver is approved for operation during SEVERE BHC at AMC locations, the local
OG/CC (or higher) must actively monitor launch and recovery of aircraft.
9.12.14.3.1.3. (Added) When the Travis Bird Hazard Condition is MODERATE or SEVERE, all aircraft
will be issued the appropriate BHC by Base Operations, ATC and Travis Command Post. If the condition
persists, it may also be broadcast on ATIS.
9.12.14.3.2. (Added) During the Phase II BASH window or anytime a MODERATE bird hazard condi-
tion has been declared:
9.12.14.3.2.1. (Added) Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when departure and arrival routes
avoid identified bird activity.
9.12.14.3.2.2. (Added) All local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity will cease (airborne aircraft/crews will
terminate transition training in the Travis local pattern).
9.12.14.3.2.3. (Added) All takeoffs require approval by 60 OG/CC after Airfield Management or wildlife
control personnel have surveyed the runways/airfield environment for significant bird activity. Aircrews
will coordinate approval through 60 AMW/CP. ATC and Travis Command Post, in coordination with
Airfield Management, will advise aircraft of the anticipated delay, if known, for bird dispersal or a return
to LOW BHC.
9.12.14.3.2.4. (Added) Airborne aircraft will divert, hold, or full stop. Aircraft commanders should assess
the risk by considering fuel status, weather, bird location, etc., when making this decision.
9.12.14.3.2.5. (Added) For aircrews on AMC-tasked missions, transition (practice patterns, approaches
and landings) at NON-DOD airfields will not be accomplished during that airfield’s BASH window. In
addition, missions should be scheduled to avoid other known peak bird activity periods for particular air-
fields.
9.12.14.4. (Added) Bird Avoidance Procedures at Travis AFB.
9.12.14.4.1. (Added) In conjunction with the Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program, consider the
following to avoid bird strikes in the local pattern. There are many birds in the vicinity of the Potrero Hills
Landfill which lies beneath the base turn for the circle and VFR pattern to RWY 3L (there is a book in
Base Ops with pictures of nesting locations). Follow these guidelines for bird avoidance:
9.12.14.4.1.1. (Added) Runway 03: Plan circling approaches and VFR patterns to RWY 3R. Circles and
VFR patterns to RWY 3L will avoid over flight of the Potrero Hills landfill. If extending beyond the land-
fill while circling, use Category E minima to ensure obstacle clearance.
9.12.14.4.1.2. (Added) Runway 21: Do not over fly the Potrero landfill on extended upwind VFR patterns
or circling to 21L/R from a RWY 3 approach.
AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006                                                                  27


9.12.14.5. (Added) Air Force Bird Strike Report. Crews will complete an AF Form 853, Air Force Bird
Strike Report, after a bird strike. Use the following procedures:
9.12.14.5.1. (Added) When block 8 on the form is answered "yes," an exact location, blocks 9 and 10 (Lat
and Long), is required. Consider using the "Mark" key on the FMS immediately to capture coordinates.
Write the location down when time permits.
9.12.14.5.2. (Added) Details about the exact location of a bird-strike should be made in block 26. Com-
plete the date and time (blocks 4 and 5) as well as altitude (block 13).
9.12.14.5.3. (Added) If a bird strike was discovered during the flight engineer post-mission walk-around,
fill in the form as completely as possible.
9.12.14.5.4. (Added) Fax completed AF Form 853 worksheets to 60 AMW/SE (reference paragraph
9.12.10.3. (Added) for current FAX numbers). If a bird strike results in reportable damage or an in-flight
emergency, also submit an AF Form 97, IAW paragraph 9.12.10.3. (Added) Electronic versions of these
forms are available on the 60 AMW/SE website at https://w3.travis.af.mil/safety.
9.12.14.6. (Added) Aircrew action after birdstrike: Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon
as conditions permit to have the aircraft inspected by weapon system specific qualified maintenance per-
sonnel. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed in flight, and undetected damage may result in a
complex airborne emergency. Only qualified maintenance personnel on the ground can make reliable
damage assessments. In addition, aircrews should not change the aircraft configuration until it has been
determined that it is safe to do so. However, crewmember judgment should always prevail in any situation
in making a decision concerning safety of the aircrew and aircraft.
9.12.15. (Added) Miscellaneous.
9.12.15.1. (Added) Flameless Ration Heater (FRH) for Meals Ready to Eat (MREs): MREs with the
FRHs incorporated can be identified by the following OSHA markings stenciled on each flame retardant
fiberboard shipping container: “NOTE: WATER ACTIVATED FLAMELESS RATION HEATERS,
NSN 8970-010321-9153, SUPPLIED IN EACH MRE MEAL BAG.” No special handling, packaging,
or certification is required for these FRHs for either CONUS or out of CONUS moves. The U.S. Dept of
Transportation has determined that small quantities of magnesium (8 grams or less per single unit)
involved do not warrant regulation as a hazardous material. When MREs with FRHs are used as in-flight
meals, the aircrew must ensure the heaters are not opened or activated on the aircraft. The FRHs will be
removed from the individual MRE units and retained by each passenger. Bulk packages of these heaters
are regulated as hazardous material and must be properly packaged and documented. The heaters are used
as supplements for MREs that do not have FRHs incorporated in each MRE meal bag. Domestic ship-
ments may be packaged in performance-oriented packaging (POP) approved shipping containers or IAW
DOT-E 10897 in flame retardant fiberboard boxes. If the DOT exempted container is used a copy of the
exemption must accompany the shipment. These exempted boxes are marked with the exemption number
and the following statement: “Water Activated. Note: In case of fire involving magnesium, flood with
large amounts of water with fog nozzle (not a solid stream) DOT-E 10897.”
9.12.15.2. (Added) Screening of Armed Crewmembers at AMC Pax Terminals. Armed crewmembers
should make every effort to avoid carrying concealed weapons into AMC passenger terminals. Options
include locking weapons in the aircraft gun box or arming crewmembers after trips to the passenger ter-
minal. If this is impractical or unavoidable, use the following procedures to eliminate the possibility of
highlighting armed crewmembers. Armed crewmembers must discreetly identify themselves to AMC
passenger service personnel upon arrival at security checkpoints. One aircrew member presenting a valid
28                                                     AFI11-2KC-10V3_TRAVISAFB 27 JULY 2006


set of crew orders, his/her Military ID Card, and a gun card authorizing the carrying of concealed weap-
ons can accomplish this. Once terminal personnel verify this, they will allow the crewmember to vouch
for the remaining crewmembers. The entire crew will then proceed through the magnetometer without
removing objects from their pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers
are armed. Once again, this is done discreetly so as to not sacrifice their position and in no way lessen the
security at single points of entry at passenger terminals.
9.12.16. (Added) Sequence of Events.

     dinated between the aircraft commander, boom operator, flight engineer, and the crew chief.
   2. (Added) Downline stations may use a different sequence of events. Coordinate with the applica-
      ble command post to establish required timing.

NOTES:
  1. (Added) 60 AMW Y-SID missions originating out of Travis will be scheduled to alert boom oper-
     ators 5+15 hrs prior to takeoff (4+15 for reserve missions). Cargo load time will commence 3+30
     prior to takeoff. These missions will be identified in the weekly AOD meeting and annotated in
     the remarks section of the OSS flying schedule as a Y SOE.
   2. (Added) The load briefing will be conducted at the aircraft for all KC-10 cargo missions originat-
      ing at Travis AFB. When following this SOE, Boom Operators WILL NOT pick up weapons;
      weapons should be picked up by crew members alerting at normal alert time. Delays in the brief
      will be noted by the Boom Operator and ATOC Information Controller (time arriving at the air-
      craft will be adjusted).
   3. (Added) Cargo load complete @ 1+30 is for planning purposes; mission requirements will dictate
      actual loading complete timing. PAX baggage loaded after cargo load complete.
   4. (Added) Boom operators will notify Command Post upon arrival at aircraft for commencement of
      upload.

NOTES:
5. (Added) This SOE is for all KC-10 missions other than Y-SIDs.
6. (Added) Instances in which opportune cargo is available, Travis Command Post Duty Officer will coor-
dinate with TACC and ATOC to determine whether opportune cargo will be authorized. At alert, the
operations controllers will notify the crew whether they have opportune cargo.
7. (Added) Crews will proceed to armory to pick up weapons. Following pick up of weapons, the primary
BO and FE will proceed to the aircraft. The cargo BO will proceed to the aircraft to receive the load pack-
age/briefing from ATOC. Delays in the brief will be noted by the Boom Operator and ATOC Information
Controller (time arriving at the aircraft will be adjusted).
8. (Added) Cargo load complete @ 1+30 is for planning purposes; mission requirements will dictate
actual loading complete time. PAX baggage loaded after cargo load complete. Two boom operators
should be available for cargo loading operations. When only one boom operator is available for loading
operations, mission delays should be anticipated.
