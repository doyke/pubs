       PURPOSE, COMMAND INFLUENCE, AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1.1. Purpose. This instruction sets forth requirements for the administration of military justice.
The primary sources of rules and guidance on military justice are in the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §801 et. seq., and the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM).
1.2. Unlawful Command Influence (Articles 37 and 98, UCMJ; Rules for Courts-Martial
(RCM) 104). The military justice system must operate free of unlawful command influence.
Staff Judge Advocates (SJAs), their staffs, and all personnel involved in the military justice
process must be sensitive to the existence, or appearance, of unlawful command influence.
Likewise, they must be vigilant and vigorous in efforts to prevent it and to respond appropriately
to its occurrence. SJAs should periodically discuss with commanders the importance of avoiding
even the appearance of unlawful command influence, and act decisively when apprised of facts
or circumstances which might give rise to it.
1.3. Ethics and Standards of Conduct. Legal ethics and expected standards of conduct in the
Air Force are contained in the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and Standards for
Civility in Professional Conduct, TJAG Policy Memorandum: TJS-2, and Air Force Standards
for Criminal Justice, TJS-3.
   1.3.1. General Application. These rules and standards apply to all military and civilian
   lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants in The Judge Advocate General‘s Corps, USAF.
   1.3.2. Application to Foreign National Attorneys Overseas. These rules and standards apply
   to all foreign national lawyers employed overseas by the Department of the Air Force, to the
   extent these rules are consistent with applicable domestic law and professional standards.
   1.3.3. Application to All Practitioners in Air Force Proceedings. The rules and standards
   also apply to all lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants who practice in Air Force
   courts or other proceedings, or assist others practicing in such proceedings. This includes,
   but is not limited to, civilian defense counsel (and their associates and non-lawyer assistants)
   who have no connection to the USAF other than as participants in such proceedings.
   Military defense counsel at trial, or appellate defense counsel on appeal, shall provide copies
   of TJS-2, the Rules, and TJS-3, the Standards, to civilian defense counsel of record. In any
   case in which military counsel is excused or not detailed, trial counsel shall ensure that
   civilian counsel has been provided the referenced rules and standards.

                                        Chapter 2

        COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION

Section 2A—Court-Martial Convening Authority

2.1. General Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(1)) The following Air Force
commanders may exercise general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA):
   2.1.1. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who have been
   authorized to exercise GCMCA by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) or the express
   authorization of TJAG to convene GCMs.
   2.1.2. Commanders of organizations not identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who are
   designated and authorized to convene GCMs by the SECAF under Article 22(a)(8), UCMJ,
   or empowered by the President under Article 22(a)(9), UCMJ.
   2.1.3. Requests for authorization to exercise GCMCA are forwarded through command
   channels to AFLOA/JAJM.
2.2. Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(2)). The following Air Force
commanders may exercise special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA):
   2.2.1. Commanders authorized to convene GCMs under paragraph 2.1.
   2.2.2. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a), UCMJ, who have been
   authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SECAF. Submit requests for SECAF action under
   Article 23(a)(7) to AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.2.3. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a)(4), UCMJ, who are not
   authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SECAF, but are authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM
   commander to convene special courts-martial. MAJCOM SJAs send a copy of all such
   authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.2.4. Commanders who are not authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SECAF, but who are
   authorized by the commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant
   command. The commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant
   command may only authorize subordinate commanders to exercise SPCMCA if the
   subordinate commander commands an organization identified by Article 23, UCMJ, and the
   subordinate commander commands an organization or unit assigned or attached to the Air
   Force component commander's command. The Air Force component command SJA sends a
   copy of all such authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.
2.3. Summary Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(3), RCM
1302). SPCMCAs and GCMCAs may convene summary courts-martial (SCM).                     The
commanding officer of a detached squadron or other detachment of the Air Force may convene a
SCM, as provided in Article 24(a)(3), UCMJ, only with the express authorization of the Air
Force GCMCA over the detached squadron or other detachment consistent with RCM
504(b)(2)(B).

Section 2B— Jurisdiction

2.4. Court-Martial Convening Authority Actions Involving Tenant Organizations. All
members of a tenant unit or Air Force Element (AFELM), whether designated as a unit or not,
are attached to the host command and its appropriate subordinate and higher commands for the
exercise of general, special, and summary courts-martial convening authority.
   2.4.1. All members of a stand-alone Air Reserve Station or Air Reserve Base are attached to
   the host command of the nearest active duty Air Force Installation and its appropriate
   subordinate and higher commands for the exercise of general, special, and summary courts-
   martial convening authority.
   2.4.2. While attachment for court-martial convening authority purposes does not serve to
   divest any other commander from the exercise of such authority over a member of the tenant
   unit, AFELM, or members assigned or attached to a reserve station or base, the concurrent
   exercise of such authority by the host command is preferred to expeditiously resolve the
   matter, preserve resources, and retain command prerogatives pertaining to matters affecting
   the maintenance of good order and discipline within the installation. Members of a tenant
   unit, AFELM, or members assigned or attached to a reserve station or base, include
   personnel on temporary duty with or otherwise attached to it.
       2.4.2.1. When a support agreement differing from that above is necessary or desirable, it
       must be documented at the general court-martial convening authority level or higher.
       2.4.2.2. All judge advocates assigned as senior trial counsel and senior defense counsel,
       area defense counsel, and defense paralegals are exclusively assigned to the Air Force
       Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) for courts-martial jurisdiction. All personnel
       assigned to AFLOA are exclusively attached to the Air Force District of Washington for
       court-martial jurisdiction. Military judges are assigned to AFDW for courts-martial
       jurisdiction.
   2.4.3. Sole Authority. This section is the sole authority for legal service support. No other
   order, writing or implementing agreement is required unless otherwise provided for herein.
2.5. Court-Martial Jurisdiction in Joint Commands (RCM 201(e), Joint Publication O-
2). Air Force personnel supporting a contingency in a deployed area of operations (AOR) fall
under the Air Force component commander‘s chain of command for Military Justice purposes.
While a commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene courts-martial
over members of any of the armed forces, a joint force commander normally should allow court-
martial jurisdiction over Air Force members to be exercised by the appropriate Air Force
convening authority. Air Force convening authorities should exercise court-martial jurisdiction
over members of other services only when warranted by RCM 201(e). AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization; AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment (Procedures for Multi-service Commanders).
2.6. Jurisdiction Involving State or Foreign Prosecution Interest.
   2.6.1. In General. Where an act or omission is subject to trial by court-martial or nonjudicial
   punishment proceedings and to trial by state or foreign courts, the determination of which
   sovereign shall exercise jurisdiction should be made through consultation or prior agreement
   between appropriate Air Force and civilian authorities. RCM 201(d). If state or foreign
   prosecution jurisdiction will not meet/or has not met the ends of good order and discipline, it
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                      19


  may be appropriate to seek permission from SECAF to exercise UCMJ authority. Convening
  authorities and staff judge advocates should foster relationships with local civilian authorities
  with a view toward maximizing Air Force jurisdiction. Except as discussed in 2.6.3., a
  member who is either pending trial or has been tried by a state or foreign court, regardless of
  the outcome, should not ordinarily be tried by a court-martial or subjected to nonjudicial
  punishment proceedings for the same act or omission. This limitation does not apply to
  vacation proceedings held under RCM 1109 and Part V, paragraph 6a(4) of the MCM. A
  member may be considered to be pending trial when state or foreign authorities have
  expressed their intention to try the member, even if formal charges have not been brought,
  e.g., upon arrest of the member or a representation by civilian authorities that they intend to
  pursue the case.
  2.6.2. Procedure. When a member is subject to both UCMJ and state or foreign jurisdiction
  for substantially the same act or omission, Air Force authorities must determine whether the
  exercise of jurisdiction is in the best interests of the Air Force. If the exercise of jurisdiction
  is sought, Air Force authorities (normally the SJA) shall contact appropriate civilian
  authorities and notify them of the Air Force desire for jurisdiction. Procedures for seeking
  jurisdiction in foreign locations are discussed in paragraph 2.6.2.1. If civilian or foreign
  authorities decline or waive the right to exercise jurisdiction, the Air Force may proceed with
  military justice action, whether court-martial or nonjudicial punishment. If the civilian or
  foreign authorities are exercising or express their intention to exercise jurisdiction over the
  member, neither a court-martial nor nonjudicial punishment may proceed as a matter of
  comity until the state or foreign proceedings are completed. Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S.
  254 (1922); United States v. Panchisin, 30 C.M.R. 921, 924-25 (A.F.B.R. 1961). If the state
  or foreign proceedings end without jeopardy attaching or if the Air Force receives clear intent
  that state or foreign proceedings will not continue pending UCMJ action, the principle of
  comity is satisfied and the Air Force may proceed with nonjudicial punishment or court-
  martial action. If jeopardy attached in the state or foreign proceedings, UCMJ action may not
  be taken unless approved by SECAF.
     2.6.2.1. Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction. The procedures to determine whether U.S.
     authorities or host-nation authorities will have primary criminal jurisdiction over military
     members present in foreign countries will vary from nation to nation. The status of
     forces agreement, or similar agreement, should address procedures for dealing with
     concurrent jurisdiction offenses. AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction, will be
     followed in these cases.
  2.6.3. Secretarial Approval. Only SECAF may approve initiation of court-martial or
  nonjudicial punishment action against a member previously tried by a state or foreign court
  for substantially the same act or omission, regardless of the outcome. These requests may
  only be submitted after the member has been tried in a state or foreign court. Submit
  requests, with full justification, through command channels to AFLOA/JAJM. SECAF
  approval will be granted in only the most unusual cases when the ends of justice and
  discipline can be satisfied in no other way. A member shall be deemed ―tried‖ by a state or
  foreign court if:
     2.6.3.1. Jeopardy has attached. Follow the state or foreign law to determine when this
     occurs. At a minimum, jeopardy attaches when the jury is impaneled and sworn, or when
     the first witness testifies in a judge alone trial. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28 (1978). State
 20                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       law may consider a member ―tried‖ even if the court ultimately suspends judgment upon
       discharge of the accused following probation, permits withdrawal of the guilty plea, or
       applies some form of alternative sentencing.
          2.6.3.1.1. A member will not be deemed ―tried‖ if the prosecution is deferred, held
          in abeyance, or otherwise diverted from normal channels pending completion of one
          or more conditions as an alternative to prosecution without an initial judicial
          determination of guilt. As a matter of Air Force policy, UCMJ action is
          impermissible without first seeking SECAF approval. If deferral, abeyance or
          diversion is conditional and the member remains subject to prosecution should he or
          she violates a condition, UCMJ action should not be taken until after the deferral,
          abeyance or diversion is completed.
2.7. Jurisdiction Involving Federal Agencies.
   2.7.1. Department of Justice (DOJ). The MCM, Appendix 3, (DoD Directive 5525.7,
   Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Department of Justice
   and the Department of Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Certain
   Crimes and DoDI 5525.07, Implementation of the MOU Between Department of Justice and
   Department of Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of Certain Crimes), sets
   forth DoD and DOJ responsibilities for investigating and prosecuting offenses over which the
   two departments have concurrent jurisdiction.
   2.7.2. U.S. Secret Service. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) exercises primary investigative
   responsibility for all cases involving alleged threats against the President or successors to the
   Presidency. 18 U.S.C. § 3056. The Chief, AFLOA/JAJM, or a designee, will meet with
   representatives of DOJ and USSS to determine which department will exercise further
   jurisdiction in the case.
   2.7.3. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 (18 U.S.C. §§ 3261 et seq)
   (MEJA). Military members, as well as civilians accompanying the force, may be subject to
   United States civilian federal jurisdiction for offenses committed while overseas. Submit a
   report of any potential case involving MEJA, through command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM.
   See AFI 51-1001, Delivery of Personnel to United States Civilian Authorities for Trial, and
   AFPD 51-10, Making Military Personnel, Employees, and Dependents Available to Civilian
   Authorities for substantive procedural guidance and procedures.

Section 2C— Completion of Service

2.8. Completion of Military Service (RCM 202).
   2.8.1. Court-martial jurisdiction extends to those persons whose enlistments have expired,
   but are awaiting discharge. Article 2(a)(1) and Article 3(a), UCMJ. Action with a view to
   trial must be taken as soon as practicable to preserve jurisdiction. RCM 202(c).
   2.8.2. Generally, jurisdiction to try a member of the military by court-martial ceases upon
   discharge or other separation. Jurisdiction over active duty military personnel normally
   continues until the member receives a valid discharge certificate, there is a final accounting
   of pay, and the member has completed administrative clearance processes required by his or
   her service Secretary. United States. v. King, 27 M.J. 327, 329 (C.M.A. 1989). SJAs should
   recognize that exceptions to this general rule might apply including regaining military
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    21


   jurisdiction for members upon reentry into military service. See RCM 202(a), Discussion
   (2)(B)(iii) and RCM 204(d). If the matter results in trial by court-martial, the record of trial
   (ROT) must include evidence that establishes jurisdiction over the accused.

Section 2D— Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members

2.9. Jurisdiction Over Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members (RCM 202).
   2.9.1. In General. Air National Guard Members while in Federal status and Air Reserve
   members including retired members are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction for offenses committed
   while on active duty or on inactive duty training status. Reserve members performing
   continuous duty in an inactive duty for training status overseas are subject to UCMJ
   jurisdiction from the commencement to the conclusion of such duty. Air National Guard
   (ANG) members are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction only when in Federal service. (Title 10).
   2.9.2. Courts-Martial. Once jurisdiction attaches in accordance with RCM 202(c), a
   member of a reserve component may either be retained on active duty pending disposition of
   offenses, or be released to reserve status and recalled as necessary for pretrial investigation,
   court-martial, or both. Prior consultation with the member‘s reserve component chain of
   command through JA channels is required. If the member is no longer on active duty when
   the offense is discovered, the member may be involuntarily ordered to active duty for a
   pretrial investigation, trial by court-martial, or both. In any case in which the accused is a
   member of the Reserve or Air National Guard, trial counsel must introduce sufficient
   evidence to establish in-personam jurisdiction over the accused at the time of the offense.
   2.9.3. Summary Courts-Martial and Nonjudicial Punishment. Do not involuntarily recall a
   reserve member to active duty solely to impose nonjudicial punishment or for trial by SCM.
   Initiate nonjudicial punishment or an SCM during the member's next period of inactive duty
   training or active duty. MAJCOM commanders or equivalents may grant waivers to this
   restriction in appropriate cases.
   2.9.4. Recall Authority. Subject to the consultation requirement of paragraph 2.9.2, the
   following may order a Reserve or Air National Guard member to active duty:
      2.9.4.1. A GCMCA for the regular component unit to which the member is attached for
      training purposes;
      2.9.4.2. A GCMCA for the regular component unit in which the member performed duty
      when the offense(s) occurred;
      2.9.4.3. A GCMCA of the regular component host unit, as designated in the applicable
      host-tenant support agreement if the member is assigned to a reserve component unit for
      training purposes, or was attached to such a unit when the offense(s) occurred; or
      2.9.4.4. AFRC/CC, 4 AF/CC, 10 AF/CC, or 22 AF/CC for members assigned or attached
      to their respective commands.
   2.9.5. Limitations on Punishment. A Reserve or Air National Guard member recalled to
   active duty for court-martial may not be sentenced to confinement, or be required to serve a
   punishment consisting of any restriction on liberty during the recall period of duty, without
   SECAF approval. See Article 2(d)(5), UCMJ. A punishment of restriction to specified
   limits may be imposed only during periods of inactive duty training or active duty ordered
 22                               AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   for routine (non-disciplinary) purposes. Requests for SECAF approval to recall a reserve
   member for court-martial to preserve the possibility that the sentence may include
   confinement are forwarded, via command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM. Generally, requests
   should be made prior to preferral of charges, but, in any case, must be approved prior to
   arraignment. The GCMCA must concur in the request and the request shall include as a
   minimum, the following information:
       2.9.5.1. The preferred or anticipated charges and specifications. When charges have
       been preferred, attach a copy of the charge sheet and personal data sheet.
       2.9.5.2. A summary of the evidence relating to each offense. Attach copies of any
       reports of investigation/inquiry or witness statements.
       2.9.5.3. Prior convictions and nonjudicial punishments.
       2.9.5.4. Whether the member refused an offer of nonjudicial punishment.
       2.9.5.5. The member's background, including                 civilian   employment,      family
       circumstances, and character of military service.
       2.9.5.6. Consultation with the member's reserve component chain of command, such as
       the unit commander (state adjutant general for an ANG member performing Federal
       service).

Section 2E— Retired Personnel

2.10. Jurisdiction Over Retired Air Force Personnel. Retired regular Air Force personnel
who are entitled to receive pay (Article 2(a)(4), UCMJ), retired members of a reserve component
who are receiving hospitalization from an armed service (Article 2(a)(5), UCMJ), and retired
members of a reserve component subject to lawful orders to return to duty (See Morgan v.
Mahoney, 50 M.J. 633 (1999), will not be tried by court-martial for acts/omissions while on
active duty or inactive duty training, within the statute of limitations, unless their conduct clearly
links them with the military or is adverse to a significant military interest of the United States.
SECAF approval is required prior to preferral of charges unless there is an immediate statute of
limitations problem. If the time prescribed by the statute of limitations is about to expire, prefer
charges and request SECAF approval as soon as possible. Send requests for approval, with full
justification, to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 2F— General Officers

2.11. Jurisdiction Over General Officers. Only commanders of Air Force MAJCOMs and
superior convening authorities may exercise court-martial convening authority over Air Force
general officers. This limitation does not apply to the exercise of court-martial convening
authority by the commanding officer of a unified command.

Section 2G—Other Persons

2.12. Jurisdiction Over DoD Civilian Employees, DoD Contractor Personnel, and Other
Persons Serving With or Accompanying the Armed Forces Overseas During Declared War
and in Contingency Operations (Article 2(a)(10), UCMJ).
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 23


  2.12.1. Article 2(a)(10) Jurisdiction. Only the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) possesses
  the authority to exercise court-martial convening authority and impose nonjudicial
  punishment (NJP) over persons subject to Article 2(a)(10) with respect to: offenses
  committed within the "United States," meaning the several States of the United States, the
  District of Columbia, and the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United
  States; persons who were not at all times during the alleged misconduct located outside the
  "United States," as defined above; and persons who are, at the time court-martial charges are
  preferred or notice of NJP proceedings is given, located within the "United States," as
  defined above. See SECDEF Memorandum dated 10 March 2008, ―UCMJ Jurisdiction Over
  DoD Civilian Employees, DoD Contractor Personnel, and Other Persons Serving With or
  Accompanying the Armed Forces Overseas During Declared War and in Contingency
  Operations.‖
     2.12.1.1. Only SECDEF, geographic combatant commanders (CCDRs), and
     commanders assigned or attached to geographic combatant commands who also possess
     GCMCA may exercise court-martial convening authority and impose NJP over persons
     subject to Article 2(a)(10) with respect to offenses committed outside the "United States,"
     as defined in paragraph 2.12.1 Geographic CCDRs may withhold this authority within
     their command.
     2.12.1.2. Authority to prefer court-martial charges and offer NJP is withheld until the
     notification requirements outlined in paragraph 2.12.4 are accomplished.            Law
     enforcement, criminal investigations, and other military justice procedures that precede
     the preferral of court-martial charges should continue, as applicable, during this
     notification process.
     2.12.1.3. Authority to prefer court-martial charges and offer NJP is withheld whenever
     DOJ provides notice that it intends to pursue federal criminal prosecution for what is
     substantially the same offense or a related offense, and such withholding of authority
     shall remain in effect while DOJ is pursuing its federal prosecution of the case until such
     prosecution is completed or terminated prior to its completion.
  2.12.2. Command Law Enforcement Authority. Commanders at all levels have the
  authority to investigate any crime allegedly committed by persons subject to the UCMJ, as
  well as persons subject to MEJA jurisdiction until such time as civilian law enforcement
  officials have assumed sole investigative responsibility. Such investigations shall be
  conducted in accordance with practices established with host nation authorities, applicable
  international law, and international agreements.
     2.12.2.1. Apprehension and Arrest. Military law enforcement officers and military
     criminal investigators are authorized to apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction,
     and arrest and temporarily detain persons subject to MEJA jurisdiction, when there is
     probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the person committed it,
     subject to the requirements of RCMs 304 and 305. Although all commissioned, warrant,
     petty, and noncommissioned officers on active duty may apprehend persons subject to
     UCMJ jurisdiction, absent exigent circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be
     done by law enforcement personnel. The apprehension and arrest of civilians in a foreign
     nation is almost exclusively a host nation function. When the apprehension, arrest, or
     temporary detention of a civilian by U.S. authorities is appropriate, such action shall be
24                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


     done in accordance with established procedures, applicable international law, and
     international agreements.
     2.12.2.2. Pretrial Restraint and Confinement. Commanders may order the pretrial
     restraint or confinement of civilians subject to the limitations of RCM 304(b) and all
     applicable provisions of the MCM and this instruction. Absent exigent circumstances,
     Article 2(a)(10) personnel shall not be placed in pretrial restraint or confinement without
     first consulting with the SJA of the appropriate geographic CCDR.
  2.12.3. Command Discretion. The unique nature of exercising UCMJ jurisdiction over
  civilians requires commanders to evaluate legal and policy considerations before initiating
  any punitive disciplinary action.
     2.12.3.1. Legal Considerations. Article 2(a)(10) applies to individuals serving with or
     accompanying the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard in the field during
     declared war or contingency operations. See 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(13). This generally
     includes DoD civilian employees and contractors, as well as individuals who are
     dependent on or connected to the armed forces in some manner. See United States v.
     Burney, 21 C.M.R. 98 (C.M.A. 1956); Perlstein v. United States et al., 151 F. 2d. 167 (3d
     Cir. 1945). It can also include both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, but international
     agreements will likely impact punitive action against any foreign national. Before taking
     any steps to initiate UCMJ action, it is critical to establish that Article 2(a)(10)
     jurisdiction applies.
     2.12.3.2. Policy Considerations. Even if an individual is legally subject to the UCMJ, as
     a matter of policy the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(10) must also be based
     on military necessity to support an effective fighting force and be called for by
     circumstances that meet the interests of justice, such as when federal criminal jurisdiction
     otherwise does not apply or federal criminal prosecution is not pursued, or when the
     person's conduct is adverse to a significant military interest of the United States (e.g.,
     alleged misconduct that may jeopardize good order and discipline or discredit the armed
     forces and thereby have a potential adverse effect on military operations).
  2.12.4. Notification Requirements and Procedures. Before initiating any disciplinary
  action against any person under Article 2(a)(10), commanders, through their SJAs, shall
  comply with the notification procedures outlined below.
     2.12.4.1. General Requirements. All levels of command must follow the notification
     requirements of DoD Instruction 5525.11, Criminal Jurisdiction Over Civilians
     Employed By or Accompanying the Armed Forces Outside the United States, Certain
     Service Members, and Former Service Members, in all cases intended to be pursued
     under Article 2(a)(10), to include forwarding all reasonably available information
     regarding the investigation, the suspect‘s last known residence in the United States, and
     the reasoning in support of a UCMJ disposition. Potential Article 2(a)(10) cases also
     trigger special interest reporting requirements under paragraph 13.8 and must be
     immediately reported to AFLOA/JAJM.
     2.12.4.2. Non-GCMCA Notification Requirements. Commanders who are not GCMCAs
     shall, before initiating any UCMJ disposition under RCMs 306-308 or 401-406, forward
     expeditiously all available information regarding the alleged misconduct that is
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 25


     potentially subject to this jurisdiction to the first GCMCA in the chain of command that
     is attached or assigned to a geographic combatant command.
     2.12.4.3. GCMCA Notification Requirements. GCMCAs assigned or attached to a
     geographic combatant command shall notify in writing (including by email or facsimile)
     their respective geographic CCDR of their intended disposition by court-martial or NJP
     over persons subject to Article 2(a)(10).
     2.12.4.4. CCDR Notification Requirements. Before any commander prefers court-
     martial charges or before a commander authorized by paragraph 2.12.1.1 offers NJP
     based on Article 2(a)(10), and regardless of whether the suspected offense may also be an
     offense under federal criminal laws, the geographic CCDR commander shall first provide
     notice of the case in writing (including by email or facsimile) in accordance with the
     procedures established in DoD Instruction 5525.11 through DoD channels so that DOJ
     may be afforded the opportunity to pursue federal criminal prosecution.
     2.12.4.5. DOJ-DoD Notification Requirements. After DoD's formal notification to DOJ,
     DOJ is to expeditiously (but in no case longer than 14 calendar days absent an extension)
     notify DoD whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction over the case. If DOJ elects to
     exercise jurisdiction over the case, authority to convene a court-martial or administer NJP
     is withheld. If DOJ does not exercise jurisdiction or terminates prosecution, or if
     permission to proceed is granted by SECDEF or his designee, UCMJ action may be
     initiated.
  2.12.5. Court-Martial Rights and Procedures. The MCM ensures a fair trial and due
  process of law for all persons tried before a properly constituted court-martial. The
  following clarifications will assist all parties with interpreting the MCM and applicable
  regulations.
     2.12.5.1. Military Defense Counsel. An accused under Article 2(a)(10) has the same
     rights to counsel as a military accused subject to the requirements prescribed in the
     Military Defense Counsel Charter, including the right to be represented by a detailed
     military defense counsel, the right to request an individual military defense counsel, and
     the right to be represented by a civilian defense counsel at no expense to the government.
     2.12.5.2. Court Members. Only commissioned officers on active duty are eligible to
     serve on a court-martial for the trial of any accused under Article 2(a)(10). A convening
     authority may, but is not required to, consider rank equivalencies by comparing military
     and civilian pay tables when selecting officer members for an accused who holds a
     federal civilian position. An accused under Article 2(a)(10) does not have the right to
     request enlisted court members.
     2.12.5.3. Punishments. Subject to the limitations of the MCM, a court-martial may
     adjudge only the following punishments for an accused under Article 2(a)(10):
     reprimand, fine, restriction to specified limits, confinement, and death.

                                           Chapter 3

      MILITARY MAGISTRATES, PRETRIAL RESTRAINT, AND PREFERRAL

Section 3A— Military Magistrates

3.1. Military Magistrate Program.
   3.1.1. Appointment of Magistrate (MRE 315(d)(2)). The commander of the lowest
   organizational level having command over an Air Force installation, who is either an
   SPCMCA or GCMCA, or the installation commander at Air Force Reserve Command
   (AFRC) bases and stations, may appoint a maximum of two officers with judicial
   temperament to serve as military magistrates for that installation. If unique circumstances
   exist that warrant the appointment of more than two magistrates, permission to appoint
   additional magistrates must be obtained from the GCMCA and approved by AFLOA/JAJM.
   Appoint magistrates in writing by name, not position, and specify the installation over which
   the magistrates may exercise authority.
   3.1.2. Qualifications. A military magistrate should be an officer serving in the grade of
   lieutenant colonel or above. The appointment of any magistrate in the rank of major or
   below may only be made by, or with the concurrence of, the GCMCA exercising jurisdiction
   over the installation. Chaplains, SJA office personnel, Air Force Office of Special
   Investigations (AFOSI) and Security Forces (SF) members, and court-martial convening
   authorities may not serve as military magistrates. Officers appointed at AFRC installations
   must be serving a period of inactive duty training or active duty to perform magistrate duties.
   3.1.3. Authority. A military magistrate issues search and seizure, and apprehension
   authorizations based upon probable cause. If two magistrates are appointed for an
   installation, each exercises concurrent authority with the other and with the installation
   commander. The commander need not be unavailable for a magistrate to exercise this
   authority.
   3.1.4. Non-Air Force Military Installations. The Air Force commander who is either an
   SPCMCA or GCMCA at a military installation where the installation commander is not an
   Air Force commander may appoint an officer with judicial temperament to serve as a military
   magistrate for matters involving Air Force personnel on the installation. A military
   magistrate appointed under this paragraph is authorized to issue search and seizure and
   apprehension authorizations, based on probable cause, involving Air Force personnel at non-
   Air Force military installations to the extent the commander appointing the military
   magistrate has control over the place where the property or person to be searched is situated
   or found, or over the person to be apprehended. MRE 315(d)(1). This military magistrate
   exercises concurrent authority with the commander who appointed him or her.
   3.1.5. SJA Duties. The SJA for the commander appointing military magistrates should brief
   military magistrates on their duties at the time of their appointment and whenever necessary
   thereafter.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   27


Section 3B— Pretrial Confinement and Restraint

3.2. Pretrial Confinement (RCM 305). An authorized person must determine if there is
probable cause to order pretrial confinement. Once the member is placed in pretrial
confinement, additional steps must occur to determine if it is appropriate to continue pretrial
confinement − a 48-hour probable cause determination, a 72-hour commander‘s decision and
memorandum, and a pretrial confinement review (within 7 days). Normally, offenses to be
disposed of by summary court-martial do not warrant pretrial confinement.
   3.2.1. Probable Cause for Pretrial Confinement. No person may be ordered into pretrial
   confinement except for probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists
   when there is a reasonable belief that an offense triable by court-martial has been committed,
   the person confined committed it, and confinement is required by the circumstances.
   Additional matters to consider include the person‘s background and character, the details of
   the offense, and the matters in the Discussion following RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The person who
   directs confinement need not conduct a detailed analysis of the circumstances before
   physically detaining the person if time does not permit. See RCM 305(d).
   3.2.2. 48-Hour Probable Cause Determination. Within 48 hours of the imposition of
   confinement under military control, a neutral and detached officer must review the adequacy
   of probable cause to continue pretrial confinement. RCM 305(i)(1); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420
   U.S. 103, 124-25 (1975); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). See
   format at Figure 3.1. If the determination is not made within 48 hours, the government may
   have to establish the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary
   circumstances. The determination should be in writing and included in the Record of Trial
   (ROT).
       3.2.2.1. Include in the ROT any documentation regarding a determination of probable
       cause made by civilian authorities prior to transfer of the member to military authorities.
       When a military member is transferred from civilian confinement to military control,
       authorities must still conduct a 48-hour probable cause determination.
       3.2.2.2. Factors to consider in determining whether an officer is neutral and detached
       include whether the officer is the formal accuser on the charge sheet, is the officer who
       ordered the accused into confinement, or is directly or particularly involved in the
       command‘s law enforcement functions. United States v. Rexroat, 38 M.J. 292 (C.M.A.
       1993); United States v. Lynch, 13 M.J. 394 (C.M.A. 1982).
       3.2.2.3. The Pretrial Confinement Review in paragraph 3.2.4 will satisfy the 48-hour
       probable cause determination if the Pretrial Confinement Review memorandum is
       completed within 48 hours of the imposition of confinement.
   3.2.3. 72-Hour Commander‘s Decision and Memorandum. A commander shall decide
   whether to continue pretrial confinement not later than 72 hours after the commander orders
   a military member into pretrial confinement, or after receipt of a report that a member of the
   commander‘s unit or organization has been confined. The commander must address the
   requirements for confinement in RCM 305(h)(2)(B) and should consider the factors in the
   Discussion to that section. If the commander decides to continue pretrial confinement, he or
   she must prepare a written memorandum in accordance with RCM 305(h)(2)(C). The
   memorandum is then forwarded to the Pretrial Confinement Review Officer, through the SJA
28                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  and SPCMCA. If court-martial results, the commander‘s memorandum must be included in
  the ROT. Figure 3.3 provides a sample format.
     3.2.3.1. The 72-hour commander‘s decision will satisfy the 48-hour probable cause
     determination only if the commander is neutral and detached and acts within 48 hours of
     the imposition of confinement. RCM 305(h)(2)(A). See Figure 3.3.
  3.2.4. Pretrial Confinement Review (PCR), (RCM 305(i)(2)). Within 7 days of the
  imposition of pretrial confinement under military control, a Pretrial Confinement Review
  Officer (PCRO) must review the probable cause determination and make a decision about the
  necessity for continued pretrial confinement. United States v. McCants, 39 M.J. 91 (C.M.A.
  1994).
     3.2.4.1. Appointment of PCROs, (RCM 305(i)(2)). The SPCMCA appoints, by letter, a
     reasonable number of mature officers to serve as PCROs. Chaplains, SJA office
     personnel, AFOSI and SF members, and court-martial convening authorities may not
     serve as a PCRO. Military magistrates may also be appointed as PCROs. Except in
     unusual circumstances, a magistrate should not serve as the PCRO if he or she otherwise
     acted upon the same case in any capacity.
     3.2.4.2. The PCRO must review the commander‘s decision to continue pretrial
     confinement satisfying the 72-hour requirement. The PCRO should consider any matters
     submitted by the pretrial confinee.
         3.2.4.2.1. The PCR may satisfy the 48-hour probable cause determination
         requirement if the PCR decision is completed within 48 hours of the imposition of
         confinement. In such cases, the PCR memorandum must specifically state when the
         probable cause determination was made.
     3.2.4.3. The PCRO conducts a hearing at which the pretrial confinee and defense counsel
     shall be allowed to appear and make a statement before the PCRO, if practicable. A
     government representative, usually a judge advocate, may also make a statement, if
     practicable. Although the PCR is not an adversarial proceeding, the PCRO may exercise
     his or her discretion by allowing the pretrial confinee, defense counsel or government
     representative to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses. The PCRO must
     complete a written summary of the testimony of any witnesses. The only rules of
     evidence that apply are MRE 302, MRE 305 and MRE 501 - 513 (Section V - Privileges).
     3.2.4.4. Upon completion of the PCR, the PCRO shall approve continued confinement or
     order immediate release. To continue pretrial confinement, the PCRO must find the
     requirements of RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence
     to continue pretrial confinement. If the requirements of RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have not been
     proven, the PCRO must order immediate release of the pretrial confinee. The PCRO may
     not impose conditions on release, but may recommend the commander impose a less
     severe form of pretrial restraint. If the PCRO orders release, a commander may impose
     any alternative lesser form of pretrial restraint authorized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3).
     3.2.4.5. Within 24 hours of making the pretrial confinement decision, the PCRO must
     complete a memorandum of the PCRO‘s conclusions and the findings on which they are
     based. A copy of all documents and summaries of all oral statements considered by the
     PCRO must be attached to the memorandum. The memorandum with attachments shall
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                      29


       be provided to the SPCMCA, the SPCMCA‘s SJA, the confinement officer, the pretrial
       confinee and the pretrial confinee‘s defense counsel. Figure 3.4 provides a sample
       format for the PCRO‘s memorandum.
   3.2.5. Pretrial Restraint Upon Release From Confinement. A commander may impose any
   alternative lesser form of pretrial restraint authorized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3), if
   release is ordered by the PCRO. Re-confinement after release is limited to circumstances
   provided in RCM 305(l). United States v. Mahoney, 36 M.J. 679 (A.F.C.M.R. 1992). The
   requirements of this chapter apply to a member upon imposition of re-confinement.
   3.2.6. Pretrial Restraint as Suicide Prevention. Preventing an accused from committing
   suicide is not valid as the sole basis for ordering the accused into or continuing pretrial
   confinement. A distinction shall be drawn between an accused that is a threat to him or
   herself and an accused that is either a threat to flee the jurisdiction to avoid prosecution or is
   a threat to commit a serious offense. The latter may be placed in pretrial confinement in
   accordance with RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The former should be referred to mental health
   practitioners for evaluation and treatment and, if necessary, involuntary commitment in a
   mental health facility. United States v. Doane, 54 M.J. 978, 982 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001).
   3.2.7. Pretrial Determination of Mental Competence. A convening authority may determine
   the place and condition of pretrial detention, including confinement in a civilian facility, for
   the purpose of evaluating the competency of the accused, subject to review by a military
   judge for abuse of discretion. The conditions may not be more harsh than necessary to
   ensure the accused's presence at trial. The facility must be capable of rendering the necessary
   competency evaluations and providing necessary care and treatment of the accused. Article
   13, UCMJ; RCM 706, 909; Short v. Chambers, 33 M.J. 49 (C.M.A. 1991); 18 U.S.C. § 4241.
   3.2.8. SJA Duties. SJAs must ensure confinement personnel advise pretrial confinees in
   accordance with RCM 305(e). SJAs must ensure PCROs are briefed on their duties when
   appointed, and updated as appropriate thereafter. SJAs must notify alleged victims of a
   confinee's pretrial confinement and release from pretrial confinement. Consult AFI 51-703,
   Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction, if a member is confined at the request of foreign host nation
   authorities.

Section 3C— Preferral of Charges (RCM 307)

3.3. Considerations Prior to Preferral of Charges.
   3.3.1. Accuser is Senior to the Convening Authority. Consult RCM 504(c)(2) and (3) when
   the accuser is senior in rank to the convening authority.
   3.3.2. Authority To Proceed in Cases Involving an Accused with Special Access. Do not
   take action on personnel who hold or have held access to Single Integrated Operation Plan-
   Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI),
   research and development (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or
   other special access program information until the appropriate special access program office
   approves. Legal offices ensure compliance with AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
   Management. In accordance with AFI 31-501, paragraph 8.9, commanders must submit a
   written request to the appropriate special access program functional office for permission to
   proceed with further processing before initiating action against military members that could
30                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  lead to a discharge. The legal office must also ensure a copy of the commander‘s written
  request is sent to AFLOA/JAJM. Apply security classification according to message
  contents and send through classified channels as required. In accordance with AFI 31-501,
  paragraph 8.9.8, if a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing
  of the case may proceed with preferral of charges and completion of the investigation
  required by Article 32, UCMJ, together with collateral actions required under Article 32.
  Under no circumstances may the charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action
  office grants authority to proceed. It is recommended that authority to proceed be sought
  before preferral and as soon as possible due to the length of time it takes to process these
  requests.
  3.3.3. Preferral in Lengthy Absence Cases. Effective 14 November 1986, summary court-
  martial convening authorities (SCMCAs) are no longer required to receipt for charges
  alleging either desertion or absent without leave (AWOL) in order to toll the statute of
  limitations. Article 43, UCMJ. Therefore, where an unauthorized absence began after 14
  November 1986, preferral and receipt for charges is not required to toll the statute of
  limitations. For all lengthy absence cases for which charges were preferred on or before 14
  November 1986 where the member has not yet returned to military control, preferred
  charges, receipted for by the SCMCA are still required to toll the limitations period. The
  servicing SJA should obtain a written delay from the appropriate convening authority to stop
  the running of the RCM 707 speedy trial rule. Documentation of approved delays shall be
  attached to the charge sheet in the member's personnel records before sending the records to
  the Air Force Personnel Center. AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence.
  Charges for desertion or an unauthorized absence, either of which began before 14 November
  1986, where there was no preferral and receipt of charges, are not viable.
  3.3.4. Extension Beyond Expiration of Term of Service (ETS). Airman may be retained
  beyond their ETS in anticipation of the preferral of charges. If there is sufficient time, the
  SJA must notify the MPF separations unit in writing. If time does not permit written
  notification, written confirmation of the verbal notice should be provided to the MPF within
  five duty days. See AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airman, and AFCSM 36-699
  Volume 1, Personnel Data Systems User Manual, Table 7B1, for guidelines, sample letters
  and rules regarding the length of extensions.
  3.3.5. Accused With Prior Adjudged Punitive Discharge. If an accused has an approved, but
  unexecuted, prior punitive discharge, the SJA for the SPCMCA over the accused shall
  immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM by voice message, e-mail, or facsimile notice concerning
  preferral of new charges, with information copies sent to the appropriate GCM and
  MAJCOM SJAs. This notice enables JAJM to ensure that the execution of the previous
  punitive discharge does not occur, providing continuing court-martial jurisdiction over the
  accused.
  3.3.6. Recoupment. If an accused received education assistance, special pay, or bonus
  money and faces separation or discharge before completion of the agreed upon period of
  active duty, notice of recoupment should be given when court-martial charges are preferred
  in accordance with Title 10, United States Code, Section 2005(g). The member should sign a
  statement of understanding regarding recoupment as shown in Figure 3.5. This notice is
  included in the ROT with pretrial allied papers in accordance with AFMAN 51-203, Records
  of Trial, Figure 4.1., paragraph 20.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                     31


3.4. Charge Sheet Preparation.
   3.4.1. Charge Sheet. Prepare charges and specifications on the DD Form 458, Charge
   Sheet. The Charge Sheet should be prepared by inputting the data into AMJAMS and
   printing out the electronic version of the DD Form 458. Information in AMJAMS should be
   reflected as follows:
   3.4.2. Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Autofill information in AMJAMS from AFPC and ensure its
   accuracy. Make pen and ink changes to the charge sheet to reflect any change in the
   accused's grade prior to arraignment by lining through and keeping the information legible.
   Initial any changes.
   3.4.3. Block 5. Enter the accused's assigned organization under the Duty Status tab in
   AMJAMS. The address should reflect the base name, state and zip. Ensure the correct pull
   down is selected for your MAJCOM. At squadron level, enter "111th Civil Engineer
   Squadron," not "111th Civil Engineering Squadron Section."
   3.4.4. Block 6. The accused's current service is the date the current enlistment began for
   enlisted personnel and the Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) for
   officers. Extensions do not change the current enlistment date. This information can be
   found in the accused's personnel records or in the record review listing prepared by the
   servicing personnel office. Double check the RIPS against the information autofilled from
   AFPC.
   3.4.5. Block 7. The accused's current pay per month will be entered automatically, this will
   need to be to changed if AFPC lists the incorrect rank. If it changes prior to arraignment,
   correct it with a pen and ink change.
   3.4.6. Blocks 8 and 9. Include any form of restraint, including restraint by civil authorities at
   the behest of the Air Force, by adding the pretrial restraint folder under the pretrial
   information in AMJAMS. An example of this is when a member in an AWOL or deserter
   status is apprehended pursuant to a DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed
   Forces, by civilian police and incarcerated or detained until Air Force officials take custody
   of the accused.
   3.4.7. Charges and Specifications. Consult RCM 307 and refer to the sample specifications
   in the MCM, Part IV, and the Military Judge‘s Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9. AMJAMS
   will auto-fill the charge and specification indicators in automatically.
      3.4.7.1. Format. Type the words "CHARGE" and "ADDITIONAL CHARGE" in all
      capital letters. "Specification‖ includes upper and lower case letters. Where more than
      one charge or specification is alleged, charges are numbered with Roman numerals (e.g.,
      I, II, III) and specifications with Arabic numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). A single charge or
      specification is not numbered.
      3.4.7.2. Additional Charges. When additional charges are preferred, add ―Additional
      Charges Preferred.‖ AMJAMS will label the charges as ADDITIONAL CHARGES. If
      charges are preferred after preferral of additional charges, add another ―Additional
      Charges Preferred‖ folder in AMJAMS. AMJAMS will label each new set of charges
      with written numbers (e.g., SECOND ADDITIONAL CHARGES, THIRD
      ADDITIONAL CHARGES).
 32                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       3.4.7.3. Identification of the Accused. In the specifications, identify the accused by
       present grade, followed by the grade on the date of the alleged offense, if different. Use
       all capital letters. Do not include the MAJCOM. List known aliases. For example: "In
       that TECHNICAL SERGEANT ADAM J. SMITH, United States Air Force, then
       MASTER SERGEANT ADAM J. SMITH, alias CAPTAIN JAY J. SMITH, United
       States Air Force, 401st Maintenance Squadron, did, . . ." NOTE: Change the accused‘s
       rank from the time of the allegation only if pertinent to the offense charged. RCM
       307(c)(3), Discussion.
       3.4.7.4. Identification of Victim. If the alleged victim is identified in the specification,
       do not put the victim's name or grade in all capital letters. Do not substitute initials for
       the name of child or sex offense victims, as is required on court-martial orders. See
       paragraph 10.7 of this instruction.
       3.4.7.5. Pleading Check Cases. Where a check or other instrument appears regularly in
       all respects, the contents need not be pled verbatim. In such cases, consider using the
       model specifications provided in the Military Judges‘ Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9 or
       the sample specifications provided at Figure 3.2. If in doubt, plead the check verbatim,
       but include only the portions applicable at the time of the offense.
3.5. Forwarding Charges (RCM 401). The commander forwards the charges to the convening
authority by attaching an indorsement (Figure 3.6) to the DD Form 458. Attach a personal data
sheet on the accused (Figure 3.7) and a copy of the report of investigation or other evidence
supporting the charges. The commander signs and dates the indorsement when preferring
charges or when forwarding charges preferred by another. Address the indorsement to the
officer exercising SPCMCA over the accused. If additional charges are later added, forward
them with a new indorsement.
3.6. Receipt for Charges (RCM 403). A judge advocate may receipt for charges on behalf of
the SCMCA if the convening authority delegates that authority. If delegated, receive the charges
"FOR THE COMMANDER."
3.7. Discovery. SJAs and Trial Counsel are strongly encouraged to provide discovery to
defense counsel as soon as practicable. This may be prior to the preferral of charges.
   3.7.1. At the time charges are preferred, the Trial Counsel should, as a minimum, provide
   defense counsel the following matters:
       3.7.1.1. A copy of DD Form 458;
       3.7.1.2. A copy of the commander‘s indorsement to the DD Form 458 with all
       attachments; and
       3.7.1.3. A copy of any report of investigation and any signed or sworn statements
       relating to the offense charged, unless the government claims that the documents or
       portions thereof are protected from release, or disclosure will have an adverse impact on
       an ongoing or proposed law enforcement investigation.
   3.7.2. Defense counsel will be provided the opportunity to inspect items of physical
   evidence upon request and when reasonably available at the time charges are preferred or
   within a reasonable time thereafter.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                               33


   3.7.3. These provisions are not intended to create any new substantive rights to discovery
   beyond those contained in the Rules for Courts-Martial. After referral of charges to trial,
   discovery shall be made by both trial and defense counsel in accordance with the Rules for
   Courts-Martial.

                                          Chapter 4

                     FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

Section 4A— Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations

4.1. Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations (RCM 404(e), 405, 406(b)(2), 601(d)).
   4.1.1. Requirement for an Article 32 Investigation. Before any charge(s) or specification(s)
   may be referred to a general court-martial for trial, a thorough and impartial investigation
   into the matters set forth in the charge(s) and specification(s) must be made.
   4.1.2. Investigating Officer (IO).
       4.1.2.1. Appointment. The convening authority directs an Article 32 investigation by
       personally appointing the IO in writing. See sample appointment letter at Figure 4.1. All
       documents provided to the IO before the investigation must be listed as attachments. The
       charge sheet and the written evidence, which forms the basis for the charge, should be
       attached to the IO Appointment Letter. Normally these documents are the same as those
       attached to the commander‘s indorsement to the charge sheet. The IO is not required to
       consider this evidence in the investigation. The IO ensures a copy of the Appointment
       Letter is provided to the accused before the Article 32 investigation begins.
       4.1.2.2. Qualification of the IO. Unless precluded by military necessity or other
       compelling circumstance, the IO should be senior in rank to the accused. An IO must
       either be a designated judge advocate or hold the grade of major or higher. An IO may be
       a reserve judge advocate on active duty or performing inactive duty training. ANG judge
       advocates must be on Title 10 orders to serve as an IO. The accuser may not act as IO.
       The IO must be impartial. Before appointing an officer to serve as an IO, the convening
       authority should consider the appointment in the context of the officer‘s normally
       assigned duties and assess whether the IO‘s impartiality could be questioned based on
       his/her relationship with the case, the parties, and the base legal office.
   4.1.3. Counsel.
       4.1.3.1. Government Representative. The convening authority may personally detail, or
       authorize the servicing SJA to detail, a government representative as counsel to represent
       the United States. RCM 405(d)(3). Both the detail of a government representative and
       the authorization to allow the SJA to detail a government representative may be verbal or
       in writing.
       4.1.3.2. Counsel for the Accused. The accused is entitled to be represented by military
       defense counsel certified under Article 27(b) and sworn under Article 42(a), UCMJ.
       RCM 405(d)(2). The accused may also be represented by civilian defense counsel;
       however, civilian defense counsel must be provided at no expense to the government.
       RCM 405(d)(2)(C). Civilian defense counsel must take an oath to perform his or her
       duties faithfully when representing an accused. The IO will administer this oath. The
       accused may represent himself, but this right is not absolute. United States v. Bramel, 29
       M.J. 958 (A.C.M.R.), aff‘d, 32 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1990).
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                47


  4.1.4. Delays and Resulting Speedy Trial Issues. The convening authority may approve a
  delay of the Article 32 investigation submitted by either party. The period of time of such
  delay shall be excluded when determining whether the period in RCM 707(a) has run. Prior
  to referral, the convening authority may delegate the authority to grant continuances to an
  Article 32 investigating officer. See RCM 707(a)(1) Discussion. Thus, when an IO has been
  delegated authority to grant delays, the period covered by the delay is excludable from the
  120-day period under RCM 707(9)(c). See also United States v. Lazauskas, 62 M.J. 472
  (2005).
  4.1.5. Preliminary actions by the IO. The IO is responsible for an inquiry into the truth of
  the matter set forth in the charge(s), consideration of the form of the charge(s), and a
  recommendation for a disposition that takes into account the interests of justice and
  discipline. Therefore, the IO must review the charge sheet. The IO should also review the
  evidence which forms the basis for the charge(s), and any other documents attached to the IO
  Appointment Letter. The IO reviews the evidence to ascertain whether it will be necessary to
  conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. The IO may also contact the government
  representative, if any, and the defense counsel to discuss administrative matters, including
  setting the date and time for the formal hearing.
  4.1.6. Witnesses.
     4.1.6.1. Availability of Witnesses. The IO must determine whether witnesses are
     reasonably available. The ―100 miles of the situs‖ rule found in RCM 405(g)(1)(A) is not
     a per se rule of unavailability. The IO must conduct a balancing test to determine
     reasonable availability. RCM 405(g), Discussion.
     4.1.6.2. Arranging for Witnesses. If the IO considers a witness available, the IO requests
     the witness‘ presence. Although the IO may contact witnesses to arrange for their
     presence at the Article 32 investigation, the IO may not discuss the substance of their
     testimony. The IO may delegate to the government representative the responsibility to
     arrange for the presence of witnesses the IO considers reasonably available.
         4.1.6.2.1. Military Witnesses. The IO arranges for the presence of military witnesses
         directly or through the witness‘ commander. Before the commander determines a
         military witness is not reasonably available, the commander should consider the
         balancing test factors in RCM 405(g), Discussion, and provide the reasons for his
         decision to the IO, to be included in the IO report. If the commander does not put the
         reasons in writing, the IO must make a memorandum for record detailing the
         commander‘s reasons and include it in the report.
         4.1.6.2.2. Civilian Witnesses. The IO may invite civilian witnesses to attend. The
         IO does not have subpoena power. Therefore, if the witness refuses to testify, the
         witness is not reasonably available.
  4.1.7. Conducting the Investigation.
     4.1.7.1. At the beginning of the investigation, the IO must inform the accused of the
     matters in RCM 405(f) and listed on the DD Form 457, Investigating Officer‘s Report,
     Item 10.
48                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


     4.1.7.2. IOs should consider all testimony and evidence that is relevant, not cumulative,
     and reasonably available. RCM 405(g)(1). IOs must become familiar with the rules on
     alternatives to testimony and evidence in RCM 405(g)(4) and (5). See RCM
     405(g)(1)(B) and 405(i) (applying MREs to Article 32 investigations).
        4.1.7.2.1. Procedure for Taking Testimony. All testimony, except that of the
        accused, is required to be taken under oath. RCM 405(h)(1)(A), Discussion. The
        accused may make a sworn or unsworn statement. The IO has discretion over the
        manner in which testimony is taken. The IO may personally question witnesses
        and/or allow the government representative to conduct the questioning. The IO must
        allow the defense counsel to question witnesses and should allow the defense wide
        latitude in cross-examination. Keep in mind the application of MRE 303, prohibiting
        degrading questions, and MRE 412, prohibiting questions regarding the alleged
        victim‘s past sexual behavior or any perceived predisposition. An IO who suspects a
        witness of an offense should advise the witness of his or her rights under Article 31,
        UCMJ.
        4.1.7.2.2. Reducing Testimony to Writing. The IO is responsible for including all
        testimony in the report. Summarized testimony should be written in the first person.
        The witnesses should sign and swear to the truth of their summarized testimony,
        unless this would unduly delay completion of the investigation. If the witness
        reviews and signs the summarized testimony in the United States, use this language
        above the witness‘ signature block: ―I declare under penalty of perjury that the
        foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).‖ If outside the United States, use:
        ―I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America
        that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).‖ 28 U.S.C. §1746. The IO
        need not be present for a witness to sign their summarized testimony. If the witness
        is not available to sign their summarized testimony, the IO may swear that the
        summary is accurate.
     4.1.7.3. Reports of Investigation (ROI). AFOSI and Security Forces ROIs contain
     documents that are evidence, alternatives to evidence or alternatives to testimony. RCM
     405(g)(4),(5). For example, a sworn statement by a witness is an alternative to testimony.
     RCM 405(g)(4)(A)(i),(B)(i). The narrative portion of an ROI is usually an ―unsworn
     statement describing the evidence‖ as that term is used in RCM 405(g)(5)(A)(v). Also,
     photographs or photocopies of physical evidence in ROIs are usually unauthenticated
     copies, photographs or reproduction of similar accuracy of the evidence. RCM
     405(g)(5)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii). IOs are discouraged from considering ROIs in their entirety.
     In order to consider an ROI, IOs must look at each part of the ROI and determine whether
     it is evidence or an alternative to testimony. If so, the IO must also determine whether
     the witness or evidence is reasonably available and apply the rules in RCM 405(g)(4) and
     (5). The IO should note in the report what parts of the ROI were considered and why.
     An investigator familiar with the matters in the ROI may testify over defense objection
     about both unavailable evidence and his or her participation in the investigation,
     including relating hearsay. RCM 404(g)(5)(B)(i). Witnesses whose statements appear in
     the ROI may adopt their statements as part of their testimony.
     4.1.7.4. Accused‘s Statements. An accused is not considered a witness for purposes of
     RCM 405. Therefore, a witness may testify about statements the accused made to the
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   49


     witness if relevant, not cumulative and not otherwise prohibited by RCM 405(i).
     Similarly, a written statement by the accused is evidence.
     4.1.7.5. Argument. Because an accused may present anything in defense, extenuation
     and mitigation, and make a statement in any form, the IO may allow the accused or
     counsel, on behalf of the accused, to make a brief argument, if requested. RCM
     405(f)(11),(12).
     4.1.7.6. Objections (RCM 405(h)(2)).
         4.1.7.6.1. The following are potential bases for objections:
             4.1.7.6.1.1. Violations of MRE 301 - 303, 305, 412 and Section V.
             4.1.7.6.1.2. Failure to comply with the procedural requirements of RCM 405.
             4.1.7.6.1.3. A determination that a witness or evidence is not reasonably
             available. RCM 405(g)(2)(D).
         4.1.7.6.2. IOs are required to note objections in their reports. RCM 405(h)(2). The
         IO may require counsel to put objections in writing before noting them in the report.
         The IO may also set a time limit for filing objections.
  4.1.8. Tape Recordings and Verbatim Transcripts. Tape recordings of witness testimony and
  any verbatim transcripts at an Article 32 investigation are permitted only with the advance
  written approval of the SJA for the convening authority that directed the investigation. When
  considering such requests, SJAs should consider the likelihood the witness will be
  unavailable or refuse to testify at a later trial, whether the testimony of an important witness
  is best evaluated by reviewing the verbatim testimony, and the discovery interest of the
  accused. If approved, all tape recordings or stenographic notes, which could be subject to
  release under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, or RCM 914, must be retained until the case
  is completed.
  4.1.9. Open Proceedings. Ordinarily, Article 32 investigations are open to the public. All
  efforts to keep the investigation open should be explored before closing the investigation.
     4.1.9.1. Closing. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceeding may be restricted
     or foreclosed at the discretion of the convening authority that directed the investigation or
     the IO when warranted by the particular circumstances. RCM 405(h)(3). The convening
     authority directing the investigation may retain sole authority over a decision to open or
     close an Article 32 investigation by giving the IO procedural instructions at the time of
     appointment or at any time thereafter. RCM 405(c).
         4.1.9.1.1. Specific Reasons. If the hearing is closed, the convening authority or IO
         ordering it closed should articulate specific, substantial reasons, in writing, for
         closure. These reasons should be attached to the IO‘s report of investigation. Such
         reasons ordinarily will be only those circumstances under which a court-martial may
         be closed. MRE 412(c) (evidence of a victim‘s prior sexual conduct); MRE 505(i)
         and (j) (classified information); MRE 506(i) (government privilege). RCM 405(h)(3),
         Discussion. Make every effort to close only those portions of the investigation that
         are clearly justified and keep the remaining portions of the investigation open.
50                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


         4.1.9.1.2. Reopening a Closed Investigation. A convening authority may open an
         Article 32 investigation an IO has closed. Prior to issuing procedural instructions to
         reopen an investigation, the convening authority must consider the IO‘s written
         reasons for closing the investigation.
     4.1.9.2. Potential Witnesses.      It is within the IO‘s discretion to exclude potential
     witnesses.
  4.1.10. Media. See Section 13D for issues dealing with the news media.
  4.1.11. Investigating Uncharged Misconduct. If evidence received at an Article 32
  investigation indicates the accused committed uncharged misconduct, the IO may investigate
  the subject matter of such offense and make a recommendation as to its disposition prior to
  preferral of charges on that offense. The IO should ensure the accused is present at the
  investigation, is informed of the nature of each uncharged offense investigated, and is
  afforded the right to counsel, cross-examination and presentation of evidence. If the
  uncharged misconduct is subsequently charged, consult RCM 405(b) as to the need for
  further investigation. Article 32(d), UCMJ.
  4.1.12. Drafting the IO‘s Report of Investigation. The IO prepares a report using DD Form
  457, Investigating Officer‘s Report, with supplemental pages, if necessary. See RCM
  405(j)(2) and MCM, Appendix 5, for what must be included in the IO report. The report
  must clearly state what evidence the IO considered. The standard of proof is whether
  reasonable grounds exist to believe that the accused committed the offense(s) alleged, not
  whether the government has presented a prima facie case. RCM 405(j)(2)(H); DD Form 457,
  Item 18. Reasonable grounds exist when the evidence convinces a reasonable, prudent
  person there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed and the accused committed
  it. A finding that reasonable grounds exist does not require a recommendation of trial by
  court-martial.
  4.1.13. Assembly of the IO Report.
     4.1.13.1. The IO report is the first indorsement to the IO Appointment Letter.
     4.1.13.2. The IO report includes the DD Form 457, its supplemental pages, and exhibits.
     Exhibits include the charge sheet, summarized or verbatim testimony, and other evidence,
     whether or not considered.
  4.1.14. Distribution of the Report.
     4.1.14.1. The IO should deliver the report through the convening authority‘s SJA to the
     convening authority who directed the Article 32 investigation. The SJA makes
     photocopies of the report and delivers the report to the convening authority. The process
     should be described in the IO Appointment Letter. RCM 405(j)(3).
     4.1.14.2. The convening authority that directed the investigation, or the SJA on behalf of
     the convening authority, shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be served on both
     the accused and accused's counsel. RCM 405(j)(3). Upon delivery, the accused and the
     accused‘s counsel shall sign receipts of service, showing the date and time of service.
     Append the receipts as attachments to the IO Appointment Letter.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   51


   4.1.15. Objections to the IO Report. Any objections to the report must be submitted to the
   convening authority that directed the investigation within 5 days of receipt of the report by
   the accused and counsel, whichever is later. The day the report is delivered is not counted in
   calculating the 5-day period. RCM 103(9); 405(j)(4). The convening authority, upon
   receipt, may direct the investigation be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.
   However, this does not prohibit a convening authority from referring charges to trial or
   taking other action within the 5-day period. RCM 405(j)(4).
      4.1.15.1. If timely objections are received after the convening authority has taken action
      on the report, the convening authority may reconsider the prior action taken in light of the
      objections received. If the report has been forwarded to a superior court-martial
      convening authority for disposition in accordance with paragraph 4.1.16 below, forward
      the objections to that convening authority by the most expeditious means so that the
      objections may receive appropriate consideration.
      4.1.15.2. Objections not received in a timely manner are waived. However, relief from
      the waiver may be granted for good cause shown. RCM 405(k).
      4.1.15.3. Append objections as attachments to the IO Appointment Letter.
   4.1.16. Forwarding the Article 32 Report of Investigation to a Superior Convening
   Authority. If the convening authority who directed the investigation decides to forward the
   Article 32 report to a superior court-martial convening authority for disposition, the
   convening authority who directed the investigation prepares a forwarding letter which
   includes a recommendation for disposition of the charges. This letter is forwarded to the
   superior court-martial convening authority, through the superior convening authority‘s SJA,
   and must include the following documents as attachments:
      4.1.16.1. The Charge Sheet,
      4.1.16.2. The commander‘s indorsement to the charge sheet, and
      4.1.16.3. The IO Appointment Letter with attachments (including the IO Report, accused
      and defense counsel receipts and any objections).
   4.1.17. If the superior convening authority needs to detail members to a court-martial to try
   the case, forward a list of court member nominees with Credit data. United States v. Credit,
   2 M.J. 631 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976); RCM 912. A list of court member nominees may not be
   required if the case will ultimately be referred to a court-martial previously impaneled to try
   cases (i.e., a standing panel to try cases that may arise in a specified period).

Section 4B— Courts of Inquiry

4.2. Courts of Inquiry. (Article 135, UCMJ; MCM, Part I, Para. 2(b)(3)).
   4.2.1. General. A court of inquiry is one of several investigative methods available to
   ascertain the facts of a matter of importance to the Air Force. Only a GCMCA may convene
   a court of inquiry. Do not use a court of inquiry when statute or regulation otherwise
   provides specific investigative procedures for a matter. Do not use a court of inquiry in place
   of an Article 32 investigation, unless deemed necessary to produce evidence not otherwise
   reasonably available. If, however, a court of inquiry previously investigated the subject
52                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  matter of an offense, and the requirements of RCM 405(b) are met, an Article 32
  investigation may not be necessary.
  4.2.2. Members of the Court of Inquiry. A court of inquiry shall consist of three or more
  commissioned officers. The senior member is the president. All members should be senior
  to any person whose conduct is the subject of an inquiry.
  4.2.3. Counsel for the Court of Inquiry. The convening authority appoints a judge advocate
  certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ, as legal advisor for the court of inquiry. The counsel
  assists the court of inquiry in matters of law, presenting evidence and keeping the record.
  4.2.4. Party to the Court of Inquiry. Designate any person subject to the UCMJ whose
  conduct is subject to inquiry as a party to the court of inquiry. Any person designated as a
  party shall be given due notice and has the right to be present, to be represented by counsel,
  to cross-examine witnesses and to introduce evidence.
  4.2.5. Counsel for Parties. A party to the court of inquiry is entitled to representation by a
  defense counsel certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ. A party may request individual
  military defense counsel, subject to the rules of reasonable availability applicable to trials by
  courts-martial. Any party may retain a civilian counsel at no expense to the government.
  See paragraph 5.3.
  4.2.6. Convening Order. Use the sample format in Figure 4.2 to convene a court of inquiry.
  The order appoints the members and counsel for the court of inquiry, states the subject of
  inquiry, designates known parties, and directs a report of findings of facts on the issues
  involved. If the convening authority desires conclusions and recommendations, include in
  the order. The convening order should set the time and place of the court of inquiry. The
  convening order is provided to the parties and counsel.
  4.2.7. Reporters. A qualified court reporter records the proceedings and testimony, and
  prepares a record of the proceedings for authentication by the president. If the record of the
  proceedings is to be used as a substitute for an Article 32 investigation, it must comply with
  the requirements of RCM 405(j). See also AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 16.12.5.
  4.2.8. Challenges. Members of a court of inquiry may be challenged by a party but only for
  cause stated to the court. The president of the court, with advice from the counsel for the
  court of inquiry, rules on challenges.
  4.2.9. Oaths. The members, counsel, reporter and interpreter take an oath or affirmation to
  faithfully perform their duties. Article 135(e), UCMJ. The president or counsel for the court
  of inquiry may administer oaths. Article 136, UCMJ.
  4.2.10. Procedures and Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence and procedure that apply
  to an Article 32 investigation apply to a court of inquiry.
  4.2.11. Witnesses. The president of the court may issue subpoenas for civilian witnesses.
  RCM 703(e)(2)(C). All witnesses testifying before a court of inquiry do so under oath or
  affirmation. Members of the court of inquiry, the counsel to the court of inquiry and the
  counsel to a party may examine all witnesses. A party cannot be compelled to testify, but
  may testify under oath subject to cross-examination or make an unsworn statement.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                       53


   4.2.12. Written Report by the Court of Inquiry. The court of inquiry makes findings of fact,
   but may not make conclusions and recommendations, unless required to do so by the
   convening authority. Dissenting views are authorized.
   4.2.13. Record of the Court of Inquiry. Each court shall keep a record of its proceedings.
   Authenticate the record in accordance with Article 135(h), UCMJ. The president forwards
   the authenticated record to the convening authority, who obtains a legal review from the
   servicing SJA. The legal review includes a summary of the proceedings, a determination of
   the legal sufficiency of the proceedings, and a recommended action.
   4.2.14. Revision. The convening authority may reconvene the court of inquiry and direct it
   to take additional action the convening authority deems necessary.

Section 4C— Depositions (RCM 702)

4.3. Counsel. The rules governing qualification of counsel who may perform duties before
courts-martial apply to counsel representing the parties at a deposition. The deposition should
affirmatively indicate the qualifications of counsel. See Figure 4.3.
4.4. Recording and Authentication.
   4.4.1. Written Depositions.    Record and authenticate depositions taken on written
   interrogatories using a DD Form 456, Interrogatories and Depositions. Do not use the DD
   Form 456 for oral depositions.
   4.4.2. Oral Deposition. Conduct oral depositions in accordance with the procedures in RCM
   702(g)(1). Figure 4.4 provides a sample format for conducting and transcribing the
   proceeding. Record and transcribe oral depositions verbatim, noting the times and dates of
   the opening, closing, recesses and adjournment. An oral deposition may be recorded by a
   reporter or other means, including videotape. RCM 702(g)(3). The deposition officer is the
   custodian for the record of deposition.
       4.4.2.1. If the deposition is recorded, the transcriber shall certify the transcription is true
       and accurate. See Figure 4.5. The deposition officer must authenticate the record of
       deposition. See Figure 4.6. The certification and authentication shall be the last pages of
       the deposition.
       4.4.2.2. For depositions recorded by other means, a written transcript is not required
       unless the convening authority or military judge directs one. RCM 702(g)(3). However,
       the record of deposition, whether it is a videotape, audiotape or sound film, must still be
       authenticated by the deposition officer. The authentication is attached to the recording.
       A sample format for the authentication of a videotaped deposition is at Figure 4.7.

Section 4D— Referral and Disposition

4.5. Pretrial Advice (Article 34, UCMJ; RCM 406).
   4.5.1. SJA's Advice. A person other than the SJA may prepare the advice, but the SJA is,
   unless disqualified, responsible for it and must personally sign it. An assistant performing
   the duties of the SJA, in the absence of, or because of the disqualification of the SJA, signs in
 54                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   the capacity of "Acting Staff Judge Advocate." The SJA's advice is required for all GCMs
   and is optional for SPCMs and SCMs.
   4.5.2. Mandatory Contents. The pretrial advice must include the conclusions and
   recommendation enumerated in RCM 406(b). The pretrial advice must also address the
   following matters, when applicable:
       4.5.2.1. Capital Cases. In a case referred as capital, the pretrial advice must specify the
       aggravating circumstances relied upon and provide the convening authority with
       conclusions as to whether capital referral is warranted based on the analysis as set forth in
       RCM 1004(b)(4). In a case where the death penalty is authorized, but not mandatory, and
       the convening authority decides to refer the case as noncapital, the referral should include
       special instructions stating the case is referred as noncapital. RCM 201(f)(1)(A)(iii).
       4.5.2.2. Offenders with Outstanding Combat or Overseas Record. When a member with
       an outstanding combat or overseas record is alleged to have committed an offense
       punishable under the UCMJ, a commander should give appropriate consideration to that
       military record before determining what, if any, disciplinary action to take. When a case
       is under consideration for referral to a GCM, include information about the accused's
       outstanding combat or overseas record in the SJA's advice. Failure to include such
       information in the advice is not a prejudicial error.
   4.5.3. Format and Length. Pretrial advice need not contain any underlying analysis or
   rationale for the conclusions contained in it. In addition, lengthy summaries of evidence,
   detailed explanations of elements of offenses, and extensive discussions of possible defenses
   are not required. See sample format for pretrial advice at Figure 4.8.
4.6. Forwarding of Pretrial Advice. The charge sheet, the commander‘s indorsement,
forwarding letters or other indorsements, and, if applicable, the investigating officer‘s
appointment letter with attachments (including the report of investigation, receipts of report and
any objections) should be forwarded with the pretrial advice to the convening authority. If the
Article 32 investigation is waived, forward the accused‘s waiver. If an Article 32 investigation is
not conducted, forward the documentary evidence that the SJA relied upon to conclude the
charges and specifications are warranted, such as investigative reports, witness statements and
other documents containing relevant information. If the convening authority needs to detail
members to a court-martial to try the forwarded case, forward appropriate documentation for
court-member selection. See paragraph 4.1.17.
4.7. Referral of Charges to Courts-Martial (RCM 601). The convening authority must sign
either the referral section on the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet, or another document reflecting the
intention to refer charges to trial. Such other documents may include concurrence with an SJA's
pretrial advice recommendation to refer the case to trial by a specified court-martial.
   4.7.1. Completing the Referral Block on Charge Sheet. The designation of the convening
   authority on the charge sheet should be the same as on the convening order. Use the date the
   convening authority referred the charges. If the convening authority personally signs the
   referral, strike out "by ... Command or Order … of...," and include the convening authority's
   signature block. If the convening authority delegated authority to sign the referral block on
   the charge sheet to a judge advocate, the judge advocate signs the referral ―FOR THE
   COMMANDER.‖
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    55


       4.7.1.1. Include special instructions in the referral block when appropriate. RCM 601(e).
       For example, when additional charges are referred, include the following: "To be tried
       with the original (charge) (charges), dated ______ [date of preferral of original
       charge(s)]." Also, when a capital case is referred as noncapital, include the following:
       ―To be tried as a noncapital case.‖
       4.7.1.2. The SPCMCA SJA must have the accused‘s records examined to ascertain the
       accused‘s nationality no later than twenty four hours after referral, even if a claim of
       foreign nationality has not been made. See paragraph 13.10.3. Comply with the
       reporting requirements of paragraph 13.10.1.
   4.7.2. Dismissing Charges (RCM 401(c)(1)). If the convening authority determines some of
   the charges and/or specifications will be dismissed instead of referred to court-martial, the
   dismissed charges and/or specifications should be lined out, and the dismissal dated and
   initialed (e.g., ―Dismissed on 15 Sep 02, [initials]‖). This may be accomplished by the
   convening authority, a judge advocate authorized to sign referrals on the convening
   authority's behalf, or the trial counsel at the direction of the convening authority. The
   remaining charges should be renumbered if necessary. If no charges remain, the referral
   must be withdrawn. See paragraph 8.2.
   4.7.3. Disqualification of Convening Authority (RCM 601(c)). An accuser may not refer
   charges to a general or special court-martial. Further, a convening authority is disqualified if
   he or she has "an interest other than an official interest in the prosecution of the accused."
   Article 1(9), UCMJ.
       4.7.3.1. If the SPCMCA is disqualified, forward the case to the GCMCA. If the
       GCMCA is disqualified, the MAJCOM commander determines who shall act as the
       GCMCA. If there is not an appropriate commander exercising GCMCA within the
       command, the MAJCOM SJA requests AFLOA/JAJM assistance in the designation of a
       commander to serve as the GCMCA.
4.8. Withdrawing Referred Charges (RCM 604). Reference paragraph 8.2 for withdrawing
referred charges.
4.9. Re-referring Charges. After charges have been referred to trial, it may become necessary
to refer them again on the same charge sheet. Use the following procedures for re-referring
charges in rehearings and other cases, including withdrawn charges:
   4.9.1. New Referral. The new referral must be documented in the same format as that on
   page 2 of the charge sheet, following the rules in paragraph 4.7. The new referral may be
   accomplished by typing the appropriate language on bond paper or by using the referral
   section from page 2 of another DD Form 458. When completed, cut out and attach the new
   referral section to the charge sheet by stapling it immediately above the original referral
   section. Never remove or obliterate a prior referral. If a third or subsequent referral is
   necessary, attach it in the same way as the second.
   4.9.2. Special Instructions for Rehearings. When a case has been referred for a rehearing
   (whether in full, for a limited purpose, or for a new trial), incorporate the appropriate
   instructions in the referral section. RCM 810. For example, in a rehearing on sentence only,
   include the special instruction: "For a rehearing on sentence only, as ordered by General
   Court-Martial Order No. 17, Headquarters, 15 AF, dated 4 June 2007, as to the charge and
 56                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   specification of which the accused was found guilty and affirmed by the Air Force Court of
   Criminal Appeal's decision, dated 10 May 2007," or a similar instruction.
4.10. Notification of Referral of Later Charges in Pending Cases.
   4.10.1. Notify AFLOA/JAJM. If charges are referred to trial against a person who is the
   accused in a case under review under Articles 66, 67, 67a or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters
   referring the new charges to trial must notify AFLOA/JAJM by the most expeditious means
   available (e.g., facsimile or e-mail). Identify the case currently under review by providing
   the accused‘s full name, rank, and social security number, along with the case‘s ACM (the
   number assigned by JAJM Appellate Records), if available. Also provide the nature of the
   new charges, including the date referred, type of court-martial, anticipated date of trial, a
   brief statement of facts of the case, and any other information which might affect disposition
   of the current review concerning the case.
   4.10.2. Follow-Up Messages. Send follow-up messages to advise when trial is completed
   (including the result), if the charges are withdrawn, or if there are other significant
   developments which may affect disposition of the case currently under review.
4.11. Arraignment and Pleas at 39(a) Session. When a UCMJ, Article 39(a) session is
conducted by the military judge before assembly, the arraignment may be held and the plea of
the accused may be accepted at that time by the military judge. In addition, the military judge
may enter findings of guilty on an accepted plea of guilty at that time.
4.12. Docketing. USAF/JAT shall establish docketing procedures.

 68                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       designated a judge advocate under 10 U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103 may be detailed
       to represent the Government.
       5.3.2.4. Air Reserve Component Members. The requirements of certification and
       designation set out in 5.3.2.1 through 5.3.2.3 apply to reserve component judge
       advocates. Only those reservists assigned as senior trial or senior defense counsel may be
       certified annually. Other reserve component judge advocates are certified according to
       AFI 51-103. Reserve component judge advocates must be on active duty or performing
       inactive duty training to be detailed as trial counsel or military defense counsel, and they
       must be in Title 10 status at all times when performing trial duties. See paragraph 5.4.5
       for guidance on reserve component judge advocates performing individual military
       defense counsel (IMDC) duties.

       standing.
   5.3.3. Disqualifications (Articles 26(d) and 27(a), UCMJ; RCM 502(d)(4)). An IO for an
   Article 32, UCMJ, investigation may never serve as a member of the prosecution or as
   military judge in the same case. A judge advocate who served as the accuser or IO for the
   Article 32, UCMJ, investigation cannot perform any other duty in connection with the trial of
   the same case, except as defense counsel at the specific request of an accused after being
   fully informed of the individual‘s prior involvement in the case.
5.4. Requests for Individual Military Defense Counsel (RCM 502(d)(3) and 506(b)). An
accused may request representation by an individual military defense counsel (IMDC) in an
Article 32 investigation or at a court-martial. The requested counsel represents the accused, if
reasonably available. The right to request an IMDC does not extend to representation for actions
under Article 15, UCMJ.
   5.4.1. Format of IMDC Requests. An IMDC request must be in writing and signed by the
   accused or detailed counsel and shall include the following, as applicable:
       5.4.1.1. The date of the Article 32 investigation or trial;
       5.4.1.2. Any special qualifications of the requested counsel relevant to the case;
       5.4.1.3. Whether the accused is represented by other counsel (not the requested counsel)
       and, if so, the name of that counsel;
       5.4.1.4. Whether the accused has entered into an attorney-client relationship with the
       requested counsel concerning the charges being investigated or tried, (including any
       statement required by 5.4.4);
       5.4.1.5. In the case of a requested counsel presently unavailable, whether the counsel is
       expected to be available before the Article 32 investigation or trial; and,
       5.4.1.6. A statement acknowledging the accused's understanding that, if the IMDC
       request is granted, the detailed defense counsel may be excused from further participation
       in the case at the sole discretion of the detailing authority.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 69


  5.4.2. Non-Availability of Certain Counsel. In addition to those persons listed in RCM
  506(b)(1), the following persons are not ordinarily reasonably available to serve as IMDC
  because of the nature of their duties, positions, or geographic locations:
     5.4.2.1. Medical Legal Consultants and Advisors;

     Operations Agency, excluding any individual detailed to perform duties as a SDC or
     ADC;

     5.4.2.5. Attorneys detailed to perform duties as a STC. Detailed trial and assistant trial

     5.4.2.6. Staff Judge Advocates, and for commands having a general court-martial
     convening authority, Deputy Staff Judge Advocates.
  5.4.3. Reasonably Available. A counsel is "reasonably available" if not considered
  unavailable by the terms of the MCM or this instruction, and the appropriate approval
  authority determines the requested counsel can perform the duties of IMDC without
  unreasonable expense or detriment to the United States and without unreasonable delay in the
  proceedings. In determining the reasonable availability of a counsel, the approval authority
  may consider the following:
     5.4.3.1. The duties, workload, and assignment status of the requested counsel;
     5.4.3.2. The experience level, duties, and workload of the military counsel already
     detailed to represent the accused;
     5.4.3.3. The nature and complexity of the charges and legal issues involved in the case;
     5.4.3.4. Whether a certified assistant trial counsel is detailed to the case;
     5.4.3.5. The workload of the office to which the requested counsel is assigned and the
     availability of personnel to meet those demands;
     5.4.3.6. The distance from the expected site of the proceedings; and
     5.4.3.7. Whether requested counsel is likely to be a necessary witness at trial or is
     otherwise conflicted from representing the accused under the Air Force Rules of
     Professional Conduct or Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice.
  5.4.4. Exception: Attorney-Client Relationship. When an attorney-client relationship exists,
  as determined by the approval authority, exceptions to non-availability based upon
  assignment to a position identified in RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2 should ordinarily
  be granted. An attorney-client relationship exists when, at the time of the accused‘s IMDC
  request, the accused and the requested attorney had a bilateral understanding as to the nature
  of services to be provided in the case, and the requested attorney was actively engaged in the
  preparation and pretrial strategy of the case. United States v. Spriggs, 52 M.J. 235 (2000). A
  statement claiming the attorney-client relationship signed by the requested attorney and
70                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  accused must accompany the IMDC request (see paragraph 5.4.1.4). The statement must
  provide an overview of the relationship.
  5.4.5. IMDC Requests for Air Reserve Component (ARC) Attorneys. Only ARC attorneys
  on extended Title 10 active duty tours can be requested. The reasonable availability of ARC
  attorneys is assessed in the context of RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2; i.e., the
  restrictions apply to the active and reserve components alike. ARC attorneys must be in Title
  10 status at all times when performing as an IMDC. Requests for ARC attorneys are
  processed IAW paragraph 5.4.7.
  5.4.6. Processing IMDC Requests for ADCs and SDCs.
     5.4.6.1. IMDC requests for ADCs and SDCs are forwarded through defense channels to
     the appropriate approval authority as follows:
         5.4.6.1.1. Senior Defense Counsel (SDCs) determine the availability of and take
         action on IMDC requests for ADCs assigned to them. However, a Chief Senior
         Defense Counsel (CSDC) may override a SDC‘s decision to grant an IMDC request.
         5.4.6.1.2. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, or a CSDC determines the availability
         of SDCs and takes action on IMDC requests for SDCs. However, the Chief, Trial
         Defense Division, may override a CSDC‘s decision to grant an IMDC request.
         5.4.6.1.3. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, determines the availability of a CSDC
         and takes action on IMDC requests for the CSDC.
     5.4.6.2. An accused may appeal the disapproval of an IMDC request to the Chief, Trial
     Defense Division, whose decision is final. There is no appeal from an IMDC request
     initially disapproved by the Chief, Trial Defense Division.
  5.4.7. Processing IMDC Requests for Other Counsel. IMDC requests for all other counsel
  (not addressed in paragraph 5.4.6.) are forwarded to the convening authority through the trial
  counsel, if any. RCM 506(b)(2). Because the Trial Defense Division is responsible for
  defense services throughout the Air Force, it is incumbent upon those IMDCs who are not
  assigned to JAJD to notify the Chief, Trial Defense Division, of their association with a case
  as soon as practicable. These IMDCs should also keep the regional SDC informed about the
  progress of the case. Additionally, the IMDC must coordinate in advance any anticipated
  expenditure of JAJD funds for travel or other reasons.
     5.4.7.1. Disposition when Counsel is Not Reasonably Available. If the requested
     counsel is not reasonably available for a reason identified in RCM 506(b)(1) or paragraph
     5.4.2, and the accused does not assert an attorney-client relationship, the convening
     authority denies the request and notifies the accused.
     5.4.7.2. Disposition when Counsel May Be Available. If the requested counsel appears
     to be reasonably available (i.e., not apparently unavailable IAW RCM 506(b)(1) or
     paragraph 5.4.2), the convening authority forwards the request to the appropriate
     approving authority identified below. The approving authority evaluates availability (see
     paragraph 5.4.3), decides whether to grant the request, and informs the forwarding
     convening authority of the decision and the reasons for the decision. The convening
     authority notifies the accused of the decision.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   71


          5.4.7.2.1. Attorneys Assigned to AFLOA or HQ Air Force. Send requests for
          attorneys in the Civil Law and Litigation Directorate (AFLOA/JAC), Air Force
          Judiciary Directorate (AFLOA/JAJ), Legal Information Services Directorate
          (AFLOA/JAS), AFJAGS or HQ Air Force directorates to the respective director or
          division chief. Requests for ADCs and SDCs shall be forwarded in accordance with
          paragraph 5.4.6.
          5.4.7.2.2. LL.M. Students. Send requests for attorneys in an LL.M. program to the
          Director, Professional Development Division, HQ USAF/JAX.
          5.4.7.2.3. Staff Judge Advocates. Send requests for staff judge advocates to the
          SJA‘s commanding officer.
          5.4.7.2.4. All Others. Send requests for all other attorneys to the requested counsel's
          SJA, supervising officer, or commander.
   5.4.8. Appeals. The accused may request review of a disapproved IMDC request by the next
   higher level of supervision of the officer who denied the request. Appeals shall be forwarded
   to the convening authority through the trial counsel.
      5.4.8.1. If the convening authority originally denied the request, and declines to grant the
      request on appeal, forward the appeal to the convening authority‘s superior officer for
      review and decision. The final decision is returned to the convening authority, who
      notifies the accused. There is no appeal from an IMDC request initially disapproved by a
      MAJCOM commander or higher authority.
      5.4.8.2. If an approval authority originally denied the request, the appeal is forwarded by
      the convening authority to that approval authority. If the approval authority declines to
      grant the request on appeal, he or she forwards the appeal to the approval authority‘s
      superior officer for review and decision. The Deputy Judge Advocate General (DJAG)
      reviews denials by Directors of AFLOA/JAJ, AFLOA/JAC, AFLOA/JAS, AFJAGS or
      by HQ USAF directorate chiefs. There is no review of denials made by the Deputy Judge
      Advocate General. The final decision is returned to the convening authority, who notifies
      the accused of the decision.
      5.4.8.3. A military judge may, for good cause, determine that a particular IMDC is
      reasonably available, notwithstanding any provision of this instruction.
5.5. Oaths (Article 136, UCMJ; RCM 807).
   5.5.1. One-Time Oath. Military judges certified according to Article 26(b), UCMJ, military
   counsel, certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ, and court reporters may take a one-time
   oath.
      5.5.1.1. Procedure for One-Time Oath. Any person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ,
      may administer the one-time oath. The person administering the oath completes a
      certificate indicating the place and date the oath was administered. The oath contains the
      typed name, signature, and qualifications of the person administering the oath. Give a
      copy to the person taking the oath.
          5.5.1.1.1. For military judges, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX.
          Use the following oath: ―I, (name of military judge), do (swear) (affirm) that I will
          faithfully and impartially perform the duties of military judge in any proceeding
 72                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


          under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to which I am detailed to perform such
          duties, (so help me God).‖
          5.5.1.1.2. For military counsel, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX.
          Use the following oath: ―I, [name of military counsel], do (swear) (affirm) that I will
          faithfully perform the duties of counsel in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of
          Military Justice to which I am detailed to perform such duties or in any court-martial
          in which I am to perform duties of individual defense counsel, (so help me God).‖
          5.5.1.1.3. For court reporters, give the original to the reporter and file one copy in the
          office where the individual is assigned. If the individual transfers to another Air
          Force legal office, forward a copy of the oath to the receiving SJA. Use the following
          oath: ―I, (name of reporter), do (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully perform the
          duties of (reporter) in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to
          which I am detailed, (so help me God).‖
   5.5.2. Court Members. Swear in court members for each court-martial to which they are
   detailed. The trial counsel administers the oath.
   5.5.3. Interpreters. In a GCM or SPCM, the trial counsel or military judge administers an
   oath to the interpreter. In other proceedings, a person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ,
   administers the oath (e.g., summary court-martial officer, deposition officer, investigating
   officer). The oath must be included in the record of the proceeding. An interpreter is
   properly sworn after an affirmative response to the following oath: ―Do you, [name of
   interpreter], (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully perform the duties of interpreter in this
   proceeding, (so help you God)?‖
5.6. Defense Investigative Support. Defense requests for investigative support will be made in
writing to the servicing SJA, who will forward the request along with a recommendation to the
convening authority. If the convening authority grants the request and investigative resources
are available within the convening authority‘s command that would satisfy the needs of the
defense, other than AFOSI investigators, the convening authority appoints an investigator.
   5.6.1. If the convening authority concludes that appointment of an AFOSI special agent is
   necessary under the circumstances, the convening authority will inform the local AFOSI
   detachment commander. The AFOSI detachment commander will forward the request
   through command channels for a determination of whether or not investigative resources
   exist to support the defense request. If AFOSI/CC agrees that appointment of a special agent
   is appropriate and an agent is available, he or she will appoint one. The AFOSI/CC is the
   decision authority for appointment of AFOSI agents as defense investigators, except in the
   extraordinary case where a trial judge specifically mandates the appointment of an AFOSI
   special agent. In all cases, the convening authority will provide the funding IAW 51-201,
   Figure 6.8, Note 9. See United States v. Pomarleau, 57 MJ 351 (CMA 2002). Contact
   AFOSI/JA with any questions regarding this policy or its application including provisions
   that apply to the conduct of AFOSI special agents who have been assigned to provide
   defense investigative support.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  73


Section 5B— Court Reporters

5.7. General Information.
   5.7.1. Duties. The primary role of the Air Force court reporter is to report, transcribe, and
   assemble court-martial records, Article 32, UCMJ, investigations, and other proceedings, as
   required. The reporter is neutral and should not express personal opinions about the case
   being reported. Reporters are normally detailed to all Air Force GCMs and SPCMs. The
   reporter records everything that is said or done verbatim, from the initial Article 39(a)
   session until the court adjourns and maintains the reporter‘s notes and recordings according
   to the Air Force Records Disposition Standards. As determined by the SJA, reporters assist
   counsel for both sides, hearing officers, and the military judge in preparing and marking
   documents associated with proceedings under the UCMJ. Upon the prior approval of the
   military judge, court reporters may authenticate records of trial (ROT) in SPCMs, including
   acquittals, not involving a bad conduct discharge (BCD). When authenticating the ROT, use
   the page provided for in the DD Form 490, Record of Trial, package, delete the words
   "military judge" and substitute the words "court reporter."
   5.7.2. Detailing Court Reporters. The Air Force court reporter program is managed by the
   Superintendent, USAF Judiciary. Requests for support, other than expeditionary court
   reporting requirements and mishap investigation boards, will be sent directly from the
   requesting office to the Superintendent for assignment. Following assignment, SJAs detail
   court reporters to perform the functions specified in Article 28, UCMJ, and RCM 502(3)(b),
   and any other duties for which needed (RCM 501(c)). Requests for expeditionary court
   reporting requirements and mishap investigation boards will be sent to the Superintendent
   from the Command requesting support.
   5.7.3. Methods of Reporting. Digital recording will be used as the primary method of
   recording; stenotype may also be utilized, however, digital is preferred. Court reporters must
   use both a primary and backup system to ensure a record can be accurately prepared. The
   backup method for stenotype reporting will be digital recording.
5.8. Enlisted Court Reporters. The primary role of the enlisted court reporter is to fulfill the
expeditionary court reporting requirement and support mishap investigation boards. They also
report and transcribe courts-martial, administrative discharge boards, Article 32 hearings,
depositions, and other proceedings as the expeditionary mission allows.

Section 5C— Detailing and Excusing Members (RCM 501, 502(a), 503(a) and 505);
Convening Orders (RCM 504)

5.9. Detailing Members. Convening authorities detail the best qualified persons for courts-
martial in accordance with the criteria in Article 25(d), UCMJ. Enough members should be
detailed so that, after challenges, a general court-martial will be comprised of at least five
members and a special court-martial will be comprised of at least three members. Convening
authorities may detail members under their command or others made available by their
commander. When detailing court members, convening authorities may consider nominees
submitted by subordinate commanders. The SJA must guard against unlawful command
influence or the appearance of such in the court member selection process, which includes
ensuring no involvement by trial counsel or assistant trial counsel. When advising the convening
 74                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


authority on court member selection, the SJA reiterates the Article 25(d), UCMJ, criteria. The
SJA may prepare a list of proposed nominees. If such a list is used, the SJA also informs the
convening authority that he or she may consider persons on the nomination list as well as any
other eligible person subject to his or her command or others made available by their
commanders. The SJA maintains all documents submitted to the convening authority.
   5.9.1. Enlisted Members (RCM 503(a)(2)). If an enlisted accused requests that enlisted
   members serve as court members, the convening authority details enlisted members,
   following the guidance in this section. The convening authority should detail enough
   enlisted members so that, after challenges, the court will be comprised of at least one-third
   enlisted members. If officer members have already been detailed, the convening authority
   may replace officer members with enlisted members, or may detail enlisted members without
   excusing officer members. If the membership of the court falls below one-third enlisted
   members, the convening authority must detail additional enlisted members.
5.10. Changing or Excusing Detailed Members. Before the court-martial is assembled, the
convening authority may excuse members or change the members of a court-martial without
showing cause. The convening authority may delegate to the servicing SJA or other principal
assistant the authority to excuse individual members of a court-martial before a court is
assembled. No more than one-third of the members may be excused by anyone other than the
convening authority. RCM 505(c).
5.11. Special Orders Convening Courts-Martial.
   5.11.1. Generally. Prepare convening orders in accordance with RCM 504, 1302, and this
   chapter. Authenticate convening orders according to this instruction. Cite the current
   Department of the Air Force Special Order or other document authorizing the commander to
   convene courts (Figure 5.1). Convening orders can be amended. To reflect changes in court
   members, except when members are excused without replacement, amend the original order
   (Figure 5.2). If excusal of a member without replacement is not reduced to writing, the
   excusal must be announced on the record. Generally, issue no more than two amendments to
   the original order. If it is necessary to further amend the convening order, do not issue a new
   amending order; instead, publish a new order convening a court-martial with a savings clause
   that transfers all cases in which the court has not yet been assembled to the new order (Figure
   5.3). Ensure all amendments to a convening order and all convening orders with a savings
   clause cite all prior orders. Give a copy of all convening orders and amendments to
   convening orders to the military judge and include in all copies of the ROT.
   5.11.2. Numbering Convening Orders. Orders convening courts-martial are special orders
   that are numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis, starting with number 1. The number
   shall follow an A-series letter prefix. AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, Table 2.1, Rule
   17. Use an A letter prefix for general courts-martial and an AB letter prefix for special
   courts-martial.
   5.11.3. Identification of Members. Special orders convening a court-martial should contain
   the name, rank, and unit of all persons detailed. Do not include personal information, i.e.
   social security number. If a detailed member is not under the command of the convening
   authority, ensure the special order clearly indicates that the member has been detailed with
   the concurrence of the member‘s commander. See Figure 5.1.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 75


   5.11.4. Members of Same Squadron. An enlisted court member may not be from the same
   unit as the accused. This limitation refers to the organization to which the individuals are
   assigned and does not apply to entities to which they are attached for administrative
   purposes. In no event does this limitation refer to an organization larger than a squadron or
   comparable organization.

           TRAVEL FUNDING, WITNESS PRODUCTION, AND IMMUNITY

Section 6A— Travel Funding

6.1. Funding Authorities. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
(hereinafter ―AFI65-601v1‖), Table 10.2, prescribes the travel funding authorities for persons
required for boards, investigations and courts-martial. AFI 65-601v1 is controlling; however, the
travel funding table is reprinted at Figure 6.9.
6.2. AFLOA Central Travel Funding. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds and manages travel for
persons identified in AFI 65-601v1, Table 10.2, for travel required for Article 32 investigations
and courts-martial. AFLOA/JAJM does not fund travel for other matters related to UCMJ
proceedings, such as travel to and from depositions and administrative actions. If a court-
martial, board, or investigation is conducted within active duty channels for a Category A or B
Reservist, the applicable active duty convening authority prescribed in Figure 6.9 is responsible
for witness travel costs.
   6.2.1. Requesting AFLOA Central Travel Funds. RCM 703(c) governs the initial
   determination of whether to produce a witness. Once the determination is made to require the
   presence of a person whose travel is funded by AFLOA/JAJM, including a witness required
   by the military judge, the SJA requests travel funds electronically through the Witness
   Funding Management System (WFMS). WFMS will monitor all requests submitted by legal
   offices. This system provides an up to date status on each request. In addition, the system has
   bulletin and e-mail capability that allows JAJM‘s Central Witness Funding (CWF) branch to
   provide essential information to the requesting base. The requester will need a FLITE ID and
   password to log into the database. The SJA, and the Chief and NCOIC of Military Justice are
   appointed as WFMS managers. WFMS managers have the ability to reset permissions and
   ensure the correct WFMS managers are posted at all times. All personnel assigned to the
   requesting legal office can create a request in the system. However, only WFMS mangers can
   approve, cancel and forward the request to JAJM. WFMS managers are responsible for
   managing the status of witnesses until the witness voucher has been paid and, if applicable,
   expert fees are paid. WFMS managers will ensure all fields are completed prior to
   forwarding the request to JAJM.
   6.2.2. All requests should be sent electronically to AFLOA/JAJM at least 10 calendar days
   before the requested person is required to travel using the WFMS link on FLITE at
   https://aflsa.jag.af.mil/flite/training/jaguar/wfms/wfms_home. An electronic approval
   will be sent via e-mail to the original requester and the approving WFMS manager. Upon
   receipt of the approval, the requesting legal office will provide the witness with a
   Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that both the witness and the Defense Travel System
   (DTS) approving official sign and then fax or email to AFLOA/JAJM (DSN 754-7487
   Comm 202-404-7487) so that cross-organizational funding can be accomplished in DTS. See
   Figure 6.1. Military witnesses must also be briefed that available dining facilities will be
   used for at least two meals a day. Once received, CWF will forward a fund-cite authorization
   letter to the DTS approving official. If a unit does not have access to DTS, coordinate with
   the witness‘s unit to manually complete a DD Form 1610 and then ensure the form is
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                79


  forwarded to ALFOA/JAJM for certification. The requesting legal office is responsible for
  ensuring all TDY arrangements are made (flight reservations, billeting, rental car).
  AFLOA/JAJM does not fu
  6.2.3. Fund Citations and Travel Itinerary. AFLOA/JAJM furnishes procedural instructions
  for JAJM funded travel. Justification is required for witnesses requiring more than five
  temporary duty days including travel for stateside travel and seven temporary duty days for
  overseas travel. Obtain prior approval from AFLOA/JAJM for any deviations to the travel
  itinerary, or the organization approving such deviation may be responsible for additional
  costs. Witnesses subject to recall should remain in the local area until released to avoid
  travel itinerary deviations.
  6.2.4. Additional Responsibilities. The requesting legal office WFMS manager must notify
  AFLOA/JAJM as soon as possible when the presence of a centrally funded witness is no
  longer required. In cases involving an expert urinalysis witness, the SJA for the requesting
  legal office must also certify the attendance of expert witnesses before payment of expert
  fees may be made.
  6.2.5. Experts in Urinalysis Cases. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds experts (forensic experts,
  e.g., chemists, toxicologists, qualified physicians) approved by a convening authority to
  testify at courts-martial relating to urinalysis testing. Follow the instructions above and
  include the witness fee per day, travel costs and per diem. The request must include a
  statement of the convening authority's approval of the expert and the amount of
  compensation. Before requesting funding for a civilian expert witness, trial counsel must
  first ascertain the non-availability of the forensic urinalysis experts at the Air Force Drug
  Testing Laboratory, Brooks AFB, Texas, or any other expert under contract with the Air
  Force. SJAs should obtain written agreements with non-government civilian expert
  witnesses fixing their rate of compensation and reimbursement for expenses. A sample
  agreement is provided at Figure 6.3.
     6.2.5.1. Fee Limits. AFLOA/JAJM funding for urinalysis expert witness fees is limited
     to $1,000 per day, with a maximum of $4,000 per witness, per case for in-court testimony
     only. Expert witness fees paid by JAJM will not include payment for days devoted to
     travel. Any agreement to pay amounts exceeding JAJM's per day or per case limits is not
     binding on AFLOA/JAJM and may result in the convening authority paying the
     difference.
     6.2.5.2. Inconvenience Fees. AFLOA/JAJM may fund up to $500 per witness, per case,
     for inconvenience or cancellation fees for prior approved urinalysis experts.
     Inconvenience fees not approved in advance by AFLOA/JAJM will not be paid from
     central witness funds. Payment will not be considered appropriate unless a written
     agreement provided for inconvenience or cancellation fees at the time the witness'
     services were contracted. In every case, there must be a showing of actual inconvenience
     and financial loss to the witness, and cancellation within five days of the authorized
     travel date. In order to demonstrate actual inconvenience and financial loss, more than
     mere cancellation is required. Expert witnesses are expected to mitigate any financial
     loss caused by cancellation.
     6.2.5.3. Consultants. Central witness funds are to be used for expert witnesses, not
     consultants. The convening authority is responsible for payment of consultant services
 80                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       and fees. The funding request constitutes a representation the witness is expected to
       testify at the trial. However, should a JAJM approved and funded expert witness not
       testify at trial, funding authority will not be revoked.

Section 6B— Witness Production

6.3. Military Witnesses. Provide notice to the witness and their commander of the time, place,
and date the witness‘ presence is required, and request the commander issue any necessary
orders to the witness. RCM 703(e)(1).
6.4. Civilian Witnesses. Except as provided in paragraphs 6.4.4, 6.4.5, and 6.4.6, use DD Form
453, Subpoena, and DD Form 453-1, Travel Order, to obtain the presence of civilian witnesses
and to authorize reimbursement for their travel expenses. Mark through any inapplicable dollar
amount in parentheses on DD Form 453-1 and insert the applicable dollar amount in the space
provided. RCM 703(e)(2) Discussion.
   6.4.1. Informal Service for Willing Witnesses. When a civilian witness will appear
   voluntarily and a subpoena is issued, informal service of process by mail, including
   arrangements for travel and advance travel pay, is authorized. Figure 6.4. is a sample letter
   to accomplish informal service. RCM 703(e)(2)(D), Discussion.
   6.4.2. Formal Service for Unwilling Witnesses. If a witness is unwilling to attend the court-
   martial voluntarily, serve the subpoena personally on the witness and tender travel orders and
   prescribed fees. RCM 703(e)(2)(D) and Discussion. Appropriate fees and mileage must be
   paid or tendered when serving the subpoena to meet the threshold requirement for requesting
   a Warrant of Attachment and subject the witness to federal prosecution under Article 47,
   UCMJ. Consult with the base Accounting & Finance Office (AFO) to determine the proper
   method of obtaining the necessary funds. The SJA or trial counsel may be designated as an
   accounting and finance certifying payment official in order to receive the witness travel
   funds for a personal service on the witness. In the alternative, the AFO may draft a check to
   the witness that accompanies the subpoena for service or attempted service upon the witness.
   Serve the subpoena in person, either by the trial counsel or a designee when the witness is in
   the local area, or contact the SJA or commander of the military installation nearest the
   witness for assistance. Personal service may also be requested through the local law
   enforcement office or AFOSI detachment nearest the witness.
   6.4.3. Failure to Appear. If the witness fails or refuses to appear, exhaust every reasonable
   means to secure live testimony. If necessary, use a DD Form 454, Warrant of Attachment, to
   compel the witness to appear or produce evidence. See RCM 703(e)(2)(G), Discussion;
   United States. v. Ortiz, 35 M.J. 391 (CMA 1992). The witness may be prosecuted for failure
   to comply.
       6.4.3.1. Requirements for a Warrant of Attachment. A Warrant of Attachment may be
       issued only if in compliance with the provisions set out in RCM 703(e)(2)(G)(ii).
       6.4.3.2. Processing a Warrant of Attachment.
          6.4.3.2.1. In most cases, a Warrant of Attachment should be executed by the U.S.
          Marshal Service. Otherwise, anyone 18 years or older may execute a Warrant of
          Attachment. Military law enforcement may execute a Warrant of Attachment.
          However, military law enforcement should only be considered a last resort.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    81


        6.4.3.2.2. Provide the U.S. Marshal‘s Service with the following:
            6.4.3.2.2.1. A copy of the Warrant of Attachment;
            6.4.3.2.2.2. A copy of the subpoena;
            6.4.3.2.2.3. A copy of the certificate of service or receipt;
            6.4.3.2.2.4. An affidavit indicating that appropriate fees and mileage were
            tendered to the witness and the amount, reasons that witness is material and why
            it is believed the witness refuses or willfully neglects to appear;
            6.4.3.2.2.5. A Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) number. See
            paragraph 6.4.3.4.
        6.4.3.2.3. The U.S. Marshal‘s Service General Counsel‘s Office will review the
        Warrant of Attachment and determine the appropriate executing office. As this
        process can take some time, trial counsel or the Government representative should
        consider requesting relief pursuant to RCM 707(c) if applicable.
        6.4.3.2.4. If the U.S. Marshal Service is executing the Warrant of Attachment, it will
        make travel, lodging, and housing arrangements for the escorts and witness as
        appropriate. Otherwise, the Government is responsible for making travel, lodging
        and housing arrangements for the escorts and witness.
        6.4.3.2.5. Only such non-deadly force as is necessary to bring the witness to the
        proceeding is authorized.
     6.4.3.3. Escorting and Detaining a Civilian Witness. Once a Warrant of Attachment is
     executed, the civilian witness must be under escort or otherwise accounted for at all
     times. Escort and housing of a civilian witness ceases once a determination is made by
     the authority issuing the warrant that the witness is no longer needed for the proceeding.
        6.4.3.3.1. If the U.S. Marshal‘s Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did
        not execute the Warrant of Attachment, a civilian witness must be accompanied by a
        minimum of two escorts at all times. Armed escorts should be use as a last resort and
        only if absolutely necessary.
        6.4.3.3.2. If it is necessary to house a civilian witness prior to the proceeding and the
        U.S. Marshal‘s Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did not execute the
        Warrant of Attachment, coordinate with the U.S. Marshal‘s Service to arrange for
        housing of the witness in the nearest available civilian detention facility. Every effort
        should be made to minimize the amount of time a civilian witness is housed in a
        civilian detention facility. Never house a civilian witness in a military confinement
        facility.
     6.4.3.4. Funding. The funding authority responsible for funding the travel of the witness
     pursuant to Figure 6.9 is also responsible for funding the travel of personnel necessary to
     effect the execution of the Warrant of Attachment and escort the witness to the location
     specified in the subpoena. If detention of the witness is required, either at the location the
     Warrant of Attachment is executed or at the location specified in the subpoena, the
     funding authority responsible for funding the travel of the witness is also responsible for
     fees charged by the facility detaining the witness. If the entity executing the Warrant of
82                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


     Attachment is another Federal agency, such as the U.S. Marshal‘s Service, funding will
     be accomplished through a MIPR.
  6.4.4. Subpoena Limitations. A civilian witness may not be subpoenaed to testify at a court-
  martial outside the United States or at an Article 32, UCMJ, hearing. Issue Invitational
  Travel Orders (Figure 6.5) to a civilian witness who voluntarily agrees to appear at such
  proceedings. Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Vol. 2, Appendix E. A sample letter
  to accompany the Invitational Travel Order is at Figure 6.4.
  6.4.5. Civilian Expert Witnesses (not employees of the United States). When a party
  considers government employment of a civilian expert witness is necessary, the party shall
  submit a written request to the convening authority, with notice to the opposing party, to
  authorize the employment and fix the expert‘s compensation. RCM 703(d). The terms of
  employment in approved requests should be memorialized in a Memorandum of Agreement
  for Expert Witnesses. See sample at Figure 6.3 Use Invitational Travel Orders (Figure 6.5)
  to authorize travel of civilian experts and to notify them of billeting and travel arrangements.
  Also process a DD Form 453-1 and forward to AFLOA/JAJM for certification. When
  making the request, take into account differences in time zones to allow for ample time for
  processing. JTR, Vol. 2, paragraph C3103 and Appendix E.
  6.4.6. Civilians Employed by the United States. Civilian employees of the United States can
  be required to testify incident to their employment with appropriate travel orders issued for
  this purpose. A subpoena is not required. For DoD civilian employees requested as
  witnesses, the appropriate travel order is the DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for
  TDY Travel of DoD Personnel. For non-DoD federal civilian employees providing
  testimony incident to their employment, the employee‘s agency will prepare the appropriate
  travel order. Do not use Invitational Travel Orders for federal civilian employees,
  contractors or Non-Appropriated Fund employees.
  6.4.7. Subpoenas to the Media. Air Force policy requires the exercise of due care when
  issuing subpoenas to media organizations to avoid unnecessary imposition on the news
  gathering process and thereby protect the media's First Amendment role.
     6.4.7.1. Prior to issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media, trial counsel will
     consult with the Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (SPCMCA) staff judge
     advocate (SJA). The SPCMCA SJA will forward a request to the General Court-Martial
     Convening Authority (GCMCA) SJA addressing the following points:
         6.4.7.1.1. That all reasonable attempts were made to obtain the information sought
         from alternative sources;
         6.4.7.1.2. That all reasonable alternative investigative steps were taken to obtain the
         information sought;
         6.4.7.1.3. The results of negotiations with the media. Negotiations should make clear
         the government‘s needs in the particular case and its willingness to respond to
         particular concerns of the media;
         6.4.7.1.4. That reasonable grounds exist to conclude, based on information obtained
         from other sources, that a crime has occurred and that the information sought is
         essential to the case; and,
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  83


         6.4.7.1.5. That to the extent possible, the subpoena is directed at material information
         regarding a limited subject matter, will cover a reasonably limited period of time, and
         will avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material.
     6.4.7.2. The GCMCA SJA will approve or disapprove the issuance of the subpoena. The
     SPCMCA SJA will immediately file a Special Interest Report (SIR) IAW paragraph 13.8
     of this instruction.
     6.4.7.3. In the event exigent circumstances prevent prior consultation with the GCMCA
     SJA, a trial counsel may only issue a subpoena with the SPCMCA SJA‘s approval. In
     that case, the SJA will immediately inform the GCMCA SJA, MAJCOM SJA, and
     AFLOA/JAJM by e-mail or fax of the issuance of the subpoena and the exigent
     circumstances that precluded prior consultation.
     6.4.7.4. The principles set forth in this guidance are not intended to create or recognize
     any legally enforceable right in any person.
  6.4.8. Rates for Civilian Witnesses.
     6.4.8.1. Civilians Employed by the United States. When summoned as a witness, a
     civilian in the employ of the government shall be paid as authorized by the JTR, Vol. 2
     (for DoD civilian employees) or by the Federal Travel Regulation, 41 C.F.R. §§ 300-304
     (for non-DoD civilian employees).
     6.4.8.2. Civilians Not Employed by the United States. Pay fees and allowances
     authorized under 28 U.S.C. § 1821 (per diem, mileage, subsistence). JTR, Vol. 2, para.
     C4562 and Appendix E.
  6.4.9. Processing Travel Vouchers. The requesting legal office shall ensure travelers
  promptly prepare and submit travel vouchers. All voucher and expert fee payment
  documentation should be faxed or emailed to ALFOA/JAJM within 5 days of completion.
  All DTS users will accomplish their vouchers through DTS and it is the base‘s responsibility
  to ensure ALFOA/JAJM promptly receives a copy of the paid DTS voucher. Manual travel
  vouchers (DD Form 1351-2) will only be used when the member does not have access to
  DTS; manual vouchers are filed at the base where the witness is assigned. If a witness files a
  voucher 30 days after the suspense date, the travel voucher will be returned as ―no order on
  file‖ and a letter from his/her squadron commander will be required to explain why the
  voucher was not done in a timely manner prior to filing.
  6.4.10. Processing Expert Fee Vouchers. Use the SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases
  and Services Other than Personal or SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on
  Official Business. The SJA with administrative responsibility for the proceeding in which the
  expert witness testified ensures the expert witness prepares and submits the appropriate forms
  to the finance office servicing the base where the court convened; however, Centrally Funded
  Witnesses‘ forms are sent to AFLOA/JAJM for processing. Before AFLOA/JAJM pays for a
  civilian expert witness, the SJA must certify the dates of attendance and any scheduled
  witness fees (expert testimony, inconvenience, etc.). See Figure 6.8
 84                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


6.5. Special Witness Production Issues.
   6.5.1. Foreign Area Clearance and Passport Applications. Allow appropriate time for the
   processing of foreign area clearances when witnesses must travel to courts-martial convened
   outside the United States. (AFI 24-405, DoD Foreign Clearance Guide; DoD Directive
   4500.54, Official Temporary Duty Travel Abroad). Ensure the prospective witness has a
   passport or applies for one. The responsible SJA may request that the base nearest the
   requested witness process the passport application or the witness can personally process the
   passport application. The State Department will normally process a passport application
   without the normal fee if the orders expressly provide for it. Contact the nearest Passport
   Office for further guidance.
   6.5.2. AFOSI. Submit requests for AFOSI agents to the AFOSI detachment to which the
   agent is assigned. Submit requests for threatened airmen and confidential sources to the local
   AFOSI detachment. Only AFOSI may contact another installation to request threatened
   airmen and confidential sources.
   6.5.3. Deployed Witness. Contact AFLOA/JAJM in cases requiring the return of a deployed
   witness.

Section 6C— Immunity

6.6. Grants of Immunity (RCM 704 & MRE 301(c)). Only a GCMCA possesses the authority
to grant immunity to witnesses. All grants of immunity must be in writing and attached to the
ROT as an allied paper. Figure 6.8 is a sample grant of immunity and order to testify.
   6.6.1. Witnesses Not Subject to UCMJ. The GCMCA may disapprove immunity requests
   for witnesses not subject to the UCMJ without DOJ coordination. However, the GCMCA
   may approve such requests only after receiving authorization from the Attorney General of
   the United States or other authority designated under 18 U.S.C. § 6004. Prepare requests for
   DOJ authorization in accordance with paragraph 6.6.4.
   6.6.2. Witnesses Who May Be Considered for Federal Prosecution. If DOJ has an interest
   in investigating and prosecuting a witness suspected of criminal activity pursuant to DoD
   Directive 5525.7, Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the
   Department of Justice and the Department of Defense Relating to the Investigation and
   Prosecution of Certain Crimes (found in the Manual for Courts Martial, Appendix 3), prepare
   the immunity request according to paragraph 6.6.4, regardless of whether the witness is
   subject to the UCMJ.
   6.6.3. National Security Cases. Process immunity requests for witnesses suspected of
   criminal activity involving national security, as specified in 13.8.2.3, according to 6.6.4,
   regardless of whether the witness is subject to the UCMJ. AFLOA/JAJM is responsible for
   coordinating such cases with the DOJ and other interested United States agencies. NOTE:
   Complete the additional reporting and processing requirements specified in 13.8 for national
   security cases independent of immunity authorization requests.
   6.6.4. Requests for DOJ Authorization. In cases requiring DOJ authorization, the SJA
   administering the court-martial initiates the request for DOJ authorization. When the
   GCMCA indicates an intent to grant immunity, the GCMCA SJA forwards the request with
   written endorsement, preferably by facsimile, directly to AFLOA/JAJM, with information
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 85


  copies to the MAJCOM SJA. Forward requests 30 days in advance of the date the witness is
  expected to testify. Consider requesting a delay pursuant to RCM 707(c)(1) while
  authorization is pending. Include the following information in the request:
     6.6.4.1. Case name and nature of the proceeding for which requesting immunity;
     6.6.4.2. Nature of the charges against the accused and anticipated date of the proceeding;
     6.6.4.3. Name, social security number, date and place of birth, and address of the
     witness;
     6.6.4.4. The witness' military status and organization, if any;
     6.6.4.5. Whether the defense or prosecution requested the immunity;
     6.6.4.6. Name, grade, organization, and mailing address of the GCMCA who will grant
     the immunity after receiving DOJ authorization and a statement that the GCMCA
     supports the immunity request. (Note: Immunity is not actually granted until approved
     by the GCMCA after receiving DOJ authorization.);
     6.6.4.7. An explanation of why immunity is necessary, including whether any state or
     Federal charges are pending against the witness and a description of those charges, if any;
     6.6.4.8. Whether the witness is currently incarcerated and, if so, the location, cause, and
     length of incarceration;
     6.6.4.9. A summary of the witness' expected testimony;
     6.6.4.10. Factual basis for believing the witness will assert the privilege against self-
     incrimination, including the nature of the offenses in which the witness may be
     incriminated;
     6.6.4.11. The likelihood of the witness testifying, should immunity be granted;
     6.6.4.12. Name, title, address and telephone number of the representative from the local
     State‘s Attorney‘s Office and United States Attorney's Office with whom trial counsel
     coordinated the request. Include information on whether the representative supports or
     opposes the request.
  6.6.5. Preliminary Discussions of Immunity. Judge advocates and investigators must be
  exceedingly careful in discussing the possibility of immunity with anyone involved in an
  investigation or potential prosecution. Avoid creating a perceived expectation of immunity
  that may be unfounded. The best practice is to first coordinate potential grants of immunity
  with the convening authority, and when appropriate, DOJ.

NOTE:
1. The JFTR, volume 1, chapter 7, part O, covers travel of members for disciplinary action. The
TDY orders for members traveling as an Accused must include a statement "member not entitled
to per diem expenses in connection with disciplinary action."
2. Funding by the Centralized Docketing Office for USAF Judiciary Members. The Convening
Authority funds costs for other individuals.
3. AFLOA/JAJM will fund the travel if the IMDC is not assigned to the USAF Judiciary at the
time the IMDC request is made and had no prior attorney-client relationship with the requester
on the matter in issue.
4. The JFTR, volume 1, paragraph U7060, directs that travel expenses of members summoned
as witnesses shall be paid from funds of the requesting service.
5. Submit requests through local AFOSI detachments. Fund according to the status of the
person requested (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table).
6. AFOSI agents assigned as defense investigators to an accused and defense counsel are funded
by the convening authority.
7. For expert witnesses in urinalysis cases, request AFLOA/JAJM funding in accordance with
AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. All fees in excess of AFLOA/JAJM established
fee limits shall be paid by the convening authority. The convening authority funds civilian
expert consultants and lab technicians in urinalysis cases.
8. Funding for testimony of federal civilian employees belonging to non-DoD agencies is a
convening authority responsibility. However, if a non-DoD civilian employee is called to
present testimony in a case that involves an activity in connection with which he or she is
employed, funding from the employing agency may be possible. See 5 U.S.C. §5751 and 28
C.F.R., Part 21, Section 21.2(d). The Comptroller General has defined the extent to which the
case must be related to the agency‘s activity as a condition to the agency‘s responsibility for
payment in 23 Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943) which states ―the employing agency is required to pay .
. . the traveling expenses incurred by the employee witness only where the information or facts
ascertained by the employee as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where the
proceeding is predicated upon law that that agency is required to administer.‖ Funding from
other agencies under 5 U.S.C. §5751 should only be sought in situations where the other
agency‘s funding responsibility can be clearly established under the law. Furthermore, if the
employing agency is not forthcoming with the funds, ultimate responsibility for funding to
ensure the presence of necessary witness remains with the convening authority.
9. AFLOA/JAJM will fund ANG members who are in Title 10 status at the time travel is
required if it involves inter-command travel between the Title 10 duty station and the location of
the UCMJ proceeding.
10. The JFTR, volume 1, paragraph U7451, and AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System,
cover funding of prisoners and prisoner escorts. The prisoner‘s travel will be funded according
to the status of the prisoner (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the
table). The convening authority requesting the prisoner‘s appearance will provide escort
funding.

                                             Chapter 7

                            VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE

Section 7A— Purpose and Objectives

7.1. Purpose. This chapter describes the Air Force Victim and Witness Assistance Program
(VWAP), implements the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. §§ 10601-
10605), the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 10606, 10607), DoD
Directive 1030.1, Victim and Witness Assistance and DoD Instruction 1030.2, Victim and
Witness Assistance Procedures. This chapter establishes responsibility for the VWAP at the
Headquarters Air Force and subordinate levels. It provides guidance for the treatment of victims
and witnesses of offenses under the UCMJ, and victims and witnesses of offenses under the
jurisdiction of local, state, other federal, or foreign authorities during those stages of the criminal
justice process conducted primarily by the Air Force. This chapter provides guidance for the
protection and assistance of victims and witnesses, enhances their roles in the military criminal
justice process, and preserves the constitutional rights of an accused. Figure 7.1 provides a list
of VWAP responsibilities with the corresponding responsible base agencies. These provisions
create no cause of action or defense in favor of any person arising out of a failure to comply with
the VWAP. The VWAP places no limitations on the lawful prerogatives of Air Force personnel.
   7.1.1. VWAP Council. Each installation Local Responsible Official (LRO) shall establish a
   VWAP Council, when practicable, to ensure victim and witness service providers follow an
   interdisciplinary approach. The following agencies or functions, when present on the
   installation, will designate a VWAP Council representative: Security Forces, AFOSI,
   Surgeon General, the Airman and Family Readiness Center, installation chaplaincy, and Staff
   Judge Advocate. In addition, the installation commander will appoint a squadron
   commander and a first sergeant to the VWAP Council and may appoint other representatives
   as appropriate. The LRO will chair the VWAP Council, which will meet, at a minimum,
   annually.
   7.1.2. Application of the VWAP. The VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct
   adversely affects victims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal
   activity if any portion of the investigation is conducted primarily by the DoD Components.
   Pay special attention to victims of serious, violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses
   of crime who suffer physical, financial, or emotional trauma receive the assistance and
   protection to which they are entitled. While various Air Force agencies have particular
   responsibility for the VWAP, the provision of victim and witness assistance is to be a
   coordinated effort among all agencies providing services to individuals.
7.2. Objectives. Within available resources and in accordance with applicable law, the
following are objectives of the Air Force VWAP:
   7.2.1. Mitigate the physical, psychological, and financial hardships suffered by victims and
   witnesses of offenses investigated by US Air Force authorities;
   7.2.2. Foster cooperation of victims and witnesses within the military criminal justice
   system; and
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 101


   7.2.3. Ensure best efforts are made to accord to victims of crime certain enumerated rights.

   coordination efforts of current base-level victim witness assistances issues and for continuing
   VWAP training.
7.8. VWAP Coordinator. The individual selected by the SJA to implement and manage the
VWAP. Responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of required training by all local agencies.

the military justice process. The designation need not be in writing. The liaison may be a
medical or mental health care provider, judge advocate, paralegal, or other person appropriate
under the circumstances of a particular case. A liaison is responsible for making contact between
victims and service agencies and arranging for those services, when appropriate.
Communications between a liaison and a victim are not confidential or privileged (See MRE 513
regarding the privilege in judicial proceedings for communications between psychotherapists and
patients).
7.9. (SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB)Victim Liaison: The LRO, or the LRO‘s designee, will
appoint victim liaisons from the judge advocates or paralegals assigned to the base legal office.

establishing procedures to ensure victims, who so elect, are notified of changes in confinee
status. The USAF central repository is Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ
AFSFC/SFC), Corrections Division/VWAP Central Repository, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard,
Lackland AFB, TX 78236-0119. COMM: (210) 925-5607, Toll Free (877) 273-3098.

Section 7C— Victim's Rights

7.11. Victim’s Rights. A victim has the following rights:
7.11. (SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB)Victim‘s Rights. All agencies represented on the VWAP
council will use DD Form 2701, Initial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, to
inform a victim and/or potential victims of crimes of the rights and services relevant to the
victim‘s needs as listed in paragraph 7.12 of AFI 51-201, Chapter 7. Such agencies will also
ensure the following information will be provided on the distributed DD Form 2701s: name of
the victim witness assistance contact and that contact's office symbol and phone number.
   7.11.1. To be treated with fairness and respect for the victim's dignity and privacy;
   7.11.2. To reasonable protection from a suspect or the accused;
   7.11.3. To notification of all court-martial proceedings;
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   103


   7.11.4. To be present at all public court-martial proceedings, unless the military judge
   determines the victim's testimony would be materially affected if the victim heard other
   testimony;
   7.11.5. To confer with trial counsel in the case;
   7.11.6. To appropriate restitution, when available; and
   7.11.7. To information about an accused's conviction, sentencing, confinement and release.

Section 7D— Services Provided to Victims and Witnesses

7.12. LRO Responsibilities to Victims. The LRO, or other officials designated in this chapter,
shall:
   7.12.1. Designate a victim liaison to assist individual victims when necessary.
   7.12.2. Inform the victim of the place where the victim may receive emergency medical and
   social service, and when necessary provide appropriate assistance in securing the care; and
       7.12.2.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) In cases handled by the 4th Medical
       Group Clinic, the clinic obtains written consent from the victim to provide necessary
       medical examinations of the victim and completes the Medical Examination Report
       (MER) and other necessary medical records. The provider is responsible for notifying
       the AFOSI and others IAW AFI and clinic specific notification procedures. A
       SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION file is established and secured by locked
       cabinet (sequestered) in Outpatient Records. Coordinates case with the LRO or the
       LRO's designee.
       7.12.2.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The 4th SFS, AFOSI, LRO, Family
       Advocacy Program, and the medical treatment facility may refer victims of sexual
       assaults to the Emergency Department (ED) at Wayne Memorial Hospital. Per
       Memorandum of Understanding between the 4th Fighter Wing and Wayne Memorial
       Hospital, ED staff trained to complete sexual assault examinations and collect evidence
       will do so for victims with a military ID card. Dependants are only eligible for
       unrestricted reporting. Service members can elect restricted or unrestricted reporting and
       still receive a sexual assault exam.
   7.12.3. Inform the victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be
   entitled and how to obtain the relief.
       7.12.3.1. Restitution may be available from, or offered by, an accused as a condition in
       the terms of a PTA, during the sentencing process, as a part of post-trial mitigation (RCM
       1105), or as a term or condition of parole or clemency. SJAs provide information on
       possible restitution from local, state or federal crime victims‘ funds, including procedures
       for applying for such funds.
       7.12.3.2. Inform victims that Article 139, UCMJ, may provide relief if the property loss
       or damage resulted from wrongful taking or willful damage by a member of the Armed
       Forces due to riotous, violent, or disorderly conduct. See Chapter 6, AFI 51-502,
       Personnel and Government Recovery Claims. Ensure an Article 139 investigation does
       not interfere with any criminal investigation or court-martial proceedings.
104                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  7.12.4. Inform victims of intra-familial abuse offenses of the availability of limited
  transitional compensation benefits, waiver of mandatory forfeitures, and possible entitlement
  to a portion of the active duty member‘s retirement benefits under 10 U.S.C. §§ 1058, 1059 -
  1408.
  7.12.5. Inform the victim of available public and private counseling, treatment and support
  programs.
      7.12.5.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The 4th Fighter Wing Chapel provides
      counseling to victims and witnesses and makes referrals as appropriate. Referrals can
      only be made after the victim/witness has given his/her permission for the chaplain to do
      so.
      7.12.5.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The 4th Medical Group Family
      Advocacy Program provides maltreatment assessment, prevention, counseling and
      treatment to victims, offenders, and witnesses. Referrals are made to the Department of
      Social Services as required, and to civilian and other military agencies as needed.
      7.12.5.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The 4th Medical Group Victim
      Advocate (VA) provides a resource for immediate and ongoing intervention and support
      to victims of domestic abuse. The VA can interface with civilian domestic violence
      programs and court systems to assist the victim in receiving services and supportive care.
  7.12.6. Assist the victim in contacting agencies providing necessary services and relief.
  7.12.7. Inform the victim concerning protection from intimidation or similar threats, and, if
  appropriate, arrange for the victim to receive reasonable protection from an accused and from
  individuals acting in concert with the accused. Instruct the victim to immediately report any
  intimidation, harassment or similar conduct to military authorities. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1512
  and 1513.
      7.12.7.1. In cases where a victim's life, well-being or safety is jeopardized or threatened
      by participation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate notification of
      appropriate law enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement agencies promptly
      take measures to provide protection for the victim, as allowed by jurisdictional
      restrictions. Assist victims in obtaining restraining orders or similar protections available
      from civilian agencies.
  7.12.8. Provide the victim with the earliest possible notice of:
      7.12.8.1. The status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it will not interfere
      with the investigation and is appropriate;
      7.12.8.2. The accused's pretrial status and any subsequent change in that status, including
      but not limited to, the accused being placed in pretrial confinement, being released from
      pretrial confinement, or escaping from pretrial confinement;

     7.12.8.6. The acceptance of a guilty plea or announcement of findings; and
     7.12.8.7. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes
     eligible for release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.
  7.12.9. During trial proceedings provide the victim with:
     7.12.9.1. A waiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the accused
     and defense witnesses; and
     7.12.9.2. Appropriate assistance in obtaining available services such as transportation,
     parking, child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or interpreters.
  7.12.10. Safeguard any of the victim's property held as evidence and return it to the victim as
  soon as possible.
  7.12.11. If requested by the victim, take reasonable steps to inform the victim's employer of
  the reasons for the victim's absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a victim
  subjected to serious financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the
  investigation or prosecution of an offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to
  creditors. However, this does not entitle victims to formal legal assistance, AFI 51-504,
  Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs.
  7.12.12. Under ordinary circumstances, consult with the victim and obtain their view
  concerning:
     7.12.12.1. Decisions not to prefer charges;
     7.12.12.2. Dismissal of charges;
     7.12.12.3. Pretrial restraint or confinement, particularly an accused's possible release
     from any pretrial restraint or confinement;
     7.12.12.4. Pretrial agreement negotiations, including PTA terms;
     7.12.12.5. Plea negotiations;
     7.12.12.6. Discharge or resignation in lieu of trial by court-martial; and
     7.12.12.7. Scheduling of judicial proceedings where the victim is required or entitled to
     attend.
  7.12.13. Consultation may be limited when it could endanger the safety of the victim or a
  witness, jeopardize an ongoing investigation, disclose classified or privileged information, or
  unduly delay disposition of an offense. Although the victims' views should be considered,
  nothing in the VWAP limits the responsibility and authority of officials involved in the
  military justice process from taking any action deemed necessary in the interest of good order
  and discipline and the prevention of service-discrediting conduct.
  7.12.14. After trial, provide the victim the earliest possible notice of:
     7.12.14.1. Consideration of the accused by the SECAF Clemency and Parole Board for
     clemency or parole;
     7.12.14.2. The escape, work release, furlough, or any other form of release from custody
     of the accused; or,
 106                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       7.12.14.3. The death of the accused, if the accused dies while in custody.
   7.12.15. Ensure that any property of the victim that is being held for evidentiary purposes be
   maintained in good condition and returned to the victim as soon as it is no longer needed.
7.13. Airman and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC) Responsibilities to Crime
Victims. The A&FRC maintains information on available treatment, counseling, and support
programs, acting as the focal point between victims and those programs. The A&FRC chief or a
designee works with other installation agencies to identify victims' needs and determine
appropriate forms of assistance and resources available through military and community
services. The A&FRC provides information to victims on available medical, financial, legal, and
other social services, and assists victims in obtaining those services. At installations without an
A&FRC, the LRO appoints an individual to provide information to victims.
7.13. (SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB)The 4th Force Support Squadron Airmen and Family
Readiness Center (A&FRC) provides indirect services and crisis counseling. Indirect services
include employment counseling, relocation assistance, financial counseling, parenting skills
counseling, housing assistance, Air Force Aid and acting as a liaison between local schools and
families.
   7.13.1. In cases where referring a victim to the A&FRC for information may potentially
   cause undue embarrassment for the victim, LROs are encouraged to provide VWAP
   information directly to the victim.
7.14. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. It is Air Force and Department of
Defense policy to eliminate sexual assault within the Department of Defense by providing a
culture of prevention, education and training, response capability, victim support, reporting
procedures, and accountability that enhances the safety and well-being of all its members. A key
component of this policy is to provide an immediate, trained response capability for each report
of sexual assault in all locations, including deployed locations, and to ensure victims of sexual
assault are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and receives timely access to appropriate
treatment and services.
7.14. (SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB)Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. The 4th
Fighter Wing Sexual Assault Response Coordinator is available to work with victims of sexual
assault, help them consider their options, and learn more about their rights. Communications
between the SARC and a victim are not confidential or privileged.
   7.14.1. Within the Air Force, the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) implements
   and manages the installation level Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program (SAPR).
   In addition to assisting commanders in meeting annual sexual assault prevention and
   response training requirements, the SARC serves as the single point of contact for integrating
   and coordinating sexual assault victim care from an initial report of sexual assault, through
   disposition and resolution of issues related to the victim‘s health and well-being.
   7.14.2. Air Force Victim Advocates (VA) are appointed by the SARC to provide essential
   support, liaison services and care to the victim. Responsibilities include providing crisis
   intervention, referral and ongoing non-clinical support, including information on available
   options and resources to assist the victim in making informed decisions about the case. VA
   services will continue until the victim states support is no longer needed. VAs do not provide
   counseling or other professional services to a victim but refer the victim to the appropriate
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   107


   agency for clinical, legal, and other professional services. VAs may accompany the victim,
   at the victim‘s request, during investigative interviews and medical examinations.
   7.14.3. The VWAP and SAPR programs are distinct but complimentary programs providing
   support and services to the victims as required by their governing directives. The LRO, or
   other officials appointed in this chapter, and the SARC and VA, must work in concert to
   discharge their individual responsibilities and provide the victim appropriate information on
   available options and resources, notice of relevant events in the investigative and judicial
   processes, and support. The LRO, or any other official appointed in this chapter, remains
   responsible for the delivery of VWAP services.
7.15. LRO Responsibilities to Witnesses. The LRO or other officials designated in this
chapter shall:
   7.15.1. Inform eligible witnesses about protection from intimidation or similar threats, and,
   if appropriate, arrange for a witness to receive reasonable protection from an accused and
   from individuals acting in concert with or at the behest of the accused. Advise witnesses to
   immediately report any intimidation, harassment, or similar conduct to military authorities.
      7.15.1.1. In a case where a witness' life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized or threatened
      by participation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate notification to
      appropriate law enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement agencies promptly
      take measures to provide protection for the witness, as allowed by jurisdictional
      restrictions. Assist witnesses in obtaining restraining orders or similar protections
      available from civilian agencies. Inform witnesses of any changes in accused's pretrial
      status, including, the accused being placed in pretrial confinement, being released from
      pretrial confinement, or escaping from pretrial confinement.
      7.15.1.2. If requested by a witness, take reasonable steps to inform the witness' employer
      of the reasons for the witness' absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a witness
      subjected to serious financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the
      investigation or prosecution of an offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to
      creditors. This does not entitle a witness to formal legal assistance, under AFI 51-504,
      Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs..
      7.15.1.3. Provide witnesses with appropriate assistance in obtaining available services
      such as transportation, parking, child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or
      interpreters.
      7.15.1.4. To the extent possible and when appropriate, afford witnesses the opportunity
      to wait in an area separate from the accused or defense witnesses to avoid
      embarrassment, coercion, or similar emotional distress.
      7.15.1.5. Inform witnesses of the time and place of each trial proceeding the witness is
      either required or entitled to attend. Promptly notify the witness of any scheduling
      changes.
   7.15.2. Determine the extent to which each individual witness is provided services or
   information under this paragraph. For example, active duty military, expert, or character
   witnesses ordinarily do not require all these services.
 108                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   7.15.3. Provide information and services to witnesses for a suspect or accused, if requested
   by defense counsel, and authorized by the LRO.
7.16. LRO Responsibilities to Others Entitled to Notice. Witnesses, relatives of victims and
witnesses who are minors, and relatives of homicide victims are entitled to receive prompt
notification of information concerning cases. If requested, the LRO or other officials designated
in this chapter shall notify the individuals of the following:
   7.16.1. Apprehension of a suspect or an accused.
   7.16.2. Initial appearance of an accused before a pretrial confinement review officer or other
   judicial official.
   7.16.3. Pretrial release of an accused, or any changes in pretrial restrictions.
   7.16.4. Court-martial proceedings, including:
       7.16.4.1. Any pleas by the accused;
       7.16.4.2. Findings; and
       7.16.4.3. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes
       eligible for release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.

Section 7E— Notifications, Form Processing, and Miscellaneous Information

7.17. Law Enforcement and Investigative Personnel. At the earliest opportunity after
identification of a crime victim or witness and when appropriate, law enforcement and
investigative personnel shall provide to each victim and witness DD Form 2701, Initial
Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. The number of DD Forms 2701 distributed
annually is reported to the base SJA or equivalent. Therefore, the date this information is
provided to the victim or witness shall be annotated on any incident report form. When
circumstances dictate, law enforcement and investigative personnel shall promptly inform all
victims about the availability of emergency medical care and applicable social services. When
necessary, secure the assistance of the A&FRC or victim liaison in obtaining available services
in the military and/or civilian community.
   7.17.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The AFOSI, Detachment 216, provides the
   DD Form 2701 to victims and witnesses and updates the Investigative Information
   Management System (IIMS) appropriately. Accomplishes threat assessment of victims and
   witnesses and arranges protection as needed.
7.18. Government Trial Counsel or Designee.
   7.18.1. Prior to trial, the government trial counsel or designee provides the victim with a DD
   Form 2702, Court-Martial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining
   victims‘ rights and access to services. The number of DD Forms 2702 distributed annually is
   reported to the base SJA or equivalent.
   7.18.2. Witnesses requested or ordered to appear at Article 32 investigations or courts-
   martial may be entitled to reimbursement for their expenses under Articles 46 and 47, UCMJ,
   and RCM 405(g). Provide victims and witnesses assistance in obtaining prompt payment of
   witness fees and related costs. When possible, establish local procedures for paying
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  109


   vouchers after normal duty hours when necessary to avoid undue hardship. See generally,
   Chapter 6, paragraphs 6.2. to 6.5.
   7.18.3. The government trial counsel or designee provides a victim with a DD Form 2703,
   Post-Trial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining the victim's post-trial
   rights. The number of DD Forms 2703 distributed annually is reported to the base SJA or
   equivalent.
   7.18.4. For all cases resulting in a sentence to confinement, the government trial counsel or
   designee completes DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning

   TX, 78236-0119, one copy to the confinement facility where the accused is in post-trial
   confinement and give a redacted copy to the victim or witness. The victim‘s/witness‘ copy
   must not contain the accused‘s SSN or any information concerning other victims or
   witnesses.
      7.18.4.1. The date the DD Form 2704 is given to the victim or witness must be recorded
      and the number of DD Forms 2704 distributed annually reported to the base SJA or
      equivalent.
      7.18.4.2. Do not attach a copy of the DD Form 2704 to any portion of any record to
      which the convicted member has access, including the ROT. Doing so could endanger
      the victim or witness. The DD Form 2704 is exempt from release under the Freedom of
      Information Act (FOIA).
7.19. Additional Confinement Notification Requirements.
   7.19.1. If the sentence includes confinement, the SJA or VWAP coordinator is responsible
   for informing the victim of the convening authority's action on the findings and sentence of
   the court-martial, regardless of where the accused is confined when action is taken.
   7.19.2. Upon an offender‘s entry into confinement, the VWAP coordinator at the military
   confinement facility shall obtain the DD Form 2704 to determine victim or witness
   notification requirements. If the form is unavailable, inquire of HQ AFSFC/SFC whether
   any victim or witness has requested notification of changes in the confinee status in the case.
   Clearly mark an individual's confinement records to indicate the case involves a victim who
   wants to be informed of the inmate's status.
   7.19.3. If an accused is confined at or near the installation where tried, the installation SF
   commander notifies the victim of an accused's escape, any form of release from custody, or
   death.
   7.19.4. When a victim or witness has requested notification of changes in confinee status on
   the DD Form 2704, and that status changes as listed below, use the DD Form 2705, Victim
   and Witness Notification of Inmate Status, to notify the victim or witness. The date

of agreement with local civilian agencies to ensure cooperative relationships in identifying,
reporting, investigating, and providing services and treatment to victims and witnesses.

Section 7F— Training and Self-Inspection

7.21. Training.
   7.21.1. General. All personnel involved in the military criminal justice process and those
   responsible for providing required services to victims and witnesses must be familiar with the
   requirements of the Air Force VWAP. The LRO is responsible for developing and
   implementing a program at each installation. The LRO is also responsible for ensuring the
   accomplishment of required training by all local agencies.
   7.21.2. Development of the Training Program. The installation SJA, Chief of Security
   Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment commander,
   medical facility commander (SG), Airman and Family Readiness Center director (AFRC),
   installation chaplain (HC) and representatives from commanders and first sergeants develop
   local training programs to ensure compliance with the VWAP. Figure 7.2 provides a list of
   references for use in developing a training program.
   7.21.3. Accomplishment of Training. Each individual agency is responsible for training
   personnel on their responsibilities under this chapter. The SJA trains commanders and first
   sergeants. The LRO coordinates all training required by this chapter and ensures the
   provisions of this chapter are publicized to all military and civilian agencies providing victim
   and witness services within their communities.
       7.21.3.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The VWAP Council representatives
       will ensure members of their respective agencies receive annual VWAP training. This
       training will focus on the particular VWAP requirements of the agency conducting the
       training. Law enforcement training must meet the minimum requirements of paragraph
       7.21.5 of AFI 51-201, Chapter 7. Training resources and guidance may be coordinated
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   111


       through the council and completion of training requirements will be reported at council
       meetings.
       7.21.3.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The VWAP council will coordinate an
       annual training event for commanders and first sergeants. VWAP training through
       participation in outside concurrent training may suffice to meet this requirement.
       7.21.3.3. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The VWAP council will coordinate
       additional opportunities to publicize the VWAP through display of relevant victim
       assistance information, articles, briefings, and any other means as the council may see fit,
       subject to command approval.
   7.21.4. Preparation of Victim Information Packet. Prepare a victim information packet at
   each installation through the coordinated efforts of the SJA, SF, AFOSI, SG, AFRC, HC and
   commanders and first sergeants. Provide the packet to each identified victim or witness. A
   model packet is at Figure 7.3.
       7.21.4.1. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) Each agency represented on the
       VWAP council is responsible for providing the LRO with information from that agency
       which may be pertinent to victims and witnesses of crime. The LRO will consolidate this
       information and provide to appointed victim liaisons.
       7.21.4.2. (Added-SEYMOURJOHNSONAFB) The LRO will create a customer
       survey and checklist to be included in the VWAP information package and distributed by
       victim/witness liaisons.
   7.21.5. Training Requirements for Investigative and Law Enforcement Personnel.
   Investigative and law enforcement personnel are often the first individuals to have contact
   with the victims of crimes. Their training must emphasize responsibilities to victims. At the
   earliest opportunity after detection of a crime and without interfering with the investigation,
   investigative and law enforcement personnel should make all efforts to:
       7.21.5.1. Identify the victim of a crime.
       7.21.5.2. Inform the victim of the name, title, business address and telephone number of
       the AFRC director or the victim liaison to whom a request for services should be
       addressed and assist the victim in making contact with those individuals when necessary.
       7.21.5.3. Inform the victim of available emergency medical and or social services.
       7.21.5.4. Inform the victim of the right to receive reasonable protection for the victim or
       witness whose life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized by participation in the military
       justice process.
   7.21.6. Funding for victim and witness assistance programs is an operations and
   maintenance-type expense.
7.22. Self-Inspection. Responsible officials should develop a system for assessing the
effectiveness of their victim and witness assistance program. For example, a questionnaire may
be sent to victims and witnesses soliciting their opinions about the assistance provided. SJAs
should keep a checklist for each case involving a victim, showing: for example, the dates
information packets and notifications were provided (with copies of all notification letters and
indorsements). Figure 7.4 provides a model VWAP Self-Inspection Checklist.
 112                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   7.22.1. Staff assistance visits will examine the effectiveness of victim and witness assistance
   programs, as well as compliance with this instruction.

Section 7H— Administrative Disposition

7.24. Disclosure of Administrative Disposition. In cases where allegations against a suspect
are disposed of other than by trial, a victim or witness may want to be informed of the alternate
disposition. Victims and witnesses should be provided as much relevant information as possible,
consistent with the privacy rights of the accused. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (the Privacy
Act), records and information related to Article 15 punishment and administrative discharge
proceedings may be disclosed as a routine use to victims and witnesses of a crime for the
purposes of providing information consistent with the requirements of VWAP and the Victims‘
Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. When analyzing Privacy Act exceptions, consider the Air
Force‘s interest in fostering cooperation of victims and witnesses in the instant case, whether the
accused has made any disclosures about the action or disposition that would diminish his/her
expectation of privacy, and other relevant factors. Because each case presents unique facts and
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                               123


circumstances, decisions to release information must be reviewed on an individualized basis, in
light of the Privacy Act and the exceptions allowing disclosure, as provided therein.

                                           Chapter 8

                                      TRIAL MATTERS

Section 8A—Changes to and Withdrawal of Charges and Specifications after Referral to Trial

8.1. Changes. Minor and major changes may be made to charges and/or specifications after
referral as authorized and explained in RCM 603. Changes should be made by lining through the
material while ensuring the form remains legible. All changes and modifications should be
initialed. Do not use white-out tape or liquid for minor or major changes.
8.1.1. Minor Changes. Make minor changes to a charge and/or specification on the Charge
Sheet. Initial and date the change. Minor changes may be accomplished without having the
charge sworn anew by the accuser. Promptly provide copies of the Charge Sheet with the
changes to the accused and defense counsel. After arraignment, only a military judge may
authorize minor changes to the charge sheet.
   8.1.2. Major Changes. Major changes or amendments to a charge and/or specification
   cannot be made over the objection of the accused unless the charge and/or specification
   affected are preferred anew. A new referral will also be necessary and, in the case of a
   general court-martial, a new Article 32 investigation will be required if the charge and/or
   specification, as changed, was not covered in the prior investigation.
       8.1.2.1. Make a major change or amendment to a charge and/or specification on the
       original Charge Sheet. Initial and date the change. If the accused objects to the change, a
       new preferral and referral of the changed or amended charge and/or specification must be
       accomplished by attaching an indorsement to the original Charge Sheet containing the
       following matters: a new preferral, notification to the accused, receipt by summary
       court-martial convening authority, referral, and service under RCM 602.
       8.1.2.2. Even if an accused does not object to a major change or amendment, it may be
       prudent to prefer anew. Re-preferral and re-referral may avoid a jurisdictional issue as to
       whether the accused was improperly tried for a charge never referred to trial by the
       convening authority in an actual order or functional equivalent. United States v. Wilkins,
       29 M.J. 421 (C.M.A. 1990).
8.2. Withdrawal. Before findings are announced, a convening authority may cause any charges
or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial. RCM 604. Withdrawal of charges or
specifications extinguishes the jurisdiction of a court-martial over them, unlike a dismissal that
extinguishes the charges themselves. Withdrawn charges and/or specifications should be
disposed of promptly (e.g., dismissed, re-referred to another court-martial, or forwarded to
another convening authority for disposition). An officer authorized to sign referrals or trial
counsel may withdraw charges and/or specifications at the direction of the convening authority.
   8.2.1. Complete Withdrawal. To withdraw all charges and specifications from a court-
   martial, line through the referral section (Part V) of the Charge Sheet, specify the disposition
   and the date, and initial the action taken (e.g., ―Withdrawn on 15 Sep 03, [initials]‖). If the
   convening authority directs both withdrawal and dismissal of all charges and specifications,
   reflect accordingly (e.g., ―Withdrawn and Dismissed on 15 Sep 03, [initials]‖).
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   125


   8.2.2. Partial Withdrawal. To withdraw a specific charge and/or specification from a court-
   martial, while allowing the other offense(s) to proceed to trial, line through the affected
   charge and/or specification, specify the disposition and the date, and initial the action taken.
   (e.g., ―Withdrawn on 15 Sep 03, [initials]‖). If the convening authority directs both
   withdrawal and dismissal of a particular charge and/or specification, reflect accordingly (e.g.
   ―Withdrawn and Dismissed on 15 Sep 03, [initials]‖). The trial counsel must determine
   whether any remaining charges and/or specifications should be renumbered (and if
   renumbered, initial the renumbering). The following rules apply to renumbering charges
   and/or specifications:
       8.2.2.1. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn before arraignment, the
       remaining charges and/or specifications must be renumbered and the new numbers
       reflected on the charge sheet and throughout the ROT.
       8.2.2.2. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment and after
       they have come to the attention of court members (or the military judge sitting alone), the
       remaining charges and/or specifications should not be renumbered. The military judge
       instructs the members that the withdrawn charges and/or specifications should not be
       considered for any reason.
       8.2.2.3. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment but before
       the court members are aware of the charges, the remaining charges and/or specifications
       should, at the direction of the military judge, be renumbered. The new numbers should
       be reflected on the charge sheet and referred to throughout the ROT from the point of
       renumbering. If the military judge directs renumbering, withdrawn charges and/or
       specifications should not be brought to the attention of the members. If the military judge
       does not direct renumbering, the remaining charges and/or specifications should not be
       renumbered and the military judge instructs the members that they should not draw any
       inference from the numbering of the charges and/or specifications.

Section 8B— Conditional Guilty Plea

8.3. Conditional Guilty Plea. RCM 910(a)(2); United States v. Monroe, 50 M.J. 550 (A.F. Ct.
Crim. App. 1999) and United States v. Phillips, 32 M.J. 955 (A.F.C.M.R. 1991). When
approving a guilty plea conditioned on preserving review of an adverse determination of a
pretrial motion, the military judge should make the following findings on the record: (1) the
offer is in writing and clearly details the motion that the accused wishes to preserve on appeal;
(2) the government's consent is in writing and signed by an official authorized to consent; (3) the
particular motion was fully litigated before the military judge; and, (4) the motion is case
dispositive. The SJA or Acting SJA to the convening authority, or the trial counsel at the
direction of the SJA or Acting SJA, is authorized to consent for the government to the accused
entering a conditional guilty plea.
 126                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


Section 8C— Pretrial Agreements (RCM 705)

8.4. Policy Considerations. Use caution whenever a pretrial agreement (PTA) is being
considered. A PTA is appropriate when there are benefits to the government and the accused.
PTAs should not be entered into by the government solely for expediency, i.e. to dispose of a
case quickly with minimal consideration for the consequences of the agreement.
   8.4.1. PTAs that would include a provision for waiver of mandatory forfeitures must be
   carefully scrutinized to ensure the accused‘s expectations will be met. For example, when an
   accused enters a no-pay status upon the expiration of his or her term of service, there will be
   no pay available to forfeit, and therefore no amount to waive for the benefit of dependents.
   An agreement predicated upon terms including a waiver that is thwarted due to no pay
   entitlement may render pleas by an accused improvident and result in reversal of a
   conviction. United States v. Mitchell, 58 M.J. 251 (2003); United States v. Perron, 58 M.J.
   78 (2003).
   8.4.2. Defense Offer. The SJA, trial counsel, and counsel for the accused may clarify the
   terms of a defense PTA offer to obtain sufficient information to enable the convening
   authority to decide whether to reject the offer or request permission to negotiate.
8.5. Authorization Required To Enter into PTA Discussion in National Security and
Related Cases.
   8.5.1. In General. The Chief, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM), must grant
   permission to enter into PTA discussions in cases involving an offense (including attempt,
   conspiracy, and solicitation to commit such an offense) of espionage, subversion, aiding the
   enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of punitive rules or regulations and criminal statutes
   concerning classified information or the foreign relations of the United States.
   AFLOA/JAJM ensures coordination with DOJ according to DoD Directive 5525.7 (MCM,
   Appendix 3). AFLOA/JAJM permission is not required for the convening authority to reject
   a PTA offer.
   8.5.2. Request for Permission to Negotiate. The GCMCA personally or through his or her
   SJA requests permission to negotiate a possible PTA from AFLOA/JAJM by the most
   expeditious means available. Include the following information in the request:
       8.5.2.1. Background information on the accused including name, rank and organization;
       8.5.2.2. The offenses charged;
       8.5.2.3. A summary of evidence against the accused;
       8.5.2.4. Terms of the accused's PTA offer; and,
       8.5.2.5. Factors warranting a PTA.
   8.5.3. Permission to Proceed. A grant of permission to enter into PTA discussions does not
   amount to approval of the terms or conditions of any PTA, which may result from the
   negotiations.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    127


8.6. Authority to Conclude Agreement. Unless withheld by a superior authority, GCMCAs
and SPCMCAs are authorized to enter into or reject offers to enter into PTAs with the accused.
The decision to accept or reject a PTA offer submitted by an accused is within the sole discretion
of the convening authority that referred the case to trial. United States v. Caruth, 6 M.J. 184
(C.M.A. 1979). The accused is entitled to have the convening authority personally act upon the
offer before trial. United States v. Upchurch, 23 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R. 1986).
8.7. Terms and Format. See RCM 705(b) and (c) for terms and conditions which may be in a
PTA. PTAs must be in writing and signed by the accused and counsel. When a convening
authority accepts a PTA, the convening authority personally signs it, unless the convening
authority previously authorized another individual such as the SJA or trial counsel to sign. If the
SJA or trial counsel signs the PTA, use an authority line such as "FOR THE COMMANDER."
Oral PTAs are prohibited, as are promises to intervene on the accused's behalf in any manner in
exchange for a guilty plea. Include all documentation pertaining to a PTA, including Appendix
A, changes, or modifications, in the ROT. Figure 8.1 is a sample PTA, but it may be modified to
fit the circumstances of a case. However, modification of Figure 8.1 should be undertaken very
cautiously; the sample language reflects generally required and legally acceptable agreement
terms.
   8.7.1. Changes in PTA. If the negotiation results in an agreement for different relief for the
   accused than such included in the original offer, prepare and sign a different offer and/or
   Appendix A reflecting the agreed terms. If only a new Appendix A is prepared, the date of
   the original offer will still appear in the first paragraph of Appendix A. If another Appendix
   A or offer is prepared, attach the original Appendix A or offer to the ROT as an allied paper.
   8.7.2. Stipulations of Fact. In order to make members and the military judge, when sitting
   alone, sufficiently aware of the circumstances of the offenses with which an accused is
   charged, the convening authority may require the accused and counsel to enter into
   stipulations of fact or testimony as a part of the PTA. RCM 705(c)(2)(A).
8.8. Withdrawal from PTAs. Either party may withdraw from a PTA as provided in RCM
705(d)(4). Withdrawals by the convening authority must be in writing and signed by the
convening authority. Give a copy to the accused and defense counsel. Withdrawals by the
accused should be in writing and given to the SJA or trial counsel. The PTA and the withdrawal,
by either side, should be included in the ROT as a pretrial allied paper. AFMAN 51-203, Figure
4.1.
   8.8.1. Post-Trial Matters. If the accused does not fulfill a promise to conform his or her
   conduct to certain conditions before action or during any period of suspension of the
   sentence, as agreed to in the PTA, the convening authority may be relieved of the obligation
   to fulfill the PTA. However, the accused‘s promise must be included in the PTA and there
   must be compliance with the hearing requirements in RCM 1109 before an alleged violation
   by the accused may relieve the convening authority of the obligation to fulfill the agreement.
   RCM 705(c)(2)(D); United States v. Smith, 46 M.J. 263 (1997).
8.9. In-Court Inquiry. Notify the military judge of a PTA before arraignment. The military
judge must question the accused prior to accepting the plea to determine whether the accused
understands and agrees to the meaning and effect of each PTA condition and the agreed upon
sentence limitations. In a trial by military judge alone, the military judge should not inquire into
the actual sentence limitations specified in the plea agreement until after sentence announcement.
 128                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


PTAs that are subject to in-court inquiry, whether or not accepted by the military judge, are
appellate exhibits in the ROT. See RCM 705(e) for PTA nondisclosure requirements.

Section 8D— Evidentiary Matters

8.10. Confidential Drug or Alcohol Abuse Records. Federal statutes and regulations restrict
the disclosure of records as to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of drug and alcohol
abusers under the Federal drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Refer to 42 U.S.C. §
290dd-2 and 42 CFR § 2.12.
   8.10.1. Although the interchange of records entirely within the Armed Forces are exempt
   from the prohibitions in paragraph 8.10, the Department of Defense adopted the standards as
   a matter of policy to the extent it provides such records may not be used to initiate or
   substantiate any criminal charges against the rehabilitant, except as authorized by a court
   order issued under 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2 and as allowed in AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing
   Program, (implementing DoDD 1010.1, Military Personnel Drug Abuse Testing Program).
   8.10.2. Disclosure of these records is permitted at the request of, and with written consent of,
   the accused-patient:
       8.10.2.1. As evidence for the defense before findings.
       8.10.2.2. As evidence in mitigation or extenuation in pre-sentencing proceedings.
       8.10.2.3. After trial in support of clemency or clemency petitions to TJAG or SECAF.
   8.10.3. Follow the procedure outlined in 42 C.F.R. § 2.31 in authorizing release of the
   records by the accused-patient. Avoid discussion of the records in open court to the extent
   feasible.
   8.10.4. Only release necessary and relevant portions of the records for purposes of paragraph
   8.10.2. An accused cannot selectively authorize disclosure of the records to mislead the
   court or other parties to the trial (e.g., disclosing favorable early records, but not later ones
   indicating regression). If there is reason to believe an accused is selectively authorizing
   disclosure, either resolve the matters among counsel, or by an in camera review of the
   records by the military judge.
   8.10.5. Drug and alcohol abuse records may be disclosed at trial without the consent of the
   accused to rebut or impeach evidence presented by the accused. United States v. Evans, 20
   M.J. 504 (A.F.C.M.R. 1985); United States v. Fenyo, 6 M.J. 933 (A.F.C.M.R. 1979), pet.
   denied, 7 M.J. 161 (C.M.A. 1979).
8.11. Psychotherapist-Patient Confidentiality. When psychotherapist-patient communications
are involved, consult the psychotherapist-patient privilege under MRE 513 and, when applicable,
the evidentiary protections and limitations extended to an accused entered in the Limited
Privilege Suicide Prevention Program (LPSP) under AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality,
and Military Law.
   8.11.1. MRE 513 is a limited evidentiary privilege protecting confidential communications
   between a patient and a psychotherapist, or an assistant to a psychotherapist, if the
   communications were made for the purpose of facilitating diagnosis or treatment of the
   patient‘s mental or emotional condition. It applies only to communications made after 1
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    129


   November 1999. While the privilege broadly applies to all ―patients,‖ including military
   members, the privilege is narrowed by eight exceptions enumerated in the rule. If an
   exception applies, no privilege under the rule exists to preclude disclosure.
   8.11.2. MRE 513 provides that the privilege applies only to ―case[s] arising under the
   UCMJ.‖ It extends to all stages of a proceeding under the UCMJ, including law enforcement
   investigations into suspected offenses, proceedings for search authorizations, nonjudicial
   punishment proceedings, court-martial actions, and other proceedings enumerated in MRE
   1101. MRE 513 has no application outside such UCMJ proceedings. As stated in the
   MCM‘s Analysis to this rule, ―there is no intent to apply Rule 513 in any proceeding other
   than those authorized under the UCMJ. . . . Rule 513 applies only to UCMJ proceedings, and
   do[es] not limit the availability of such information internally to the services, for appropriate
   purposes.‖ MCM, Appendix 22.
   8.11.3. Therefore, the MRE 513 privilege has no application if access to the confidential
   communications between a military member and a psychotherapist is sought for a non-
   UCMJ-related purpose. In these situations, confidential communications should be disclosed
   to persons or agencies with a proper and legitimate need for the information and authorized
   by law or regulation to receive them. When UCMJ proceedings are pending against the
   member whose confidential communications are being sought for a non-UCMJ-related
   purpose, no privilege applies.
   8.11.4. Disputes between a requestor and a psychotherapist or patient may arise over the
   disclosure of confidential communications. AFI 44-109 has established procedures that
   address this issue. The installation SJA is authorized to resolve the dispute and determine
   whether disclosure should be made. When the request is for non-UCMJ purposes, the focus
   should be on whether the requestor has a proper and legitimate need for the confidential
   communications and is authorized by law or regulation to receive them. When the request
   seeks disclosure for UCMJ purposes, the SJA‘s focus should be on whether an enumerated
   exception in MRE 513 authorizes disclosure. The SJA, in UCMJ cases, must guard against
   improper disclosures to investigators and trial counsel that may ―poison the case‖ with
   inadmissible evidence.
   8.11.5. The MRE 513 privilege also interacts with the protections afforded members in the
   LPSP Program. Confidential communications of members in the LPSP program cannot be
   used against them in a UCMJ action, even if an exception in MRE 513 applies. Members
   may be entered into the program once they are officially notified that they are either under
   investigation or suspected of committing an offense under the UCMJ.
8.12. Confidentiality of Sexual Assault Protected Program Records. When communications
between a victim of sexual assault and a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) and/or
Victim Advocate (VA) are involved, consult the confidential reporting program for victims of
sexual assault established by DoDD 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
Program, and Department of the Air Force Policies and Procedures for the Prevention of and
Response to Sexual Assault.
   8.12.1. Restricted reporting allows a sexual assault victim to confidentially disclose the
   details of his or her assault to specified individuals and receive medical treatment and
   counseling, without triggering the official investigative process. Service members who are
   sexually assaulted and desire restricted reporting under this policy may only report the
 130                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   assault to the SARC, VA or a HCP. In cases where a victim elects restricted reporting, the
   SARC, assigned VA (whether uniformed or civilian), and HCPs may not disclose covered
   communications to law enforcement or command authorities, either within or outside the
   Department of Defense, except as provided by the DoDI and/or AF Policy.
   8.12.2. The disclosure will be limited to information necessary to satisfy the purpose of the
   disclosure in the event an authorized disclosure is made.
   8.12.3. Disclosure may be made to:
       8.12.3.1. Command officials or law enforcement (including SF and AFOSI or other
       criminal investigative service) when the disclosure is authorized in writing by the victim;
       8.12.3.2. Command officials or law enforcement when disclosure is necessary to prevent
       or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the individual or another;
       8.12.3.3. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a healthcare
       provider is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement determinations, limited to
       only that information which is necessary to process the disability retirement
       determination;
       8.12.3.4. SARC, VAs or healthcare provider when disclosure is necessary for the
       supervision of direct victim services;
       8.12.3.5. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when disclosure is ordered
       by a military, Federal, or State judge, or other officials or entities as required by a Federal
       or State statute or applicable U.S. international agreement.
   8.12.4. The SARC, assigned VA, and healthcare providers will consult with the servicing
   legal office, in the same manner as other recipients of privileged information, to determine if
   the exception criteria apply. Until those determinations are made, only non-identifying
   information should be disclosed. When there is uncertainty or disagreement on whether an
   exception applies, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the senior commander for
   decision.

Section 8E— Pre-sentencing Matters (RCM 1001)

8.13. Personal Data and Character of Prior Service. "Personnel records of the accused," as
referenced in RCM 1001, includes all those records made or maintained in accordance with Air
Force directives that reflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the
accused, as well as any evidence of disciplinary actions, including punishment under Article 15,
UCMJ, and previous court-martial convictions.
   8.13.1. Personnel Information File. Relevant material contained in an accused's unit
   personnel information file (PIF) may be admitted pursuant to RCM 1001(b) if:
       8.13.1.1. Counsel provided a copy of the document or made the document available to
       opposing counsel prior to trial; and
       8.13.1.2. There is some evidence on the document or attached to it that:
           8.13.1.2.1. The accused received a copy of the correspondence (a document bearing
           the signature of the accused, or a witnessed statement regarding the accused's refusal
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   131


           to sign, would meet this criterion) and had the opportunity to respond to the
           allegation; and,
           8.13.1.2.2. The document is not over 5 years old on the date the charges were
           referred to trial.
       8.13.1.3. Relevant material contained in an accused's PIF may be admitted under RCM
       1001(d) for rebuttal purposes, even if it does not comply with 8.13.1.2.1. and 8.13.1.2.2.,
       if, in the military judge's discretion, other competent means of authenticating the material
       have been presented to the court. United States v. Strong, 17 M.J. 263 (C.M.A. 1984).
   8.13.2. Nonjudicial Punishment. Records of punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, from any
   file in which the record is properly maintained by regulation, may be admitted if not over 5
   years old on the date the charges were referred. Measure this time period from the date the
   commander notified the accused of the commander's intent to impose nonjudicial
   punishment. Exclude periods in which the accused is absent without authority in computing
   the 5-year period. If the PIF contains an AF Form 366, Record of Proceedings of Vacation
   of Suspended Nonjudicial Punishment, which meets this five-year requirement, a copy of the
   Article 15 record imposing the punishment vacated is also admissible, regardless of whether
   the original Article 15 action was served on the accused within this time period. Nothing in
   this paragraph precludes use of Article 15 actions over five years old as rebuttal evidence
   pursuant to RCM 1001(d).
   8.13.3. Performance Reports. Trial counsel offers all Enlisted or Officer Performance
   Reports maintained according to departmental directives, as evidence of the character of the
   accused's prior service. RCM 1001(b)(2); United States v. Wingart, 27 M.J. 128 (C.M.A.
   1988).
   8.13.4. Previous Convictions. The DD Form 493, Extract of Military Records of Previous
   Convictions, may be used to introduce evidence of an accused's previous conviction. Do not
   offer evidence of a previous conviction by SCM, in which counsel did not represent the
   accused, unless the accused waived the right to counsel. United States v. Booker, 5 M.J. 238,
   246 (C.M.A. 1977). A conviction by SCM is not admissible until reviewed pursuant to
   Article 64(a), UCMJ. See also RCM 1001(b)(3).
8.14. Hate Crimes. Trial counsel may present evidence in aggravation that the accused
intentionally selected a victim or any property as the object of the offense because of the actual
or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual
orientation of any person. RCM 1001(b)(4).

Section 8F— Matters Requiring Air Force Legal Operations Agency Assistance

8.15. Appeals by the United States from an Adverse Ruling by a Military Judge (RCM
908).
   8.15.1. Trial counsel may file a notice of appeal by the United States under Article 62,
   UCMJ, and RCM 908 only after consultation with the Government Trial and Appellate
   Counsel Division (AFLOA/JAJG). The SJA decides whether to file such notice of appeal
   with the convening authority's concurrence.
 132                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   8.15.2. After filing a notice of appeal conforming to the requirements of RCM 908(b) with
   the military judge, trial counsel sends notice to AFLOA/JAJG within 20 days, requesting that
   office file the appeal with the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA). In the request,
   identify the ruling or order to be appealed and include the following:
       8.15.2.1. A copy of the charges and specifications;
       8.15.2.2. An original and two copies of the verbatim record of the applicable
       proceedings, or, if not available, a summary of the evidence and facts;
       8.15.2.3. Trial counsel's certification that the appeal is not taken to delay the case;
       8.15.2.4. Trial counsel's certification that, if the order or ruling excludes evidence, the
       excluded evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding; and
       8.15.2.5. A memorandum opinion on the law applicable to the issues appealed, including
       an explanation why the issues appealed are significant enough to require appeal by the
       United States.
   8.15.3. AFLOA/JAJG decides whether to file the appeal with AFCCA, and notifies the trial
   counsel and SJA.
8.16. Extraordinary Writs by Government Counsel. A petition for extraordinary relief by the
prosecution in a court-martial is, and should remain, a rare course of action.
8.17. Officer Resignations for the Good of the Service (RILOs). SPCMCAs, GCMCAs and
MAJCOM commanders are authorized to deny RILOs submitted prior to the referral of charges.
If denied, the officer may again submit a RILO after referral of charges. Once referral of charges
occurs, RILOs may only be acted upon at the Secretarial level. A RILO may not be submitted
post-arraignment.
   8.17.1. Procedure. Forward all pre-referral RILOs, in which approval is recommended, and
   all post-referral officer RILOs expeditiously to AFLOA/JAJM through the command
   channels outlined in AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, chapter 2, section 2C.
       8.17.1.1. Forward the original and two copies of the RILO package. Base legal offices
       should also determine whether AFPC and MAJCOM reviewing authorities will need
       additional copies of the RILO package. In addition to the officer's resignation and any
       supporting documents submitted by the officer, the RILO package should include (as
       applicable) copies of:
           8.17.1.1.1. Any reports of investigation, statements, or other documents supporting
           the charges or accusations against the officer;
           8.17.1.1.2. The charge sheet, forwarding letters and any indorsements with
           attachments, including the personal data sheet on the officer;
           8.17.1.1.3. The report of the Article 32 investigation with attachments;
           8.17.1.1.4. Recommendations on disposition of the RILO from each commander
           required to review the RILO; and
           8.17.1.1.5. A comprehensive legal review from the base level (or equivalent) legal
           office where the RILO originated, including the view of each victim of the alleged
           offense(s) (see paragraphs 7.3 and 7.12.12.6).
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    133


      8.17.1.2. Documents submitted by the defense after the original submission of the
      resignation package will be considered at the discretion of the recommendation and
      decision authorities.
      8.17.1.3. Written legal reviews are not required at intermediate levels of command
      between the originating legal office and AFLOA/JAJM, unless an intermediate level legal
      office disagrees with a lower level legal review or needs to add and discuss omitted
      matters. Otherwise, written coordination indicating concurrence is all that is required.
      MAJCOMs may require additional legal reviews if they desire.
      8.17.1.4. Do not delay processing court-martial charges through referral solely because a
      RILO is pending.
   8.17.2. Requests to Proceed to Trial Pending Action on Officer Resignation. Prior
   authorization from AFLOA/JAJM is required before proceeding to trial in all officer cases in
   which action on a RILO is pending. For purposes of this paragraph, the start of trial is
   defined as the acceptance of pleas at arraignment. In the request to proceed, include
   justification why the trial should proceed before a decision on the resignation. See AFI 36-
   3207. If permission to proceed is granted, do not, under any circumstances, prepare a
   convening authority action before SECAF issues a decision on the resignation. A Request to
   Proceed is not required to conduct pre-arraignment preliminary sessions pursuant to Article
   39(a)(1), (2) and (4), UCMJ, including conducting evidentiary hearings and other motions
   which may help expeditiously process the case in the interests of judicial economy.
   8.17.3. Seven Day Rule for RILOs. Do not proceed to trial in any officer case with a RILO
   pending without prior authorization from JAJM. AFLOA/JAJM will normally approve
   requests to proceed to trial while a RILO is pending, if the RILO is submitted more than
   seven calendar days after service of charges on the accused under RCM 602. In those cases,
   the only justification necessary in the request to proceed to trial is the untimely submission of
   the RILO, but additional reasons may be submitted if they exist. If a RILO is submitted
   within seven days of service of charges under RCM 602, requests to proceed to trial pending
   action on the RILO will normally be disapproved by AFLOA/JAJM absent compelling
   circumstances warranting trial while the RILO is pending. RILO processing should not be
   stopped or delayed, nor should the RILO be rejected for processing, based solely upon the
   time submitted unless submitted post-arraignment. All timely RILOs must be forwarded
   through channels for Secretarial action, even if submitted more than seven days after service
   of charges under RCM 602.
8.18. Classified or Controlled Information. Special procedures and requirements apply in
cases where classified information may be used as evidence. In all such cases, contact
AFLOA/JAJM as soon as possible for guidance on how to proceed.
   8.18.1. Asserting the MRE 505 Privilege. Only SECAF, or the head of a government
   agency for documents owned by agencies outside the Air Force, may claim the privilege
   from disclosure of classified information (MRE 505). A person who may claim the privilege
   may authorize a witness or trial counsel to claim the privilege on his or her behalf. Forward
   requests for assertion of the privilege to AFLOA/JAJM.
   8.18.2. Classified Material in the Record. When a ROT contains classified material,
   declassify the material when proper. If it is impossible to declassify the material, the record
 134                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   must be classified. In determining whether a particular ROT must be classified because of its
   content, consideration should be given to DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and
   AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter 6,
   for additional guidance.
   8.18.3. Controlled Material in the Record. When a ROT contains controlled material (e.g.,
   promotion testing materials, PME test materials, CDC EOC Exams, etc.), safeguard the
   materials to prevent further disclosure or unauthorized access. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter
   6, for additional guidance.
8.19. Disclosure       of    Government        Information other    than      Classified
Information. Immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM if a case involves assertion of the privilege
against disclosure of government information (MRE 506).

Section 8G—Trial by Military Judge

8.20. Requesting Trial by Military Judge. To request a trial by military judge alone, the
accused should use the DD Form 1722, Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone. If the
DD Form 1722 is used, it must be included in the ROT as an appellate exhibit. AFMAN51-203,
Figure 4.1. Refer to RCM 903 for additional guidance.

Section 8H— Use of Audiovisual and Teleconferencing Technology

8.21. Audiovisual and Teleconferencing Technology. The use of audiovisual and
teleconferencing technology is authorized by SECAF to the extent and under the conditions
allowed for in RCM 804(b), 805(a), 805(c), and 914B.

Section 8I— Findings and Sentencing Worksheets

8.22. Use of Findings and Sentencing Worksheets. The following forms may be used to assist
court members put court-martial findings and sentences in the format required by the Manual for
Court-Martial:
   8.22.1. AF Form 1092, Court-Martial Findings Worksheet.
       8.22.1.1. Where a specification against a service member alleges wrongful acts on
       ―divers occasions,‖ trial counsel should request members be instructed that any findings
       made by exceptions and substitutions that remove the ―divers occasions‖ language should
       clearly reflect the specific instance of conduct upon which the modified findings are
       based. Such changes can generally be accomplished through reference in the substituted
       language to a relevant date or other facts in evidence that will clearly put the accused and
       the reviewing court on notice of what conduct served as the basis for the finding. United
       States v. Waters, 58 MJ 391 (CAAF 2003).
   8.22.2. AF Form 1093, Sentence Worksheet (Special Court-Martial).
   8.22.3. AF Form 835, Sentence Worksheet (General Court-Martial).

AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                               137




Appendix A to Offer for Pretrial Agreement: (Appendix A must be prepared as a separate document that can stand
apart from the portion entitled Offer for Pretrial Agreement).

NOTE:
1. The clauses contained in paragraph 6 of this figure are optional. If used, carefully tailor them
to include adequate protections against arbitrary revocation of the agreement to prevent their
being declared void as against public policy. See United States v. Dawson, 10 M.J. 142 (C.M.A.
1982); United States v. Connell, 13 M.J. 156 (C.M.A. 1982); MCM, Appendix 21, Analysis,
RCM 705(c)(2)(D).
2. The convening authority signs the Offer for Pretrial Agreement only if approving it and
Appendix A.
3. Overall sentence caps may be confusing. If the parties wish to cap the sentence in the
aggregate (allowing substitution of punishments for those specifically adjudged, so long as the
aggregate effect does not exceed the aggregate adjudged), the pretrial agreement should be
specific on this point. Otherwise, to avoid confusion, consider using the following language
when limiting more than one form of the punishment: "He will approve no punitive discharge, if
one is adjudged, more severe than a Bad Conduct Discharge; he will approve no confinement, if
confinement is adjudged, in excess of [state time in months or years]; he will approve no
forfeiture with a monthly amount in excess of $500 per month, nor a number of months in excess
 138                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


of 36 months. There are no restrictions on his ability to approve other forms of punishment that
may be adjudged."
4. See paragraph 8.8.2.
5. The convening authority signs Appendix A only if approving it and the Offer for Pretrial
Agreement.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 139



                                           Chapter 9

                                POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

Section 9A—Report of the Result of Trial (RCM 1101; RCM 1305).

9.1. Publication of Result of Trial. Publish the result of trial on an AF Form 1359, Report of
Result of Trial. Distribute the Report of Result of Trial to the accused‘s immediate commander,
the GCM and SPCM convening authorities and their SJAs, the commander of the local SFS and
AFOSI detachment, and, if the accused is in confinement, to the commanding officer responsible
for the confinement facility and the confinement officer. Additional copies may be distributed as
directed by the convening authority. See paragraph 9.13.1 for additional guidance on preparing
the AF Form 1359 and Section 9I for additional reporting requirements on the sentence. Include
―Sex Offender Notification Required,‖ ―DNA Processing Required,‖ and/or ―Crime of Domestic
Violence‖ in the sentence block of the AF Form 1359 if applicable. See paragraphs 13.17 and
13.21 for more information.

Section 9B— Post-Trial Confinement

9.2. Entry into Post-Trial Confinement. Sentences to confinement run from the date
adjudged, except when suspended or deferred by the convening authority. Use the DD Form
2707, Confinement Order, to enter an accused into post-trial confinement.
   9.2.1. Processing DD Form 2707.
       9.2.1.1. When a court-martial sentence includes confinement, the legal office should
       prepare the top portion of the DD Form 2707. The person directing confinement,
       typically the trial counsel, signs item 7(b). A judge advocate signs item 8(b) as the
       officer conducting a legal review and approval. The same person cannot sign both item
       7(b) and 8(b). Before signing the legal review, the judge advocate should ensure the
       form is properly completed and the individual directing confinement actually has
       authority to direct confinement.
       9.2.1.2. Unless limited by superior authority, the commander of the accused orders the
       accused into post-trial confinement. Commanders may delegate the authority to order
       post-trial confinement to the trial counsel or assistant trial counsel. See RCM 1101(b). A
       sample memorandum delegating military justice administrative duties is at Figure 13.1.
       9.2.1.3. Security Forces personnel receipt for the prisoner by completing and signing
       item 11 of the DD Form 2707. The servicing legal office must retain a signed copy of the
       DD Form 2707. Security Forces personnel must ensure the prisoner receives a medical
       examination within 24 hours or the next duty day after entry into confinement as required
       by AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System, paragraph 5.3.2. Security Forces
       personnel ensure medical personnel complete items 9 and 10 of the DD Form 2707.
       Ensure a completed copy of DD Form 2707 is returned to the legal office for insertion in
       the ROT.
 140                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   9.2.2. If an accused is in pretrial confinement, no action is normally necessary to continue
   that confinement. The AF Form 1359 may serve in lieu of the DD Form 2707. See AFI 31-
   205, paragraph 5.1.
9.3. Effect of Pretrial Confinement. An accused receives day-for-day credit for any pretrial
confinement served in military, civilian or foreign confinement facilities, for which the accused
has not received credit against any other sentence. United States v. Allen, 17 M.J. 126 (C.M.A.
1984), United States v. Murray, 43 M.J. 507 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995) and United States v.
Pinson, 54 M.J. 692 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001). Annotate on AF Form 1359 and DD Form 2707
any civilian and/or military pretrial confinement credit. This credit is not to be included in the
convening authority‘s initial action; only credit that is directed for illegal pretrial confinement is
to be included in the action in accordance with RCM 1107(f)(4)(F).
   9.3.1. When a military judge directs credit for illegal pretrial confinement, this credit must
   be ordered in the convening authority's initial action (RCM 1107(f)(4)(F)), and should not be
   reflected on the AF Form 1359. See Figure 9.8.
9.4. Confinement Facility (RCM 1101; 1107(f)(4)(C); 1113(d)(2)(C)). HQ AFSFC/SFC
oversees Air Force correctional facilities worldwide, is responsible for inmates gained by HQ
AFSFC/SFC (inmates not ordered to serve sentences in local correctional facilities), and
approves all inmate transfers between military corrections facilities. HQ AFSFC/SFC, not the
convening authority, selects the corrections facility for post-trial confinement and rehabilitation
for inmates gained by HQ AFSFC/SFC. Refer to AFI 31-205, for confinement rules and
practices.
   9.4.1. Correctional facilities other than those in the Air Force Corrections System may be
   used to confine inmates. HQ AFSFC/SFC sends detailed instructions covering selection of
   inmates for these assignments, details of transfer, and other administrative matters. The
   GCMCA over an inmate transferred to such a facility exercises the same responsibilities as
   those assigned in this chapter to the Commander, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW),
   Bolling AFB, DC, for inmates in the Air Force Corrections System.

Section 9C— Preparing, Serving, and Forwarding Records of Trial

9.5. Preparing Records of Trial. Prepare court-martial records of trial (ROT) in accordance
with RCM 1103, RCM 1305, MCM Appendices 13-15, and AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial.
Ensure ROTs are authenticated in accordance with RCM 1104(a). See also AFMAN 51-203,
chapter 12 and paragraph 10.3.
9.6. Serving Records of Trial. Serve the ROT on the accused in accordance with RCM
1104(b) or RCM 1305(d). Include the original proof of service, or substitute service, in the ROT.
9.7. Forwarding Records of Trial. Forward the ROT to the convening authority or his or her
SJA, in accordance with RCM 1104(e). After the convening authority takes action, promptly
forward the original ROT and required copies to AFLOA/JAJM using the most cost-effective
method which provides a means to track the ROT. Do not forward incomplete ROTs (e.g., ROTs
that are missing documents or have unsigned receipts). Consult AFMAN 51-203, Chapters 3 and
13, for the number of required copies that must accompany the original and for forwarding
instructions.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   141


Section 9D— Matters Submitted by the Accused and/or Defense Counsel (RCM 1105)

9.8. Notice Regarding Post-Trial Submissions. The SJA, trial counsel, or assistant trial
counsel provides the accused and defense counsel a memorandum (Figure 9.1) informing the
accused of the right to submit matters, including clemency matters, for the convening authority's
consideration, and the time period for making such submissions. Address the letter to the
accused and provide a copy to the defense counsel responsible for post-trial matters. If an SJA
recommendation is not required in the case, provide the letter to the detailed military defense
counsel, unless the accused requested otherwise. Include a copy of the notification letter, with
the accused's receipt, in the ROT as specified in AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 4.6 and Figure 4.1.
   9.8.1. Waiver of Accused‘s Right to Submit Matters. If the accused submits a waiver of the
   right to submit matters, include the written waiver in the ROT. See Figures 9.2 and 9.3
9.9. Applications to Defer Sentence and Waive Required Forfeitures. Before action is taken
on a case, an accused may submit an application to the convening authority, through the
servicing SJA, to defer any adjudged and/or mandatory forfeiture of pay or allowances, reduction
in grade, or service of a sentence to confinement. See Articles 57(a)(2), 57a(a), and 58b(a)(1). If
an accused has dependents, an application may also be submitted to the convening authority,
through the servicing SJA, to waive any mandatory forfeiture of pay and allowances under
Article 58b(b), for the benefit of the accused‘s dependents. Applications for deferral and/or
waiver may be submitted through the servicing SJA any time after the sentence is announced and
before action by the convening authority. See also paragraphs 9.24.1 and 9.24.3. See Section
9G for additional guidance on deferring and waiving forfeitures of pay and allowances.
9.10. RCM 1105 Submissions. An accused may submit matters, including clemency
recommendations, for the convening authority to consider before taking action on the case. See
RCM 1105 for a discussion on matters that may be submitted, waivers, and the appropriate time
periods for submissions.
9.11. Requests for Entry in Return to Duty Program (RTDP). The RTDP offers selected
enlisted personnel with exceptional potential the opportunity to return to active duty and have
their punitive discharge, if adjudged, remitted. Participants are provided with programs
individually designed to address their confining offenses and improve their conduct, attitude, and
productivity for continued Air Force service. The accused's defense counsel assists the accused
in volunteering for the RTDP by obtaining and submitting the appropriate paperwork to the
convening authority. An eligible inmate who volunteered, but was not approved by the
convening authority for entry into the RTDP, may be eligible to apply for entry to the Air Force
Clemency and Parole Board. See AFI 31-205, paragraph 11.6, for additional guidance on
applications and requirements for entry in the RTDP.

Section 9E— Staff Judge Advocate Recommendation and Addendum (RCM 1106)

9.12. Mandatory Recommendation. A Staff Judge Advocate's Recommendation (SJAR) is
required in cases where the convening authority takes action on a ROT by general court-martial
or a ROT by special court-martial that includes a sentence to a bad conduct discharge or
confinement for one year or more.
   9.12.1. An SJAR is not required when the convening authority takes action on a ROT in a
   summary court-martial or special court-martial that does not include either a sentence to a
 142                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   bad conduct discharge or confinement for one year. In these cases, the SJA should provide
   the convening authority with the ROT, the defense submission, a memorandum to be signed
   by the convening authority acknowledging that he or she considered the defense submissions,
   and a proposed action for the convening authority‘s signature. When an SJAR is not
   required, the action may be forwarded using the sample action memorandum provided in
   Figure 9.4. If there is a need to address new matter, use an SJAR/addendum instead of the
   action memorandum. Serve new matters on the accused and accused's counsel and allow 10
   days from service to submit comments. See RCM 1106(f)(7)
9.13. SJAR Format. An SJAR should be a clear and concise recommendation written in
memorandum format containing the information required by RCM 1106(d). Attach copies of the
AF Form 1359, and the personal data sheet of the accused admitted at trial (see Figure 3.6.) to
the SJAR. See sample format at Figure 9.5.
   9.13.1. The AF Form 1359 is the primary source of findings and sentence information.
   Therefore, this form must be filled out completely and accurately, including offenses, pleas,
   findings and sentence. The form must accurately reflect findings of guilty to lesser included
   offenses and pleas or findings with exceptions and/or substitutions. The sentence portion of
   the AF Form 1359 should include both the sentence announced as well as the PTA sentence
   limitation.
       9.13.1.1. Ensure specifications which have pleas and findings with exceptions and/or
       substitutions are entered verbatim, not simply summarized.
   9.13.2. When combined with the SJAR and AF Form 1359, the personal data sheet ensures
   that all information required by RCM 1106(d)(3)(C) is provided to the convening authority.
   9.13.3. Include the original SJAR with all attachments (AF Form 1359 and the personal data
   sheet) in the original ROT. The attachments must follow immediately behind the SJAR in
   the ROT, even if these documents are also included in other parts of the record. Place a copy
   of the SJAR and attachments in each copy of the ROT.
   9.13.4. The SJAR must include items required by RCM 1106 that are not included on the
   personal data sheet or the AF Form 1359. This includes a description of the character of the
   accused's service prior to the charges (RCM 1106(d)(3)(C)), any clemency recommendations
   made by the sentencing authority (made in conjunction with the announced sentence) (RCM
   1106(d)(3)(B)), and any additional credit awarded by the military judge for illegal pretrial
   confinement. The SJAR should also contain the maximum sentence for the guilty
   specifications/charges and any pretrial agreement. The terms of the agreement should
   include the sentence the convening authority is authorized to approve pursuant to the
   agreement.
   9.13.5. The SJAR should address any previously approved request from the accused for
   deferral of confinement, forfeitures of pay, and/or reduction in grade, and any previously
   approved or pending request from the accused or the accused's dependents for a waiver of
   mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b, UCMJ. Approved deferrals and waivers must be
   documented in the convening authority's action and the convening authority must act upon
   pending requests.
       9.13.5.1. If a convening authority previously disapproved a request for deferral or waiver
       prior to initial action on the sentence, comment in the SJAR on that request and what
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   143


       action may still be appropriate. For example, a convening authority may disapprove a
       deferral or waiver request based upon matters adverse to the accused from outside the
       record, knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable. If the convening authority
       also considers such matters when taking action on the sentence, the accused is entitled to
       notice and an opportunity to rebut. See RCM 1107(b)(3)(B)(iii). Notice may be satisfied
       through the SJAR.
9.14. Preparing and Signing the SJAR. The SJAR must clearly indicate that the
recommendation is from the SJA. An assistant performing the duties of the SJA may sign as
"Acting SJA." An assistant SJA may prepare the recommendation, but the SJA (or if
unavailable, the ―Acting SJA‖) must review the ROT and sign the SJAR. No person who
participated in the court-martial as a member, a military judge, a trial counsel, a defense counsel
or investigating officer may draft or sign the SJAR or addendum or otherwise act as the SJA or
legal advisor to any reviewing or convening authority in that case. See RCM 1106(b).
   9.14.1. If the convening authority does not have an SJA (or ―Acting SJA‖) or the person
   serving in that capacity is disqualified under RCM 1106(b) or otherwise, then the convening
   authority must request the assignment of another SJA to prepare the SJAR or forward the
   record to any GCMCA as provided in RCM 1107(a). See RCM 1106(c)(1).
       9.14.1.1. If all judge advocates on the SPCMCA‘s staff are disqualified from preparing
       and signing the SJAR, forward the record to the GCMCA's SJA. That officer may
       prepare and sign the SJAR or designate another SJA (or ―Acting SJA‖) in the GCMCA‘s
       command to prepare and sign the SJAR.
       9.14.1.2. If all judge advocates on the GCMCA‘s staff are disqualified from preparing
       and signing the SJAR, forward the record to the MAJCOM‘s SJA. That officer may
       prepare and sign the SJAR or designate another SJA (or ―Acting SJA‖) in the MAJCOM
       to prepare and sign the SJAR. If all the SJAs (or ―Acting SJAs‖) in the MAJCOM are
       disqualified from preparing and signing the SJAR, the MAJCOM SJA requests
       AFLOA/JAJM‘s assistance in designating an SJA to prepare and sign the SJAR.
   9.14.2. If the original SJA did not sign the SJAR, the SJA signing the SJAR must include an
   explanation in the allied papers of the ROT. An explanation is not required if it is clear from
   the ROT (e.g., forwarding memorandum, transfer memorandum) why the original SJA did
   not sign the SJAR.
9.15. Service of SJAR on Defense. Ensure copies of the SJAR, including its attachments, are
served on the accused's counsel and, unless impracticable, on the accused. Obtain receipts for
service of the SJAR from both and include in the ROT. If service on the accused is
impracticable or if the accused so requests on the record at the court-martial or in writing,
forward the accused‘s copy to the accused‘s defense counsel and attach a statement to the ROT
explaining why the accused was not served. See RCM 1106(f)(1).
9.16. Defense Counsel Response to SJAR. The accused's counsel may submit objections or
rebuttal to any matter in the SJAR and may comment on any other matter. Defense counsel must
submit comments within 10 days of service of the ROT on the accused (under RCM 1104(b)) or
receipt of the SJAR, whichever is later, unless the period is extended. See RCM 1106(f)(4) and
(5).
 144                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


9.17. Addendum to the SJAR. When the SJA receives matters submitted by an accused or
defense counsel under RCM 1105 or 1106(f)(4) after service of the SJAR on defense, the SJA
must prepare an addendum to the SJAR for the convening authority. The SJA must address
whether corrective action is required when an allegation of error is raised in matters submitted
under RCM 1105. The response may consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with
the matter raised by the accused or counsel. RCM 1106(d)(4). The SJA may address other
matters raised by defense submissions in the addendum. Figure 9.6 is a sample addendum to the
SJAR when defense matters are submitted. If matters are not submitted, the SJA should still
prepare an addendum to the SJAR. See paragraph 9.17.3.
   9.17.1. The Addendum to the SJAR must:
       9.17.1.1. List each defense submission as a separate attachment to the addendum;
       9.17.1.2. Advise the convening authority that he or she must consider all written matters
       submitted by the defense. RCM 1107(b)(3)(A)(iii); and,
       9.17.1.3. Advise the convening authority that he or she may consider other matters prior
       to taking action, such as the ROT, personnel records of the accused, and such other
       matters as the convening authority deems appropriate. However, if the convening
       authority considers matters adverse to the accused from outside the record, with
       knowledge of which the accused is not chargeable, the accused must be notified and
       given an opportunity to rebut. See RCM 1107(b)(3)(B).
   9.17.2. New Matters in Addendum. New matters include all references to issues that are not
   included in the ROT and are not served on defense counsel and the accused with the SJAR.
   New matters ordinarily do not include the SJA's discussion of the correctness of the defense
   counsel's comments on the recommendation. If the addendum includes new matters serve
   the accused and defense counsel with the addendum containing the new matter. They are
   allowed 10 days from service to submit comments. RCM 1106(f)(7).
       9.17.2.1. When an addendum containing new matters is served upon the accused and
       defense counsel for comment, a second or additional addendum must be prepared to
       address defense comments or the absence of such comments. The second or additional
       addendum must list any additional defense submissions as an attachment, must re-advise
       the convening authority to comply with paragraphs 9.17.1.2 and 9.17.1.3, and may
       address any matters raised in additional defense submissions. If any addendum contains
       new matters, comply with paragraph 9.17.2.
   9.17.3. If the SJA does not receive matters from the accused or defense counsel per RCM
   1105 after service of the SJAR on defense per RCM 1106, the SJA must still prepare an
   addendum to the SJAR for the convening authority. In this case, the matters addressed in
   paragraphs 9.17.1.1 and 9.17.1.2 are not required, nor would paragraph 9.17.2 apply unless
   new matters are addressed in the Addendum to the SJAR. Figure 9.7 is a sample addendum
   to the SJAR when defense matters are not submitted.
9.18. Staff Summary Sheets. Avoid use of a staff summary sheet (SSS) in conjunction with the
SJAR, addendum to the SJAR, and action memorandum. If a SSS or other document is used to
forward the record (e.g., SJAR, action memorandum, RCM 1105 or RCM 1106 matters from the
defense, Addendum to the SJAR, ROT) to the convening authority for action, it must be included
with the ROT. The contents of any SSS should not ordinarily include any information not
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 145


previously addressed in the SJAR or addendum to the SJAR. Such information in the SSS may
constitute new matter. Any document that the SJA uses to supplement the post-trial
recommendation must be served on the defense counsel when it contains new matter. United
States v. Thompson, 43 M.J. 703 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995). If the SSS adds new matter not
otherwise addressed in the SJAR or addendum to the SJAR, it must be served on the accused and
defense counsel for comment. United States v. Leslie, 16 M.J. 714 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983).

Section 9F—Initial Action by the Convening Authority (RCM 1107).

9.19. When Initial Action May Be Taken. The convening authority may not take initial action
until the time period for the accused to submit matters for consideration under RCM 1105(c) has
expired or the accused has waived the right to submit such matters under RCM 1105(d).
   9.19.1. Action While RILO is Pending. The convening authority must not, under any
   circumstances, take action under RCM 1107 on any officer case in which an accused's
   resignation for the good of the service (RILO) is pending final SECAF decision (see
   paragraph 8.17.2).
   9.19.2. Acquittals. There is no convening authority action for an acquittal of all charges and
   specifications. A promulgating order is required. See paragraph 10.8.1.1.
9.20. Convening Authority Discretion. The convening authority is not required to take any
action on the findings, to review the case for legal errors, or to review the case for factual
sufficiency. Action taken on the findings and sentence is a matter of command prerogative and
within the sole discretion of the convening authority.
   9.20.1. Convening authorities should consider an accused's service in an area of combat
   operations in determining what punishment, if any, to approve. Where the sentence of an
   accused with an outstanding record in an area of combat operations extends to a punitive
   discharge, convening authorities should consider suspending or remitting the discharge,
   provided that return to duty is in the best interests of the Air Force.
   9.20.2. Convening authorities may not substitute an administrative discharge for an adjudged
   punitive discharge. However, in cases involving relatively minor offenses, an accused with
   an outstanding combat record, or other exceptional circumstances, and where restoration to
   duty is inappropriate, convening and reviewing authorities may consider recommending to
   SECAF, administrative, rather than punitive, separation under Article 74(b), UCMJ. Contact
   AFLOA/JAJR, 112 Luke Avenue, Room 343, Bolling AFB, DC 20032-8000, for assistance
   and coordination on such recommendations.
9.21. Disqualification of Convening Authority. A convening authority may not conduct the
post-trial review of a case if the attendant facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable
person to impute to him/her a personal interest in the outcome of the case or a personal bias
towards the accused. United States v. Gudmundson, 57 M.J. 493 (2002); United States v.
Voorhees, 50 M.J. 494 (1999); United States v. Crossley, 10 M.J. 376 (C.M.A. 1981); United
States v. Gordon, 1 C.M.A. 255, 2 C.M.R. 161 (C.M.A. 1952).
   9.21.1. If the SPCMCA is unable to take action in a case, forward the case to the GCMCA
   through the GCMCA‘s SJA. If the GCMCA is unable to take action, the MAJCOM
   commander designates a convening authority to do so.
 146                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   9.21.2. The ROT allied papers must include a memorandum by the SJA (of the convening
   authority taking action) explaining why a different convening authority took action on the
   case. The memorandum is not required if it is clear from the ROT (e.g., forwarding
   memorandum, transfer memorandum) why a different convening authority took action on the
   case.
   9.21.3. Transfer of responsibility for recommendation and action does not transfer authority
   to order or rescind deferments of sentence under Article 57a. That authority remains with the
   convening authority granting the deferment or, if the accused is no longer under that
   command, then with the GCMCA for the command to which the accused is currently
   assigned.
9.22. Format for Initial Actions. Prepare convening authority's initial action in accordance
with RCM 1107(f) and the guidance in the MCM, Appendix 16. Samples of a convening
authority's initial action are at Figure 9.8.
   9.22.1. Findings. Findings are addressed in the action only when any findings of guilty are
   disapproved, in whole or part. See sample formats in MCM, Appendix 16.
   9.22.2. Deferred Forfeitures and Reduction in Grade and Waiver of Automatic Forfeitures.
   See Section 9G for guidance, and Figures 9.8 and 9.9 for sample formats for initial actions.
9.23. Additional Considerations When Preparing Initial Actions.
   9.23.1. Limitation on Forfeitures. If no confinement is adjudged and a forfeiture exceeding
   two-thirds pay per month is adjudged, reduce the approved forfeiture to not more than two-
   thirds pay per month to run for a specified period of time or up until the punitive discharge is
   executed. Where an accused sentenced to an adjudged period of confinement and a forfeiture
   exceeding two-thirds pay per month has served the adjudged period of confinement prior to
   the convening authority‘s action, reduce the approved forfeiture to not more than total
   forfeitures for the period the accused was in confinement and not more than two-thirds pay
   per month thereafter, to run either for a specified period of time or up until execution of an
   adjudged punitive discharge. See RCM 1107(d)(2), Discussion; United States v. Craze, 56
   M.J. 777 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2002); United States v. York, 53 M.J. 553 (A.F. Ct. Crim.
   App. 2000); and United States v. Warner, 25 M.J. 64 (C.M.A. 1987).
   9.23.2. Duration of Forfeitures. When total forfeitures are approved, the duration of
   forfeitures is not specified. An enlisted member, sentenced to a punitive discharge,
   confinement and total forfeitures, restored to duty after release from confinement is entitled
   to pay and allowances from the date the member is restored to duty, and the forfeitures
   become inoperative thereafter.       DoD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial
   Management Regulations, Vol. 7A, para. 480804.
   9.23.3. Application of Article 58a, UCMJ. The provisions of Article 58a do not apply to the
   Air Force. All reductions in grade will be based upon adjudged and approved sentences.
   9.23.4. Suspension of Sentences and Proceedings to Vacate a Suspended Sentence. RCM
   1108 and RCM 1109. In a case where the convening authority suspends all or part of the
   execution of a sentence, include a copy of the suspension terms and the member's receipt in
   each copy of the ROT with the suspension action. If a suspended sentence is later vacated,
   document the vacation hearing on a DD Form 455, Report of Proceedings to Vacate
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 147


   Suspension of a General Court-Martial Sentence or of a Special Court-Martial Sentence
   Including a Bad-Conduct Discharge Under Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109. If the
   member waives the vacation hearing, the DD Form 455 is not required. Send the completed
   DD Form 455 or the member's waiver to AFLOA/JAJM for review and filing with the
   original ROT. Distribute court-martial orders announcing the vacation of a suspended
   sentence as required in Chapter 10. Use special orders to announce SCM sentence vacations.

Section 9G—Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ.

9.24. Distinctions between Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ. Articles 57(a) and 58b are
separate and distinct statutory provisions. They serve different purposes.
   9.24.1. Article 57(a) mandates the effective date of any forfeiture of pay and allowances or
   reduction in grade that is included in the sentence of a court-martial. It provides that
   adjudged forfeitures and an adjudged reduction in grade will take effect upon the convening
   authority‘s action or 14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever occurs first. There is
   no additional requirement under Article 57(a) for the sentence to include confinement or a
   punitive discharge. Therefore, adjudged forfeitures and reductions, unless deferred, should
   take effect on the date provided for in Article 57(a) even if there is no confinement or
   punitive discharge in the case.
   9.24.2. Article 58b requires forfeiture of pay (and allowances in general courts-martial) due
   a member during qualified periods of confinement or parole. The mandatory forfeitures (also
   known as required or automatic forfeitures) under this provision only take effect if three
   conditions exist:
       9.24.2.1. The adjudged sentence includes confinement for more than six months or
       death, or confinement for any period and a dishonorable discharge, bad conduct
       discharge, or dismissal;
       9.24.2.2. The accused is in confinement or on parole; and
       9.24.2.3. The accused is otherwise entitled to pay and allowances that are subject to
       mandatory forfeitures.
   9.24.3. As with adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures take effect the date of action or
   14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is sooner. The amount of pay and
   allowances forfeited in a general court-martial is all pay and allowances otherwise due the
   accused. The amount of pay forfeited in a special court-martial is two-thirds of pay
   otherwise due the accused. Allowances otherwise due are not subject to mandatory
   forfeitures in special courts-martial.
9.25. Deferral and Waiver Provisions under Articles 57(a) and 58b: Articles 57(a) and 58b
contain provisions that enable a convening authority to permit payments to the accused and/or
the accused‘s dependents that would otherwise have been forfeited.
   9.25.1. Article 57(a)(2) permits the convening authority to defer either adjudged forfeitures
   or an adjudged reduction in grade, or both, from taking effect until action. The accused must
   submit a written request to have adjudged and, if applicable, mandatory forfeitures deferred.
   The accused‘s pay will not stop if the convening authority approves a deferment of both
   adjudged and mandatory forfeitures, or approves a deferment of only adjudged forfeitures
 148                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   when there are no mandatory forfeitures. The convening authority may rescind a deferment
   at any time. Deferred forfeitures are paid to the accused.
   9.25.2. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived in cases where an accused has dependents.
   Waived forfeitures must be paid to the dependents. See paragraph 9.27 for dependency
   determinations.
   9.25.3. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived by the convening authority for a period not
   exceeding six months, or the period of confinement if less than six months.
   9.25.4. Waived forfeitures cannot be applied beyond the member's expiration of term of
   service (ETS) because the pay entitlement ceases at that point.
   9.25.5. The accused does not have to apply for a waiver of mandatory forfeitures. The
   convening authority may waive mandatory forfeitures on his or her initiative.
   9.25.6. The convening authority can waive mandatory forfeitures either before taking action
   or when taking action on the case. The waiver can be retroactive, designated to begin on a
   date 14 days after the sentence is adjudged.
   9.25.7. The convening authority must defer, suspend, mitigate or disapprove all or part of
   adjudged total forfeitures in order to waive any amount of mandatory forfeitures. Mandatory
   forfeitures can be waived for the benefit of the accused‘s dependents only to the extent
   adjudged forfeitures are not in effect. See United States v. Emminizer, 56 M.J. 441 (2002).
   9.25.8. A convening authority can defer mandatory forfeitures (and any adjudged
   forfeitures) until action and then waive mandatory forfeitures for a period not to exceed six
   months. A combination of deferral and waiver can maximize the pay and allowances going
   to the accused and his or her family.
9.26. Mechanics of Deferring and Waiving Forfeitures: Figure 9.1 explains the relationship
between adjudged and mandatory forfeitures from the date sentence is adjudged until the end of
the forfeiture period. Figure 9.1 provides examples of the interplay between adjudged and
mandatory forfeitures. To assist in drafting the convening authority‘s action on the sentence, see
Figures 9.8 and 9.9.

                                                                  qualifying dependents.
                                                                  (See Notes 3 & 4)
 ACTION TO END OF             The amount the CA approves is       Still in effect, except any
 FORFEITURE PERIOD            still in effect. The CA may         portion the CA waives or has
                              approve, disapprove, commute        waived.
                              or suspend the AF in whole or       (See Notes 4 & 5)
                              in part.

NOTE:
1. Mandatory forfeitures (MF) only apply when the three conditions listed in paragraph 9.24.2.
exist.
2. If the accused applies for deferment, the convening authority (CA) may defer all or a portion
of the AF and/or MF 14 days after the date on which the sentence was adjudged until the
convening authority takes action. The accused should specify whether the deferment requested
is for AF, MF, or both (a request for deferment of forfeitures in general is considered a request
for both). If a deferment is approved, the accused will be paid a sum equal to the pay and
allowances to which he or she is entitled, minus any amounts forfeited (AF and/or MF not
deferred). The CA may rescind a deferment (AF and/or MF) at any time.
3. The CA may waive available MF with or without a request from the accused. The CA may
waive MF to the extent that the accused is entitled to pay and allowances (see Note 1 above).
4. MF may be waived until the earlier of: 1) a period not to exceed six months; 2) the accused‘s
release from confinement; or 3) the last day the accused is otherwise entitled to pay and
allowances (see Note 1 above).
5. At action, the CA may waive all or portion of the available MF (if previously waived, waiver
is memorialized in the action) for the benefit of the accused‘s dependents. The CA may
disapprove, commute or suspend all or a portion of the AF to increase the amount of MF
available for the CA to waive. The CA may retroactively waive MF, starting 14 days after the
date on which the sentence was adjudged.

  9.26.1. Accused‘s Deferral Request. If an accused requests a deferral of a reduction in grade
  and/or a forfeiture of pay (and allowances) until action is taken, the convening authority may
  approve the request, in full or in part, or may disapprove the request.
      9.26.1.1. The accused‘s deferral request should specify whether a request for deferred
      forfeitures is for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures, or both. If it is unclear, the
      convening authority may treat it as a request for deferral of both.
      9.26.1.2. The convening authority‘s action on the request should be reflected in a signed
      and dated document.
      9.26.1.3. The terms of approved deferrals must also be reported in a 14-day priority
      message in accordance with Figure 9.10 and must be reported in the action the convening
      authority ultimately takes on the case.
      9.26.1.4. A deferral of forfeitures may be for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures,
      or both, and for all pay and allowances to which the accused is entitled or a lesser sum.
  9.26.2. Waiver of Mandatory Forfeitures. In cases where mandatory forfeitures are waived,
  whether prior to or as party of the action, the approved waiver should express the amount
  approved in dollar amounts per month. The exception to this is when the waiver is for total
  pay and allowances in a general court-martial or two-thirds pay in a special court-martial.
      9.26.2.1. Approved requests must identify the dependents that will receive the waived
      forfeitures. If payments are made to an ex-spouse or other person on behalf of minor
      dependents, confirmation that the designated payee is the appointed guardian or custodian
      of a minor dependent is required.
      9.26.2.2. If mandatory forfeitures are waived before action, the convening authority
      should reflect approval in a signed and dated document. Such a waiver of mandatory
      forfeitures should also be reported in the 14-day priority message and in the convening
      authority‘s action on the case.
      9.26.2.3. Contact the local accounting and finance office to determine the accused‘s
      entitlements and the actual amount of pay and allowances the accused and/or the
      accused‘s dependents may be entitled to receive. A number of factors can impact these
      entitlements:
         9.26.2.3.1. BAS. In most cases, the accused will lose BAS upon entering
         confinement. Therefore, the convening authority cannot give the accused‘s family
         any portion of the accused‘s BAS.
         9.26.2.3.2. TAXES. Federal and state taxes will be withheld from any payments of
         deferred or waived forfeitures. Therefore, if the convening authority wants the
         accused‘s family to receive a certain amount of money, the amount of taxes should be
         factored into the calculation.
         9.26.2.3.3. GRADE REDUCTION. A reduction in grade may significantly lower the
         amount of the accused‘s pay that is eligible for waiver. Therefore, if the convening
         authority wants the accused‘s family to receive a certain amount of money, the effect
         of a reduction in grade should be taken into consideration.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   151


          9.26.2.3.4. SPOUSE on ACTIVE DUTY. A spouse who is also an active duty
          military member can receive only waived forfeiture of pay, not pay and allowances.
          9.26.2.3.5. ETS. There are no forfeitures to waive on any date after the accused‘s
          ETS. Any pretrial agreement to approve a waiver of any amount of forfeitures when
          the accused is near or beyond his or her ETS may render pleas improvident because
          the accused may not receive the benefit of his bargain. Pretrial agreements containing
          a waiver provision must clearly state that any waiver is only applicable to pay and/or
          allowances that the accused is otherwise entitled to receive. See United States v.
          Perron, 58 M.J. 78 (2003) and paragraph 8.5.2.1.
9.27. Dependency Determinations under Article 58b: When addressing waivers of
mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b, UCMJ, an issue may arise as to whether a person
qualifies as a dependent.
   9.27.1. Dependent Categories. RCM 1101(d)(3) provides that, for the purpose of waiving
   forfeitures, a ―dependent‖ means any person qualifying as a dependent according to 37
   U.S.C. § 401. This statute identifies four categories of dependents:
      9.27.1.1. Spouse of the accused, regardless of military status.
      9.27.1.2. Unmarried child of the accused under 21 years of age, including an adopted
      child or stepchild. In addition, special rules permit a child as old as 23 years of age to be
      a dependent if enrolled as a full-time student and a child older than 21 years of age to be
      a dependent if incapable of self-support due to mental or physical incapacity. However,
      in these two cases the accused must provide more than one-half of the child‘s support.
      9.27.1.3. Parent of the accused. Additional dependency requirements are required,
      including the accused providing over one-half of the parent‘s support. Parents includes
      natural parents, stepparents, and adoptive parents of the accused or the accused‘s spouse;
      and any other person who stood in loco parentis to the accused for a continuous 5 year
      period before the member became 21 years of age.
      9.27.1.4. Unmarried persons placed in legal custody of the member as a result of a court
      order for a period of at least 12 months. This category of persons, known as wards, must
      depend upon the accused for over one-half of their support and must meet numerous
      other criteria set forth in the statute (37 U.S.C. § 401).
   9.27.2. Evidence of Dependency. Sufficient evidence of dependency is required to support
   an Article 58b waiver. The nature of this evidence will depend on the status of the
   dependent.
      9.27.2.1. Dependency status for a spouse and/or child may be established by their
      enrollment in DEERS or by other competent evidence, such as a marriage certificate for a
      spouse or a birth certificate or court order establishing paternity and/or child support
      obligations for a child.
      9.27.2.2. Dependency determinations for a child over 21 years of age, parents, or a ward
      are more complex because they only qualify as a dependent if the military sponsor
      provides more than one-half of their support. A thorough determination by DFAS is
      necessary. A precondition for waiving forfeitures for the benefit of one of these
      dependents should be an ―approval letter‖ of dependency from DFAS. The accused, or
 152                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       other party requesting the waiver, should provide a copy of the DFAS ―approval letter‖
       with any request to waive mandatory forfeitures.
       9.27.2.3. If an accused has failed to qualify or was unable to qualify the person(s) as
       dependent(s) with DFAS, there will normally be insufficient evidence of dependency to
       support an Article 58b waiver of mandatory forfeitures.
9.28. Service of Legal Reviews on the Accused: The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals has
addressed whether an SJA‘s legal advice to a convening authority regarding requests for deferral
or waiver of forfeitures must be served upon the accused with an opportunity to respond.
Deferrals need not be served, see 9.28.1. Waivers must be served, see 9.28.2. In either case,
legal offices should process requests promptly.
   9.28.1. Article 57(a) Deferral of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Key, 55 M.J. 537
   (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001), the Court held that an SJA review of a request for deferral of
   forfeitures does not need to be served on the defense for comment prior to submission to the
   convening authority. The Court compared such a request to a request for deferral of a
   sentence to confinement, for which no SJA recommendation is required and, historically, the
   SJA‘s legal analysis of the request is not served on the accused. Any SJA review and action
   by the convening authority on the request must become a part of the completed ROT.
   9.28.2. Article 58b Waiver of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Spears, 48 M.J. 768
   (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1998), the Court considered whether a legal review of a request for a
   waiver of forfeitures must be served on the defense prior to submission to the convening
   authority. The Court noted that SJAs are not required to prepare legal reviews of requests for
   waiver of automatic forfeitures. The Court treated the request for waiver of forfeitures as a
   clemency request and declared that practitioners must exercise care when addressing the
   request for waiver of forfeitures before the record is completed. Spears set this basic
   approach: any legal review prepared by the SJA for the convening authority prior to
   completion of the SJAR should be attached to the SJAR and become part of the completed
   ROT. Any legal review that may be prepared after the SJAR should be treated as an
   addendum to the SJAR and served on the accused for comment when it contains matter
   outside the record. Serve it on the accused before submission to the convening authority and
   include it in the completed ROT.
9.29. Application of Article 57(a) and 58b To Cases With Offenses Committed Prior to 1
April 1996. For cases in which all of the charged offenses occurred before 1 April 1996, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in United States v. Gorski, 47 M.J. 370 (1997),
held these provisions operate in violation of the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.
   9.29.1. For cases affected by the Gorski decision, any forfeitures collected pursuant to
   Article 58b (mandatory forfeitures); Article 57(a)(1)(A) (adjudged forfeitures taken prior to
   convening authority action); and/or any pay and allowances withheld due to a reduction in
   grade pursuant to Article 57(a)(1)(A) (reduction in grade prior to convening authority
   action), are without legal effect and will be restored.
   9.29.2. For cases involving offense(s) committed both before and after 1 April 1996, the
   Court, in United States v. Carter, 49 M.J. 392 (1998), applied unitary sentencing principles
   and limited the Gorski holding to those cases where the maximum sentence for any or all
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 153


   offenses committed on or after 1 April 1996 would induce mandatory forfeitures under
   Article 58b.

Section 9H— Contingent Confinement

9.30. Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement is confinement authorized by a court-
martial in the form of a fine-enforcement provision. See RCM 1003(b)(3) and RCM 1113(d)(3).
A fine enforcement provision may be ordered executed in accordance with the procedures below.
   9.30.1. Authority to Execute Contingent Confinement. A fine does not become effective
   until ordered executed (Article 57(c), UCMJ). Fines may be ordered executed in the
   convening authority's initial action (Article 71(c)(2), UCMJ). The accused is not required to
   pay a fine until the fine is ordered executed. Moreover, an accused may not be ordered to
   serve contingent confinement until the fine is ordered executed and the requirements of
   paragraph 9.31 are met. If the accused fails to demonstrate that he or she has made good
   faith efforts to pay the fine but cannot because of indigency, the convening authority may
   order the sentence of confinement executed by following the procedures outlined in
   paragraph 9.31.
   9.30.2. Enforcement. Once court-martial jurisdiction attaches, an accused remains subject to
   the UCMJ through the execution and enforcement of a sentence. Article 2(a)(1), UCMJ,
   confers jurisdiction over members of a regular component of the armed forces, including
   those awaiting discharge after the expiration of terms of enlistment. Jurisdiction continues
   for the purpose of enforcing an adjudged sentence for individuals discharged as the result of
   a court-martial conviction. Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365 (1902); Peebles v. Froehlke,
   46 C.M.R. 266 (1973).
9.31. Procedures for Executing Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement may be
executed in accordance with the following procedures:
   9.31.1. When the fine is ordered executed, the accused must be notified in writing the fine is
   due and payable. A specific due date should be included in the notification. If the accused is
   in confinement, the due date should normally be a reasonable period before the accused is
   scheduled for release from confinement to allow adequate time for a contingent confinement
   hearing and convening authority action.
   9.31.2. After the fine is considered due, the SJA for the base where the accused was tried
   ascertains whether the accused has met his or her obligations concerning the fine. If it
   appears the fine has not been paid, notify the convening authority. If the convening authority
   finds probable cause to believe a fine is unpaid, the convening authority may order a
   contingent confinement hearing. The convening authority for this hearing is the officer who
   convened the court-martial, his or her successor in command, or the officer exercising
   GCMCA over the command to which the accused is assigned. If the accused is no longer a
   member of the Air Force, the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Commander
   (GCMCA over the Air Force Corrections System) is the convening authority. The purpose of
   the hearing is to determine whether the fine is delinquent, whether the delinquency, if any,
   resulted from the accused's indigence and whether the contingent confinement should be
   executed.
154                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  9.31.3. A military judge is detailed as hearing officer to conduct the contingent confinement
  hearing in the same manner as detailed to a court-martial.
  9.31.4. The accused is provided written notice of the time and place of the hearing. The
  convening authority provides the accused with temporary duty orders or invitational travel
  orders if the accused is not in confinement and the hearing is beyond reasonable commuting
  distance from the accused's residence. See Figure 6.9 for appropriate funding authority. The
  notice informs the accused of the following:
      9.31.4.1. The accused's alleged failure to pay the fine;
      9.31.4.2. The purpose of the hearing to determine whether the fine is delinquent and
      whether the delinquency, if any, is the result of the accused's indigence;
      9.31.4.3. The accused‘s right to present witnesses and documentary evidence;
      9.31.4.4. The accused‘s right to representation by military defense counsel; and
      9.31.4.5. The evidence which was relied upon in issuing the notice of hearing and the
      options available to the convening authority.
  9.31.5. Unless the hearing is otherwise waived, the hearing officer makes findings on
  whether payment of a fine is delinquent and whether any delinquency resulted from the
  accused's indigence. Payment of a fine is delinquent if not made within the period specified
  in the approved sentence or, if no period is specified, within a reasonable time. An accused's
  failure to pay a fine is not due to indigence if the failure to pay the fine resulted from a
  willful refusal to pay the fine or a failure to make sufficient good faith efforts to pay it. The
  Government bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, of showing that
  payment of the fine is delinquent. The accused bears the burden of proof, by a
  preponderance of the evidence, of showing that any delinquency resulted from indigence.
  See 18 U.S.C. § 3572(a) for criteria to consider in making these determinations.
  9.31.6. Hearing Procedures.
      9.31.6.1. The hearing officer determines the facts from the best evidence available.
      Rulings on evidentiary and procedural matters are final. Strict evidentiary rules do not
      apply and hearsay statements are admissible.
      9.31.6.2. The accused may testify and present witnesses and documentary evidence.
      Witness testimony may be presented through sworn or unsworn statements, affidavits,
      depositions, prior testimony, stipulations of expected testimony, or telephone conference.
      The accused may not compel the production of a witness at Government expense unless
      the request is made to the hearing officer, in writing, before the hearing and the hearing
      officer determines:
         9.31.6.2.1. The physical presence of the witness is critical to a fair determination of a
         material issue in dispute;
         9.31.6.2.2. The witness is available to testify; and
         9.31.6.2.3. There is no substitute for the live testimony of the prospective witness
         (e.g. written statements, affidavits, stipulations, or telephone conference).
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 155


      9.31.6.3. The accused has a right to confront and cross-examine those witnesses
      testifying at the hearing.
      9.31.6.4. The accused may be represented at the hearing by a civilian attorney or civilian
      representative of the accused's choice at no cost to the Government. The accused is also
      entitled to representation by either an ADC or military counsel of the accused's selection,
      if reasonably available (see paragraph 5.4). The accused is not entitled to representation
      by more than one military counsel.
      9.31.6.5. A court reporter reports the hearing and prepares a summarized record of the
      proceeding. The record includes a summary of the evidence presented and any objections
      or requests considered by the hearing officer.
      9.31.6.6. The hearing officer submits a written report to the convening authority through
      the SJA, including a statement of the evidence relied upon to support the findings. If the
      hearing officer chooses to make the findings and statement of evidence on the record,
      transcribe them verbatim. The hearing officer forwards the report and/or record to the
      convening authority.
      9.31.6.7. The convening authority takes final action on the hearing officer's findings and
      determinations. The convening authority may adopt, modify or reject the hearing
      officer's findings and determinations. If the hearing officer's findings and determinations
      are not adopted, the convening authority must specify the evidence relied upon and the
      reasons for the decision.
      9.31.6.8. If the convening authority determines payment of the fine is delinquent and the
      failure to pay is not due to indigence, the convening authority may order the sentence of
      confinement executed. See Figure 9.11 for a sample order executing contingent
      confinement. If the convening authority determines the accused has made good efforts to
      pay the fine, but cannot because of indigency, the convening authority may not order the
      sentence of confinement executed unless he or she determines that there is no other
      punishment adequate to meet the Government‘s interest in appropriate punishment. See
      RCM 1113(d)(3).
      9.31.6.9. Forward a copy of the summarized record of the contingent confinement
      hearing for each copy of the ROT required by AFMAN 51-203, chapters 3 and 13 to
      AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 9I— Notifications of Adjudged Sentence, Action of the Convening Authority, and
Deferment or Waiver

9.32. Reporting by Base Level SJA. In all courts-martial with mandatory forfeitures under
Article 58b, UCMJ, adjudged forfeitures, or reduction in grade, the SJA of the office that
prosecuted the case must send a message by the most expeditious means available to HQ
AFPC/DPPPWM and the member's finance office, with informational copies to HQ AFSFC/SFC
and DFAS-DE/FJPC in the format set out in Figure 9.10. The referenced message must be sent
within 24 hours of the date the convening authority takes action under RCM 1107 or 14 days
after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is earlier. If any portion of the punishment or
mandatory forfeitures is deferred or if the convening authority waives any portion of the
 156                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


mandatory forfeitures prior to the date of the message, the message must include the terms of
such deferment or waiver.
9.33. Reporting by Convening Authority's SJA. If action is taken more than 14 days after the
sentence is adjudged, in any case where the approved sentence includes a reduction in grade or
forfeitures (mandatory or adjudged), the SJA of the convening authority must send a second
priority message within 24 hours after the convening authority‘s RCM 1107 action. If any
portion of the punishment or mandatory forfeiture is deferred or if the convening authority
waives any portion of the mandatory forfeiture, the second message must include the terms of
such deferment or waiver. Send the message to the same addressees listed in paragraph 9.32 and,
if the accused is confined, to the confinement facility, using the format in Figure 9.11 For
members who enter a prisoner status requiring a permanent change of station, also send the
message to the gaining AFO.
9.34. Notification and Distribution of Documents to Confinement Facilities.
   9.34.1. After action by the original convening authority, the AFDW Commander exercises
   GCMCA over inmates transferred to Level II Regional Corrections Facilities (RCFs) and
   long-term corrections facilities as defined in AFI 31-205, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and
   over those Air Force members and former members paroled or placed on excess leave from
   such facilities.
   9.34.2. When an inmate (with or without a punitive separation) is transferred into the Air
   Force Corrections System, the servicing SJA sends:
       9.34.2.1. Four copies of the court-martial order to HQ AFSFC/SFC and two copies of the
       court-martial order to the corrections officer of the facility housing the offender;
       9.34.2.2. Two copies of any victim request to be notified of changes in the inmate's
       status and of clemency hearings to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
       9.34.2.3. One copy of the SJAR to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
       9.34.2.4. One copy of the ROT to the corrections officer, if the approved confinement is
       one year or more.
   9.34.3. If at the time the inmate is transferred to a corrections facility, the court-martial order
   has not been published, send one copy of the AF Form 1359 and the convening authority's
   action to HQ AFSFC/SFC (facsimile transmission in lieu of mailing is permissible, DSN
   473-0788) and two copies of each to the corrections officer.

Section 9J—Involuntary (Required) and Voluntary Excess Leave

9.35. Excess Leave.
   9.35.1. The convening authority may place an accused that had either no confinement
   adjudged or already completed the period of confinement on involuntary excess leave while
   awaiting appellate review of an unsuspended punitive separation (See Article 76a, UCMJ).
   Members of the Air Reserve Components may be removed from active duty status rather
   than being placed in excess leave and recalled as necessary to complete appellate review.
   Contact HQ AFRC/JA for guidance.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 157


  9.35.2. Members with an adjudged sentence that includes a punitive discharge may volunteer
  to be placed on excess leave pending the convening authority's action. If the convening
  authority approves the punitive separation, terminate the accused‘s voluntary excess leave
  status. Return the accused to duty or place on involuntary excess leave.
  9.35.3. When an approved sentence includes unsuspended confinement, the confinement
  must be served, remitted, or deferred before placing an accused on either voluntary or
  involuntary excess leave.
  9.35.4. An accused with accrued leave when required to take excess leave may elect to either
  receive pay and allowances during the period of accrued leave and then continue on unpaid
  excess leave or receive payment for the accrued leave as of the day excess leave begins, and
  serve the entire period on unpaid excess leave.
  9.35.5. If the accused's sentence to a punitive separation is set aside or disapproved upon
  appellate review, the accused is entitled to pay and allowances for the period of required
  excess leave, unless a rehearing or new trial is ordered and a punitive separation results from
  the rehearing. The amount of pay and allowances is reduced by the amount of income,
  unemployment compensation, and public assistance benefits received by the accused from
  any government agency during the period of excess leave.
  9.35.6. The convening authority may order the accused to begin involuntary excess leave
  upon completion of a sentence to confinement in the RCM 1107 action, upon completion of a
  sentence to confinement or at any time following approval of a sentence which includes a
  punitive discharge, subject to paragraph 9.36.3. Such involuntary excess leave may continue
  until the date the discharge is executed, unless terminated at any earlier date.
  9.35.7. When a convening authority directs excess leave for an accused serving in an
  overseas area, the convening authority directs reassignment to the Mission Support Squadron
  at the base nearest the appellate leave address provided by the accused.
     9.35.7.1. An accused may go directly to his or her leave address without reporting into
     the gaining unit. The accused will determine whether to physically report into the
     gaining unit before departure.
     9.35.7.2. The losing commander, consistent with the accused‘s election, will direct the
     accused to travel from the overseas location to either the appellate leave address or the
     gaining unit as soon as possible after completion of out processing. After arrival, the
     accused will commence taking accrued leave, if so elected, and/or required excess leave.
     9.35.7.3. The accused will be considered assigned to the Mission Support Squadron at
     the gaining base on the date the member physically reports to the unit or, in cases where
     the accused does not physically report to the gaining unit, the date determined by the
     local MPF‘s Personnel Relocations Element based upon the accused‘s departure date and
     travel time.
     9.35.7.4. Overseas members may provide a leave address in an OCONUS state or
     territory of the United States (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, Guam) and HQ AFPC may assign the
     member to the Mission Support Squadron nearest such leave address. Overseas airmen in
     foreign countries must provide an appellate leave address in a state or territory of the
     United States and will be reassigned to a Mission Support Squadron at the base nearest
158                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


      the leave address. Overseas members in foreign countries will be required to depart the
      foreign country.
  9.35.8. Procedures for Placing an Accused on Excess Leave. When the convening authority
  orders an accused to take excess leave, the convening authority sends the accused a letter
  (Figure 9.12), through command channels, directing the excess leave and informing the
  accused of entitlements, status, and responsibilities while on excess leave. If the convening
  authority directed the excess leave in the action (see Figure 9.8.), the convening authority‘s
  SJA, or Acting SJA, may sign and send the letter to the accused. The SJA for the convening
  authority directing excess leave ensures a signed copy of this letter, with the accused's receipt
  and any subsequent address changes, is sent to the servicing MPF. In cases of an accused
  being reassigned from overseas, send a copy of the letter to the SJAs of the SPCMCA and
  GCMCA of the gaining unit, the gaining excess leave MSS/CC, AFLOA/JAJM and
  AFLOA/JAJA. See Figure 9.12.
      9.35.8.1. Action to place the accused on voluntary or involuntary excess leave must
      comply with JFTR, paragraph U7506, and AFIs 36-3003, Military Leave Program, 36-
      2110, Assignments, 36-2102, Base-Level Relocations Procedures and 31-205, The Air
      Force Corrections System. Ensure AMJAMS is updated to reflect the accused‘s
      appellate leave address.
  9.35.9. Travel of Personnel Awaiting Completion of Appellate Review (Excess) Leave. An
  accused involuntarily placed on excess leave while awaiting completion of appellate review
  of a court-martial sentence to a punitive discharge or dismissal from the service may be
  provided travel or transportation in kind, according to the JFTR, Volume I. Ensure a special
  order is published in "A" series if the court-martial convening authority directs involuntary
  appellate (excess) leave according to AFI 36-3003 and this instruction. If the accused's
  court-martial sentence is disapproved or set aside, and the member is restored to duty, the
  member is authorized travel or transportation in kind, according to the JFTR Volume I. In
  such cases, publish an "A" Series order.

                                           Chapter 10

                                COURT-MARTIAL ORDERS

10.1. General. A Court-Martial Order (CMO) is used to promulgate the result of trial and
action by the convening authority (initial action), and any subsequent action the convening
authority or higher authorities take on a case after the initial action (supplementary orders),
including the final order. Use the guidance in RCM 1114, Appendix 17, and Figures 10.1
through 10.8 to prepare and issue CMOs. See AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial, para. 10.5, for
guidance on convening authority action in SCMs.
10.2. Separate Orders. Use a separate CMO to announce the results for each accused tried,
whether or not they were tried jointly.
10.3. Authority to Publish Orders. This chapter is the sole authority for the publication of
CMOs. The appropriate convening authority publishes CMOs, or AFLOA/JAJM may direct
publication. Additionally, AFLOA/JAJM publishes final CMOs executing sentences in cases
acted on by TJAG, and AFLOA/JAJR publishes final CMOs in cases acted on by SECAF and
the President. In the event a convening authority's command is deactivated, responsibility for
publication of orders falls to:
   10.3.1. The next higher level of command exercising GCMCA;
   10.3.2. A re-designated unit, when the initial order was published under its old designation;
   or
   10.3.3. A unit assuming the records, personnel, functions, etc., of an inactivated or
   transferred unit that published the initial order.
10.4. Authentication (Signature). The authority issuing the CMO signs it personally, or
delegates such authority. Figure 13.1.1. Do not designate a representative below the grade of
master sergeant. Include the signature block of the issuing authority and, if applicable, the
signature block of the person authenticating pursuant to a delegation. Only the person actually
authenticating the CMO signs it. The convening authority personally must sign a supplemental
order that comprises an action subsequent to the initial action. RCM 1114(b)(2).
10.5. Orders Promulgation. See Figures 10.1 through 10.8 for examples.
   10.5.1. Promulgate CMOs as follows:
       10.5.1.1. For GCMs, use a General Court-Martial Order. For SPCMs, use a Special
       Court-Martial Order.
       10.5.1.2. Number consecutively, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
       10.5.1.3. Above the heading of the first order of a fiscal year, cite the number of the last
       order published in the previous fiscal year. If no orders were published the preceding
       year, state there were no orders published in the previous fiscal year.
       10.5.1.4. Continue CMOs of commands redesignated during a fiscal year in the same
       series of numbers. Cite the authority for the redesignation above the heading of the first
       page in the first order published after redesignation.
 184                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       10.5.1.5. For SCMs, CMOs are required only when the CA takes action after the initial
       action.
   10.5.2. Orders Logs.
       10.5.2.1. Have a separate CMO log for each type of court-martial and each convening
       authority. For example, a single-base GCMCA will have one log for SPCMs and one log
       for GCMs. Also, each SPCMCA at a base will each have his/her own log for SPCMs. A
       CMO log is in addition to the convening orders log.
       10.5.2.2. The log should reflect the CMO number assigned to a particular case. Original
       CMOs are stored with the CMO log.
10.6. Format. Use the following format. See also Figures 10.1 through 10.8:
   10.6.1. Head-to-foot on letter size paper.
   10.6.2. Margins. Leave a two-inch margin at the top and bottom of all pages, and a one-inch
   margin on the left and right side of all pages. On the first page of an order include the order
   number one-half inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. Number the second and
   succeeding pages one-half inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. On the first
   line of the second and succeeding pages, state the order number, headquarters and date of the
   CMO; e.g., SPCMO No. 3, HQ 71 FTW, Vance AFB, OK, 6 May 2007.
   10.6.3. Heading. Include "DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE," the complete unit
   designation, the name of the MAJCOM abbreviated in parentheses, the mailing address, and
   the order number and date. See Figures 10.1 through 10.8.
   10.6.4. Body. Do not number paragraphs in the body. Center the headings titled
   ―SENTENCE‖ and ―ACTION‖ and use subparagraphs under each.
   10.6.5. Announcement of the Proceedings. State the accused‘s grade at the time of
   arraignment, name, social security number, branch of service, and unit. State the location of
   the arraignment.
   10.6.6. Grade, Name. Always reflect the grade and name of an accused in capital letters.
   The first time the name is used, state the grade or title, first name, middle initial, last name.
   If the name is used again, use only the grade or title and last name. When referencing the
   accused after stating a reduction in grade was approved, use the accused‘s reduced grade
   (e.g., when directing excess leave in the convening authority‘s action).
   10.6.7. Abbreviations. Abbreviations from a standard dictionary, or AFH 33-337, The
   Tongue and Quill, may be used if they make the order clearer.
   10.6.8. Close. In the close, use the appropriate authority line depending on who
   authenticates the order, followed by the signature block of the person authenticating. For
   Department of the Air Force, use ―BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR
   FORCE.‖ For the Air Force Academy, use ―FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT.‖ For TJAG
   use ―FOR THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.‖ For all other units, use ―FOR THE
   COMMANDER.‖ No authority line is required when the convening authority personally
   signs the CMO. Paralegals in grade E-7 thru E-9 must include duty titles.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                       185


10.7. Matters Unfit for Publication and Classified Matters.
   10.7.1. Unexpurgated and Expurgated CMOs. When the content of a CMO includes
   classified or other matters unfit for publication, prepare two versions of the CMO. The
   version with the content included is called the unexpurgated order. The version with the
   content replaced is called the expurgated order. Both the unexpurgated and the expurgated
   orders are the same order, and both carry the same order number and full distribution list. To
   avoid confusion between the recipients, on both versions mark the addressees of those who
   are to receive the unexpurgated copies with asterisks next to the number of copies and add,
   below the distribution list, "Recipients of unexpurgated CMO." Make the following
   substitutions in the expurgated order:
       10.7.1.1. Names of children 16 years and under are always replaced with initials in both
       expurgated and unexpurgated CMOs (NOTE: Therefore, unless there is an independent
       reason to create an expurgated CMO, create only an unexpurgated CMO using just
       initials instead of names and mark the appropriate agencies for distribution for the
       unexpurgated copies);
       10.7.1.2. Names of adult sex offense victims are replaced with initials;
       10.7.1.3. Obscene language and matters are replaced with asterisks; and
       10.7.1.4. Classified information is replaced with asterisks (10.7.2.2.)
   10.7.2. Distribution.
       10.7.2.1. Unexpurgated Orders. AFLOA/JAJM, AFPC/DPSFCM, the authorities of the
       command where the accused is held in custody or to which transferred, and the
       commander of the place where the accused is confined receive copies of the
       unexpurgated CMO.
       10.7.2.2. Expurgated Orders. Include the classified information only in the order
       provided to the command where the accused is held in custody or assigned and one copy
       of the order accompanying the original ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.
10.8. Initial Promulgating Orders. Initial CMOs promulgate the results of trial and any initial
action taken under Article 60, UCMJ. RCM 1114. It is important they accurately reflect the
proceedings of the court-martial.
   10.8.1. Preparing Orders. Prepare initial CMOs when the convening authority takes action
   on a case where the court returned any finding of guilty and a sentence.
       10.8.1.1. Orders in Cases without a Guilty Finding. Issue a CMO in trials terminated
       after arraignment but before findings (i.e., all charges dismissed or withdrawn, including
       upon declaration of a mistrial), and trials resulting in a finding of not guilty of all charges,
       including not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility and acquittals. Include the
       date of the termination or not guilty finding. Explain the circumstances of the
       termination. The date of the CMO is the same date it is published. Do not issue a CMO
       in trials terminated without findings before arraignment.
       10.8.1.2. Rehearing or New Trial. Indicate in an initial CMO whether a case is a
       rehearing or new trial as shown in Figure 10.5.
186                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  10.8.2. Form.
      10.8.2.1. Date. The date of the CMO is the same date the convening authority took
      action. If the convening authority did not take action (e.g., in an acquittal), the date of the
      CMO is the date it is published.
      10.8.2.2. Charges, Specifications, Pleas and Findings.          List the charges and
      specifications on which the accused was arraigned. After each charge and specification,
      abbreviate the plea and finding. Use ―G‖ for guilty and ―NG‖ for not guilty. If no plea
      was entered, state ―None entered.‖ If an accused‘s plea changed during trial, explain the
      circumstances surrounding the change. See A4.2.2.6. If no finding was entered, state the
      reason. The disposition of each charge and specification should be clear, including those
      amended, merged, withdrawn and/or dismissed.
         10.8.2.2.1. Summarized Specifications. RCM 1114(c) requires the promulgating
         order to contain at least a summary of the charges and specifications on which the
         accused was arraigned. Therefore, because the accused‘s personal information is
         contained in the introductory paragraph of the CMO, it need not be repeated in the
         specification subparagraph. However, the remainder of the specification on which
         the accused was arraigned should be verbatim. Consider summarizing lengthy bad
         check specifications. Ensure any summarized specification includes factors such as
         value, amount or other such circumstances affecting maximum punishment. See
         Figures 10.1 through 10.5, 10.8.
         10.8.2.2.2. Lesser Included Offense (LIO); Exceptions and Substitutions. The charge
         should reflect any plea or findings of guilt to an LIO. When an accused pled or was
         found guilty by exceptions, the language in the specification being excepted should
         be verbatim. The plea or finding of the specification should accurately reflect the
         words being excepted and, if applicable, substituted. If found not guilty of the greater
         offense, but guilty of the LIO, then it should be NG of Art. X, but guilty of Art. Y.
         See Figures 10.1 and 10.2.
         10.8.2.2.3. Amendments. Indicate, in parentheses and after the affected portion of
         the specification, an amendment to a charge or specification made after arraignment.
         Figure 10.2.
         10.8.2.2.4. Renumbering of Charges. Use care in proofing CMOs involving charges
         and specifications withdrawn, dismissed or severed that result in renumbering of
         remaining charges and specifications. Charges and specifications withdrawn before
         arraignment do not appear in the CMO if the other charges were correctly
         renumbered. See para. 8.2.2; Figure 10.4.
      10.8.2.3. Sentence. State the forum that adjudged the sentence, the date the sentence was
      adjudged, and the adjudged sentence. When the convening authority orders a reprimand
      executed, place the language of the reprimand after the action and before the distribution.
      10.8.2.4. Action. Reflect the action taken by the convening authority under Article 60.
      On CMOs, the action may be summarized to the extent it does not repeat the accused‘s
      personal information (which should be in the introductory paragraph). The remainder of
      the convening authority‘s Action should be verbatim. When the convening authority
      modified an Action before publication or before the accused was notified of the action,
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 187


       the initial CMO reflects only the modified action. On CMOs, the wording of an action
       should follow the wording in the Action verbatim including the accused‘s personal
       information. If an error occurs, CMOs should not be corrected, but withdrawn and
       accomplished again.
10.9. Supplementary Orders. Promulgate any action taken on a case subsequent to the initial
action in a supplementary order. For example, use a supplementary order to suspend or remit a
sentence (RCM 1108), vacate an earlier suspension (RCM 1109), terminate deferment (RCM
1101(c)(7)), and take final action.
   10.9.1. Form. All supplementary orders contain the following:
       10.9.1.1. A cite to the initial CMO and any later CMOs modifying the findings, sentence
       or action.
       10.9.1.2. The date the sentence was adjudged and the trial forum.
       10.9.1.3. The ACM or ACMS number assigned to the case.
   10.9.2. Convening Authority Signature. The convening authority personally signs any
   supplementary orders. See RCM 1114(b)(2).
   10.9.3. Order Vacating Suspension. To provide necessary data to confinement officers for
   computation of time to be served in confinement, include in CMOs promulgating the
   vacation of a suspension of confinement the information in MCM, Appendix 17(d), and the
   following additional information: the trial forum, the date the sentence was adjudged, the
   period of any deferment, any modification of confinement, and identifying data of any orders
   affecting the sentence to confinement.
   10.9.4. Article 64 Review. When the general court-martial convening authority is required
   to take action under RCM 1112(e) in a non-BCD special court-martial, ensure the CMO
   states the action is ―pursuant to the authority of RCM 1112(f).‖ Ensure the cover and the
   CMO are typed or stamped ―64a Review.‖
   10.9.5. Final Orders. A final order is a supplementary order used after appellate review is
   complete to promulgate a convening authority‘s action and/or reflect modifications of
   findings and sentence. In addition, use a final order after withdrawal of appellate review and
   when the proceedings are abated upon the death of an accused during appellate review. A
   final order should reflect the post-trial and appellate history of the case, including actions
   taken by the convening authority, the appellate courts, SECAF and TJAG. Ensure that the
   GCMCA orders execute all dishonorable or bad conduct discharges, while SECAF orders
   execute all dismissals. RCM 1113(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2). In cases involving re-hearings, the
   final order reflects only modifications of the findings and sentence occurring after
   publication of the rehearing promulgating order.
   10.9.6. International Hold Situations. When the accused is overseas and being retained in a
   foreign country because of pending foreign criminal proceedings, consult AFJI 51-706,
   Status of Forces Policies, Procedures and Information, before issuing a CMO. This includes
   any order ordering the sentence executed; an initial order where Article 71, UCMJ, does not
   require further review before it may be ordered executed; or a supplemental order after
   completion of appellate action when the latter is required. See also AFI 51-703, Foreign
   Criminal Jurisdiction.
 188                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   10.9.7. Supplementary Orders When the Accused May Be Adjudged Two Punitive
   Discharges. An accused cannot be discharged twice from the same enlistment. If an accused
   has an approved punitive discharge from one court-martial and is facing another court-
   martial which may adjudge a more severe punitive discharge, execute the sentence from the
   first court-martial, except the discharge. If the accused receives a dishonorable discharge in
   the second court-martial after receiving a bad conduct discharge in the first court-martial,
   execute the dishonorable discharge after final appellate review of the second court-martial. If
   the approved sentence of the second court-martial includes a bad conduct discharge or no
   punitive discharge, do not delay execution of the first punitive discharge solely to wait for
   appellate review of the second court-martial. If the accused is discharged using the second
   punitive discharge, a supplementary order for the first court-martial must address the first
   discharge (e.g., the bad conduct discharge will not be executed because the accused was
   previously discharged in GCMO No. 1, this headquarters, dated 1 June 2003).
10.10. Corrected Copies.
   10.10.1. Do not amend CMOs. Issue a corrected copy to correct errors in the heading and
   close, the body of the order, the announcement of the proceedings, the action taken, and
   errors in typing or printing that make the order ambiguous. To correct a CMO, include the
   deleted matter with a line through it and leave it legible. If the correction is an addition,
   underscore the added matters. If the correction is a substitution, include both the deleted and
   the added matter, with the former lined out and the latter underscored. Identify it as a
   corrected copy in the heading. The order number and date of the corrected copy remains the
   same as the original order. In the event additional corrections are required, the heading must
   reflect that the order is the second, third, etc., corrected copy. Incorporate changes from a
   previous corrected copy by deleting the language lined through and retaining the added
   language without the underscore. See Figure 10.4.
   10.10.2. Do not issue a corrected copy in any case in which a convening authority or
   reviewing authority withdraws an action and substitutes a new one. Prepare a new CMO
   rescinding the initial order. See Figure 10.8.
10.11. Distribution and Number of Copies. List recipients of the CMO distribution and the
number of copies beginning two spaces below the authentication signature element at the left
margin. Include the complete mailing address. For the most current distribution list see Figure
10.9 (NOTE: DO NOT mail additional copies of the CMO to AFLOA/JAJM because the copies
inserted in the record of trial are sufficient for what is required.)
10.12. Retention and Disposition of Original CMOs. SJAs are responsible for retaining the
original of their headquarters' CMOs and retiring the record sets in annual blocks in accordance
with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-3.
10.13. Disposition of Stamped Orders. When orders are examined and noted as legally
sufficient under Article 64(a), UCMJ, permanently place 4 copies with an original signature in
the ROT. Make distribution in accordance with paragraphs 11.4.4. and 10.12.

                                           Chapter 11

  APPEALS AND REVIEWS, REHEARINGS, RETRIALS, DUBAY HEARINGS AND
                           CLEMENCY

Section 11A— General Information

11.1. Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Include an AF Form 304, Request for
Appellate Defense Counsel, signed by the accused in every ROT forwarded for review by the Air
Force Court of Criminal Appeals or forwarded to The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) for
examination. AFMAN 51-203, Figure 4.1. The accused's trial defense counsel assists the
accused in filling out the form, obtains the accused's signature and submits it to the trial counsel
or appropriate SJA as soon as practicable after sentence announcement. The AF Form 304
provides the accused's preferred mailing address (appellate leave address, etc.) for all appellate
review correspondence when the accused is not in a confinement facility. An address must be
provided even if the accused waives appellate review.
   11.1.1. If an accused‘s death sentence by a court-martial has been approved by the President
   pursuant to Article 71, UCMJ, and the accused seeks to file a post-conviction habeas corpus
   petition in Federal civilian court concerning his/her court-martial, the accused may request a
   military defense counsel from The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). Upon receipt of the
   accused‘s request, TJAG will detail military counsel under Article 70(e), UCMJ, to represent
   the accused in such proceedings and any appeals there from.
11.2. Withdrawal of Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Use the following format to
withdraw a request for appellate defense counsel:
I consulted with my [military trial defense counsel] [civilian defense counsel], (insert counsel's
name), and have been advised of the action taken by the court-martial convening authority in my
case. I received a copy of my record of trial for review. I am aware of my right to representation
by appellate counsel. I hereby withdraw the request for appellate counsel executed by me on
(insert date).

The accused may also decline appellate representation by checking the appropriate box on the
AF Form 304. If the accused declines appellate representation, forward only the original ROT
to AFLOA/JAJM for appellate review.
11.3. Waiver or Withdrawal of Appellate Review. If an accused wishes to waive or withdraw
from appellate review, the procedures outlined in RCM 1110 must be followed. The request to
waive or withdraw from appellate review must be filed after the convening authority takes
action. The waiver or withdrawal of appellate review should be accomplished on a DD Form
2330, Waiver/Withdrawal of Appellate Rights in General and Special Courts-Martial Subject to
Review by a Court of Military Review, or DD Form 2331, Waiver/ Withdrawal of Appellate
Rights in General Courts-Martial Subject to Examination in the Office of the Judge Advocate
General. MCM, Appendix 19 & 20. Waiver or withdrawal of appellate review bars review by
the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals and by TJAG under Article 69(a). It does not prevent
later submission of an Article 69(b) application. An Article 64(a) review is required for special
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   203


and general courts-martial where an accused waives appellate review. See Section 11B below
for additional information.

Section 11B— Article 64(a), UCMJ, Judge Advocate Reviews (RCM 1112)

11.4. Article 64(a) Review (RCM 1112). An Article 64(a), UCMJ, review is required in three
types of cases: 1) all SPCMs or GCMs in which the accused waived or withdrew from appellate
review under RCM 1110; 2) in any SPCM in which the approved sentence does not include a
bad conduct discharge; and, 3) in all SCMs. A judge advocate appointed by the SJA of the
officer exercising GCMCA over the accused at the time of trial conducts the review. No review
is required if the accused is found not guilty of all offenses, the convening authority disapproved
all findings of guilty or the accused is found not guilty for all offenses only because of lack of
mental responsibility for all offenses.
   11.4.1. The Article 64(a) review conforms to the requirements of RCM 1112. Indicate
   compliance with Article 64(a) with a stamped or typed notation signed and dated by the
   reviewing officer on the cover of the first volume of all copies of the ROT and on all copies
   of the court-martial order. Only the original cover and court-martial order must have an
   original signature, the others may be mechanically reproduced.
   11.4.2. If all judge advocates on the GCM convening authority's staff are disqualified from
   conducting such a review or the GCM convening authority is disqualified from taking any
   required action on the case, the MAJCOM SJA will select another GCM convening authority
   and SJA to perform the review and take any required action. If there is no eligible convening
   authority in the command, or if the major commander is the convening authority, the
   MAJCOM SJA may request another MAJCOM commander to act or to designate a
   commander exercising GCM convening authority within that other MAJCOM to take action
   on the case. If agreement cannot be reached between MAJCOMs, contact AFLOA/JAJM for
   assistance in identifying an officer exercising GCM convening authority to act on the case.
   11.4.3. Form and Content of the Review
       11.4.3.1. Reviews of summary courts-martial will contain only those matters required by
       RCM 1112(d). In those cases in which no corrective action is required by the convening
       authority, the review will consist of a stamped or typed entry on the cover of volume one
       of the original ROT, on two copies of the ROT, and on the back of the DD Form 2329,
       Record of Trial by Summary Court-Martial. The entry shall be entitled, "Article 64(a),
       UCMJ, Review" and shall consist of the conclusions required in RCM 1112(d)(1), the
       command of reviewer, the date, signature of the reviewer, and the reviewer's signature
       block.
       11.4.3.2. In those GCM and SPCM cases where no allegations of error have been
       asserted by the accused and no corrective action is required by the convening authority,
       the review will consist of a stamped or typed entry on the cover of volume one of the
       original ROT, on two copies of the ROT, and on the court-martial orders. The entry shall
       be entitled, "Article 64(a), UCMJ, Review" and shall consist of the conclusions required
       in RCM 1112(d)(1), the command of the reviewer, the date, signature of the reviewer,
       and the reviewer's signature block. If the approved sentence includes a bad-conduct or
204                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


      dishonorable discharge, the general court-martial convening authority personally signs
      the supplementary order executing the punitive discharge. Figure 10.7.
      11.4.3.3. In GCM and SPCM cases where the review addresses allegations of error by
      the accused, but no corrective action of the convening authority is required; the review
      will be prepared in writing, dated and signed by the reviewer, will cover the matters
      required by RCM 1112(d)(1) and (2), and will include a statement that the findings and
      sentence are correct in law and fact. The review will be attached to the ROT. The cover
      (DD Form 490) of volume one and all copies of the court-martial order will be annotated
      with a typed or stamped notation consisting of the date, signature block, the command of
      the reviewer, and a statement that Article 64(a), UCMJ, has been complied with.
      11.4.3.4. When the officer exercising GCM jurisdiction over the accused at the time the
      court-martial was convened is required to take corrective or further action under Article
      64, UCMJ, and RCM 1112(e), the judge advocate's review will be in writing, dated and
      signed by the reviewer, and will address the matters required in RCM 1112(d)(1), (2),
      and (3) as well as whether the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact. After the
      convening authority takes action, the review and action will be included in the ROT. The
      cover (DD Form 490) of volume one and all copies of the court-martial order will be
      annotated with a typed or stamped notation consisting of the date, the signature of the
      reviewer, a statement that Article 64, UCMJ, has been complied with, the reviewer's
      command, and the reviewer's signature block.
         11.4.3.4.1. In cases where the review stated that corrective action was required as a
         matter of law, and the convening authority refused to take action that was at least as
         favorable to the accused as that recommended by the reviewer, the ROT, review and
         action of the convening authority shall be transmitted to TJAG through
         AFLOA/JAJM for review under Article 69(b), UCMJ. RCM 1112(g) and Appendix
         16(33).
         11.4.3.4.2. If the officer taking action under Article 64, UCMJ, orders a rehearing,
         the ROT, action and court-martial order will be sent to the officer who convened the
         court-martial. That officer will determine whether a rehearing is practicable. See
         Section 11F. If a rehearing is to be held and the accused has been transferred to
         another command, the officer who convened the court-martial will make
         arrangements for the rehearing with the coordination of the officer presently
         exercising SPCM jurisdiction over the accused.
      11.4.3.5. Except cases requiring Article 69, UCMJ, review under RCM 1112(g),
      Secretarial action under Article 71, UCMJ, or rehearings, cases are final under Article 76,
      UCMJ, upon completion of the judge advocate's review and any required action by the
      GCM convening authority. The GCM convening authority's action may execute all
      unexecuted portions of the sentence except those portions requiring Secretarial approval
      under Article 71, UCMJ.
         11.4.3.5.1. If the GCMCA orders a rehearing, forward the review, ROT, action, and
         court-martial order to the convening authority that convened the court-martial. This
         convening authority determines whether a rehearing is practicable.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  205


   11.4.4. Distribution of Article 64(a) Reviews. After completing the Article 64(a) review
   and, when applicable, any action by the GCMCA under RCM 1112(f), forward the original
   ROT and four copies of the court-martial order and any supplementary orders to
   AFLOA/JAJM indicating compliance with Article 64(a) as stated in paragraph 11.4.3.
   Provide one copy each of the annotated court-martial order indicating compliance with
   Article 64(a) to each addressee as required by paragraph 10.11, as applicable.

Section 11C— Article 69 Review, UCMJ

11.5. Article 69(a) Review, UCMJ (RCM 1201(b)(1)). The ROT in each GCM that is not
otherwise reviewed under Article 66 shall be examined in the Office of The Judge Advocate
General if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to
appellate review under Article 61.
   11.5.1. Submission of Matters by the Accused. The accused may submit matters for TJAG‘s
   consideration. Any matters must be submitted directly to AFLOA/JAJM on or before the
   thirtieth (30) day after the date the GCMCA approved the sentence, unless the accused
   establishes good cause for not filing matters within that time. Submissions must meet the
   requirements of paragraph 11.6.3.
   11.5.2. Notification of Article 69(a) Examination Results. AFLOA/JAJM notifies the
   convening authority's SJA of the examination results. If TJAG does not direct a review by
   the AFCCA, AFLOA/JAJM forwards a copy of the initial promulgating order to the
   convening authority‘s SJA, reflecting the results of the review. AFLOA/JAJM serves one
   copy of the order upon the accused and obtains a receipt for it. If the defense counsel's name
   and address is included in matters submitted by the accused, AFLOA/JAJM sends a copy of
   the results to the defense counsel.
   11.5.3. Other Action by TJAG. If TJAG orders a rehearing, the procedures in Section 11F
   will apply. If TJAG forwards the case for review by AFCCA, the GCMCA‘s SJA will, upon
   request, send two copies of the ROT to AFLOA/JAJM.
11.6. Application for Relief under Article 69(b), UCMJ (RCM 1201(b)(3)). The Judge
Advocate General may vacate or modify the findings or sentence, or both, reassess the sentence,
or set aside the findings or sentence and order a rehearing of a court-martial case which has
become final in law but has not been reviewed by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals
(AFCCA) or TJAG. RCM 1201(b). This applies to GCMs, SPCMs, and SCMs including those
cases forwarded under RCM 1112(g)(1). The findings or sentence, or both, may be reviewed on
any ground specified in RCM 1201(b)(3)(A). Review of a finding of not guilty, only by reason
of lack of mental responsibility, under this rule may not extend to the determination of lack of
mental responsibility. RCM 1201(b)(3)(A), Discussion.
   11.6.1. Prerequisite of Finality of Review. An application may not be filed and will not be
   reviewed under Article 69(b), UCMJ, unless the convening authority has taken action, and a
   judge advocate completed the review and any other action required by Article 64, UCMJ.
   11.6.2. Submission of Application. The member sends the application directly to
   AFLOA/JAJM, and it is considered filed when received by that office.
       11.6.2.1. If the application concerns a trial by SCM with action taken before 1 Jul 96, the
       GCMCA‘s SJA obtains the ROT, and any other statements, documents, matters admitted,
 206                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       or, in the alternative, summaries of the substance of such evidence, from the SJA for the
       installation at which the trial was held and forwards all the documents to AFLOA/JAJM.
   11.6.3. Contents of Application. Figure 11.1 is a sample format for applications. In all
   cases, the application must be written and signed by the accused, or the applicant's legal
   representative, under oath or affirmation. Defense counsel does not receive a copy of TJAG's
   action, unless counsel's name is on the application. The application must also contain:
       11.6.3.1. The accused's name, social security number, and present mailing address;
       11.6.3.2. The date and place of trial and type of court-martial;
       11.6.3.3. The sentence of the court as approved and any subsequent reduction by
       clemency or otherwise;
       11.6.3.4. A succinct statement of the specific relief requested and the specific grounds
       for the relief (a concise brief of the applicable law with appropriate citations is
       encouraged); and
       11.6.3.5. Any documentary or other evidence pertinent to the facts asserted under the
       specific grounds alleged, including copies of the court-martial order, if available.
       11.6.3.6. The application must be notarized.

Section 11D— Review by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), the United
States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (USCAAF) and the United States Supreme
Court

11.7. Briefs and Affidavits to Support Arguments of Error Filed. If an assignment of error
is advanced concerning matters outside the ROT or allied papers, affidavits or other documents
may support the assigned error. These papers should be attached to and forwarded with the
assigned error. Briefs submitted in support of assigned errors should be signed by the person
preparing them.
11.8. AFCCA Review (RCM 1203). AFCCA reviews cases referred to it by TJAG under RCM
1201(a) or (b)(1).
   11.8.1. Notification of the AFCCA's Decision. AFCCA‘s decision is transmitted to the
   accused directly from AFLOA/JAJM or through the officer exercising GCM convening
   authority over the accused. The GCMCA‘s SJA is responsible for delivery of the decision to
   the accused. (Except for cases where personal service is used, the decision should not be
   forwarded to the SPCM for delivery to the accused.) The transmittal letter to the GCMCA
   contains specific instructions for delivery to the accused and must be returned by
   indorsement to AFLOA/JAJM with the accused's receipt of the AFCCA‘s decision or proof
   of transmittal of the decision to the accused by first class restricted delivery, certified mail.
   These documents become part of the permanent records of the case and must be handled
   carefully and returned promptly.
       11.8.1.1. The accused may petition the USCAAF for review of AFCCA‘s decision
       within 60 days from the earlier of:
          11.8.1.1.1. The date the accused is personally notified of AFCCA‘s decision; or
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   207


           11.8.1.1.2. The date a copy of AFCCA‘s decision, after being served on appellate
           defense counsel, is deposited in the United States mails for delivery by first class
           certified mail to the accused at an address provided by the accused or at the last
           known address listed for the accused in the accused's official service record. Article
           67(c), UCMJ.
   11.8.2. Action Following Receipt of AFCCA‘s Decision. AFLOA/JAJM must notify the
   accused's current GCMCA‘s SJA when the accused petitions USCAAF for review or if a
   timely petition of review is not filed. The notice will include appropriate instructions for
   further processing. A final supplementary court-martial order will not be promulgated, nor
   will the accused be discharged, until these instructions are received. Delay of final action in
   a case is sometimes necessary for a number of reasons, including consideration of clemency
   under Article 74, UCMJ.
11.9. USCAAF Review (RCM 1204). USCAAF reviews the record in all cases: in which the
sentence, as affirmed by AFCCA, extends to death; reviewed by AFCCA which TJAG orders
sent to USCAAF for review; and reviewed by AFCCA, except those referred to it by TJAG
under RCM 1201(b)(1), in which, upon petition by the accused and on good cause shown,
USCAAF has granted a review.
   11.9.1. Petition for Review by the Accused. The Rules of Practice and Procedure,
   USCAAF, provide the formats for filing, either personally or through counsel, petitions for
   grant of review under Article 67(b) (3), UCMJ.
       11.9.1.1. A petition may be filed at any time after the decision of the Air Force Court of
       Criminal Appeals has been released, but within 60 days of the date the accused is notified
       of that decision or an alternate service is made. A petition is considered filed on the date
       the accused mails or delivers the petition to the court.
       11.9.1.2. Upon receipt of a copy of a petition for grant of review filed by an accused not
       represented by military appellate defense counsel, TJAG will appoint counsel to represent
       the accused, unless the accused is already represented by civilian counsel and has
       expressly waived representation by appointed military appellate defense counsel.
       11.9.1.3. Normally, the accused makes the decision to petition the court after receipt of
       AFCCA‘s ruling and after having received the advice of counsel as to the merits of such a
       petition. RCM 1204(b).
11.10. Petition for Supreme Court Review by Writ of Certiorari. Petitions for Supreme
Court review by writ of certiorari may be filed by the accused or the United States in those cases
specified in Article 67a(a) and RCM 1205(a). Such petitions will be filed according to the rules
of the Supreme Court of the United States.
   11.10.1. Military appellate defense counsel may assist the accused in preparing a petition for
   writ of certiorari and provide representation before the Supreme Court when requested by the
   accused.
   11.10.2. When requested to do so by the Attorney General of the United States, TJAG will
   appoint appellate government counsel to represent the United States in any cases filed under
   Article 67a above.

Section 11E—Petitions for New Trial (RCM 1210).

11.11. Petition for New Trial. Petitions for new trial are prepared and processed under RCM
1210, and are filed with AFLOA/JAJM on behalf of The Judge Advocate General. A petition for
new trial may be submitted because of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court in any
kind of court-martial within two years after approval of the sentence by the convening authority.
   11.11.1. General Information. The petition must be in writing and contain the matters
   required by RCM 1210(c). When practicable, the petition should be typewritten and double-
   spaced. The petition will be signed under oath or affirmation by the petitioner, a person
   possessing the power of attorney of the petitioner for that purpose, or a person with the
   authorization of an appropriate court of law to sign the petition as the petitioner's
   representative. The member forwards the original and two copies of the petition and
   supporting documentation directly to AFLOA/JAJM. An accused may submit only one
   petition for new trial for the same reason within the two-year limitation period.
   11.11.2. Forwarding Copy of the Petition.
       11.11.2.1. If the petitioner's case is pending before the AFCCA, AFLOA/JAJM shall
       forward these documents to the court: the original petition, two copies of the petition,
       copies of each supporting document, and any prepared briefs. AFLOA/JAJM shall also
       forward a copy of the petition and all documents to appellate defense and appellate
       government counsel. RCM 1210(e); AFCCA Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 22.
       11.11.2.2. If the petitioner's case is pending before USCAAF, AFLOA/JAJM shall
       forward these documents to the court: the original petition, seven copies of the petition,
       copies of each supporting document and any prepared briefs. AFLOA/JAJM shall also
       forward a copy of the petition and all documents to both appellate defense and appellate
       government counsel. RCM 1210(e); USCAAF Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 29.
   11.11.3. TJAG Review of the Petition. If the petitioner's case is not pending before a court,
   TJAG or the officer(s) designated by TJAG shall review the petition. Upon request by the
   designated officer(s), TJAG shall appoint appellate defense counsel and appellate
   government counsel to act in the case. Upon such appointment, the designated officer(s)
   shall forward one copy of the petition and all documents to each appellate counsel. The
   designated officer(s) may direct appellate defense and government counsel to provide briefs
   in the case and upon written request or, if the designated officer(s) deem(s) it appropriate,
   may order oral arguments to be presented before the officer(s).
       11.11.3.1. Process for Filing Briefs Requiring TJAG Review of the Petition.
           11.11.3.1.1. Form and Number of Briefs. Briefs are to be typewritten, double spaced
           on letter size white paper in an original and three copies. Counsel shall be limited to
           filing one brief per side unless TJAG or the designated officer(s) reviewing the
           petition otherwise permit(s).
           11.11.3.1.2. Time for Filing. The brief on behalf of the petitioner shall be filed with
           AFLOA/JAJM within 20 days after appellate defense counsel has been appointed by
           TJAG and a copy of the petition and supporting documents have been provided
           counsel. Appellate government counsel may file a brief within 20 days the
           petitioner‘s brief has been filed. If counsel for the petitioner has filed no brief,
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    209


           appellate government counsel will file a brief within 20 days after expiration of the
           time allowed for the filing of a brief on behalf of the petitioner. Upon written request,
           the time for filing briefs by either counsel may be extended at the discretion of TJAG
           or the designated officer(s) reviewing the petition.
       11.11.3.2. Oral Arguments. If ordered by the designated officer(s), oral arguments shall
       be heard after written briefs have been filed.
           11.11.3.2.1. Notice. The designated officer(s) shall give appellate counsel at least 10
           days notice of the time and place of oral arguments.
           11.11.3.2.2. Time Limits. No more than 30 minutes on each side shall be allowed for
           oral arguments unless the time is extended by the designated officer(s).
           11.11.3.2.3. Number of Counsel; Opening and Closing. The designated officer(s)
           may limit the number of counsel making an oral argument. The counsel for the
           petitioner has the right to make opening and closing arguments.
           11.11.3.2.4. Failure to Appear. If appellate counsel fails to appear at the time and
           place set for oral argument may be regarded as a waiver thereof and the designated
           officer(s) may proceed on the case as submitted without argument or may continue
           the case for argument at a later date, giving due notice thereof.
           11.11.3.2.5. Presence of Petitioner. The petitioner does not have a right to be present
           at the time of oral arguments before the designated officer(s).
       11.11.3.3. Opinion and Action. A memorandum opinion and an action shall be prepared
       by the designated officer(s) for consideration by TJAG. After the action has been signed,
       AFLOA/JAJM, shall cause a copy thereof to be served on petitioner and shall take such
       action as may be necessary to carry out the orders of TJAG as contained in the action.

Section 11F— Rehearings and Other Remedial Actions

11.12. Cases Remanded by the Appellate Courts. When a decision of the Supreme Court,
USCAAF, or AFCCA directs or authorizes further proceedings, such as a rehearing, a limited
hearing, or a new action by the convening authority (CA), reasonable efforts must be made to
locate the accused and provide the accused with a copy of the decision. Further proceedings in
AFCCA cases need not be delayed, however, solely to permit an accused to petition for a grant
of review or otherwise appeal the matter. Any special instructions deemed necessary to carry out
the mandate of the Court will be transmitted by AFLOA/JAJM with the remanded ROT.
   11.12.1. Pursuant to Article 76(a), an accused may only be placed on involuntary appellate
   leave when the approved sentence includes a punitive discharge. When an appellate court
   sets aside the action or the sentence, the accused should be taken off of appellate leave.
   Figure 11.2.
11.13. Procedure When Rehearing is Authorized (RCM 810). When an order of a reviewing
or convening authority, an order of TJAG, a decision of AFCCA, a mandate issued by USCAAF,
or a judgment of the Supreme Court authorizes a rehearing on the findings or sentence, the
following procedures apply:
210                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


  11.13.1. Notification of the Convening Authority and Identification of the Responsible
  Convening Authority. AFLOA/JAJM, or the Article 64, UCMJ, reviewing officer, as
  appropriate, sends a transmittal letter, and a copy of the pertinent decision, mandate, or order
  to the original convening authority‘s SJA (or the current CA if the original CA no longer
  exists). If the accused is no longer within the command of the original convening authority, a
  courtesy copy will be forwarded to the accused's current CA with jurisdiction to convene the
  type of court-martial involved.
      11.13.1.1. The original court-martial convening authority is the CA who approved the
      accused‘s sentence. The original CA is the responsible convening authority if the
      accused is still under his or her jurisdiction.
      11.13.1.2. If the accused is no longer under the jurisdiction of the original CA, the
      original CA decides whether to remain the responsible CA or transfer his or her
      responsibilities for the case to the officer presently exercising authority over the accused
      to convene the type of court-martial involved. If transferred, the current CA becomes the
      responsible CA.
         11.13.1.2.1. If the original CA remains the responsible CA and determines that a
         rehearing should be held, he or she will request that the accused be returned for the
         purpose of rehearing or will reach an understanding as to situs with the officer
         presently exercising court-martial convening authority over the accused or with
         another officer exercising court martial convening authority.
      11.13.1.3. If the original CA no longer exists, the accused‘s current CA, exercising
      authority over the accused to convene the type of court-martial involved, is the
      responsible CA.
  11.13.2. Receipt of Decision and Speedy Trial Clock. Receipt of decision by the original
  CA‘s (or the current CA if the original CA no longer exists) SJA triggers the speedy trial
  clock for both rehearings on findings and rehearings on sentence only. In a sentence-only
  rehearing, an accused is ―brought to trial‖ at the first Article 39a session. U.S. v. Becker, 53
  MJ 229 (CAAF 2000); RCM 707(b)(3)(D).
  11.13.3. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs
  or authorizes further proceedings, the responsible convening authority‘s SJA must make
  reasonable efforts to locate and provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a
  copy of the document requiring additional action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
  11.13.4. Action. The responsible CA should ensure action is taken consistent with the post-
  trial directions from the reviewing or appellate authority. The responsible CA will publish a
  supplementary court-martial order indicating either:
      11.13.4.1. A rehearing is ordered before another court-martial to be designated. See
      Figure 10.5 for sample language for rehearing on sentence]; or
      11.13.4.2. If a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, that the sentence has been set-
      aside and a sentence of no punishment is approved; or
      11.13.4.3. If a rehearing on findings is impracticable, that the findings of guilt and the
      sentence have been set aside and the charges are dismissed.
  11.13.5. Ensure appropriate coordination is made with all counsel, and military judge.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  211


   11.13.6. Sentence Reassessment. When partial findings have been approved and a rehearing
   as to other offenses and the sentence ordered, the convening authority may, if specifically
   authorized by either AFCCA or USCAAF, reassess the sentence based on the approved
   findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges, if any. RCM. 1107(e)(1)(B)(iii),
   Discussion.
11.14. Referral. Whether re-referring the matter to a rehearing in full or for a limited purpose
ensure that the following actions are accomplished:
   11.14.1. The responsible CA directs the rehearing. This may be done at any location the
   convening authority determines to be appropriate. If the rehearing is held at a location
   requiring the accused to travel, the accused should be placed on TDY. See Figure 6.8.
   11.14.2. A military judge is detailed. The military judge may be the same as in the original
   trial or a new one may be detailed.
   11.14.3. A new convening order is published with all new members.
   11.14.4. A new referral indorsement in same form as on page 2 of the Charge Sheet, DD
   Form 458, is completed following normal rules of referral.
       11.14.4.1. The appropriate instructions concerning the rehearing are incorporated on the
       referral form.
       11.14.4.2. The new referral is attached to the original referral. (See 4.9)
11.15. Record of Trial and Post-Rehearing Concerns.
   11.15.1. The original ROT and any copies must remain intact, except for documents needed
   for reintroduction at rehearing, such as the charge sheet and exhibits, if required.
   11.15.2. Any documents withdrawn from the original ROT and used at the rehearing should
   be substituted in the record and all copies with a description of the document, reasons for
   withdrawal, and new location of the document should be included. Do not withdraw the
   original copies of a decision of a court, action of a convening authority, post-trial review or
   recommendation, pretrial advice, and Article 32 report of investigation.
   11.15.3. If the accused served confinement resulting from the original trial, the convening
   authority‘s new action must reflect that the accused will be credited for the time served.
   11.15.4. The promulgating order must indicate the case is a rehearing. See Figure 10.5.
   11.15.5. The record of the rehearing is a separate volume from the original ROT. Place the
   record of rehearing on top of the original ROT. Other volumes are renumbered as
   appropriate.
   11.15.6. A verbatim transcript is required for a rehearing proceeding. Forward the original
   and two copies of the verbatim rehearing record, along with the original ROT, to
   AFLOA/JAJM.
11.16. DuBay Hearing. A DuBay hearing is a post-trial hearing ordered by an appellate court
for the limited purpose of obtaining further evidence on a matter under consideration by the
court. While the MCM does not explicitly address this type of limited fact-finding hearing,
DuBay procedure is a well-established means to address an ambiguity or omission in the record;
or to dispose of a claim of error before necessary witnesses disperse, memories fade, or
 212                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


witnesses became unavailable. United States v. DuBay, 37 C.M.R. 411 (C.M.A. 1967). DuBay
hearings on various matters may be directed by the CAAF, AFCCA, convening and supervisory
authorities, or the detailed military judge on his or her own motion prior to authentication of the
ROT, so long as the subject of the proceeding is "one that can be verified without material
prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused." U. S. v. Brickey, 16 M.J. 258 (C.M.A. 1983).
The following procedures apply when a DuBay hearing is ordered:
   11.16.1. Notification of Convening Authority. AFLOA/JAJM sends a letter of transmittal
   and a copy of the pertinent mandate or order to the SJA of the convening authority who
   exercised such authority over the accused at the time of the trial (or the current CA if the
   original CA no longer exists). If the accused is no longer within the command of the original
   convening authority, a courtesy copy will be forwarded to the accused's current CA who has
   the authority to convene the type of court-martial involved.
       11.16.1.1. The responsible CA, as identified in 11.13.1, must ensure action is taken
       consistent with the post-trial directions from the authority directing the DuBay hearing.
       The responsible CA will publish a supplementary court-martial order reflecting post-trial
       action on the case.
       11.16.1.2. Receipt of Decision and Time Standards. There are no formal time standards
       for completion of the hearing, however the matter should be expedited as appellate
       review is pending. Additionally, the appellate court directing the hearing generally
       specifies a date by which the process must be completed. Any time extension requests
       require coordination with AFLOA/JAJG through AFLOA/JAJM.
   11.16.2. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs
   a DuBay hearing, the responsible convening authority‘s SJA must make reasonable efforts to
   locate and provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a copy of the document
   requiring additional action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
       11.16.2.1. The accused should be returned to active duty status for the limited purpose of
       participating in the DuBay hearing. Figure 11.3.
       11.16.2.2. Appointment Letter. The SJA prepares a letter for the responsible CA to sign
       directing the DuBay hearing to take place. Figure 11.4.
   11.16.3. Detail of a Military Judge. After appropriate coordination, the SJA drafts a letter
   for the convening authority requesting a military judge be detailed and directing a hearing
   date to be scheduled. A military judge is detailed to a DuBay hearing in the same manner as
   detailed to any court-martial.
   11.16.4. DuBay hearings are conducted in accordance with Article 39(a), UCMJ.
   11.16.5. Exhibits. Number items admitted as evidence at the hearing numerically, beginning
   with "Hearing Exhibit 1."
   11.16.6. Record of Hearing and Post Hearing Action. Prepare a verbatim record of the
   hearing, unless otherwise directed by the authority ordering the hearing. Authenticate the
   transcript of the hearing in the same format as required for ROTs. Return the original ROT
   and the original DuBay transcript and two copies of the DuBay transcript to AFLOA/JAJM.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 213


Section 11G— Remission and Suspension Under Article 74, UCMJ

11.17. General Information. After the action is published or the accused has been officially
notified of the action, the SECAF has the authority to remit or suspend any part or amount of the
unexecuted part of any sentence, except one approved by the President, unless the SECAF
delegated such authority in this section.
   11.17.1. The term "unexecuted part of a sentence" includes that part which has been
   approved and ordered executed but which has not been carried out (e.g., punitive discharges
   or dismissals not ordered into execution, unserved confinement, hard labor without
   confinement or restriction, and uncollected forfeitures).
11.18. Authority Reserved to the SECAF. Only the SECAF may remit or suspend, any part or
amount of the unexecuted part of the sentences listed below. This limitation does not apply to
the convening authority's powers under RCM 1107; Article 60, UCMJ.
   11.18.1. Any sentence of a person convicted by a military tribunal, under SECAF‘s
   jurisdiction, resulting from the President's commutation of a sentence of death to a lesser
   punishment (RCM 1206 (b)(3);
   11.18.2. Any sentence the SECAF approved and ordered into execution;
   11.18.3. A dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad conduct discharge that is imposed for
   the conviction of an offense when a sentence to death is authorized by the MCM;
   11.18.4. Those referred to the SECAF for action by commanders authorized to exercise
   Article 74, UCMJ. Commanders are encouraged to forward to AFLOA/JAJR for SECAF
   decision those cases involving issues most appropriate for resolution at the Air Force policy
   level.
11.19. Authority of TJAG. TJAG may exercise SECAF authority under Article 74(a), UCMJ,
and remit or suspend in whole or in part any unexecuted part of a sentence, with the exception of
those cases specified in 11.17. The Director, USAF Judiciary, may act for TJAG to remit or
suspend up to 90 days of an approved sentence to confinement.
11.20. Authority of the Accused's Commander. Except in cases listed in 11.17 and 11.18, the
commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial of the kind which
adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part or amount of the unexecuted part of an
accused‘s sentence adjudged by a summary court-martial or a SPCM, except for a BCD,
regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the sentence.
   11.20.1. A commander exercising only SPCMCA over the command to which the accused is
   assigned may not remit a BCD, but may suspend a BCD only in the initial action.
   11.20.2. A commander exercising GCMCA over the command to which the accused is
   assigned may remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence
   except in cases listed in paragraph 11.17.
   11.20.3. If the accused is transferred to a Level II Regional Confinement Facility or a long-
   term corrections facility, as defined in AFI 31-205, or to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and
   the accused has been assigned to HQ AFSFC/SFC, this authority will be exercised only by
   the Commander, AFDW, the officer exercising GCMCA over Air Force personnel in those
   institutions.
 214                              AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


11.21. Publication of SECAF Actions under Article 74, UCMJ. Promulgate actions taken by

   AUTOMATED MILITARY JUSTICE ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
                            (AMJAMS)

Section 12A— General Information

12.1. Purpose. The purpose of AMJAMS is to collect data pertaining to investigations,
nonjudicial punishment imposed pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, trials by court-martial, and
related military justice activity. The information collected is required:
   12.1.1. To conduct statistical studies that measure disciplinary rates and trends and evaluate
   military justice involvement as it affects the quality of the force and the personnel needs of
   the service;
   12.1.2. To provide various management reports to judge advocate personnel at all levels;
   12.1.3. To provide statistical data to the Department of Defense concerning military justice;
   12.1.4. To provide raw data to the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS); and,
   12.1.5. To reply to inquiries concerning military justice.
12.2. Program Uses. AMJAMS collects detailed information on offenses and processing
timelines as well as demographic information on the participants in the judicial and nonjudicial
punishment process. The new improved management information from AMJAMS provides
effective management tools for use by Headquarters USAF, major commands, general and
special court-martial jurisdictions, the judiciary, and the appellate divisions. When used
properly, the information will assist in eliminating or highlighting excessive processing delays
and in monitoring the current status of military justice actions from the investigation stage
through to completion of the appellate process.
12.3. Policy. AMJAMS inputs are to be timely, complete, and accurate. Timely collecting,
reporting, and processing of military justice information is essential to staff judge advocates at
all levels. Inputs are to be completed as soon as possible after a military justice ―event‖ occurs
in a case, beginning with the Investigation Module. For the purpose of this Instruction, ―events‖
are defined as data fields in AMJAMS. If the data field is applicable to a case, an input should
be made as soon as the data is available. Refer to AMJAMS online Help Topics in the
AMJAMS client for detailed instructions on data entry. The data will be accurate at the time of
input and updated as the need arises.

Section 12B— Data Entry

12.4. Responsibilities.
   12.4.1. Base and GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for all
   AMJAMS data entry except appellate data.
       12.4.1.1. Paralegals are the primary individuals responsible for data entry. Attorneys are
       authorized edit rights, only after written approval from their MAJCOM staff judge
       advocates. This privilege is ONLY authorized on a case-by-case basis.
 220                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       12.4.1.2. GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for reviewing all
       AMJAMS inputs for completeness and accuracy except appellate data.
   12.4.2. JAJM and appellate court personnel are primarily responsible for data entry in the
   TJAG and appellate folders.

Section 12C— Investigations

12.5. Investigations. New cases should be opened in AMJAMS as investigations immediately
upon becoming aware of a potential Article 15, courts-martial, or circumstances reportable as a
special interest case.
   12.5.1. Special Interest Cases. If the case contains one of the qualifying criteria listed in
   Section 12E of this Instruction, designate the case as a special interest case by selecting
   ‗YES,‘ special interest reporting required. If the case is disposed of through an Article 15
   and falls within the reporting requirements of Section 12E, report the case to JAJM through
   AMJAMS until punishment is imposed. If the case is disposed of through court-martial and
   falls within the reporting requirements of Section 12E, report the case to JAJM through
   AMJAMS until sentence is announced or other terminating disposition. If the case does not
   qualify for special interest reporting to JAJM, but does meet MAJCOM or NAF special
   interest reporting requirements, select ‗YES‘ NAF/MAJCOM reporting required on the
   NAF/MAJCOM Reporting pane.
   12.5.2. Member data. This branch has seven tabs: Member, Race, Pay, Career, Duty Status,
   Prior Actions, and Commander. All of them are equally important and for the most part,
   self-explanatory. The information found in these tabs is automatically entered by AMJAMS
   from a file that is updated by AFPC monthly. These fields can be edited if changes have
   occurred in personal data since the AFPC update.
   12.5.3. Pending Offenses. All offenses and violations being investigated must be entered in
   this module regardless of jurisdiction. For civilian investigations, input offenses that closely
   coincide with the civilian code violations.
   12.5.4. Text Fields. Three text fields are provided for specific types of data. Information
   that is or should be entered in a specific field elsewhere in the database should not be entered
   in any text field.
       12.5.4.1. Current Case Status. Enter data describing the current status of the case. Valid
       data for this field may include information regarding situations that may delay or
       otherwise affect the processing of the case, i.e. ―Commander TDY until ______;
       Accused hospitalized until ______; Defense counsel unavailable until _______; etc.
       Enter a ―Current as of‖ date each time this field is updated.
       12.5.4.2. Case Notes. Legal offices may enter day-to-day notes in this field that provide
       useful information in the administrative processing of the case.
       12.5.4.3. Narrative Description. Enter enough information in sufficient detail to provide
       a clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved in the case (who, what,
       when, where, how) for each offense investigated. This field should be updated as
       significant events occur. Also, do not put any information in this field that could
       compromise an ongoing investigation.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                       221


   12.5.5. Investigation Personnel. The folder has three tabs – Defense Counsel, Investigation
   POC, and Base POC. Use the local look-up tables to add these persons under their affiliated
   tabs. If there is more than one counsel, add them as appropriate. When the investigation is
   converted to an Article 15 or court-martial, these names will copy down to Article 15
   personnel folder or trial personnel folder.
   12.5.6. Pretrial Restraint. If pretrial restraint is imposed on the member (military or
   civilian), add this folder and enter the type of restraint imposed, dates imposed, and date of
   the pretrial hearing if applicable.
   12.5.7. Case Disposition. Cases should be disposed of immediately upon the commander‘s
   determination of forum. For cases processed by civilian authorities, the cases will remain in
   the investigation status until resolution of alleged offenses.

Section 12D—-- Defense Incident Based Reporting System

12.6. DIBRS. In 1996 the Department of Defense (DoD) established a comprehensive database
called the ―Defense Incident-Based Reporting System (DIBRS)‖ to track criminal and other high
interest incidents involving personnel from ―cradle to grave.‖ The authority for this system is
DoD Directive 7730.47, 15 Oct 96 and its implementing guidance is DoD 7730.47-M, Manual
for Defense Incident-Based Reporting System. The system was designed to meet the reporting
requirements mandated by Congress in the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act of 1988; the
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994; and recurring requests for overall DoD law
enforcement data.
   12.6.1. DIBRS Reporting.          Within DIBRS there are eight reporting segments:
   administrative, offense, property, victim, offender/arrestee, commander‘s action, results of
   trial, and corrections. SF and AFOSI are primarily responsible for the segments and, in most
   cases, will initiate the reporting process when they receive a credible report of a criminal
   incident. JA is only responsible for the ―results of trial‖ segment. The data for this segment
   is gathered through the use of AMJAMS and most of it is already entered by a paralegal.
   There are, however, three additional DIBRS screens in AMJAMS that must now be
   completed for each court-martial.
       12.6.1.1. DIBRS Incident. Enter the offender ID, FBI Location number and Incident
       number in this section. Data for these three fields are obtained from the lead agency
       investigating the case.
       12.6.1.2. Miscellaneous. Enter the UIC that corresponds with the location of the court-
       martial and the UIC of the convening authority. Be aware that these codes may differ.
       Enter the promulgating order number and date of the order. If the investigated offenses
       resulted in disposition other than trial, indicate the disposition in the trial clearance field.
       Enter the number of days credited for pretrial confinement, and then enter the number of
       pretrial confinement days.
       12.6.1.3. Notification. Enter the number of victims and witnesses notified before and
       after trial.

Section 12E— Pretrial

12.7. Pretrial. All folders and corresponding fields that apply to a particular case must be
completed in their entirety. AMJAMS report criteria and logic may be dependent upon any
number of fields in AMJAMS and not necessarily those used at base or NAF level. It is
imperative for database integrity that the fields within the area of control at base and NAF level
be completed if applicable to the case.
   12.7.1. Folders. Add folders to the AMJAMS case tree as cases progress through the
   military justice process. Do not add folders that do not apply (e.g. If the member did not
   request IMDC, do not add that folder, etc.).
       12.7.1.1. Pretrial Information. This folder contains the Case Ready Date. The date is
       copied to this folder from the Investigation module and can only be edited in the
       Investigation module.
           12.7.1.1.1. Discharge Request. Annotate whether the member requested discharge in
           lieu of trial or for officers, resignation for the good of the service (RILO). If the
           member initially does not request discharge, but later changes his option, update the
           discharge fields using the same discharge folder to reflect the request and the action
           taken.
           12.7.1.1.2. Pretrial Restraint. The restraint folder may be added at any time the need
           arises. Add every instance of pretrial restraint, reflect all hearing dates, and the date
           restraint was terminated in this folder. If pretrial restraint does not terminate until the
           date of sentence or acquittal, the termination date will be entered automatically.
           12.7.1.1.3. Charges Preferred. Pending offenses from the Investigation module will
           be copied to the Charges Preferred folder. If an offense entered in Pending Offenses
           will not be preferred, delete that offense from Charges Preferred. If an offense will
           be added that was not in Pending Offenses, add the offense in the Charges Preferred
           module. Once an offense has been preferred, only AMJAMS Administrators can
           delete the preferral date and offense. After all applicable data is entered in the
           ‗Charges Preferred‘ module, print the Charge Sheet (DD Form 458) from AMJAMS.

           12.7.1.1.4. Special Offense Identifiers. Offenses requiring separate, individualized
           tracking have been assigned special offense identifiers. A list of the special offense
           identifiers can be found on the AMJAMS web page maintained by AFLOA/JAS. If
           the case involves offenses falling within the special offense category, please identify
           the offense by selecting the corresponding special offense identifier. A drop down
           list of potential identifiers is available for your convenience. Note: More than one
           special offense identifier may apply to each offense, i.e., 120-A, Rape, could use both
           ―40‖ sex offender registration and ―45‖ DNA processing required.
           12.7.1.1.5. Trial Personnel. Enter data pertaining to all trial participants in their
           respective categories (i.e., Defense Counsel, Trial Counsel, Court Reporter, etc.).
           Add as many participants as applicable, with the exception of the military judge. Use
           this tab first to reflect the military judge assigned to the case. If you need to add

Section 12I—- Time Management of Case Processing

12.15. In General. SJAs must give managerial attention to all time standards prescribed by the
MCM, statutes, case law, and regulations.
   12.15.1. Coordination with AFOSI. SJAs should develop local procedures with their
   servicing AFOSI detachment commander to coordinate with agents as early as possible in the
 228                             AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   investigative stages of the case to ensure limited investigative resources are focused on
   gathering relevant evidence in a timely manner.
   12.15.2. Time Management. Expeditious processing of courts-martial is essential to
   minimize disruptions in the Air Force mission, the lives of victims, witnesses, and the
   accused, and to minimize Air Force costs. The impartial and timely administration of
   military justice helps sustain good order and discipline. SJAs and chiefs of military justice,
   at all levels of command, should regularly analyze available AMJAMS data relating to each
   segment of court processing over which they have significant control to determine specific
   areas for improvement and implement appropriate management measures to maximize
   effectiveness and efficiency. The following Air Force court-martial metrics are established
   to assist in expediting the administration of justice.
       12.15.2.1. Convene 80% of all courts-martial (arraignment) on a Negotiated Trial Date
       within 45 days after the accused is served (RCM 602).
       12.15.2.2. Complete 80% of all general courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date)
       within 160 days.
       12.15.2.3. Complete 80% of all special courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date)
       within 75 days.
       12.15.2.4. Complete 80% of all summary courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action)
       within 30 days.
       12.15.2.5. Forward all court-martial ROTs to AFLOA/JAJM within 14 days of CA
       Action.
       12.15.2.6. Complete 80% of all Article 66, UCMJ, and appellate reviews within 270
       days (Date AFLOA/JAJM receives the ROT - AFCCA Decision Date).
   12.15.3. Staff judge advocates are expected to ensure expeditious processing of cases by
   closely monitoring reports and making improvements in areas where the military justice
   process lags unnecessarily.

                  MISCELLANEOUS MILITARY JUSTICE MATTERS

Section 13A— Staff Judge Advocate

13.1. Staff Judge Advocate-Title. Unless otherwise specified by TJAG, the senior officer of
TJAG's Corps on a commander's staff is designated the "Staff Judge Advocate" of that
command. All other judge advocate officers assigned to a command are designated "Assistant
Staff Judge Advocates." Use these titles for pretrial advice, post-trial recommendations and
court-martial orders. The Senior Assistant Staff Judge Advocate uses the title "Acting Staff
Judge Advocate" when the Staff Judge Advocate is absent or ineligible to act in a particular case.
In all other matters, titles such as "Deputy Staff Judge Advocate," "Chief, Military Justice
division," and "Executive Officer," may be used.
   13.1.1. Convening authorities may delegate military justice administrative duties to the Staff
   Judge Advocate (SJA) or any other attorney assigned to the servicing SJA's office. Figure
   13.1 is a sample delegation letter. In addition to the duties listed in Figure 13.1, convening
   authorities may delegate any other military justice administrative duties not expressly
   requiring convening authority action. When signing a military justice matter for the
   convening authority, use the signature element, "FOR THE COMMANDER."

Section 13C— Direct Communications and Reports

13.3. AFLOA/JAJM Requests for Information.
   13.3.1. In General. AFLOA/JAJM routinely receives inquiries concerning military justice
   actions against Air Force members and relies heavily on information from bases to answer
   the inquiries. A complete, accurate and timely response to requests for information is
   critical. Do not construe requests as criticism of case handling, nor view them as a mandate
   for particular action. AFLOA/JAJM may communicate directly with any organizational
   level. When providing information, send informational copies of replies to intermediate
   levels of command and through MAJCOM level to AFLOA/JAJM to ensure all are informed.
   13.3.2. All Responses. Respond to AFLOA/JAJM via e-mail directly to the requestor or to
   AFLOA/JAJMworkflow@pentagon.af.mil, or data facsimile, DSN 754-8755, commercial

13.4. Local Responses to High Level Inquiries. When members of the Congress inquire
directly to field commanders concerning disciplinary action against a member, retain a copy of
the inquiry and reply in the office administrative file for the action. AFI 90-401, Air Force
Relations with Congress, paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4 provide additional guidance.

Section 13D— Extrajudicial Statements to the Public Relating to Criminal Proceedings and
Release of Court-Martial Records.

13.5. General. Information may not be disseminated if there is a substantial likelihood that
release will prejudice a criminal proceeding. The determination of whether a release is
permissible includes an assessment of the type of information to be released and its source, the
type of proceeding, and the stage of the proceeding.
   13.5.1. The release of information relating to a criminal proceeding is subject to the Air
   Force Rules of Professional Conduct, the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice,
   implementing directives, security requirements, judicial orders protecting information and
   applicable laws, such as the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Victim and
   Witness Protection Act,
   13.5.2. Air Force representatives must not encourage or assist news media in photographing
   or televising an accused being held or transported in custody.
   13.5.3. This section does not apply to the release of information by military or civilian
   defense counsel. However, defense counsel, both military and civilian, must comply with the
   Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice,
   portions of which address trial publicity by defense counsel. Military defense counsel must
   comply with the requirements and restrictions of the Freedom of Information Act and the
   Privacy Act with regard to trial publicity.
13.6. Extrajudicial Statements. Extrajudicial statements are oral or written statements made
outside of a criminal proceeding that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by
means of public communication. The question of whether a statement is extrajudicial will
depend upon the circumstances. SJAs should consult with their MAJCOM SJAs when there is a
question about the nature of a statement proposed for release.
   13.6.1. There are valid reasons for making certain information available to the public in the
   form of extrajudicial statements. However, extrajudicial statements should not be used for
   the purpose of influencing the course of a criminal proceeding. Usually, extrajudicial
   statements should include only factual matters and should not offer subjective observations
   or opinions.
       13.6.1.1. The release of extrajudicial statements is a command responsibility. The
       installation SJA and the installation public affairs officer (PAO) must work closely
       together to provide informed advice to the commander. If the extrajudicial statement is
       based on information contained in agency records, the OPR for the record should also
       coordinate on the extrajudicial statement prior to release. The convening authority
       responsible for the criminal proceeding makes the ultimate decision about release of
       extrajudicial statements relating to that criminal proceeding. MAJCOM (or equivalent)
       commanders may withhold release authority from subordinate commanders. In high
       interest cases, the SJA and the PAO should consult with their MAJCOM representatives.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                 233


     13.6.1.2. The SJA, trial counsel and defense counsel must ensure investigators, law
     enforcement personnel, employees and other persons assisting or associated with counsel
     do not make extrajudicial statements counsel are prohibited from making.
  13.6.2. Extrajudicial Statements Which Generally May Not Be Made. Extrajudicial
  statements relating to the following matters ordinarily have a substantial likelihood of
  prejudicing a criminal proceeding and generally should not be made:
     13.6.2.1. The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement by the
     accused or the accused‘s refusal or failure to make a statement;
     13.6.2.2. Observations about the accused‘s character and reputation;
     13.6.2.3. Opinions regarding the accused‘s guilt or innocence;
     13.6.2.4. Opinions regarding the merits of the case or the merits of the evidence;
     13.6.2.5. References to the performance of any examinations, tests or investigative
     procedures (e.g., fingerprints, polygraph examinations, and ballistics or laboratory tests),
     the accused‘s failure to submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of
     physical evidence expected to be presented;
     13.6.2.6. Statements concerning the identity, expected testimony, disciplinary or criminal
     records, or credibility of prospective witnesses;
     13.6.2.7. The possibility of a guilty plea or other disposition of the case other than
     procedural information concerning such processes;
     13.6.2.8. Before sentencing, facts regarding the accused‘s disciplinary or criminal
     record, including nonjudicial punishment, prior court-martial convictions, and other
     arrests, indictments, convictions, or charges. Do not release information about
     nonjudicial punishment or administrative actions even after sentencing unless admitted
     into evidence. This rule does not prohibit, however, a statement that the accused has no
     prior criminal or disciplinary record; and,
     13.6.2.9. Information trial counsel knows or has reason to know would be inadmissible
     as evidence in a trial.
  13.6.3. Extrajudicial Statements That May Be Made Under Some Circumstances Regardless
  of the Stage of the Proceedings. Subject to the limitations in 13.5.1 and 13.5.2, the following
  extrajudicial statements may be made when deemed necessary regardless of the stage of the
  proceeding:
     13.6.3.1. General information to educate or inform the public concerning military law
     and the military justice system;
     13.6.3.2. If the accused is a fugitive, information necessary to aid in apprehending the
     accused or to warn the public of possible dangers;
     13.6.3.3. Requests for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary to
     obtain evidence;
     13.6.3.4. Facts and circumstances of an accused‘s apprehension, including the time and
     place of apprehension;
234                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


      13.6.3.5. The identities of investigating and apprehending agencies, and the length of the
      investigation, only if release of this information will not impede an ongoing or future
      investigation, and the release is coordinated with the affected agencies;
      13.6.3.6. Information contained in a public record, without further comment; and
      13.6.3.7. Information that protects the Air Force or the military justice system from the
      substantial, undue prejudicial effect of recent publicity initiated by some person or entity
      other than the Air Force. Information in the form of extrajudicial statements shall be
      limited to that which is necessary to correct misinformation or to mitigate substantial
      undue prejudicial information already available to the public. This can include, but is not
      limited to, information that would have been available to a spectator at an open Article 32
      investigation or an open session of a court-martial. Unless The Judge Advocate General
      (TJAG) has withheld the authority to coordinate on command release of this information
      for individual cases or types of cases, the MAJCOM SJA (or equivalent) shall coordinate
      on release of this information by the appropriate command authority. If TJAG has
      withheld the authority to coordinate on release of extrajudicial statements, requests for
      TJAG coordination shall be forwarded through the MAJCOM SJA to AFLOA/JAJM by
      the most expeditious means appropriate for the sensitivity of the information.
  13.6.4. Extrajudicial Statements That Generally May Be Made Only After Preferral of
  Charges. Subject to the limitations in paragraphs 13.5.1 and 13.5.2, the following
  information may be provided after preferral of charges:
      13.6.4.1. The accused‘s name, unit and assignment;
      13.6.4.2. The substance or text of charges and specifications, provided there is a
      statement included explaining that the charges are merely accusations and that the
      accused is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. As necessary, redact all
      Victim and Witness Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data from the charges and
      specifications.
      13.6.4.3. The scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process;
      13.6.4.4. Date and place of trial and other proceedings, or anticipated dates, if known;
      13.6.4.5. Identity and qualifications of appointed counsel;
      13.6.4.6. Identities of convening and reviewing authorities;
      13.6.4.7. A statement, without comment, that the accused has no prior criminal or
      disciplinary record or that the accused denies the charges; and
      13.6.4.8. The identity of the victim where the release of that information is not otherwise
      prohibited by law. Generally, however, seek to avoid release of the name of victims of
      sex offenses, the names of children or the identity of any victim when release would be
      contrary to the desire of the victim or harmful to the victim.
      13.6.4.9. The identities of court members and the military judge. Do not volunteer the
      identities of the court members or the military judge in material prepared for publication.
      This information may be released, if requested, after the court members or the military
      judge have been identified in the court-martial proceeding and the SJA to the convening
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                     235


       authority determines release would not prejudice the accused‘s rights or violate the
       member‘s or the military judge‘s privacy interests.
13.7. Documentation Pertaining to Criminal Proceedings. This subsection applies to those
documents and agency records created during the course of the military justice process and any
document or record incorporated into a military justice document or record. Unless
AFLOA/JAJM or higher authority withholds authority, the disclosure authority is the SJA for the
convening authority responsible for the criminal proceeding. File a copy of letters releasing
documents or records with the allied papers and immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM of any
release. However, once a completed record is forwarded, AFLOA/JAJM is the disclosure
authority for all records and associated documents. This subsection does not apply to documents
or records that originate outside the military justice system of records (e.g., OSI reports). The
disclosure authority for those documents and records is the OPR for those records under the
provisions of the, AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, and/or the DODR 5400.7-AFSUP, DoD
Freedom of Information Act Program.
   13.7.1. Release of Court-Martial Record of Trial. RCM 1103(b)(2) defines a court-martial
   record of trial. The court-martial record of trial is subject to release determination under the
   Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. Information marked as classified, controlled,
   or sealed by judicial order should not be released absent an authoritative determination of
   releasability. A transcript of oral proceedings is not a record until authentication. When
   releasing records of trial under this paragraph, redact all Victim and Witness Protection Act
   and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of victims of sex offenses, the names of
   children, and the identity of victims who could be harmed by disclosure of their identity.
   13.7.2. Release of Other Military Justice Documents or Records. All other documents or
   records, including documents which will become part of a record of trial, and including those
   which are attached to the court-martial record of trial but not made a part of the record of trial
   under the provisions of RCM 1103 (for example, an Article 32 report and its attachments) are
   also subject to release determination under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act.
   However, due regard will be given to the potentially heightened privacy interests of an
   accused where a case has not been fully adjudicated as well as to whether any exemption,
   such as those included to protect ongoing deliberative processes or investigative processes
   should be invoked. Information marked as classified, controlled, or sealed by judicial order
   should not be released absent an authoritative determination of releasability. When releasing
   military justice documents or records under this paragraph, redact all Victim and Witness
   Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of victims of sex
   offenses, the names of children, and the identity of victims who could be harmed by
   disclosure of their identity.
   13.7.3. Cases Disposed of by Acquittal or Action Other Than Court-Martial. When the
   charges against an accused were disposed of by an action other than court-martial, or when a
   court-martial results in an acquittal, due consideration must be given to the likelihood that the
   accused may have increased privacy interests in the protection of information contained in
   military justice documents or records. Less serious misconduct, which is handled
   administratively rather than judicially, generally is not considered of sufficient public interest
   to outweigh the privacy interest of the individual.

Section 13E— Special Interest Reports (SIRs)

13.8. Reporting Special Interest Cases to HQ USAF. Certain offenses committed by Air
Force members generate requests for information within HQ USAF, regardless of the member's
grade. Similarly, an accused's grade itself may generate requests for information, or necessitate
HQ USAF knowledge of an alleged offense. Staff judge advocates must be sensitive to reporting
requirements in this chapter, and make complete and timely reports. Reports should be prepared
and forwarded by the base legal office prosecuting the case or, if the case is in a civilian court,
the base legal office servicing the unit where the accused is assigned. None of the reporting
requirements are intended to preclude a commander's complete evaluation of a case before
deciding what action, if any, to take.
   13.8.1. Officer, Cadet, CMSgt and SMSgt Cases. Regardless of offense, report all
   investigations into allegations involving officers, cadets, CMSgts, and SMSgts.

       13.8.2.7. anthrax or smallpox refusals.
   13.8.3. Cases with Media Interest. Report any other case with potential community reaction,
   or potential or actual media coverage.
   13.8.4. Report Format. Use the Automated Military Justice Analysis and Management
   System (AMJAMS) to generate reports. Ensure the initial report includes a detailed
   summary of the case by filling in all AMJAMS data fields. Include a thorough description of
   offenses, dates, UCMJ articles allegedly violated, the number of specifications under each
   offense, sufficient detail to provide senior leadership with a clear understanding of the facts
   and circumstances involved, whether media attention is anticipated, and any other unusual or
   significant features of the case. Identify incomplete facts in the report and follow-up as soon
   as possible.
       13.8.4.1. Ensure sensitive investigative information is not included in the SIR without
       concurrence of the AFOSI Detachment Commander or other investigating agency. See
       paragraph 13.28 for examples of sensitive investigative information.
   13.8.5. When to Report. Submit reports:
       13.8.5.1. Immediately after learning of an incident in any of the above-mentioned
       categories;
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    237


       13.8.5.2. When a significant event in a reported case occurs after initial reporting.
       Significant events include disposition of investigation, preferral of charges, trial, results
       of trial, date Article 15 offered, date Article 15 punishment imposed, and media interest;
       13.8.5.3. DELETED.
   13.8.6. When updating SIRs in accordance with triggering events listed in the previous
   paragraph, use the following format for the email subject line as appropriate: (FOUO) NEW
   SIR: CASE ID # - RANK SURNAME – BASE; (FOUO) UPATED SIR: CASE ID # -
   RANK SURNAME – BASE.
   13.8.7. AMJAMS Process. All special interest reporting should be accomplished via
   AMJAMS using the reports located on the AMJAMS reports page. Reporting special interest
   cases is a base responsibility. Updates should be made after every significant event until
   final disposition (e.g., Article 15, administrative action, preferral, Article 32, referral).
       13.8.7.1. SAF and NAF/MAJCOM SIR buttons are located in the Special Interest Folder
       of AMJAMS. Click the ―SI reporting required‖ button for all cases listed in the
       paragraphs 13.8.1 to 13.8.3. The ―NAF/MAJCOM SIR‖ button is selected when a
       NAF/MAJCOM requires additional reporting not required by this AFI and the
       information is for use by each individual NAF and MAJCOM. If the case is disposed of
       via nonjudicial punishment, deselect the ―SAF SI‖ box in AMJAMS. Deselect the ―SAF
       SI‖ box after sentence is announced in courts-martial.
       13.8.7.2. Transmitting SIRs to AFLOA/JAJM. In addition to the requirement in
       paragraph 13.8.5, updates are made on AMJAMS by going to the AMJAMS Reports
       page on the web and selecting SAF Report. Next, put in the date range and run the
       report. Select ―[File/Send to/Page by Email]‖ to send the report to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 13F— Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review

13.9. Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review. If a case is
pending review under Articles 66, 67 or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters referring new charges must
notify AFLOA/JAJM of the facts relating to the new charges.

Section 13G— Reporting Foreign National USAF Member Cases

13.10. Foreign National USAF Member. A foreign national USAF member is a member of
the USAF who is a national of a foreign country and who is not a citizen or national of the
United States. For purposes of this section, any USAF member who claims to be a foreign
national shall be considered so.
   13.10.1. Notification. Notify HQ USAF/JAO when a foreign national USAF member is:
       13.10.1.1. Apprehended under circumstances likely to result in confinement or trial by
       court-martial and states that he/she is a foreign national;
       13.10.1.2. Ordered into arrest or confinement;
       13.10.1.3. Held for trial with or without any form of restraint; or
       13.10.1.4. Pending court-martial charges which have been referred for trial.
 238                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


   13.10.2. The notification shall include:
       13.10.2.1. The name, grade, SSN, organization and station of the foreign national USAF
       member;
       13.10.2.2. Any evidence, including information from the member‘s military record,
       which is inconsistent with a claim of foreign nationality;
       13.10.2.3. A thorough description of offenses, including dates, UCMJ articles allegedly
       violated, the number of specifications under each offense, and sufficient detail to provide
       clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved, and any other unusual or
       significant features of the case;
       13.10.2.4. The name of the military and/or civilian defense counsel, if any; and
       13.10.2.5. The exact location of the foreign national USAF member (e.g., Andrews AFB
       confinement facility).
   13.10.3. Whenever charges against a foreign national USAF member are referred for trial,
   the SJA of the SPCMCA shall have the member‘s military records examined to ascertain the
   member‘s nationality even if that member has not entered a claim of foreign nationality.
   13.10.4. Notification is not required:
       13.10.4.1. When disciplinary action under Article 15, UCMJ, or administrative action is
       taken; or
       13.10.4.2. If the foreign national USAF member is apprehended or confined in
       anticipation that only such actions will be taken.
   13.10.5. The section does not apply when a foreign national is charged with a crime,
   arrested, confined or detained in custody by the civil authorities of the United States, or any
   political subdivision, possession or territory thereof, or by the authorities of any foreign
   government. AFJI 51-707, Consular Protection of Foreign National Subject to the Uniform
   Code of Military Justice.

Section 13H— Time Management Of Case Processing

13.11. Time For Processing Cases.
   13.11.1. In General. SJAs must give managerial attention to all time standards prescribed by
   the MCM, statutes, case law and regulations.
   13.11.2. Coordination with AFOSI. SJAs should develop local procedures with their
   servicing AFOSI detachment commander to coordinate with agents as early as possible in the
   investigative stages of a case to ensure limited investigative resources are focused on
   gathering relevant evidence in a timely manner.
   13.11.3. Time Management. Expeditious processing of courts-martial is essential to
   minimize disruptions in the Air Force mission, the lives of victims, witnesses, and the
   accused, and to minimize Air Force costs. The impartial and timely administration of
   military justice helps sustain good order and discipline. SJAs and chiefs of military justice,
   at all levels of command, should regularly analyze available AMJAMS data relating to each
   segment of court processing over which they have significant control to determine specific
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  239


   areas for improvement and implement appropriate management measures to maximize
   effectiveness and efficiency. The following Air Force court-martial metrics are established
   to assist in expediting the administration of justice.
       13.11.3.1. Prefer charges in 80% of all courts-martial within 30 days of the date the
       AFOSI Report of Investigation is published. (NOTE: Charges may always be preferred
       prior to the publication of the Report of Investigation.)
       13.11.3.2. Convene 80% of all courts-martial (arraignment) on a Negotiated Trial Date
       within 45 days after the accused is served (RCM 602).
       13.11.3.3. Complete 80% of all general courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date)
       within 160 days.
       13.11.3.4. Complete 80% of all special courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action Date)
       within 75 days.
       13.11.3.5. Complete 80% of all summary courts-martial (Preferral Date - CA Action
       Date) within 30 days.
       13.11.3.6. Forward all court-martial ROTs to AFLOA/JAJM within 14 days of CA
       action.
       13.11.3.7. Complete 80% of all Article 66, UCMJ, appellate reviews within 270 days
       (Date AFLOA/JAJM receives the ROT - Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals Decision
       Date).
       13.11.3.8. In addition to the requirements outlined in paragraph 13.11.3.1 for AFOSI
       investigations, Staff Judge Advocates are expected to ensure expeditious processing of all
       cases by closely monitoring the investigative activities of all agencies until preferral of
       charges.

Section 13I— Specific Search, Seizure, and Apprehension Matters

13.12. Authorization to Administer Oaths for Search, Seizure, and Apprehension. Air
Force commanders and military magistrates are authorized to administer oaths or affirmations for
purposes of authorizing searches, seizures, and apprehensions based upon probable cause. Use
the AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling, to document authorization to
apprehend someone from a private dwelling. When required by the circumstances of a particular
case, oral authorization may be given.
13.13. U. S. Mail and Government Information Systems.
   13.13.1. U. S. Mail. Refer to DoD 4525.6-M, Department of Defense Postal Manual,
   paragraph C10.7, for procedures for the inspection, search, and seizure of mail in the custody
   of the military postal service. The U.S. Postal Service operates post offices on CONUS
   installations and opening of mail is allowed only pursuant to a valid search warrant executed
   by a federal magistrate or judge.
   13.13.2. Government Information Systems. Government information systems are subject
   to monitoring, interception, search, and seizure for all authorized purposes in accordance
   with the DoD Consent Banner placed on government computer systems.
 240                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


       13.13.2.1. The DoD Consent Banner does not extend to include the content of privileged
       communications or work product related to personal representation or services by
       attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, to include their assistants. Users should annotate
       their privileged communications in emails and documents to ensure such information is
       kept confidential and not inappropriately accessed or read during authorized search,
       seizure, interception, or monitoring activities. Investigators should consult with the
       appropriate legal office or AFOSI/JA prior to and during such activities to ensure
       privileged communications are appropriately protected and remain confidential.
       13.13.2.2. The presence of the DoD Consent Banner on a government information
       system, standing alone, may not necessarily negate a user‘s reasonable expectation of
       privacy regarding that system. Whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists will
       depend upon the state of the law and the facts and circumstances in each case. Because
       this area of the law continues to remain unsettled, consider obtaining search authorization
       for cases involving alleged criminal activity. U.S. v. Larson, 66 M.J. 212 (C.A.A.F.
       2008); U.S. v. Long, 64 M.J. 57 (C.A.A.F. 2006).
13.14. Military Defense Counsel . If a search authorization is to be issued against an ADC or
SDC, or his/her house or office, precautions must be taken to protect the confidentiality of
attorney-client materials to the maximum extent possible. Staff judge advocates will inform the
commander, Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA/CC), or the Director, USAF Judiciary
(AFLOA/JAJ), before such search authorizations are executed or as soon as practicable if exigent
circumstances exist. United States v. Calhoun, 49 M.J. 485 (1998). If a search authorization is
not required due to exigent circumstances IAW MRE 315(g), notify AFLOA/CC or AFLOA/JAJ
of the search as soon as practicable. See TJAG Policy Memorandum: Military Justice - 2.

Section 13J— Appointment of Judges to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals

13.15. Appointing Judges to AFCCA. Pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, TJAG appoints judge
advocates to the AFCCA. The appointment may be documented using an AF Form 516,
Certificate for Appointment of Appellate Judge.

Section 13K— Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration under
Federal Law

13.16. General Provision. If the member has been convicted of a sexually violent offense or
certain offenses against a minor, the Air Force is required to provide notice to state and local
officials prior to the member‘s release from confinement, and the member may be required to
register as a sex offender under state law. See the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and
Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (1994); Pub. L. 105-119, Title I, § 115(a)(8(C)(i),
111 Stat. 2466 (1997);Megan’s Law (1996); the Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling
Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act and Megan’s Law
(1998); Pam Lyncher Sex Offender Tracking and Identification Act (1996); Jacob Wetterling
Improvements Act (1997); Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act (1998); and, Adam
Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (2006). The Acts are available at the United States
Department of Justice (DOJ) website http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/legislation.htm.
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                   241


13.17. Compliance With Federal/State Laws. The Security Forces (SF) corrections officer, or
designee at the facility in which the prisoner is detained ensures compliance with federal/state
laws. See AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System. This includes the corrections officer
notifying appropriate state and local law enforcement officials and state sex offender registration
officials using the DD Form 2791, Notice of Release/Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex
Offender Registration Requirements. It also includes the corrections officer notifying the
member about his or her registration responsibilities and obtaining the member‘s
acknowledgment of these responsibilities.
13.18. Base-level SJA Responsibilities. If a member is convicted of an offense that triggers the
notification requirement, indicate on the AF Form 1359, Report of Result of Trial, that
compliance with this section is required. Use the language ―SEX OFFENDER NOTIFICATION
REQUIRED‖ in the SENTENCE block of AF Form 1359. A determination that a member
committed a qualifying offense has important consequences. Figure 13.4 is a list of offenses
which trigger sex offender notification requirements. It should be noted, however, that sex
offender registration requirements vary by state and may be triggered by offenses not listed in
Figure 13.4. Therefore, a member convicted of an offense that does not trigger sex offender
notification requirements may nonetheless be required to register as a sex offender under state
law. When a question arises whether a conviction triggers notification requirements, SJAs should
seek guidance from a superior command level legal office. Further questions about whether an
offense triggers notification requirements may be directed to AFLOA/JAJM.
   13.18.1. No Post-trial Confinement. When compliance with Section 13K is required, but
   confinement is not part of the adjudged punishment (or sufficient pretrial or illegal pretrial
   confinement credit completely offsets the term of confinement imposed at trial), the SJA will
   notify the appropriate corrections officer (or the Security Forces commander, if there is no
   corrections officer), in writing, within 24 hours of the member‘s conviction. For purposes of
   this section, conviction includes announcement of the sentence. The corrections officer, or
   the Security Forces commander, as appropriate, will ensure that the notifications required in
   paragraph 13.16 and AFI 31-205 are made.

Section 13L— Compliance with DNA Collection under Federal Law

13.19. General Provision. An accused convicted by a general or special court-martial of a
―qualifying military offense‖ are subject to the mandatory collection of a DNA sample pursuant
to Section 5 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. 10 U.S.C. § 1565.
13.20. Base Level SJA Responsibilities. If an accused is convicted of an offense that triggers
the mandatory DNA collection requirement, indicate on the AF Form 1359, Report of Result of
Trial, that compliance with this section is required. Use the language ―DNA PROCESSING
REQUIRED‖ in the SENTENCE block of AF Form 1359. Base-level SJAs will brief their
commanders about the new DNA processing requirements. The SJA uses Figure 13.3
(Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities) when notifying and briefing immediate
commanders about their responsibilities on individual cases. SJAs must ensure promulgating
orders prepared for individuals convicted of a ―qualifying military offense‖ contain the
annotation ―DNA Processing Required. 10 U.S.C. § 1565.‖ in 14-point boldface type on the first
page of the order. The annotation must be one line, centered, and one inch from the top of the
page. In a general court-martial, the SJA to the general court-martial convening authority may
 242                            AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


send the ―Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities‖ to the immediate commander
through a subordinate SJA. For additional guidance addressing a ―qualifying military offense,‖
as well as substantive and procedural requirements under the Act, See 10 U.S.C. § 1565; Figure
13.2 (DNA Processing Required Qualifying Military Offenses Under 10 U.S.C. § 1565); and
Figure 13.3 (Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities).

       13.20.1.4. DELETED.
   13.20.2. Commander Notification. The SJA for the convening authority taking initial action
   on a general or special court-martial that includes a conviction of a ―qualifying military
   offense‖ ensures the accused‘s immediate commander is notified and briefed about DNA
   processing responsibilities if:
       13.20.2.1. The accused receives a sentence that did not include confinement;
       13.20.2.2. The accused is no longer in confinement when the convening authority takes
       initial action on the sentence; or
       13.20.2.3. The SJA receives notice from a DoD Correctional Facility that the accused
       was released from confinement before correctional personnel could collect a DNA
       sample.
   13.20.3. DNA Processing Responsibilities. The immediate commander, upon notification
   from the SJA of the need for DNA processing of an accused with a conviction of a
   ―qualifying military offense,‖ should:
       13.20.3.1. Ensure a U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) collection
       kit is promptly obtained from HQ AFSFC/SFC, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland
       AFB, TX 78236-0119 [DSN 945-5622 or (210) 925-5622] or the nearest Air Force
       Correctional Facility designated by HQ AFSFC/SFC to maintain such kits.
       13.20.3.2. Ensure a DNA sample is obtained using the DNA collection kit and
       instructions contained therein. The commander will utilize local Security Forces (SF)
       corrections personnel and local medical personnel, to the maximum extent possible, to
       process the collection of the DNA sample. This includes requesting local SF personnel
       assistance in completing items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 on the USACIL collection card
       (which includes fingerprinting the accused and witnessing the drawing of blood) and
       mailing the sample to USACIL. This also includes using local medical personnel to
       collect the blood sample and complete any pertinent items on the USACIL collection
       card.
       13.20.3.3. Ensure the required DNA sample is collected and mailed to USACIL before
       the accused is permitted to begin excess appellate leave or before the accused is
       administratively discharged from the Air Force. If an accused departs on excess appellate
       leave before the DNA sample is collected, the commander shall notify the accused of this
       requirement and request a voluntary return by the accused, at no expense to the
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                    243


       government, and provide a sample while remaining in excess appellate leave status. If
       the accused is no longer in the immediate area, the commander may arrange for the DNA
       processing at a military installation closer to the accused‘s appellate leave address. If the
       accused does not or is unable to voluntarily return at his or her own expense to comply
       with DNA processing mandated by law, the commander shall recall the member to duty
       for the purpose of obtaining the required DNA sample. Consult AFI 36-3003, Military
       Leave Program, paragraph 4.11.3, and the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR),
       paragraph U7220, for funding issues. If the accused is no longer in the immediate area
       when recalled, the commander may consider arranging for the accused to report for duty
       and provide a DNA sample at a military installation near his or her appellate leave
       address to minimize government expense.
       13.20.3.4. If an accused does not comply with a recall to duty from appellate leave status
       or otherwise refuses to cooperate in providing a DNA sample, contact the SJA for
       guidance. [Note: When these situations arise, the SJA should notify and consult with
       AFLOA/JAJM, Policy and Precedent Branch.]
       13.20.3.5. Notify the SJA and HQ AFSFC/SFC of the date the DNA sample was sent to
       USACIL. If a DNA sample cannot be obtained, the reason must be provided.
   13.20.4. Members Subject to Collection. DNA samples shall not be collected from members
   who are no longer subject to military jurisdiction. Accordingly, execution of a punitive or
   administrative discharge should be deferred until DNA processing has been completed.

Section 13M— Compliance with the Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act of
1968 (known as “The Lautenberg Amendment”)

13.21. General Provision. The Lautenberg Amendment makes it a felony for any person to sell
or otherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition to any person whom he or she knows or has
reasonable cause to believe has been convicted of a ―misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.‖
Additionally, persons convicted of such crimes are also prohibited from: (1) shipping or
transporting in interstate commerce or foreign commerce, (2) possessing in or affecting
commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or (3) receiving any firearm or ammunition which has
been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. A ―crime of domestic violence‖
is an offense that has as its factual basis one of the following: (1) the use or attempted use of
physical force, or (2) the threatened use of a deadly weapon. One of the factors must be coupled
with a crime committed by a current or former spouse, parent or guardian of the victim; by a
person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or
has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or, by a person similarly situated
to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victims. Qualifying convictions include ―a crime of
domestic violence‖ tried by general or special court-martial which otherwise meets the elements
of a crime of domestic violence even though not classified as a misdemeanor or felony. 18
U.S.C. § 922(d) and (g).
13.22. Base Level SJA Responsibilities. If an accused is convicted at a special or general
court-martial of an offense constituting ―a crime of domestic violence,‖ indicate this on the AF
Form 1359. Place the language ―CRIME OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE‖ in the SENTENCE
block of the AF Form 1359. SJAs must also ensure promulgating orders prepared for individuals
convicted of a qualifying offense contain the annotation ―Crime of Domestic Violence. 18
 244                           AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010


U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).‖ The annotation must be one line, centered, in 14-point boldface type, and
one inch from the top of the page. SJAs are responsible for informing commanders of the impact
of the conviction on the accused‘s ability to handle firearms or ammunition as part of their
official duties; briefing commanders on retrieving all Government-issued firearms and
ammunition and suspending the member‘s authority to possess Government-issued firearms and
ammunition; and advising members of their commands to lawfully dispose of their privately
owned firearms and ammunition. For additional guidance addressing qualifying offenses, as
well as substantive and procedural requirements under the Act, See 18 U.S.C. §§ 921 and 922.

Section 13N—Facilitating the Investigation to Disposition Process

13.23. General Provision. An effective military justice process starts with a timely, thorough,
and accurate investigation. JA and investigative personnel, particularly AFOSI, must develop a
collaborative relationship focused on integrating investigative efforts and the legal process. The
goal is thorough, case-ready Reports of Investigation (ROIs), robust litigation preparation, and
timely resolution of military justice cases. Although the remainder of this Section applies
primarily to AFOSI and JA procedures, SJAs will establish local procedures to implement these
goals for all investigations.
13.24. Initial Process. An effective team approach starts at the beginning of the military justice
process. In matters involving alleged violations of the UCMJ or where the Military
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) may apply, the AFOSI detachment will notify the local
JA when substantive criminal investigations are initiated. At a minimum, the SJA will designate
an attorney to provide initial counsel to the AFOSI case agent on the new investigation.
13.25. Investigative Support Team. The SJA will designate an investigative support team as
early as practicable in the investigative process. The investigative support team will be
composed of judge advocate(s), as well as civilian attorney(s) and paralegal(s) when appropriate,
AFI51-201_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 2 JULY 2010                                                  253


who will work with the AFOSI case agent(s) during the investigation to provide legal support.
Members of the investigative support team are not investigators and they must be careful not to
depart from their role. The team should properly safeguard all attorney work-product material.
Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947); United States v. Romano, 46 M.J. 269 (C.A.A.F. 1997);
United States v. Vanderwier, 25 M.J. 263, (C.M.A. 1987).
13.26. Investigative Plan Development. The attorney designated by the SJA and/or the
investigative support team will receive a briefing on the initial investigative steps. The
designated attorney or the investigative support team will continue the collaborative process
during the development of the Investigative Plan and work with the AFOSI case agent in
identifying potential criminal offenses for investigation, comparing the evidence in the case with
the elements of proof for a given offense. JA will coordinate with the AFOSI case agent on
subject interviews.
13.27. Case Development.
   13.27.1. The investigative support team and AFOSI case agents will continue their
   collaborative efforts as the investigation proceeds. As appropriate, designated investigative
   support team members or JA staff members will attend AFOSI case review meetings.
   Likewise, AFOSI personnel are encouraged to attend relevant JA military justice meetings.
   13.27.2. The investigative support team will review and update the initial proof analysis
   crafted by trial counsel to address the elements, evidence, anticipated objections, and
   potential defenses for each specification as appropriate, but at least on a monthly basis, for
   JA use. JA will discuss the results of the analysis with AFOSI. A final proof analysis will be
   completed contemporaneously with the publication of the ROI. This will also assist in pre-
   trial preparation efforts.
   13.27.3. In accordance with AFI 51-1001, the SJA will initiate the coordination process as
   early as possible for MEJA cases.
13.28. Disclosure and Reporting of Sensitive Case Information. As a case develops, both the
SJA and AFOSI are required to provide case information and status to higher commands through
their respective reporting channels. To avoid compromising an on-going investigation, the SJA
will not allow disclosure of sensitive investigative information without the AFOSI Detachment
Commander‘s concurrence. Some examples of sensitive investigative information would include
AFOSI investigative techniques, case leads, and confidential source information. Once a case
proceeds to trial, the rules of discovery will control the release of any sensitive investigative
information.
13.29. Lessons Learned. Within 30 days of the conclusion of trial, the SJA and available
members of the trial team will conduct a ―hot wash‖ with AFOSI to review case lessons learned.
Other legal office personnel may attend at the SJA‘s and AFOSI detachment commander‘s
discretion.
