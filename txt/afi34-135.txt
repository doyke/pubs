1.3. Lodging Facility Standards. DoD 4165.63-M, DoD Housing Management, prescribes
standards (see Table 1.1) for transient, unaccompanied personnel housing (lodging). Personnel
staying in DoD lodging operations should have the same quality facilities, furnishings, and
services, as they would find in a good quality, mid-level, commercial hotel. The standards
identified in this AFI are designed with the customer in mind. The customer wants consistent,
quality service in all facets of the lodging operation and expects the same quality facilities,
furnishings, and service from one Air Force lodging operation to the next. Air Force lodging
managers, through their chain of command, are responsible for ensuring every aspect of their
operation adheres to these standards. The use of standards will also help maximize economies
and efficiencies in Air Force lodging operations. The lodging manager’s goal is to meet 100% of
the standards. For a complete list of the Air Force Inns guest room standards, refer to the Air
Force Lodging Standards section of the Air Force Inns webpage on the USAF Services Portal.
Requests for waivers due to inadequate space, guest inconvenience, or operational need may be
forwarded from Squadron Commanders/Division Chiefs with complete justification to
AFPC/SVI, to be routed to AFPC Lodging Program for consideration. Refer to Unified
Facilities Criteria 4-720-01, Lodging Facilities, Feb 12, for new construction standards.
Conversion of new construction visiting quarters (VQ) to business suites must be submitted to
AF/A1S for consideration. For a complete list of VQs and Temporary Lodging Facility (TLF)
facility design standards, refer to the USAF Services Portal under the Lodging Recapitalization
Program section.

   1.3.1. Air Force lodging operations are not authorized to involuntarily lodge duty transient
   personnel in government lodging not meeting the minimum space and privacy standards
   identified in Table 1.1, during normal, peacetime operations, without the approval of
   AF/A1S, Operations Division (AF/A1SO). (T-3).
      1.3.1.1. Installation commanders may authorize lodging in facilities not meeting
      minimum standards for reasons of military necessity, such as contingency operations,
      natural disasters, emergencies, etc. It is inappropriate to involuntarily lodge duty
      transient personnel in facilities below minimum adequacy standards solely to reduce
      temporary duty (TDY) costs. (T-3).
      1.3.1.2. Duty transient personnel may voluntarily accept a lodging room that does not
      meet minimum adequacy standards. Room rates are not negotiable under any
      circumstances including rooms not meeting minimum adequacy standards.
      1.3.1.3. Exception: Reserve personnel in Inactive Duty Training (IDT) status with a
      waiver from AFPC/SVI. (T-3). NOTES: 1. Lodging will house Air National Guard
      (ANG) and Reserve technicians in travel status according to the military grade shown on
      their travel orders. 2. The net living area of a private room or suite is measured from the
      inside face of the peripheral wall and includes all enclosed, unshared spaces, and
      partitions. The net living area of a shared room is the clear area in the sleeping room
      allocated for an individual’s bed, locker (wardrobe/closet), furniture, and circulation. It
      excludes lounges, bathrooms, hallways, and storage areas designated for military
      mobility and field gear, or equivalent. In an open bay, net living area is one equal share
      per person. For a detailed explanation on measuring rooms, please refer to the Unified
      Facilities Criteria, Lodging Facilities, on the USAF Services Portal. 3. For information
      on contingency procedures, see Attachment 4. 4. (ANG) Adhere to the above minimum
      adequacy standards identified in Table 1.1 when obtaining commercial lodging (CL)
      while in an AT status. (T-3). 5. (ANG) The Training and Education Center at McGhee-
      Tyson Air National Guard Base (ANGB) TN and four Combat Readiness Training
      Centers (CRTC) (Alpena MI; Gulfport MS; Savannah GA; and, Volk Field WI), and the
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     11


       five Regional Training Sites (RTS) (Fort Indiantown Gap PA; Charlotte (Baden) NC;
       March ARB CA; Fargo ND; and Fort Smith AR) are considered exceptions to lodging
       standards. The lodging accommodations are specially constructed to conform to
       particular needs of the TEC, CRTC and RTS locations and are deemed adequate for the
       occupancy of all personnel regardless of rank/grade or career field. (T-3).
1.4. Facility Utilization. Lodging managers determine the number of lodging rooms required
based on Priority 1 (see Chapter 2) guest historical data and future mission changes that may
affect Priority 1 guest traffic. Commanders will re-designate lodging rooms/facilities as
contingency quarters or other use if the occupancy rate is below 75% for a period of 1 year (or
below 50% Priority 1 guests). Any re-designation of non-contingency lodging appropriated fund
(APF) assets requires AF/A1S approval. (T-3).
   1.4.1. AF/A1S must approve any diversions of NAF built facilities including internal
   diversion such as redesignation of VQ rooms to Business Suites, etc. (Refer to AFI 32-9002,
   Use of Real Property Facilities, for additional guidance.)
   1.4.2. Lodging managers may temporarily house newly assigned unaccompanied single
   permanent party personnel in lodging facilities if permanent party housing is not readily
   available. Members must pay the lodging room rate. Lodging units are not to be transferred
   temporarily to Unaccompanied Officer’s Quarters (UOQ) or dormitories to circumvent the
   daily room rate. Members should consult their financial services office regarding pay
   entitlements. (T-3).
   1.4.3. If on-base lodging becomes unavailable for any reason, the lodging manager will
   inform potential customers IAW procedures outlined in AFMAN 34-102, Directory of
   Government Quarters and Dining Facilities. (T-3).
   1.4.4. Unaccompanied male and female guests will not share sleeping rooms or bathrooms,
   but may have adjacent bedrooms with a kitchen and/or living area between them if the
   kitchen/living area has separate doors with functioning locking mechanisms on both sides
   leading from the shared kitchen/living area to the private sleeping/bath area. However, every
   effort will be made to assign male and female guests to separate rooms. (T-3).
       1.4.4.1. For facilities configured as VQs the following guidelines apply: A separation of
       general areas between guests that fall into different rank categories is normally desirable.
       To the extent possible, assign airmen/non-commissioned officers (NCOs), officers, and
       aircrew members to rooms on separate floors/wings, especially when crew rest is an
       issue. Managers should use flexibility and good judgment when making these
       assignments. When rooms in the normally designated area are not available, assign
       guests to any available VQ room on a first-come, first-served basis. Do not send guests
       to commercial quarters or issue certificates unless there are no rooms available. (T-3).
       1.4.4.2. (ANG) Married couples on duty status may be lodged together if a private
       sleeping facility and a private bathroom are available. In recognition of the need to
       accommodate the mission, this request is desired but not mandatory for deployment and
       exercises. (T-3).
       1.4.4.3. (ANG) The installation/site commander may allow for single occupancy as
       space-A, financial considerations, and military necessity permits for eligible members
       performing Inactive Duty Training (IDT). Rooms will be assigned based upon the
 12                                                          AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


       designated rank or position the installation/site commander had deemed eligible for a
       private room for on base or CL. (T-3).
1.5. Guest Room Standards. Every effort should be made to ensure our guests have clean,
comfortable rooms that afford them a good night’s rest. All lodging employees have a
significant role in this effort. The room should be attractively furnished, supplied appropriately,
clean, and properly maintained to ensure guests have a pleasant stay. Detailed guest room
amenity, furnishing, and supply standards are located in Air Force Lodging Standards on the
USAF Services Portal, https://www.usafservices.com. (T-3).
   1.5.1. Guest Room Accessories and Amenities. Air Force lodging rooms are distinguished
   by the attention to detail that is put into the rooms to make them as comfortable as possible
   for all lodging guests. To ensure consistent service from one Air Force Inn to the next, all
   lodging operations must provide guests the same standard accessories and amenities. See Air
   Force Lodging Standards on the USAF Services Portal for the detailed list of standard Air
   Force Inn accessories and amenities. (T-3).
   1.5.2. Guest Information. Each room will have a guest information book prominently
   displayed which includes a welcome letter from the lodging manager on the first page
   including how guests may contact the duty manager. Ensure information is available
   pertaining to local areas and conditions. Lodging will also list occupant responsibilities in
   guest room information books. See Air Force Lodging Standards on the USAF Services
   Portal for a detailed listing of what is required in the guest information book. (T-3).
   1.5.3. Guest Privacy. Lodging staff will not enter a guest room displaying a “Do Not
   Disturb” sign, unless the sign has been displayed for three consecutive days. On the third
   day, lodging staff will enter the room to ensure the safety of the guest and condition of the
   room. This should be accomplished no earlier than the posted check-out time. Pet Friendly
   TLFs will be entered daily to remove excessive dander and fur, and inspected for fleas, ticks,
   and any damages caused by pets. For more information, see 1.6.2 and 1.19. (T-3).
       1.5.3.1. Lodging managers will work with a POC for long term aircrews to obtain
       aircrew resting schedules to prevent housekeeping interruptions. During unforeseen
       emergency circumstances, maintenance will enter rooms as appropriate. Guest rooms
       will also be entered IAW contractually obligated maintenance schedules. (T-3).
1.6. Occupant Responsibilities in the Facilities and Guest Rooms. Occupants are responsible
for their conduct and the conduct of their guests and/or family members while in government
lodging. Their actions must not infringe on the rights of others. (T-3). NOTE: Guests that are
accompanied by Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Service dogs are authorized to stay in
lodging facilities, regardless of an approved local pet policy and are exempt from paying any
additional fees above the nightly room rate. For additional guidance on ADA requirements
concerning Service Animals, see the USAF Services Portal.
   1.6.1. No-Smoking Policy. All Air Force lodging common areas and guest rooms, including
   TLF units, are no-smoking areas. If smoking does occur in a guest room, an efficient ionizer
   or deodorizer will be used to clean the room to rid it of smoke residue. Guests may be
   charged up to a $150.00 fee based on expenses incurred to return the room to available
   inventory for violating the no-smoking policy. Once cited, guests who violate this policy are
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      13


   subject to eviction as determined by the lodging manager; appeals should be made through
   the Force Support Squadron Commander/Director. (T-3).
   1.6.2. Pet Friendly TLFs. Housekeeping or lodging management will enter Pet Friendly
   TLFs daily. Guests may be charged up to a $150.00 cleaning fee based on expenses incurred
   to return the room to available inventory when pet friendly TLFs require extraordinary
   cleaning or incur damages. Once cited, guests who violate this policy are subject to eviction
   as determined by the lodging manager; appeals should be made through the Force Support
   Squadron Commander/Director. Pets in VQs are not authorized and are incompatible with
   the purpose of TDY facilities. Information on operating Pet TLFs is found in paragraph
   1.19 (T-3).
       1.6.2.1. Guests may be charged up to a $150.00 cleaning fee based on expenses incurred
       to return the room to available inventory for violating the no-pet policy in non-pet
       friendly rooms. (T-3).
   1.6.3. Occupants will conserve utilities, and comply with Air Force fire, health, and safety
   regulations. (T-3).
   1.6.4. Occupants will reimburse lodging for damage beyond fair wear and tear, and for
   missing government property caused by abuse or negligence on their part or by their guests.
   AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, or AFI 34-202, Protecting
   Nonappropriated Fund Assets, govern the assessment of loss or damage to a lodging unit by
   a guest. The lodging manager processes a report of survey on loss or damage to NAF/APF
   assets in accordance with AFMAN 23-220 and AFI 34-202. (T-3).
1.7. Guest Security in Facilities and Guest Room. Guest safety and security is of the utmost
importance. Accordingly, the front desk staff must not give a guest’s room number or personal
information to others. (T-3).
   1.7.1. Key control procedures will be implemented to ensure security. Do not print room
   numbers on the key, key chain, or electronic door openers. If room numbers are already
   placed on keys or key chains, place the key in a small envelope to conceal the room number
   until replaced. (T-3).
   1.7.2. Do not issue replacement keys to guests when requested without positive
   identification confirming the guest is assigned to the room. (T-3).
   1.7.3. All interior corridor rooms will have evacuation procedures with maps leading to the
   closest exit posted on the backside of all room entry doors. (T-3).
1.8. Guest Room Housekeeping and Preventive Maintenance. The housekeeping staff plays
a very important role in ensuring guests enjoy their stay and must ensure all lodging rooms and
common areas are clean, orderly and in proper working order. All housekeepers must provide
guests with friendly, prompt, professional service. (T-3).
   1.8.1. Guest requests for housekeeping service or supplies made during normal duty hours
   must be fulfilled no later than 30 minutes after the request is made. Supplies such as towels,
   linen, spare light bulbs, and toilet paper, will be available at the front desk after normal duty
   hours. (T-3).
   1.8.2. Full room cleaning, common area cleaning, deep cleaning, and preventive
   maintenance checks will be accomplished according to prescribed standards. Standards and
 14                                                          AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   checklists are located in the AF Lodging Standards Checklist, which can be found on the
   USAF Services Portal. (T-3).
1.9. Guest Room Quality Assurance Inspection and Review. The installation commander (or
deputy) inspects a sampling of all types of lodging at least annually. The lodging manager
maintains a record of these inspections to include dates, facilities visited, and comments. All
discrepancies noted must be tracked and corrected. (T-3).
   1.9.1. Lodging management (i.e., general/assistant manager) will inspect at least 1-2 percent
   of guest rooms (each room type) on a weekly basis (and maintain documentation of
   inspections for at least one year). (T-3).
   1.9.2. At least two members of the lodging management staff must conduct formal
   inspections of lodging common areas and at least 25 percent of the guest rooms each quarter
   and document their findings (maintain inspection documentation for at least one year). (T-
   3).
   1.9.3. Housekeeping supervisors (to include work leaders) are required to conduct formal
   inspections of at least 1-2 percent of guest rooms (each room type) on a weekly basis (and
   maintain documentation of inspections for at least one year). (T-3).
   1.9.4. The lodging staff conducts safety self-inspections of all lodging facilities and
   operations, using checklists from Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standards
   annually or as directed by the local safety office. (T-3).
   1.9.5. The maintenance staff conducts room specific preventive maintenance on at least 25
   percent of the guest rooms each quarter and documents findings (maintain inspection
   documentation for at least one year). (T-3).
1.10. Business Suites. An installation commander may designate business suites within the
VQs. Business suites will be released NLT 1600 daily to the Lodging office when managed by
the Protocol office. Occupancy should be maximized by issuing a majority of rooms to other
TDY and Space A travelers regardless of rank or status (being mindful of upcoming
reservations) aiming to keep business suites occupied at least 75% of the time or risk a reduction
in their business suite inventory. (T-3).
   1.10.1. No more than five percent of a lodging operation’s total transient quarters will be
   identified as business suites without AFPC Lodging Program approval. Waivers must be
   resubmitted no later than every two years from the original date of approval, and should
   justify excess need and include historical occupancy data. (T-3).
   1.10.2. Lodging and protocol will establish a local operational instruction concerning
   business suite reservations and management to include exceptions to 1.9 above such as
   protection of General Officer suites, etc. It should also emphasize space-A and occupancy
   percentages. (T-3).
   1.10.3. MAJCOMs and/or bases are not authorized to adjust the number of business suites
   constructed in VQs. Any action pursued to either reduce or expand the number, and/or size,
   of suites constructed is inconsistent with the justification and methodology for providing
   VQs and must be submitted through AFPC/SVI for AFPC Lodging Program to forward
   recommendations to AF/A1S as the sole waiver authority. (T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   15


1.11. Fitness Rooms. In keeping with the Fit to Fight culture of the Air Force, fitness rooms
will be included in Air Force lodging facilities when space and equipment permit. Fitness rooms
should focus on commercial grade cardio equipment such as treadmills, elliptical trainers, stair
climbers, and stationary bicycles. (Fitness equipment is an appropriated fund requirement.)
Additionally, adequate space for abdominal work and stretching is required. Free weights or
other weight machinery is not appropriate for this area and is best left to fully supervised
facilities such as the base fitness center. A television for viewing while using the equipment is
required as are towelettes to clean the equipment after use. Ideally, when establishing a fitness
room, lodging should partner with the fitness center staff to maximize use of their excess
equipment. Whether reusing aged fitness center equipment or buying new, lodging should use
the same cardio equipment brands as the base fitness center and establish equipment
maintenance through the fitness center’s source. Lodging fitness rooms are in no way intended
to compete with base fitness centers, but instead should complement the focus on an individual’s
responsibility to stay Fit to Fight in the TDY/permanent change of station (PCS) environment.
Specific standards, location consideration, etc., are listed in the Air Force Lodging Standards
section of the Air Force Inns webpage on the USAF Services Portal. (T-3).
1.12. Business Centers. Air Force personnel traveling on TDY or PCS orders often require
continued contact with their offices/duty stations. Air Force Inns must provide standard business
services including internet access, fax, copy capability and CAC readers for official business at
no cost. Specific standards/guidelines regarding the appropriate number of computers for a
business center are listed in the Air Force Lodging Standards section of the Air Force Inns
webpage on the USAF Services Portal. (T-3).
1.13. Laundry Facilities. Laundry equipment will be offered to our guests at no charge.
Laundry supplies (detergent, softener, etc.) must be available to guests through coin-operated
vending machines located in laundry rooms or at retail sales outlets. Washers and dryers are
provided at a ratio of one washer and dryer for each 12 rooms in VQs and one washer and dryer
per each eight rooms in TLFs (one per unit in new construction); however at training bases or
bases where a significant portion of the customer base involves long-term stays (more than three-
weeks duration), the ratio is one washer and dryer for each eight VQs. (T-3).
1.14. Transient Aircrew Lodging. Lodging provides a private room/private bath to officer
transient aircrew members (accommodations may include a shared kitchen and/or living area).
For enlisted transient aircrew members, lodging provides a private room and a private or shared
bath. Aircrew members are defined as anyone on the flight crew order. Ensure gender is
considered when assigning lodging for aircrew members. (T-3).
   1.14.1. Lodging managers should consider crew rest before assigning aircrew members to
   rooms in the vicinity of construction or maintenance operations. (T-3).
   1.14.2. Lodging may assign other authorized guests to transient aircrew accommodations if
   not required for aircrews and other on-base lodging is not available. When assigning other
   TDY personnel to aircrew accommodations, advise them of the varied aircrew members
   sleeping hours, and ask them to refrain from making any noise or disturbance that could
   interrupt crew rest. (T-3).
   1.14.3. Lodging will maintain aircrew integrity by housing the entire aircrew either on base
   or off base. If housed on base, lodging will house them as close together as possible. If
 16                                                         AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   lodged off base, lodging will house the aircrew in one commercial establishment whenever
   possible. (T-3).
   1.14.4. The installation commander or the aircraft commander may waive aircrew lodging
   requirements on a temporary basis for reasons of military necessity. (T-3).
1.15. Guest Parking. There must be adequate and designated vehicle parking for guest
registration with a separate area for unloading/loading passengers and baggage. All facility
parking areas must be well marked, free of debris, and adequately lighted at night. Where
feasible, each business suite will have a designated parking space as close as possible to the
room. (T-3).
1.16. Facility and Guest Room Signage. Proper signage is necessary to direct lodging guests
to the lodging reception center and to their rooms. The lodging manager will make every effort

2.1. Eligible Guests in Air Force VQs and TLFs. Table 2.1. lists personnel who qualify for
Priority 1 and Priority 2 status in VQs. Table 2.2. lists personnel who qualify for Priority 1 and
Priority 2 status in TLFs. Personnel listed as Priority 2 are assigned rooms on a space available
basis. Within Priority 1 and Priority 2, assignments to VQs and TLFs are made on a first-come,
first-served basis, without regard to rank. (T-3).
   2.1.1. (ANG) ANG installations may provide lodging accommodations, either on the
   installation or in CL, for eligible unaccompanied personnel requiring government lodging
   during IDT or AT whenever possible. Eligible unaccompanied personnel are members of the
   unit who reside outside the 50 mile commuting distance as required by DoDI 1225.9. ( T-3).
   2.1.2. (ANG) The Wing Commander has the option to amend eligibility in case of
   inclement weather, natural disaster, or other safety concerns, such as extended duty hours due
   to duty position requirements. (T-3).
   2.1.3. (ANG) ANG Lodging Managers must annually determine (July-September) eligible
   members, and have supporting documentation. This allows for proper budgeting of funds for
   lodging accommodations. (T-3).
   2.1.4. (ANG) Lodging at no expense to the eligible unaccompanied personnel during IDT is
   not a benefit guaranteed by the ANG and is contingent upon funding and the discretion of the

   within the surrounding area before securing CL for eligible unaccompanied personnel during
   IRT. (T-3).
   2.2.2. (ANG) TDY personnel to ANG installations will be lodged either on the installation
   where military accommodations are available or in CL. TDY personnel will pay their own

   training site (military accommodations available or in CL), to eliminate possible hindrances
   to their learning experience. (T-3).

NOTES:
1. Civilian personnel and/or their family members are Priority 1 for on base lodging when in a
PCS status overseas. In CONUS, they are Priority 2 for on base lodging.

2. Do not issue a PCS member an automated CL authorization or Non-Availability (NA) number.
Instead, provide member an Air Force Inns Temporary Lodging Expense Allowance/Temporary
Lodging Allowance (TLE/TLA) memorandum. Using the Property Management System (PMS),
the guest will be registered in the Wait List Module and assign them a CL or NA room type.
Reference the PMS wait list account number on the provided TLE/TLA memorandum. (T-3).

3. All foreign personnel must pay lodging room rates directly to the lodging office, except
International Military Education and Training (IMET) enlisted personnel. Lodging requests
reimbursement for IMET enlisted personnel through the host base foreign training office and
accounting and finance office. Invoices must list names, nationality, and number of days that
lodging was provided, and total amount of charges. Lodging must also furnish a copy of each
student’s travel orders. (T-3).

4. IMA members will pay all lodging charges, regardless of type of duty performed (i.e., active
duty, AF Form 938, Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour;
inactive duty for training, AF Form 40A, Authorization for Individual Inactive Training, per diem
status, or location where the duty is performed (i.e., at or away from the assigned unit/man-day
assignment). IMA members must file for reimbursement through IMAT-OL/FMFPT
(Consolidated Accounting and Finance Office, Travel Section), 1392 Second Street, Dobbins ARB
GA 30069-4823. (T-3).

5. Lodging managers who have other groups requesting reservations more than 60 days out will
work with the ARC wing/unit lodging POC to maximize occupancy in Lodging facilities. When
quarters are in short supply on a routine basis, Lodging and the ARC unit should work together to
negotiate with a commercial hotel for quarters at or near the Base Lodging rate. (T-3).

6. Unit-assigned Air Force Reserve personnel in an active duty status, to include annual tours
(AT) in a per diem or non-per diem status, performed at home station or away from home station,
will pay all lodging charges and file for reimbursement on a travel voucher. (T-3).

7. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status away from home station will pay their own
lodging costs and file for reimbursement. (T-3).

8. Unit-assigned Reserve personnel in an IDT status at home station will not pay for their own
lodging. The unit of assignment will pay all lodging room charges via an organizational credit
account (e.g., Government Purchase Card (GPC)). Refer to Attachment 2 for billing procedures.
(T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                            25


9. Air National Guard (ANG) members in an active duty status for AT in a non per diem status
will pay for on-base lodging or CL. ANG members will file for reimbursement through their
unit of assignment. (T-3).

10. Air National Guard members in an IDT status will not pay their lodging room charges. The
unit of assignment will pay IDT lodging charges via an organizational credit account (e.g., GPC).
Refer to Attachment 2 for billing procedures. For Geographically Separated Units (GSUs), Air
National Guard and Reserve lodging is provided in accordance with the Inter-Service Support
Agreement and Host Tenant Support Agreement. (T-3).

NOTE: For payment procedures concerning individual and unit-assigned Air Force Reserve
personnel, contact AFRC/A1SP (Programs Division, Services Directorate), Robins AFB GA,
DSN 497-2103. For Air National Guard billing procedures, contact Air National Guard,
Services Plans Division NGB/A1SC, Andrews AFB MD, DSN 612-7155. (T-3).

11. Contract personnel traveling overseas are lodged according to the contract provisions and
the host-nation Status of Forces Agreement. For CONUS and OCONUS, AFPC Lodging
Program will provide a letter of identification for those personnel with centrally managed
contracts if they do not have a Common Access Card (CAC). Lodging managers will coordinate
with the contracting authority to provide LOIs for personnel of non-centrally managed contracts
if they do not possess a CAC. (T-3).

12. If space is available for these guests, confirm their reservation as a Priority 1 status for the
duration of their stay. (T-3).

13. Unless otherwise covered by other rules in this table.

14. Military includes US Coast Guard members.

15. Retirees who are evacuated to a Medical Treatment Facility in the United States are
considered Priority 1 and thus allowed to make confirmed lodging reservations for the duration
of their stay. (T-3).

16. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) cadets participating in the Operation
Air Force Program and the Base Visit Program are not in a per diem status. They are not
charged for services provided (except for incidental expenses, e.g., sundries, phone charges,
etc.). They are not assigned to CL without prior approval from AFROTC/DOSR.
Reimbursement for lodging room rates is accomplished as follows: For the Operation Air Force
Program, collect a copy of each cadet’s orders, indicate the daily service rate and estimated
number of nights’ stay and fax a copy of the cadet’s orders to AFROTC/DOSR at DSN 492-7003
or commercial (334) 953-7003, within 5 days after checkout. AFROTC/DOSR will provide a
Government Travel Account (credit card) number to pay for room charges. Upon checkout, fax
a copy of the paid bill/receipt to AFROTC/DOSR. For the Base Visit program, fill out the
information at the bottom of the cadet’s special orders, where it says, “note to lodging facility,”
and fax a copy to AFROTC/DOSR. All other procedures are the same as the Operation Air
Force Program. (T-3).

17. Every attempt must be made to house United States Air Force Academy Cadets on base. If
there is no on-base room availability during the proposed TDY dates, these cadets may be
authorized CL with approval from the cadet liaison officer. CL costs will be paid directly by the
individual cadet. (T-3).

18. See paragraph 4.7. for guidance on payment procedures.

19. (ANG) Eligible unaccompanied personnel are members who reside outside the 50 mile
commuting distance and may use the lodging accommodations at no expense for IDT. (T-3).

20. (ANG) All full-time employees at the assigned ANG installation (AGR) are considered to be
living within the commuting distance. The unit is not authorized to pay lodging for ANG
members employed full-time (AGR) for IDT unless required by military necessity (e.g., alert,
mobilization). This excludes all Title 5 Technicians assigned to the installation. (T-3).

21. (ANG) The unit may authorize lodging accommodations for non-eligible ANG members at
no cost to the members due to inclement weather. (T-3).

22. (ANG) On-base lodging or CL may be provided to eligible members arriving the night
before the first IDT. (T-3).

departing duty assignment location, not PCS en route (traveling to new duty assignment).
Personnel on a PCS in or out of the local area (i.e., Recruiters, regardless of service) will be
considered Priority 1 for assignment in the TLF at the installation closest to their office location
regardless of their host base of assignment. Military personnel leaving or returning from 179
days or more deployment to the AOR will be given the same consideration as PCS personnel.

                                            Chapter 3

                     RESERVATION AND CHECK-IN/OUT PROCESS

3.1. Reservation Process for On-Base Lodging. The reservation process is typically the
guest’s first encounter with the lodging operation. Therefore, lodging personnel who accept
reservations must be thoroughly trained to conduct this procedure as efficiently and smoothly as
possible. Air Force lodging accepts reservations for travelers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on
a first-come, first-served basis, without regard to rank. Lodging facilities operating less than 24
hours a day must have the capability to accept reservations via answering machines after normal
duty hours. Air Force military TDY personnel must use on-base lodging when available unless
waived for military necessity, and will make advance reservations when traveling to an Air Force
installation. Reservations can be made via a traveler’s home installation’s servicing commercial
travel office (CTO) or by contacting an Air Force Inn directly. The Air Force Inns Directory can
be found at: http://www.dodlodging.net for public access. This directory can also be used to
make direct online lodging reservations. Guests may also make CONUS reservations by calling
1-888-AF-LODGE (235-6343). Lodging managers must report all lodging phone number
changes to AFPC/SVI to immediately forward to AFPC Lodging Program.
   3.1.1. The JFTR/JTR requires official travelers to exercise the same care and regard for
   incurring expenses paid by the government as would a prudent person traveling at personal
   expense. (T-3).
   3.1.2. The JFTR requires uniformed service members on orders to a U.S. installation to
   check for Government Quarters availability at the site to which they are temporarily
   assigned. (T-3).
   3.1.3. Military and civilians traveling TDY should select the installation as their TDY
   location (i.e, versus a city) when requesting orders through DTS. (T-3).
   3.1.4. Guest reservations are booked by reserving room type space and not specific rooms.
   Reserving guest reservations by space versus room results in the most effective use of
   available quarters and the best customer service. There will be occasions where reservations
   will be needed for specific rooms such as for Distinguished Visitors, handicap rooms, or
   other unique situations. (T-3).
   3.1.5. Guests checked-in between 2400 and 0500 will be charged for the previous night’s
   stay. Guests requesting an “early check-in” and reserving a room for the day prior to their
   arrival may be assessed an early check-in fee, regardless of their actual arrival time. Guests
   checking in after 0500 will be charged for the current day’s stay. (T-3).
   3.1.6. Newly inducted enlisted members undergoing processing, orientation, or basic
   training, including technical training at a base having both government dining facilities and
   lodging, are not authorized per diem or reimbursement for lodging room rates, and will be
   accommodated in permanent party housing. However, if members have attended a PCS
   school and are attending follow-on training and are entitled to per diem, lodging provides
   accommodations. (T-3).
   3.1.7. The installation commander reserves the right to refuse service to any guest for cause.
   (This responsibility may be delegated in writing to the lodging manager.) A memorandum
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      31


   for record (MFR) detailing the reasons for refusal should be sent to the Force Support
   squadron for review and filing. (T-3).
   3.1.8. The lodging office will house group travelers requiring team integrity at the same
   geographical location (all on base or all off base) when specified on the group members’
   travel orders. (T-3).
   3.1.9. (ANG) Eligible ANG members should advise the lodging manager or designated
   representative the Saturday of UTA prior to the next schedule training periods. This allows
   the ANG unit to secure the required rooms at a military lodging facility or CL. (T-3).
   3.1.10. (ANG) Eligible ANG members performing AT, at their assigned installation, must
   contact their lodging managers/Base Services Manager, or their unit lodging representative
   prior to making any reservations, and then follow the prescribed lodging plan for their ANG
   installation. (T-3).
   3.1.11. (ANG) Eligible ANG members wishing to share a room with ineligible dependents
   may do so provided there is neither an additional cost to the government nor a reduction in
   needed occupancy. The member will accrue all additional cost. (T-3).
3.2. VQ Reservation Process. At the time lodging confirms the reservation request, the staff
must inform TDY personnel whether their reservation is confirmed for on-base lodging or off-
base lodging. If on-base and CL accommodations are not available the guest has the option to
accept a (NA) number and find their own hotel or allow the front desk to assist them with
securing accommodations. The member is authorized CL if adequate lodging is unavailable on
base for the entire TDY period. The member is authorized a NA if on base and CL
accommodations are unavailable for the length of stay. If space becomes available in on-base
lodging after CL reservation confirmation or NA number issuance, lodging should make an
effort to maximize occupancy by attempting to notify the traveler of the change and encouraging
the traveler to stay on base. (T-3). NOTE: The traveler is not required to stay in on-base
lodging after he/she has received a NA number or been issued a CL reservation confirmation.
(T-3). NOTE: Managers will maximize the use of on base lodging for TDY-to-School students.
Students attending formal training funded with TDY-to-School dollars will make their
reservations as soon as their school tour is confirmed to maximize the use of on base lodging. If
lodging is unavailable, students will continue to attempt to attain on base lodging until 5 business
days prior to the start of the TDY. Schoolhouses making group reservations for classes will
request their group reservation as soon as the class dates are confirmed in order to maximize the
use of on base lodging. (T-3). NOTE: See Attachment 2 for ARC procedures for IDT
Lodging.
   3.2.1. Prior to the start of the FY, the lodging manager will obtain annual class schedules
   from the base training registrar or individual squadron training manager (as appropriate for
   each base) and make group reservations in the PMS for the projected classes (by class name,
   class number, and number of students). Lodging manager along with base training registrar
   or individual squadron training manager will review and update training schedules monthly
   for accurate forecasting of the next 3 months. (T-3).
   3.2.2. Before placing an official traveler in CL or issuing a NA number, lodging operations
   will assign guests to available room types that meet or exceed the minimum adequacy
   standards found in Chapter 1, Table 1.1. Lodging will assign enlisted personnel to Visiting
 32                                                           AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   Officers Quarters (VOQ) when Visiting Airman’s Quarters (VAQ) is full rather than sending
   them off base. Officers and civilians may be assigned to a VAQ when VOQs are full and the
   VAQ room meets minimum adequacy standards for officers and civilians. Lodging
   managers are responsible for controlling lodging rooms to ensure efficient use of all rooms
   and maximum occupancy. Lodging managers will review daily reports, e.g., arrivals report,
   departure report, reservations, etc., and make changes to reservations as necessary. The
   reservation staff will encourage guests to book the portion of their stay that can be
   accommodated on base at the time of “sale”. The goal is to accommodate the entire length of
   stay, but at the very least, accommodate them for the maximum amount of time a room is
   available. Lodging managers will also establish a tracking system to ensure guests are
   contacted at their off-base accommodations to provide them the opportunity to move back on
   base once space becomes available. (T-3).
   3.2.3. If a registered Priority 1 guest (on base, CL, or with a NA number) must extend the
   TDY period, lodging will consider this extension as a new requirement and handle it
   accordingly. The lodging manager will issue another NA number if on-base lodging or CL is
   not available for the extended TDY period. (T-3). NOTE: Lodging reservations for multiple
   tours (back-to-back) regardless of the type of duty performed are considered one requirement
   if made at the same time. Do not move personnel from one room to another when duty status
   changes. (T-3).
   3.2.4. When lodging authorizes CL, provide the traveler the name and phone number of the
   commercial hotel or motel within one duty day of the reservation request. (T-3).
       3.2.4.1. When authorizing lodging at a CL establishment, lodging will provide a letter of
       authorization identifying the traveler and verifying duty status. This authorization will be
       provided to the hotel/motel prior to the guest’s arrival (via fax, e-mail, etc.). The traveler
       is not required to go to lodging to pick up the letter of authorization. The CL
       establishment will develop procedures to provide the traveler a copy of this authorization
       at check-in. The CL agreement entitles duty status travelers to the agreed government
       rate for the specified period. The traveler retains this authorization and submits it with
       his/her travel voucher. (T-3).
   3.2.5. Per JFTR, Volume 1, government quarters are considered not available when the TDY
   is less than 24 hours. Therefore NA numbers are not issued in such circumstances. This
   should be stated on the member’s travel orders or the TDY member should note this on
   his/her travel voucher. (T-3).
       3.2.5.1. Lodging does not issue NA numbers to ARC units in an inactive duty, non-per
       diem status when at home station.
       3.2.5.2. The lodging manager issues NA numbers only if the installation is listed in
       AFMAN 34-102 as having lodging facilities available.
3.3. TLF Reservation Process. The maximum TLF stay for Priority 1 guests (members
arriving/departing PCS, separating, or retiring; hospital outpatients, friends/relatives of
inpatients, etc.) is 30 days if available. The lodging manager may adjust the maximum stay
considering PCS and hospital outpatient demand for lodging to maximize TLF availability for
Priority 1 guests. Guest may stay beyond the 30 day maximum on space available status pending
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     33


current occupancy and availability; however they must check-out of their Priority 1 status. (T-
3).
   3.3.1. PCS members on Permissive TDY for an advance house-hunting trip (e.g., not
   performed in conjunction with actual PCS move) are limited to ten days. In overseas areas,
   the lodging manager may grant extensions if this reduces TLA costs and does not create
   hardship for other potential guests. (T-3).
   3.3.2. If Priority 1 guests occupy all TLFs, and other Priority 1 personnel request TLFs the
   lodging manager keeps their requests on a standby basis for a reasonable time (PMS’s wait
   list), pending cancellation of reservations or early guest departure. Lodging fills vacancies
   from these standby reservations on a first-come, first-served basis before assigning personnel
   from lower priorities. (T-3).
   3.3.3. Lodging assigns families to CL on a voluntary basis when TLFs are fully occupied or
   adequate space is not available (lodging manager will determine if VQ space is suitable for
   family and other VQ guests). When the family is referred to CL or makes their own
   arrangements, lodging must register them in the PMS as a CL or NA room type reservation.
   (T-3).
3.4. Guaranteed and Non-guaranteed Reservations. Official duty travelers, i.e., TDY/PCS,
must use their government travel card (GTC) to pay all lodging room fees per Public Law 105-
264 unless exempt from GTC use (exemptions should be reflected on official travel orders). Any
reservation that is guaranteed for check in with a credit card and not checked-in by midnight will
automatically go into a “no-show” status when the night audit is run. At 0500 the guest services
representative will manually post the room charge in the guest’s folio. All guaranteed
reservations will be charged one night’s room rate when a guest fails to call and cancel their
reservation or does not show up to check into their room. All lodging guests must provide a
credit card when making their reservation (unless noted as an exception in Table 2.1 where the
lodging bill is not paid by the individual). If the guest (excluding the exception in Table 2.1)
does not provide a valid credit card at time of reservation, the guest must be informed the room
is not guaranteed beyond 1800 hours (use 1800 hold code in PMS). There will be individual
reservations where the duty guest (Priority 1) does not have a valid credit card to provide at time
of reservation and they are arriving after 1800. In this case, the manager must approve to hold
the reservation beyond 1800 (use manager code in PMS). Lodging will inform guests of the
cancellation/no-show policy when the reservation is made. (T-3).
3.5. Space-Available Reservations. Space-A reservations can be made up to 120 days in
advance, depending on the base occupancy and at the lodging managers’ discretion. Space-A
reservations for TLF can only be made up to 30 days in advance. (T-3).
   3.5.1. Priority 1 customers will not “bump” Priority 2 customers with confirmed
   reservations, nor will they bump them once they are assigned quarters (checked in) for a
   specific period of time, except in times of contingency, emergency, or when the installation
   commander determines higher priorities exist. A confirmed reservation may not guarantee a
   specific room type. (T-3).
   3.5.2. Space-available guests requesting lodging should be assigned to uncommitted (not
   occupied or reserved) lodging rooms upon arrival. Number of nights assigned is left up to
   local management discretion and should be based on forecasted occupancy or historical
 34                                                            AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   occupancy for the same time period. After 1800, lodging assigns all vacant rooms resulting
   from no-shows of personnel with non-guaranteed hold reservations to remaining Space-A
   guests on a first-come, first-served basis.     Space-available guests that cannot be
   accommodated on base should be offered assistance in locating off-base quarters. (T-3).
   3.5.3. Service members may confirm space available reservations for visitation periods with
   minor dependent children up to 110 days prior to stay regardless of local guidelines. Lodging
   managers may limit the duration of stay depending upon projected occupancy. (T-3).
3.6. Check-in and Checkout Process. The front desk staff has the opportunity to make a
lasting, favorable impression on the guest. The front desk staff will be proactive, attentive, and
professional, always striving to anticipate guests’ needs and “make things right” for them. (T-3).
   3.6.1. Front desk staff must acknowledge all guests (e.g., make eye contact, smile) and greet
   them in a professional, courteous manner. (T-3).
       3.6.1.1. Front desk staff must adhere to payment procedures outlined in Chapter 4,
       paragraph 4.7, asking the guest for a government identification card and a valid credit
       card (if applicable). (T-3).
       3.6.1.2. Validation of a guest’s Priority 1 status will be at the lodging manager’s
       determination but should be limited to times of high occupancy or question of the guest
       abusing Priority 1 status. A copy of the guest’s government travel orders can be politely
       requested. After review, the orders will be returned to the guest that is paying for room
       charges and not centrally billed. (T-3).
   3.6.2. Front desk staff must ensure that guests’ immediate needs (e.g., registration,
   information on Force Support activities/eateries, local points of interests, restaurants, etc.) are
   met in a friendly, efficient manner. (T-3).
   3.6.3. Front desk staff will provide guests with professionally made, easy-to-use maps,
   directing them to their rooms upon check-in (if the guest room is in a different facility from
   the reception center/registration desk). (T-3).
   3.6.4. At least one front desk staff member must be at the front desk at all times. (T-3).
   3.6.5. The front desk must be staffed 24 hours a day, AFPC Lodging Program has the
   authority to waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis. (T-3).
   3.6.6. Check-in and checkout must be completed as promptly as possible. Guests checking
   in with a reservation should be checked in within 3 minutes. Guests arriving without a
   reservation should be checked in within 5 minutes. Do not let a guest stand in line without
   acknowledging their presence. (T-3).
       3.6.6.1. Normal check-in time is 1400. However, guests may check-in at any time if
       rooms are available. Normal checkout time is 1100. AFPC Lodging Program may
       approve changes to these standard times due to local requirements on a case-by-case
       basis. A late fee equal to the daily room rate may be assessed, at the lodging manager’s
       discretion, for late checkouts. (T-3).
       3.6.6.2. At check-in, confirm the room type, rate, and departure date (mentioning
       checkout time). Do not charge guests a deposit for the room key or charge for lost keys.
       (T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    35


       3.6.6.3. At checkout, ask the guest if their stay was satisfactory. Offer guests with no e-
       mail address on file the opportunity to complete a customer comment card. Thank
       departing guests and give an appropriate farewell, such as, “I hope you enjoyed your
       stay.” (T-3).
       3.6.6.4. Management must ensure the express checkout envelope and insert are available
       and visible with the daily room rate for all transient aircrew and Distinguished Visitors
       (DVs) staying in on-base lodging. Where feasible, management should also provide
       express checkout envelopes in other quarter types. (T-3).
3.7. Group Registration Process. The lodging manager must establish procedures to
efficiently pre-block, assign rooms and check-in guests who are part of a group. This
registration may take place at a location other than the primary lodging reception center front
desk if the size of the group warrants it. (T-3).
3.8. Check-in and Out Luggage Storage. Lodging will provide guests secure luggage storage
service. Luggage storage rooms should be located in, or immediately adjacent to, the lobby.
Also, ensure the guest is made aware a luggage storage room is available for use if they arrive
before the normal check-in time, when no rooms are immediately available and on the day of
checkout, if necessary. Verify guest identification is on each item stored. Provide the guest with
a receipt for each item stored along with a properly filled out standard AF Inns luggage tag.
Provide luggage carts where feasible. (T-3).
3.9. Endorsing Civilian TDY Orders at time of Check-in. The lodging manager, or
designated representative, will endorse, sign and date TDY orders of all civilian employees who
occupy on-base government lodging to entitle them to limited use of Exchange and Force
Support facilities (Overseas bases follow local ration card requirements). This can be
accomplished with a rubber stamp containing the following statement: (“The individual’s
name”) is assigned to on-base government lodging at this installation for the period of TDY
indicated on these orders, and is eligible to use the base theater, Force Support activities, and
exchange facilities, as authorized by the commander, according to AFI 34-211 (I), Army and Air
Force Exchange Service General Policies, and AFI 34-101, Air Force Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation (MWR) Programs and Use Eligibility. (T-3).

                                           Chapter 4

           LODGING FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT

4.1. Fund Sources. Lodging operations, to include VQs and temporary lodging facilities, are
mission-sustaining functions, supported through a combination of APF and NAFs as prescribed
in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, and AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds. A
room amenities listing is located on the USAF Services Portal. Refer to AFI 65-106 for fund
purchasing responsibility. (T-3).
   4.1.1. (ANG) ANG Services (NGB/A1S) does not allocate funds to provide a lodging
   program at ANG installations. Each ANG installation providing lodging accommodations
   for IDT should annually include Operational and Maintenance (O&M) funds in their
   financial plan towards this program. Individual squadrons at the unit should include AT
   lodging funds in their military personnel (MilPers) funds in their annual financial plan for
   this program. (T-3).
   4.1.2. Unit personnel in AT status at their assigned installation will pay for their lodging
   expense utilizing their government travel card. (T-3).
4.2. Resource Protection. The lodging manager must ensure adequate procedures are
established and followed in accordance with AFI 34-202 to protect all lodging assets against
misappropriation, misuse, damage, or loss. This includes cash control procedures, physical
safeguards, key control, resale merchandise, and property control. Lodging managers will
consult their local security forces to determine the requirement for intrusion detection systems,
surveillance cameras, or duress alarms. (T-3).
4.3. Base Lodging Fund. Each base establishes a base lodging nonappropriated fund
instrumentality (NAFI) in accordance with AFI 34-201. The base lodging manager will manage
the lodging activity to meet the projected rate package budget approved by the Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force, Business Management Division (SAF/FMCEB). Each individual
base activity must perform to the approved budget and each base will have different net income
adjusted for depreciation goal based on the approved rate. The base Resource Manager (RM) is
the fund custodian. Financial Indicator Program is detailed in the USAF Services Portal. A BLF
is flagged at AF level when they fail to meet the budget goals. The base must submit a letter of
explanation defining the cause for not meeting the goal and a planned course of action though
AFPC/SVI to be forwarded to AFPC Lodging Program. (T-3).
4.4. Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF). The AFLF will fund the bases’ capital requirements
projects based on the standard replacement schedule, and will ensure their base lodging activities
meet financial standards. All capital requirements and expendable bulk equipment purchases
will be executed at the AFPC/SV level. Any base level purchase request will be routed for
approval to AFPC Lodging Program and funds certified by AFPC Financial Management. (T-3).
4.5. Transfer of NAF Property. The lodging manager, working with the Force Support
logistics manager, may transfer NAF-procured property to APF for maintenance when allowed
by AFI 34-201 and AFI 65-106. (T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    37


   4.5.1. Lodging NAF property may be transferred to other NAFIs on the same base or
   elsewhere as prescribed in AFI 34-201. (T-3).
   4.5.2. Recording the disposition of Lodging NAF property is in accordance with AFI 34-
   204, Services Property Management, AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial
   Management and Accounting; and AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Fund
   Financial Management and Accounting. (T-3).
4.6. Room Rates. The AFLF will recommend Air Force-wide room rates at the minimum
amount necessary to cover the cost of providing quality lodging facilities and service to
authorized guests. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Cost and Economics
(SAF/FMC), approves Air Force lodging rates. (T-3).
   4.6.1. Lodging will charge all occupants the same rate for similar accommodations,
   regardless of duty status or priority. The installation commander may waive the TLF room
   charge for additional units occupied by large families on PCS orders, but the TLF assessment
   must still be charged for each additional room used. (T-3). NOTE: The TLF waiver only
   applies to Priority 1 guests. Space-A guests will incur room charges for additional rooms.
   The TLF assessment charge must be paid in all cases. (T-3).
   4.6.2. Lodging operations will be managed so lodging NAFI cost centers are self-sustaining.
   The AFLF will manage funds for capital improvements. (T-3).
   4.6.3. Lodging will not charge more than the single occupancy daily rate for VQs
   accommodating two or more family members. If rooms are configured for double
   occupancy, and both guests are on official orders, each will pay their portion of the room rate
   regardless of room type (e.g., 2 official travelers - each is responsible for 50% of the room
   rate; 3 official travelers - each is responsible for 33% of the room rate). Guests sharing
   quarters not normally configured for double/triple occupancy will also split the room rate.
   (T-3).
   4.6.4. AFPC Lodging Program, in coordination with the AFPC Financial Management, will
   prepare lodging room rate determination packages biennially and submit them to AF/A1S for
   review. Room rates will be sufficient to pay operating expenses, annual capital requirements,
   surcharge, and TLF user assessments. (T-3).
   4.6.5. At overseas operations experiencing financial difficulty due to currency fluctuations,
   service charges may temporarily be increased. Route requests for a temporary increase to
   service charges to AFPC Lodging Program for approval. Service charge increases will be
   reviewed every 90 days, not to exceed 360 days. If at the end of that time frame the increase
   is still required, AFPC Lodging Program will request a separate rate through SAF/FMCEB.
   (T-3).
4.7. Payment Procedures. All Air Force lodging guests must pay the established daily room
rate for their assigned room type. All lodging guests must provide a valid credit card and
government identification card for verification purposes at time of check-in. It will be the
Lodging manager’s decision on what the check-in payment process will be, however the long-
term guest still need to make payment every 15 days. This policy applies to priority one and two
status guests. Guests who do not have a valid credit card at check-in will adhere to the same
payment process noted above by paying for 30 days of stay up front. These guests must also
provide their social security number or Foreign Service number, which must be annotated in the
 38                                                        AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


PMS. (T-3). NOTE: The exception to these procedures is unit paid bills for Reserve and Guard
personnel and aircrew under Air Mobility Command Transportation Working Capital Fund
(TWCF) at authorized locations only. Reserve component units must pay using a GPC or
centrally billed account within 20 days of stay (checkout day). AF Form 616, Fund Cite
Authorization (FCA), and DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR)
may be accepted from Air Force and other DoD agencies on a case-by-case basis with prior
management approval. When possible, the preferred method of payment is the GPC. There will
be incidents where base leadership directs lodging to house scouting groups, air show
participants, emergency snow removal crews, spouse abuse victims, etc. Lodging will not
provide rooms without payment and the manager must work with base leadership to establish an
Operating Instruction defining proper payment source for room and incidental charges.
   4.7.1. At time of check-in all guests will electronically or manually sign the guest
   registration form. (T-3).
   4.7.2. (ANG) Group travel reservations can be made with the unit’s Centrally Billed Unit
   Reservation Account (CBURA); however, each individual will pay their lodging expense.
   The CBURA is not intended to have expenses charged to this account. The sole purpose of
   the CBURA is to reserve lodging accommodations at CL establishments. (T-3).
   4.7.3. (ANG) The TEC, CRTCs and RTS will develop their own procedures for establishing
   group travel reservations. Methods of payment for lodging at the TEC, CRTCs and RTS will
   be established by local policy, and may include, but not limited to such things as GPC, GTC,
   checks, cash and MIPR’s. (T-3).
4.8. Financial Planning. The planning and budgeting process helps the lodging manager
forecast revenues, program expenses, and budget capital requirements. Managers will work with
the RM to develop annual NAF and APF operating budgets in support of the Lodging Rate
Package. AFPC Lodging Program will assist with annual NAF requirement budgets for room
renovations to be purchased by AFLF, which include capital fixed asset items and those meeting
bulk purchase criteria. Managers will also submit an annual capital requirements budget for
items over $1,000 to be purchased at base level, but approved by AFPC prior to purchase. The
Base Lodging NAFI must operate to the standard determined by the most current SAF/FMC
approved budget for that lodging NAFI. Under the AF single rate concept it is acceptable for a
lodging NAFI to operate at a loss. The approved installation budget for the Lodging fund will be
maintained and posted by AFPC Financial Management. This is the budget managers must use
on a day to day basis to achieve their financial indicator goals as established in Financial
Indicator Program Standards guidelines. Budgets provide good forecasts but must be reviewed
at least quarterly to ensure business assumptions and performance expectations are considered
and properly reflected. (Refer to AFI 34-201, AFI 34-202, AFI 34-209, and AFMAN 34-212,
Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets) Budget changes can be made to future quarters,
but not the current quarter. Budget changes must be reviewed by the RM and FSS
commander/director before submission to AFPC Lodging Program for review. The Lodging
Program will forward the tentative changes to AFPC Financial Management for further review
with final approval by SAF/FMCB. For more detailed information on the appropriate fund
source refer to AFI 65-106 or the Room Amenities spreadsheet found on the USAF Services
Portal. Managers must brief the local NAF Council on all budget submissions as well as budgets
approved by AFPC. (T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    39


   4.8.1. Capital Requirements Planning Standards Guide. AFPC Lodging Program will
   develop a standard Capital Requirements Planning Standards Guide and distribute it to all
   bases. Lodging managers will develop and maintain a 5-year capital improvement plan
   approved by the AFPC Lodging Program. The capital improvement plan will be verified
   during the Air Force Inns evaluation. Lodging managers will also participate in the
   installation Quarters Improvement Committee meetings and ensure lodging’s capital
   improvement requirements (facilities, furnishings, and equipment, both APF and NAF) are
   adequately addressed in the Installation Quarters Improvement Plan (see AFI 32-6005,
   Unaccompanied Housing Management) and made known to the Civil Engineer’s Furnishings
   Management Office (FMO) and base senior leadership. It is important to execute approved
   annual capital requirements in a timely manner to maintain quality lodging facilities,
   furnishings, and equipment. It is critical to ensure APF furnishings and appliance
   requirements are worked closely with the FMO to allow adequate lead-time for ordering,
   receiving, warehouse storage (if necessary), and delivering lodging items in time for
   beneficial occupancy dates of lodging facility renovations. Refer to AFI 32-6004,
   Furnishings Management, for more detailed guidance regarding facility and furnishings
   standards, individual responsibilities, budget requirements, warehouse management,
   furnishings accountability, and appliance management. (T-3).
   4.8.2. Any revenue generating operations, outside of core lodging, such as a shuttle service,
   must be operated as a MWR activity. If lodging manages the operation, follow guidance in
   AFMAN 34-214 on Management Fee Agreements. Any no-fee service, such as an on base
   courtesy shuttle, is permitted IAW AFMAN 34-214. (T-3).
4.9. Operating Expenses. Lodging managers should consistently monitor and manage the
operating cost per occupied room (CPOR). Labor is the single largest and most controllable
expense item impacting CPOR. Bases must follow the staff guide established per base by AFPC
Lodging Program (the staff guide is provided on the USAF Services Portal). Any exceptions to
the posted staff guide must be approved by AFPC Lodging Program. (T-3).
4.10. Sundry Sales. Snack and beverage sales are required guest services. Installations are
encouraged to use their MWR or Army and Air Force Exchange Service activities to provide this
service. (T-3).
   4.10.1. Lodging managers will ensure every guest has a reasonable opportunity to obtain
   sundry items 24 hours a day. In most operations, this can be accomplished using a
   combination of front desk sales and vending machines strategically located throughout the
   lodging facilities. In those rare instances where building layout precludes vending machines,
   room stocking may be used. The final determination will be based on providing quality
   customer service and not the convenience of the lodging staff. Lodging managers will
   control and structure pricing so the gross margin from sales is sufficient to cover the cost of
   goods and labor. Lodging managers must continue to provide beverage items in business
   suites. Sundries in the business suites will be inventoried and restocked daily (including
   weekends). (T-3).
   4.10.2. Post charges to guest folios in a timely manner. To enhance internal controls, use the
   standard 3-part inventory form where one copy is left with the guest, another is sent to the
   front desk to update the folio, and the third is used to update the storeroom files. (T-3).
 40                                                           AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


4.11. Long Distance Telephone Calls. Charges for long distance telephone calls must be
continuously monitored; if the telephone system does not interface with the PMS and
automatically update folios, lodging personnel must manually post charges to the guest’s folio as
calls are made. (T-3).
4.12. Lost and Found. The lodging manager must establish efficient procedures and operating
instructions for the effective handling and return of lost and found items to their rightful owners.
AFPC Lodging Program has an Operating Instruction (OI) template for Lost and Found, located
on the USAF Services Portal. (T-3).
   4.12.1. Store all items in a secure area. Lodging employees must use the Lost and Found
   module in PMS to track lost and found property. Every attempt should be made to contact
   guests as soon as possible regarding forgotten belongings. Guests are responsible for all
   postage charges incurred when items are returned. Lodging will contact guests to verify
   payment method and shipping instructions. (T-3).
   4.12.2. In the event a guest intentionally leaves an article(s) behind, refer to the Intentionally
   Left Behind program located on the Air Force Portal. (T-3).
4.13. Automation. All Air Force lodging operations are fully automated. All reservation,
registration, accounting, online comment cards, and management functions must be utilized
through the automated enterprise system referred to as the Defense Lodging System (DLS).
When situations arise such as power outages, maintenance downtime, etc., manual procedures
must be followed. All manual forms must be accounted for and controlled. Samples of manual
forms can be found on the USAF Services Portal. All lodging personnel must adhere to the
Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards by protecting guest’s personal data. (T-
3).
   4.13.1. The guest’s social security number will only be collected if the guest doesn’t provide
   a valid credit card at check in. Guest credit card and social security numbers will be
   encrypted in the PMS. Only management will have access to the unencrypted credit card or
   social security number in the PMS. (T-3).
   4.13.2. All manual forms containing guest credit card or social security number information
   must be cross-cut shred, incinerated or pulped. This task must be completed immediately
   after entering the guest information into the PMS. If not, properly secure the form in a
   controlled, locked safe until this task can be performed. Management must document and
   sign the form control log indicating the form was properly destroyed. (T-3).
   4.13.3. The only approved electronic reservation system is through the dodlodging.net
   website. Lodging will not maintain any type of local reservation system through websites.
   This type of system does not meet Air Force security accreditation requirements and could
   exploit the guest’s personal data. Refrain from asking for guest’s credit card information by
   e-mail. (T-3).
4.14. Marketing. In conjunction with the marketing office, Air Force lodging operations will
develop a marketing plan and work with other Force Support activities (e.g., golf course, marina,
outdoor recreation, ITT, clubs, etc.) to promote all Force Support operations. (T-3).

                                             Chapter 5

                        EMPLOYEE STANDARDS AND TRAINING

5.1. General Management Requirements and Responsibilities. The Lodging manager sets
the tone for the entire lodging operation and will ensure adherence to this Air Force Instruction
in the lodging operation for which he/she is responsible. The manager will ensure consistent,
quality service to meet customers’ expectations every time they stay at an Air Force Inns
establishment. To ensure customers have the opportunity to use our online comment service,
managers will ensure the reservation agent/desk clerk is capturing the guests e-mail address in
the PMS preferably during the initial reservation or during the check in process. The reservation
agent/guest service representative will politely ask for the e-mail address: "After your stay with
us we would love to get your feedback - Will you provide a work or home e-mail address so we
can e-mail you our online comment card?” DV guests in the grades O-7 through O-10 or their
civilian equivalent, serving actively or retired, will not be asked to provide an e-mail address and
one will not be kept on file. If guests elect not to participate, fill in the PMS e-mail address with:
noemail@noemail.com. Guest comment cards will be reviewed, tracked and responded to via
phone call or e-mail as appropriate. Lodging managers will conduct semi-annual self-
assessments of their operations using the AF Lodging Standards Checklist posted in the USAF
Services Portal. (T-3).
5.2. Dress and Appearance. All lodging employees will wear the Air Force Lodging standard
uniform. Each employee should be issued an adequate number of uniforms to perform their
duties and uniforms should fit appropriately to provide a professional appearance. Management
will provide written guidance detailing proper uniform wear and personal hygiene standards.
Lodging managers and assistant managers may wear either AF standard uniforms or business
attire. Costs for business attire will be the responsibility of the individual and will not be
purchased with lodging funds. NAFs will be used for the purchase of NAF civilian uniforms
(AFI 65-106, table 6.1. Lodging Application of Funds). Nametags will display either the USAF
Services logo or the local Force Support logo (depending on local logo policy). Those items
allowed embroidery will be the Air Force Inns logo and will not be customized. Refer to the
USAF Services Portal for guidance on required items, logo location and specific Air Force Inns
uniform standards. Military personnel assigned to lodging will wear the appropriate military
uniform. (T-3).
5.3. Employee Recognition Program. All bases are required to have an active employee
recognition program to include having a written OI. The program can be monthly or quarterly,
but cannot just be an annual event. This can be a lead into the squadron quarterly awards.
Lodging should ensure internal awards focus on all functional areas. The lodging award
program may submit to the squadron quarterly awards program but the squadron’s program will
not substitute for lodging’s award program. (T-3).
5.4. Training Standards. All employees will receive recurring training particular to their jobs
(task training), as well as customer service techniques to guarantee consistent, courteous, and
professional service to all guests. Managers must use the AFPC Lodging Program approved
web-based training program for use in Air Force Lodging. Lodging managers may receive
assistance in obtaining training materials from AFPC Lodging Program. All lodging employee
training will be documented using the appropriate forms. In addition, training for military

       training must be accomplished with the employees first day of hire. This training may be
       accomplished by the Force Support Squadron training section. (T-3).
       5.4.1.2. Lodging Specific Training: This training is intended to focus on the professional
       hospitality and lodging progression and will be accomplished by lodging staff. Training
       time is determined by the department manager and based on employee performance. (T-
       3).
          5.4.1.2.1. Initial training on blood borne pathogens exposure control (to include
          policies, procedures, and equipment) for all employees whose normal duties include
          the possibility of occupational exposure to blood and other bodily fluids
          (Occupational Safety and Health Administration annual training requirement). This
          training must be accomplished with the employees first three days of hire. (T-3).
          5.4.1.2.2. An entire lodging operation overview, to include reservations, front desk
          operations, housekeeping and maintenance. New lodging front desk, reservation and
          administrative personnel must be trained on the PMS by accessing the centralized
          training websites and the online Computer Based Training website. This training
          must be done within the first two weeks of the employees start date. (T-3).
          5.4.1.2.3. New personnel will be given a lodging operations tour, to include all types

          familiar with eating establishments within the immediate vicinity. (First Quarter). (T-
          3).
5.5. Professional Certification. The Air Force recognizes the importance of life-long learning
and continuing professional development. The lodging manager is encouraged to have (or be
working toward) professional certification, such as the Certified Hotel Administrator
designation, and accomplish the necessary actions to keep the designation current. Other staff
members are also encouraged to pursue certification in their specialty. (T-3).
5.6. Training Workshop. Lodging managers and assistant managers must attend the Lodging
Manager’s Course at AFPC/SV within 12 months of initial assignment and are encouraged to
attend refresher training every 5-8 years. Lodging managers should maximize use of the
AFPC/SV courses such as the Lodging Operations courses, and any specialty training like

education opportunities. (T-3).
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    45

                                     LINEN EXCHANGE

6.1. Operation. Military manpower positions to operate a centralized linen exchange point are
not authorized. Bases have three options to support the base linen exchange requirements.
Option one: Establish a contractor operated centralized linen exchange point, normally using
the same contractor that is awarded the base linen/laundry contract. Option two: Establish a
NAF operated centralized linen exchange point with an established Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA) to provide APFs to reimburse the NAFI incurring the expense. NAF personnel would
normally be assigned under the base lodging operation. Option three: Eliminate the central
linen exchange point and establish decentralized pickup and delivery points, normally at each
organization requiring linen exchange. Under Option three, since there is no manned central
exchange point, each organization would be required to be trained as quality assurance
evaluators (QAE) to monitor their part of the commercial linen contract. A standard
Performance Work Statement (PWS) to establish Options 1 and 3 and an MOA sample for
Option two can be downloaded from the USAF Services Portal under Lodging. (T-3).
6.2. Authorized Items. The following items are authorized to be washed or dry cleaned at the
expense of Air Force APFs:
   6.2.1. Government-property linens and items, such as sheets, pillow cases, blankets, towels,
   mattress covers, and others, bought with APFs and issued to or used by organizations,
   activities, and individuals.
   6.2.2. Government rugs, upholstery, and drapes. (T-3).
   6.2.3. Organizational items and special or distinctive clothing or equipment issued to
   military or DoD civilian personnel. (T-3).
   6.2.4. Linens purchased with APFs (linens on NAF accounts must be cleaned using NAFs).
   (T-3).
   6.2.5. Shop wiping towels, cloths, and rags (cost analysis should be made first to decide
   which is less expensive, cleaning or buying new shop wiping towels, cloths, and rags). (T-
   3).
   6.2.6. Authorized uniform items that need water-repellent treatment. (T-3).
   6.2.7. Clothing of prisoners kept at a base in a non-pay status. (T-3).
   6.2.8. Clothing required for burial of deceased active duty personnel. (T-3).
   6.2.9. All soiled personal clothing items (serviceable items only) of deceased active duty
   personnel or personnel declared missing must be washed or dry cleaned, as needed, before
   they are sent to the next of kin. The commander (or the summary court officer) of the
   deceased or missing person must sign a certificate for payment from local O&M
   appropriations stating the following: I certify that the items listed are the personal items of
   (name, grade, and social security number), who are deceased (or missing), and that the
   cleaning costs should be paid from appropriated funds. (T-3).
 46                                                        AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   6.2.10. Uniforms soiled as a result of honor guard duty. A letter authorizing cleaning,
   signed by the honor guard commander, must be kept on file in linen exchange for all honor
   guard members desiring this service. (T-3).
6.3. Centralized Linen Exchange Point. If a base maintains a central pickup location using
Option one or two above, then base linen exchange provides the Base Exchange point for all
items authorized in paragraph 2. At bases with an Air Force laundry and dry cleaning plant, the
plant should serve as the linen exchange function point. (T-3).
   6.3.1. Contingency/Wartime Operations. In the event of an emergency situation, natural
   disaster or wartime situation, the Force Support Squadron Commander/Director through the
   installation commander, can expand the authorized customers or items the central linen
   exchange can process. (T-3).
   6.3.2. Managing Linen Inventory. Maintain only enough items to meet scheduled
   exchanges, replenishment of worn out and damaged items, and a justifiable reserve for
   emergencies. Emergency requirements will be determined by referring to your base
   Operating Plans (OPlans) as referenced in AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary
   (BAS&E) Site Planning, Attachment 16, Tab B. Keep records of items released and returned
   using the Daily Linen Exchange Transactions spreadsheet located on the USAF Services
   Portal under Lodging. Linen operations can also use other electronic means in place of the
   Daily Linen Exchange Transactions spreadsheet.
       6.3.2.1. Inventory Procedures. Perform a complete inventory semiannually, on the last
       workday of March and September. Prepare two copies of AF Form 905, Linen Exchange
       Inventory Report. Instructions for completing the form are available on the USAF
       Services Portal. This report is maintained locally. (T-3).
          6.3.2.1.1. Set up a control register (AF Form 115A, Register of Control Numbers) to
          support posting to AF Form 2009-1, Manual Supply Accounting Record. Keep
          supporting documents with the control register. On 1 October each year, voucher
          numbers in numerical sequence are assigned to all documents affecting linen
          exchange accountability. (T-3).
          6.3.2.1.2. AF Form 85A, Inventory Count Card, is certified by the linen exchange
          manager and approved by the Force Support Squadron Commander or Director. (T-
          3).
          6.3.2.1.3. Use AF Form 2009-1 as the stock record for each line item. Use the
          entries on this form to document quantities on hand, on order, received, issued,
          inventoried, and adjusted. (T-3).
          6.3.2.1.4. Where administrative errors caused overages or shortages, use and attach
          AF Form 85A, to correct records. This form will be certified by the linen exchange
          manager and approved by the Force Support Squadron Commander or Director. (T-
          3).
   6.3.3. Salvage of Linen Items. Sprinkle uneconomical repairable linens with a distinctive
   dye. Dyed linens are issued to organizations (transportation, field maintenance, etc.) that
   normally use wiping and cleaning rags. Unserviceable linen is accounted for and issued
   intact (not torn into rags). Tearing items into rags is the responsibility of receiving
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      47


  organizations. Linen will be entered on the AF Form 2009-1 in the unserviceable column,
  until dyed and issued to an organization. (T-3).
     6.3.3.1. When issuing rags to organizations, fill out a DD Form 1348-1A, Issue
     Release/Receipt Document, as follows: (T-3).
         6.3.3.1.1. Assign a document number from the AF Form 2009-1 in Block 24.
         6.3.3.1.2. List item nomenclature ("rags-sheets," "rags-blankets," etc.) in Block 17.
         6.3.3.1.3. List national stock number in Block 25.
         6.3.3.1.4. List quantity in Block 26.
         6.3.3.1.5. Print authorized representative’s name and squadron/branch in Block 27.
         6.3.3.1.6. Obtain a signature from an authorized representative of the using
         organization in Block 22 and date received by representative in Block 23.
         6.3.3.1.7. Post quantity issued to AF Form 2009-1, showing the organization issued
         to in the transaction column.
         6.3.3.1.8. File posted copy of DD Form 1348-1A in document file.
         6.3.3.1.9. Turn in linen items no longer fit for their intended purpose and not suitable
         for conversion to rags to the local property disposal office or base supply using
         locally established procedures. Ensure the turn-in document is properly used to
         reduce the linen exchange account
  6.3.4. A departing linen exchange manager and the newly appointed manager transfer
  accountability by conducting a joint inventory of linen. Both managers prepare certificates
  of transfer (available on the USAF Services Portal) and sign them on the day they transfer the
  account. The original copy will be kept on file.

NAF Purchasing Agreement (NPA)— NPAs are limited primarily to prime sources exercising
full control over the product and its distribution. In addition, prices offered for the product do
not exceed the prices offered by the firm’s most favored customer for the same items under
comparable conditions. Representation is usually limited to three to four contractors per major
product category under our NPA program.
Non—Availability Numbers - Refers to no availability of government quarters or meals.
Lodging issues the TDY member a non-availability number when government lodging is not
available. (Nonavailability numbers are not issued when AFMAN 34-255, Directory of
Government Quarters and Dining Facilities, reflects that the installation does not have lodging
available.) The authorizing official determines if the TDY member may eat meals in the
government facility. The commercial travel office uses AFMAN 34-255, Directory of
Government Quarters & Dining Facilities, to determine the availability of government meals at
the TDY location; no written nonavailability of meals certification is required, and the full per
diem rate for meals and incidental expenses is authorized (DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 9,
Chapter 5).

  LODGING PROCEDURES FOR INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT-ASSIGNED RESERVE
PERSONNEL ON INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING (IDT), AND AIR NATIONAL GUARD
 PERSONNEL ON INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING OR ANNUAL TOUR (AT) STATUS

A2.1. Government Quarters. ARCs are authorized to pay (or reimburse) lodging for their
members in an IDT status only when government-controlled quarters, i.e., on-base lodging or
off-base CL are provided. Government lodging is authorized for ARC members traveling to
inactive duty training at a location more than 50 miles from that member’s residence.
A2.2. ARC Commercial Lodging Requirement. Contractual agreements must be established
with CL properties for GPC payment of off-base lodging. MOUs are not contractual agreements
and are not authorized for payment of lodging bills exceeding $2,500. Host-base lodging
activities responsible for reserving off-base CL for ARC members in an IDT status must
establish blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) through their Contracting Office. AFRC
organizations using the Automated Lodging Reservation System, ResNet, or other computer-
based programs for IDT lodging should establish their own through the host Contracting Office.
Every attempt should be made to establish BPAs with the same MOU CL properties of the host
base lodging activity.
A2.3. Multiple Duty Tours. Lodging reservations for multiple tours (back-to-back), regardless
of the type of duty performed, are considered one requirement when reservations are made for
the duration of tours. Do not move personnel from one room to another when duty status
changes. It is the responsibility of the ARC member to notify lodging when performing
multiple-duty tours. Failure to identify back-to-back tours could necessitate new reservations.
A2.4. Lodging Reservations. ARC members are required to make advanced lodging
reservations IAW paragraph 3.1. of this instruction,
   A2.4.1. Lodging management makes lodging reservations for ARC personnel for on-base
   and with CL establishments in accordance with established procedures.
   A2.4.2. Non-availability numbers will not be issued to unit-assigned ARC members in an
   inactive duty status. NOTES: IMA/IRR members may be given a non-availability number
   if on-base or CL is not available. However, these members must use government quarters for
   IDT lodging reimbursement (on-base, BPAs, CL) when performing duty on or near a military
   installation. Members should use www.gsa.gov/lodging for finding government lodging at
   non-military locations.
   A2.4.3. Each ARC Wing will appoint a wing lodging point of contact (POC). Inactive duty
   for training periods include Unit Training Assemblies (UTAs), rescheduled UTAs (RUTAs),
   additional flying training periods (AFTPs), and for AT (if applicable), etc.
   A2.4.4. The ARC wing/unit lodging POC at each installation will also provide lodging a
   copy of the wing’s annual UTA schedule as soon as it is finalized and approved (Jul-Sep time
   frame). Lodging will match the UTA schedule to create a group reservation for scheduled
   UTAs. Lodging managers who have other groups requesting reservations more than 60 days
   out will work with ARC wing/unit lodging POC to maximize occupancy in Lodging
   Facilities. Lodging will notify the ARC lodging POC of any problems in obtaining the
   required number of rooms/bedspaces. This allows the ARC commanders to reschedule
 56                                                          AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


   UTAs or, if necessary, lodging to establish requirements-type contracts for specific time
   periods. Installation Commander may waive on a case by case basis.
   A2.4.5. Within 5 working days after the UTA, the ARC wing/units will provide lodging a
   list identifying Reserve or Guard members who will require lodging for the next UTA.
   Lodging will input names and obtain contract CL, when needed within 5 working days from
   receipt of the UTA lodging list. (Exception: Reserve wings/units using the Automated
   Lodging Reservations System (ALRS).) Three days prior to the scheduled UTA, the
   wing/unit POC will update the list (revalidate), in writing, with any changes that may have
   occurred. Changes that occur after this notification (Wednesday, prior to UTA) will be
   worked on a case-by-case basis with the host lodging activity.
A2.5. Walk-In Policy. ARC members are required to make advanced lodging reservations.
Members who walk-in without making reservations may still utilize government quarters,
however, the wing/unit of assignment will not pay for lodging of members who fail to comply
with this directive. (EXCEPTIONS: New recruits, members returning from long deployments,
etc.) It is the wing lodging POC’s responsibility to ensure that all members are aware of and in
compliance with this policy.
A2.6. No-Show Reservations.
   A2.6.1. The ARC wing/unit guarantees payment for on-base and contract CL reserved for
   their members. Therefore, the wing/unit will be responsible for payment of quarters reserved
   (on-base and contract) and not used.
   A2.6.2. Lodging will check in all unit no-shows before the Friday night audit and provide a
   list of no-shows to the wing/unit lodging POC by 0900 on Saturday of the UTA. The
   wing/unit will notify lodging by check-out time (1100) on Saturday if the member will
   occupy quarters on Saturday night.
A2.7. ARC Wing Lodging Policy. Each ARC wing must establish a wing lodging policy to
include procedures identified in this attachment. It is essential to enforce walk-in and no-show
guidelines to ensure an accurate number of rooms are reserved for members performing their
UTAs and to eliminate the expenditure of funds for unused rooms and to maintain maximum
utilization of on-base quarters. Procedures must include commuting distance designation
determination, exception to policy procedures, disciplinary actions for those who abuse the IDT
lodging privilege, etc.
A2.8. Billing Procedures.
   A2.8.1. For on-base lodging bills, the base lodging accounting technician will ensure that all
   back-up documentation (AF Form 938, AF Form 40A, or unit lodging
   reservation/revalidation listing, plus all folios) to substantiate the charges are provided with
   each bill. For easier validation, bills may be broken out by unit of assignment. This portion
   of the process will be accomplished within 10 working days of the UTA. The ARC
   wing/unit lodging POC, together with the lodging accounting technician, will review the bills
   and ensure they are correct. Upon validation, the GPC or alternative payment method will be
   used to make payment. If discrepancies occur, lodging and the ARC lodging POC will work
   together to resolve the issue. This entire process will be accomplished within 20 working
   days from the UTA. NOTES: At least twice monthly, lodging prepares bills for other IDT
   lodging requirements, i.e., RUTAs, AFTPs, etc. These bills may be provided at the same
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 57


   time as the UTA bill, but must be documented separately. Payment is made via the GPC or
   an alternative payment method. An ARC member performing IDTs (other than regular
   UTAs) must provide a completed AF Form 40A or locally developed Reserve (ALRS)
   lodging form.
   A2.8.2. CL bills may be processed through the installation lodging manager, or sent directly
   to the wing lodging POC. Within 20 days of receipt, the ARC wing lodging POC ensures
   that payment is made.
   A2.8.3. When a unit-assigned Reserve member performs an IDT at home station in
   conjunction with an active duty tour, to include AT in a non per diem status, only the IDT
   portion is authorized for payment by the wing/unit of assignment. The member is
   responsible for payment of their lodging charges for all active duty tours regardless of per
   diem status.
   A2.8.4. When a unit-assigned ANG member pulls an IDT in conjunction with a per diem
   status tour, only the IDT portion is authorized payment by the unit of assignment. It is the
   responsibility of the member to present the paperwork for the IDT portion of the stay at
   check-in. The ANG member is responsible for payment of their lodging charges when in a
   per diem status. NOTES: For overseas deployments, the unit of assignment’s FM function
   may provide an AF Form 616 or other fund source document, to confirm that sufficient funds
   are available to cover the cost of on-base and/or commercial quarters for unit-assigned
   personnel, if requested by the overseas lodging general manager. The billing and payment
   process will be accomplished within 20 working days following the deployment.
A2.9. Payment Responsibilities. Procedures outlined herein apply to all Services unless
otherwise noted.
   A2.9.1. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).
      A2.9.1.1. IMA/IRR Lodging Payment. Individual (IMA/IRR) members will pay all
      lodging charges regardless of the type of duty status (active duty or inactive duty for
      training), location where the duty is performed, or per diem status, and file for
      reimbursement. (IMAT-OL/FMFPT, 1392 Second Street, Dobbins ARB GA 30069-4823,
      Customer Service – 1-800-808-5949, DSN (voice) 625-5800/3533, Commercial (voice)

      A2.9.1.2. Unit-assigned members performing active duty tours (AF Form 938)
      regardless of per diem status, are individually responsible for their lodging charges.
      Individuals will file for reimbursement (normal procedures apply).
      A2.9.1.3. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs away from home station (AF Form
      40A) are responsible for payment of their lodging charges and will file for
      reimbursement.
      A2.9.1.4. Unit-assigned members performing IDTs at home station will not pay lodging
      room charges. Lodging room costs (on-base and contract) for unit-assigned members
      performing IDTs at home station will be paid by the wing/unit of assignment via a
      Government Purchase Card (GPC). Billing to the wing/unit will be accomplished through
      an A/R account within lodging or contract lodging property. Payment for personal
      charges, i.e., telephone, in-room resale items, late checkout fees, etc., are the
 58                                                       AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


       responsibility of the member, and must be paid prior to being assigned lodging for the

   A2.9.2. Air National Guard (ANG).
       A2.9.2.1. Unit-assigned ANG members performing active duty tours, regardless of per
       diem status, are individually responsible for their lodging charges.
       A2.9.2.2. ANG members performing IDTs, regardless of location, will not pay for their
       lodging room costs. The unit of assignment will pay for on-base and commercial quarters
       via a GPC. Payment for personal charges, i.e., telephone, in-room resale items, late
       checkout fees, etc., is the responsibility of the member.
A2.10. UTA Unit Assistance. For unit-assigned members, the ARC wing/unit provides lodging
and/or CL managers with an ARC lodging monitor (wing/unit lodging POC or designated
representative), if requested. This individual will be available in the reception areas(s) on
training weekends to assist with peak check-in (and check-out) periods for unit-assigned
members, and to facilitate resolution of UTA lodging issues.
A2.11. For Guard and Reserve Components:
   A2.11.1. For AFRC situations, both IMA/IRR and unit-assigned, that deviate from these
   procedures, contact AFRC/A1RY, 155 Richard Ray Blvd., Robins AFB, GA 31098 DSN
   497-0341, prior to implementation.
   A2.11.2. For ANG situations that deviate from these procedures, contact the Air National

                         AIRCREW SUPPORT (PRIME KNIGHT)

A3.1. Aircrew Support Programs.
   A3.1.1. Special aircrew handling programs, such as Prime Knight, ensure high-quality and
   consistent lodging, transportation, and food service support to transient aircrews. The quality
   of service depends upon timely notification to the host program manager of aircrew
   requirements. The program is mandatory for all transient aircrews.
   A3.1.2. The installation commander appoints a program manager empowered with the
   authority to ensure transient aircrews receive transportation, lodging, and food service
   support. If a base has no Prime Knight program then AFPC Lodging Operation needs a letter
   from the Force Support Squadron Commander/Director authorizing no program. NOTE:
   These programs do not apply to bases that do not support flight operations.
A3.2. Functional Responsibilities.
   A3.2.1. AF/A1S. Serves as the Air Staff office of primary responsibility (OPR), reviews
   program assessments and MAJCOM reports (upon request), and in coordination with other
   Air Staff agencies such as Operations (A3O) and Transportation (A4TT) provides
   recommendations to the Air Force Chief of Staff.
   A3.2.2. MAJCOM/A1s will:
       A3.2.2.1. Coordinate MAJCOM staff guidance with other agencies (XO, LGT, etc.)
       A3.2.2.2. Implement the program command wide.
       A3.2.2.3. Conduct periodic assessments of the program.
   A3.2.3. Host installation commanders will:
       A3.2.3.1. Implement this instruction and approve local support plans and procedures.
       A3.2.3.2. Appoint a base program manager. NOTE: This program impacts several
       disciplines (e.g., Force Support, Transportation.) No single, functional entity is
       responsible for providing all the required services under this program. Therefore, the
       vehicle operations chief, lodging manager, or food service officer will not be appointed
       as the Prime Knight manager. Select this individual from an operations unit such as
       operations support, Air Mobility support, or command post.
       A3.2.3.3. Provide the resources required for a viable Prime Knight program.
   A3.2.4. Aircraft commanders/command and control agencies (or other MAJCOM designated
   agencies) will:
       A3.2.4.1. At the earliest opportunity, provide destination program managers with
       information required as indicated below:
          A3.2.4.1.1. Using a fax, telephone, message, or radio (HF), provide number of crew
          members by rank (e.g., 5 officers, 3 enlisted, estimated time of arrival (ETA), gender
          of crew by exception, and call sign/tail number if available). Upon arrival at the TDY
60                                                        AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014


        location, the aircraft commander provides a copy of the aircrew orders listing each
        member’s social security number to the program representative.
        A3.2.4.1.2. Cancel reservations to preclude “no shows” and guaranteed hold charges
        being assessed due to mission changes, weather diversions, etc.
  A3.2.5. Base Program Manager will:
     A3.2.5.1. Develop base aircrew handling program support plans and policies to provide
     transient aircrew with transportation, lodging, and access to meals.
     A3.2.5.2. Ensure a responsible individual meets each transient aircraft requesting Prime
     Knight service and provides appropriate transportation, keys, (or documentation) for
     lodging/rooms, and an information packet to the aircraft commander. NOTE: (The
     vehicle operator may be used for this task. Installations may set policy allowing the
     crews to pick up the information packet and keys at the command post or base operations
     if crews normally stop at these locations prior to going into crew rest. Under no
     circumstances will aircrews be required to pick up keys or other items from locations
     they would not normally transit (not applicable during contingency aircraft operations).
     A3.2.5.3. Ensure the welcome packet contains the following as a minimum:
        A3.2.5.3.1. Base information on meals, lodging, and transportation, lodging
        registration forms, or off-base lodging authorizations.
        A3.2.5.3.2. Program critique form.
  A3.2.6. Lodging Manager will:
     A3.2.6.1. Support the installation Prime Knight Manager by providing adequate rooms
     and efficient lodging guest service to transient aircrews when rooms are available.
     A3.2.6.2. Establish designated aircrew VQs when the volume of transient aircrews
     warrants.
     A3.2.6.3. Provide reservation capability during all normal operating hours (e.g., at 24-
     hour lodging operations, aircrews should be able to make reservations at any time during
     that period).
     A3.2.6.4. Pre-register the aircrew if assigned to on-base lodging. In addition, the lodging
     manager will block or assign rooms and assemble keys or put them in the information
     packet prior to the aircrew’s arrival. (On-base lodging will be used to the maximum
     extent possible to maximize mission execution and limit demand on support activities.)
     A3.2.6.5. Information packets will contain base information on meals, lodging, and
     transportation; lodging registration forms or off-base (commercial lodging) authorizations
     if necessary; area maps; and customer comment cards.
     A3.2.6.6. Assemble the necessary documents if the aircrew is staying off base. (NA
     forms, directions, etc.)
     A3.2.6.7. Establish an express checkout system for aircrews staying in government
     quarters.
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                61


     A3.2.6.8. Assign each crewmember to a single room (exceptions may be made during
     contingencies and alert operations). Aircrew members are defined as anyone on the flight
     crew order. Ensure gender is considered when assigning lodging to aircrews. Crew
     integrity will be maintained--all members of the same crew will be housed together,
     either all on base or all off base. Efforts should be made to lodge all crewmembers in as
     few locations as possible.
  A3.2.7. Food Service will:
     A3.2.7.1. Provide the program manager with menus and operating hours of the flight
     kitchen and base appropriated fund dining facilities for inclusion in the aircrew
     information package.
     A3.2.7.2. Respond to aircrew requests for meals.       (Use of the in-flight kitchen is
     sufficient to meet this requirement.)
  A3.2.8. Transportation will:
     A3.2.8.1. Meet the aircraft within 10 minutes of the time requested by the aircrew or
     applicable command and control system.
     A3.2.8.2. Provide authorized transportation to aircrew members during their stay.
     NOTE: Base shuttle or taxi services are considered adequate and may be used for this
     purpose but will not be used for initial pickups or departures.
     A3.2.8.3. Respond to the aircrew’s request for departure pickup at the established pickup
     time.
  A3.2.9. Base operations (or command post) will:
     A3.2.9.1. Track all inbound aircraft in the normal course of duties that might generate
     program requirements. If there is a change to either arrival time or number of crew
     members expected, base operations or command post personnel will notify the
     responsible agency/agencies as indicated in the installation program support plan. Base
     operations will provide these updates as soon as possible but not later than one hour, if
     possible, prior to scheduled arrival times.

                               CONTINGENCY QUARTERS

A4.1. Contingency Quarters. Contingency quarters are base facilities, designated by the
installation commander, used to beddown personnel deployed to and/or transiting a main
operating base (MOB) or geographically separated unit (GSU) usually in support of an exercise
or contingency operation. Permissive TDY personnel supporting officially sanctioned events
(i.e., sports teams, scouts, and JROTC groups) may be authorized to stay in contingency quarters
at the discretion of the installation commander as long as APF are used for all associated costs
(i.e., cleaning, furnishings, repair and maintenance, etc.). Installation commanders may
authorize use of contingency quarters for humanitarian reasons, such as natural disasters.
NOTES: When lodging facilities are converted in direct support of contingency or wartime
operations, Space-A lodging is not authorized. During real-world contingency operations, all
non-contingency personnel may be requested to vacate lodging to meet mission requirements. If
necessary, move current guests off base and change future reservations as necessary to
accommodate long-term TDY personnel on base. The lodging staff provides 24-hour locator
service for personnel in contingency quarters.
A4.2. Lodging Procedures during Emergency/Wartime Conditions. During emergency or
wartime conditions, lodging may be required to surge to meet contingency requirements.
Contingency quarters may be temporarily opened to accommodate large influxes of en route
TDY personnel who cannot be housed in regular base lodging accommodations. When the
mission requires excess appropriated facilities be opened to support the mission, the Force
Support unit will coordinate the activation with the Civil Engineering unit. At bases maintaining
appropriated facilities such as contingency quarters, Force Support will only manage the facility
when activated. Contingency quarters’ usages are an appropriated expense for the host wing,
and are managed by the Civil Engineering unit during downtime.
A4.3. Facility Management. Contingency facilities will be managed by Base Civil
Engineering Squadrons. Force Support personnel will only manage contingency quarters on a
day-to-day basis when supporting an on-going exercise or contingency operation that cannot be
accommodated in the existing lodging facility inventory. The MOB or GSU will be responsible
for managing contingency quarters if it’s within their capabilities as determined by the
installation commander. Services Unit Type Code (UTC) support should only be requested
when the operation is beyond the capability of the MOB or GSU. If UTC support is required,
ensure adequate personnel are included in the Services UTCs designated to deploy to the
location.
A4.4. Funding. APFs will be used for necessary purchases to support contingency quarter
operations. Air Force Lodging funds (AFLF) are not authorized to support contingency quarters.
When expending funds in support of contingency quarters, use the appropriate emergency and
special program (ESP) code for the exercise or contingency operation. If establishing a NAF
MOA for services, MIPRs (Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request) are not recommended
for payment as the timeline for the user to pay for any support given negatively impacts the
associated fund (AFLF or MWRF).
A4.5. Capability. The capability to beddown augmentation/contingency forces will be
identified using existing facilities and equipment (dormitories, family housing, etc.), or
AFI34-135 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     63


commercial quarters. When necessary, Force Support identifies furnishings requirements to the
base civil engineer (BCE). CE will provide minimal furnishings to meet contingency
requirements, such as excess FMO furniture from either the support base or within the region. If
surplus stocks are not available, FMO will purchase required furnishings from APFs as
necessary, using funds earmarked for specific contingency beddown operations when
appropriate. Force Support provides accountability for furnishings assets while they are in use in
contingency quarter’s operations. When fixed assets are insufficient or not available, War
Readiness Material assets will be used for planning surge capability for a main operating base
(MOB), collocated operating base, forward operating base (FOB), or bare base. In such cases,
primary bedding is sleeping bags that are clean, sanitized, and in good repair. All bases must
maintain separation between contingency quarter’s operations and lodging desk operations. All
bedspace assignments and terminations will be controlled separately between lodging and
contingency quarter’s operations. The lodging desk will operate in coordination with Personnel
Support for Contingency Operations to ensure accountability of deployed personnel. For further
guidance on planning factors, refer to the War Mobilization Plan (WMP1) Services Supplement
Aug 2006.
A4.6. Standards for Contingency Quarters. The policies are outlined in Air Force Pamphlet
(AFPAM) 10-219, V5, Bare Base Conceptual Planning, and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-
247V1, Guide to Services Contingency Planning: Beddown.
A4.7. Authorized Personnel. When the installation commander authorizes minors (i.e., scouts,
JROTC) to use contingency quarters, they must be in a separate area from any active duty and
adult occupants of the facility and be chaperoned by an adult of at least 18 years of age or older.
Personnel on routine, funded TDY orders, not associated with a contingency or wartime mission,
are not authorized to stay in contingency quarters. In addition, personnel on leave or otherwise
considered space-available in lodging are not authorized in contingency quarters. No fee will be
charged to use contingency quarters. Contingency quarters offer more protection from the
elements than a tent city and should be used to their maximum capacity before moving to a tent
city.
