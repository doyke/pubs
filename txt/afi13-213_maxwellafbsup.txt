                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for developing an Airfield Driving Program (ADP) to
   provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and/or
   operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g. military, DoD
   Civilians, Contractors, etc.) who, as a part of their job, are required to drive unescorted on an
   airfield.
   1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply with
   the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI).
   For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level instruction.
   1.1.3. In today’s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
   pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
   personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be involved
   with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft, vehicle or person
   enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of aircraft
   without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). Runway incursions have the
   potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While there are several factors
   involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these incidents result from a failure to
   follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training, and loss of situational awareness.
   Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-
   vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the airfield.
   1.1.4. Shared-Use Airfields. Airfield Management (AM) personnel at shared-use airfields
   (e.g. Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve units) must work with the civil airport manager
   to develop and implement local airfield driving procedures where applicable.
   1.1.5. Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield Authority
   (SAA) or equivalent, may authorize deviations to airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated.
      1.1.5.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
      should be by exception only and include a Risk Management assessment. Factors to
      consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of time the operation has
      been in place and available resources.
      1.1.5.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
      deviations to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, for an operational review.
      1.1.5.3. Provide the MAJCOM OPR for AO, or equivalent, an informational copy of
      approved deviations to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight,
      and developing area of responsibility execution activities.
1.2. Waivers, Recommended Changes and Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or
Procedures.
   1.2.1. Waivers.

       1.2.1.1. Waiver Authority. HQ AFFSA/A3A will provide waivers to this instruction
       only upon an official MAJCOM OPR for AO request when a requirement makes a waiver
       necessary or compliance with creates a hazard. HQ AFFSA/A3A grants waivers to this
       AFI for a period not to exceed two years.
       1.2.1.2. Waiver Process. AF IMT 4058, Airfield Operations Policy Waiver will be used
       to request waivers to this instruction. If additional space is required, annotate on plain
       bond paper and submit along with the form. Number each comment with the
       corresponding block number. In addition, units will submit an Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Assessment in accordance with AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
       Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools or alternate risk mitigation procedures with all
       waiver requests.
           1.2.1.2.1. All waiver requests to this instruction must be reviewed/coordinated on by
           the Wing Airfield Driving Program Manager (Wing ADPM), Airfield Operations
           Flight Commander (AOF/CC) and Wing Safety.
           1.2.1.2.2. The AOF/CC forwards the AF IMT 4058 through the Senior Operational
           Commander (e.g., OG/CC) to the MAJCOM OPR for AO, who will then
           review/coordinate and send to HQ AFFSA.
           1.2.1.2.3. Submit additional data (e.g., Letters of Procedure (LOP), airfield diagrams,
           etc.) to substantiate the waiver request as required.
       1.2.1.3. Submit waiver renewal requests to HQ AFFSA No Later Than (NLT) 30 days
       prior to expiration.
    1.2.2. Recommended Changes. Use the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
    Publication to submit recommended changes to this AFI. Recommended changes must be
    coordinated on by the Wing ADPM, AOF/CC and host Wing/CC or equivalent then
    forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for AO.               The MAJCOM OPR for AO will
    review/coordinate on proposed changes prior to forwarding to HQ AFFSA/A3A for final
    disposition.
    1.2.3. Issuing New Airfield Driving Policy or Procedures. In accordance with AFI 33-360,
    Publications Management Program, a Guidance Memorandum (GM) or Interim Change (IC)
    will be used to prescribe procedures and guidance pending revision of this AFI. New USAF
    procedures/guidance will be distributed through the MAJCOM OPR for AO. GMs and ICs
    will be posted on the AFDPO website until formalized in this publication.

       required to operate a vehicle on the airfield, must complete all airfield drivers’ training
       and testing requirements outlined in this AFI and the ADI prior to issuance of an AF IMT
       483. Note: An AFSC or career field training (e.g. aircraft maintenance, aircrew, fire and
       emergency services, security forces, transportation, etc.) is not a substitute for completion
       of airfield driving training and testing requirements outlined in this AFI.
       3.2.2.3. (MAXWELLAFB) EXCEPTION: Any government vehicle entering the
       airfield through Gate 1, directly adjacent to Base Operations, and only traveling to and
       from the “Red Carpet” in direct support of Distinguished Visitor arrivals or departures do
       not require an AF Form 483.
   3.2.3. Training criteria. Outline wing and/or base level airfield driving training
   requirements. All locally developed training curriculum and training materials, to include
   PowerPoint slides, videos, Computer Base Training (CBT), checklist(s), and lesson plan(s)
   used in training airfield drivers will be prescribed by the ADI. Include an OPR and currency
   date on training materials.

         will be conducted online at the Advanced Distributed Learning Services (ADLS) for
         those personnel with valid Common Access Card (CAC). The CBT on ADLS is
         located under “Course Lists/Misc/Airfield Driving” or as directed by AAFM should
         an updated version become available.
         3.2.3.3.2. (Added-M0AXWELLAFB) Those personnel without CAC will test
         through their ADPM. In this situation, Airfield Management (42 OSF/Airfield
         Management Operations) will extract the current version of the CBT, test information
         and the answer key from the online location. This course and testing information will
         be posted on the “share point” drive with the presentation and test accessed only via
         “permission required”. Airfield Management will grant this permission only to those
         ADPMs who have drivers without CAC. Airfield driver trainees must view the slide
         presentation and pass the test with a minimum score of 80%. Airfield Management
         will maintain the answer key and grade the tests when received from these ADPMs.

  test(s). Note: All base assigned personnel (e.g. military, DoD Civilian, Contractor, etc.)
  required to operate a vehicle on the airfield must pass all required test(s) prior to issuance of
  an AF IMT 483. Training and testing material should be made available in the predominant
  host nation language as applicable. Note: Written tests may be consolidated as long as the
  minimum test questions are covered and clearly defined by sections (e.g. General
  Knowledge, Communication, Runway Incursion Prevention, etc.).
     3.2.4.1. Coordinate tests with Wing Safety prior to implementation. Each test must
     include the OPR and currency date.
     3.2.4.2. Authority to administer tests may be delegated to the unit ADPMs in the ADI.

        airfield.
        3.2.7.1.2. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or Non-base assigned contractors are
        responsible for providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF IMT 483.
        3.2.7.1.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Vehicle/Aircraft Right of Way Procedures.
            3.2.7.1.3.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) When approaching or being approached
            by taxiing aircraft, exit taxiway/taxilane or move from aircraft path at next paved
            surface until the aircraft is well clear of your vehicle, time permitting. Give way
            to aircraft by at least 50 feet. If it is necessary to drive off the paved surface, the
            operator is responsible for checking the vehicle tires for any FOD material and
            ensuring all tires and the paved surface are clear of FOD. This check will be
            accomplished immediately upon returning to the paved surface.
            3.2.7.1.3.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Do not cross when an approaching
            aircraft is within 500 feet of your position, or until the aircraft has passed your
            position by at least 200 feet (500 feet for large aircraft).
            3.2.7.1.3.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Vehicles will not cross in front of an
            aircraft on hold unless signaled to do so by the pilot or instructed by Maxwell
            Ground via radio. Vehicle operators will never proceed between aircraft and a

            all areas within 100 feet from the edge of the runway to include taxiways, LZ and
            overruns. EXCEPTION: The portion of Taxiway Alpha from the North Ramp up
            to the hold line of the LZ is not part of the radio controlled movement area. These
            are areas of increased hazard and accident potential. Only vehicles being used to
            complete mission requirements are authorized to operate within the controlled
            movement area. Vehicles/personnel must establish two-way radio contact with
            Maxwell Ground to receive approval before entering the CMA. Communications
            must be maintained with Maxwell Ground for entire time personnel are in CMA.
            3.2.7.2.1.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Maxwell Ground has authority over all
            traffic entering the CMA and will issue specific instructions to control movement
            of aircraft, vehicles, equipment or personnel during published airfield hours.
            Airfield hours are normally: Mon-Fri 0800L-2200L and Sat/Sun 1000L-1800L.
            The airfield is closed on federal holidays. Note: The airfield often opens early or
            closes late on short notice due to DV or operational requirements. Uncontrolled
            operations are authorized for CAP aircraft only when coordinated in advance per
            LOA. Never assume the airfield is closed or not being utilized by CAP aircraft.
            3.2.7.2.1.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Radio contact with Maxwell Ground
            must be established before gaining access to, crossing or working in the CMA.
            Once Maxwell Ground approves access, radio contact will be maintained at all
            times while in CMA. If contact with Maxwell Ground cannot be made or is lost,
            advise Airfield Management to page Maxwell Ground on your behalf.
        3.2.7.2.2. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians must read back all ATC instructions
        verbatim.
        3.2.7.2.3. Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians must always monitor the appropriate
        radio frequency when in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency
        flashers when driving in the CMA.
        3.2.7.2.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent
        radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the ATCT. A hand-held radio
        should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
        vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
        3.2.7.2.6. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a
        distinct call sign (e.g., Airfield 1, Chief 1, Sweeper 1, TA 1, etc.) coordinated by the
        Wing ADPM to avoid duplicating, confusing, or different agencies using similar
AFI13-213_MAXWELLAFBSUP 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                     25


       names (e.g. Airfield 1, Airfield Lighting, Airfield Sweeper, etc.). Note: Do not use a
       call sign that is also a part of ATC phraseology such as “Taxi”.
          3.2.7.2.6.1. Include vehicle and/or pedestrian call signs in the ADI.
          3.2.7.2.6.2. For standardization, AM personnel will use the radio call signs listed
          below. Note: AM personnel at Joint/Shared-Use and host nation airfields may
          use different vehicle call signs to prevent duplication/similar call signs with local
          civilian airport operations personnel.
              3.2.7.2.6.2.1. Airfield Manager (Airfield – 1).
              3.2.7.2.6.2.2. Deputy/Assistant Airfield Manager (Airfield – 2).
              3.2.7.2.6.2.3. NCOIC, Airfield Management, NCOIC, Airfield Management
              Operations, NCOIC, Airfield Management Training and Airfield Management
              Operations Personnel or civilian equivalents (Airfield 3, 4, 5, etc.)
       3.2.7.2.7. Do not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when
       authorizing vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield
       inspection/check or other airfield operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic
       Control for additional information.
       3.2.7.2.8. Limit crossing the runway to vehicle operators/traffic performing mission
       essential duties and then only to an absolute minimum. Note: When crossing a
       runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the
       departure end.
       3.2.7.2.9. Identify procedures for emergency removal or exit of vehicles and/or
       pedestrians in the event of vehicle/ATCT radio failure. At a minimum, procedures
       will include the following:
       3.2.7.2.9. (MAXWELLAFB) Vehicle operators and/or pedestrians will follow
       procedures in AFI 13-213, paragraphs 3.2.7.2.9.1. – 3.2.7.2.9.2., in the event of radio
       failure.
          3.2.7.2.9.1. ATCT will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
          operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
          requires them to immediately exit the runway.
          3.2.7.2.9.2. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately.
          Contact ATCT or AM immediately and advise off the runway and include any
          pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to
          communicate with ATCT or AM via radio, use other means of communication
          such as a cellular phone (when available). Report incident to AM immediately.
       3.2.7.2.10. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Uncontrolled CMA Procedures.
          3.2.7.2.10.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) When the Air Traffic Control Tower is
          closed, the CMA becomes an uncontrolled movement area. Vehicles and other
          operators will use extreme caution when operating on the airfield due to the
          potential for aircraft landing and operating on the airfield at any time. Any
          activity on the airfield after hours will be coordinated through the BDOC at (953-
          7222) prior to accessing the airfield. Individuals will provide location, duration
26                                   AFI13-213_MAXWELLAFBSUP 3 DECEMBER 2013


            and type of activity performed. Individuals will also call the BDOC when they
            are off the airfield.
            3.2.7.2.10.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Airfield access is restricted to
            authorized personnel who have been trained and licensed to drive on the airfield
            (Maxwell AFB Airfield Certified, AF Form 483). Unqualified personnel must
            have a licensed escort and coordinate with AM during normal airfield operating
            hours or BDOC when closed, prior to entering the airfield.
            3.2.7.2.10.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Vehicle operators will attempt to
            contact Maxwell Ground prior to entering or crossing the runway or LZ. If there
            is no response, drivers will call BDOC at 953-7222 to verify the airfield and
            Maxwell Ground are closed. After verifying the airfield and Maxwell Ground are
            closed, the driver will make a general announcement of their activity (e.g. "CE
            ELECTRIC 1 is proceeding on Runway 15/33 at Taxiway Charlie"). Likewise,
            when drivers exit the runway or LZ, they will make an announcement that they
            are off the runway or LZ. If the airfield and Maxwell Ground are not closed, the
            driver must get permission before entering the runway or LZ. Personnel driving
            on the airfield during uncontrolled periods will maintain two-way radio capability
            and will monitor the appropriate tower/ground frequency at all times. Personnel
            will follow all airfield operating rules as outlined in this instruction even when the
            tower is closed. Crossing or entering the runways will be kept to an absolute
            minimum and will only be for performance of official duties. Access roads will
            be used whenever possible, even if that means taking a longer route. Drivers will
            ensure there are no aircraft in the immediate vicinity by performing a thorough
            visual check of the overhead traffic pattern and surrounding area. Operate vehicle
            emergency flashers/beacons while on the runway and LZ.
     3.2.7.3. Procedures and standards to use proper radio communications phraseology,
     discipline, and techniques. The words "clear" or “clearance” must not be used in
     communication with ATCT. Exception: Vehicle operators may reply “Loud and Clear”
     in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission quality or clarity. See Chapter 4
     for additional information.
        3.2.7.3.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Words that authorize access to CMA are
        “PROCEED” or “CROSS”. The word “HOLD” indicates disapproval of an operator’s
        request. The proper term for leaving the CMA is “OUT OF” and “OFF” for exiting
        the runway.
     3.2.7.4. Procedures and standards to use and maintain airfield driving visual aids/decals.
     At a minimum, all vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following
     AFVA/decals and diagrams: Note: Decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of
     the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it
     can be flipped down for ready reference.
        3.2.7.4.1. AFVA 11-240. Note: The FAA Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual Aid Safety
        Placard is the FAA equivalent to AFVA 11-240 and may be used by units located at
        shared-use airfields.
        3.2.7.4.2. AFVA 13-221 (optional if vehicle has an AFVA 11-240).

    gun signals. Note: Provide a detailed description and an example of the following:
       3.2.7.5.1. Airfield signs (e.g., mandatory and informational).
           3.2.7.5.1.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Mandatory Signs (Attachment 13) . Red
           signs with white legends indicate mandatory holding positions for runways or ILS
           critical area boundaries. Vehicle operators will not proceed beyond these signs
           without approval from Maxwell Ground.
           3.2.7.5.1.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Taxiway Guidance, Information and
           Location Signs (Attachment 13). Yellow signs with black legends indicate
           direction, destination, runway exit or other information. There are also signs with
           black backgrounds and yellow letters to indicate the taxiway designation for the
           taxiway you are currently on (Taxiway location signs).
       3.2.7.5.2. Airfield markings (e.g. runway, taxiway, apron/ramp, instrument, etc.).
           3.2.7.5.2.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Runway Markings (Attachment 13).
           Solid white lines running the length of the runway denote the runway edge.
           Dashed white lines running down middle of the runway indicate the runway
           centerline. White numbers at the ends of each runway indicate the runway
           designation.
           3.2.7.5.2.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) VFR                 Hold     Position     Markings
           (Attachment 13). VFR hold positions are located at least 100 feet from the edge
           of runways on all taxiways leading to runway. The markings consist of four
           parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to the axis of taxiway centerline (or runway
           edge), extending across taxiway, including the shoulders. The two stripes closest
           to the runway are dashed lines and other two are solid lines. . Vehicles will not
           cross runway hold positions or proceed onto the runway without obtaining
           permission from Maxwell Ground.
           3.2.7.5.2.3. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Instrument (INST) Hold Position
           Markings (Attachment 13) (Taxiway Echo). These lines are normally placed
           farther from the runway than the VFR hold position markings. These markings
           consist of two solid yellow lines, two feet apart, extending across width of
           taxiway, connected by pairs of solid yellow lines 10 feet apart, on black
           background. INST Hold Positions will be used during IFR conditions or when
           directed by Maxwell Ground. These hold positions will be used any time the
           weather falls below a ceiling of 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) and/or
           visibility decreases to three statute miles or less. Stop Bar Markings are located at
           least 100 feet from the edge of runways on all access roads and abandoned
           pavement leading to runway. The markings consist of a solid white line
           perpendicular to the axis of centerline of the pavement. These lines mark

            boundary of CMA. Vehicles will not cross Stop Bars or proceed onto the runway
            without obtaining permission from Maxwell Ground. NOTE: Stop Bar
            Markings should be adjacent to a stop sign indicating to stop and contact ATC
            before proceeding.
            3.2.7.5.2.4. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Taxiway            and     Apron     Markings
            (Attachment 13). Solid double yellow lines denote the edge of taxiways or
            aprons. Dashed double yellow lines denote the edge of a taxilanes. Single solid
            yellow lines denote taxiway/taxilane centerlines.
        3.2.7.5.3. Airfield lighting (e.g. runway, taxiway, etc.).
            3.2.7.5.3.1. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Runway Lights (Attachment 13). White
            and amber lights are located on the edges of runways. These high intensity lights
            run length of runway and identify runway edge.
            3.2.7.5.3.2. (Added-MAXWELLAFB) Taxiway Lights (Attachment 13). Blue
            lights are used to identify taxiway/taxilane edges.
     3.2.7.6. Procedures and standards to comply with vehicle speed limits on the airfield.
     Identify vehicle speed limits for the following:
     3.2.7.6. (MAXWELLAFB) General Speed Limits. The maximum speed limit for
     general purpose vehicles operating on the airfield or runways is 25 mph. The maximum
     speed limit for general purpose vehicles on the airfield taxiways and the parking
     ramps/aprons is 15 mph. The maximum speed limit for airfield access roads is 15 mph.
     Exceptions to speed limits include the following. Vehicles operating in close proximity
     to aircraft (within 50 feet) will not exceed 5 mph. Special-purpose vehicles (e.g. tugs,
     forklifts, refueling vehicles, K-loaders) will not exceed 10 mph. Emergency-response
     vehicles may exceed speed limits only when responding to an emergency. Emergency
     lights will be in operation. Safety and caution are of the utmost importance in responding
     to an emergency. Note: Emergency vehicles will not automatically assume the right of
     way. Vehicles responding to “Red Ball” are NOT authorized to exceed speed limits.
        3.2.7.6.1. Vehicle parking areas.
        3.2.7.6.1. (MAXWELLAFB) Vehicles will not exceed 5 mph in vehicle parking

    traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or
    ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a
    radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely
    as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular telephone to
    advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the runway,
    should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and wait
    for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know
    and comply with the following signals:

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the ATCT is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   4.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator, must know exactly what the controller
   wants them to do.
   4.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   4.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   4.2.3. The microphone should be very close to your lips and, after pressing the “microphone
   button”, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure, the first word is transmitted clearly.
   Speak in a normal, conversational tone.
   4.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   4.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   “stuck mike,” and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   4.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   4.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
4.3. Phraseology. Vehicle operators must contact the ATCT controller each and every time
they proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
 46                                   AFI13-213_MAXWELLAFBSUP 3 DECEMBER 2013


intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must always
give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists. VHF/UHF
transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
   4.3.1. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 4.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology.
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER
                                      AIRFIELD ONE.”
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, JACKSONVILLE
                                      TOWER.”
VEHICLE OPERATOR:                     “JACKSONVILLE TOWER,
                                      AIRFIELD ONE REQUEST TO
                                      CROSS (runway) AT
                                      (point/intersection).
ATCT:                                 “AIRFIELD ONE, CROSS (runway)
                                      AT (point/intersection).
                                      or
                                      “AIRFIELD ONE, HOLD SHORT
                                      OF (runway).”
   4.3.2. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

personnel operating motor vehicles on the airfield.
Commercial Vehicle—A vehicle, which is owned or leased by a commercial firm.
Controlled Areas—Controlled areas are legally defined areas containing Protection Level 4
resources. Only authorized personnel, designated by a unit commander, have access to controlled
areas.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—As defined in Airfield Operation Instructions, any
portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic
Control Tower (ATCT) approval for (normally via two-way radio contact with the ATCT).
Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as
 54                                   AFI13-213_MAXWELLAFBSUP 3 DECEMBER 2013


required taxiing of aircraft. Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined
in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA.
Controlled Movement Area Violation (CMAV) Event—An airfield infraction caused by
aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering the control movement area without specific ATCT
approval. This definition includes runway incursions and infractions caused by communication
errors. Refer to AFI 91-223 paragraphs 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR reporting procedures and
1.3.1.9. for reportable CMAV events.
Expedite—Used by ATC when prompt compliance is required to avoid the development of an
imminent situation.
Foreign Object Damage (FOD)—Any damage to an aircraft, engine, aircraft system,
component, tire, munitions, or support equipment caused by a foreign object(s) which may or
may not degrade the required safety and/or operational characteristics of the aforementioned
items.
Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs)—Vehicles that are owned or leased by the US
government.
Ground Vehicle Traffic Lane—A defined and marked lane on the flightline used for the
movement of vehicle traffic.
(Added-MAXWELLAFB) GSA Vehicles—Government vehicles that look like private
vehicles, but are provided to drivers and may be used on the airfield.
Hold or Hold Short—Used by ATC to indicate you must stay where you are currently located
or for you to hold at the Runway Hold line/VFR hold line prior to receiving approval into the
CMA.
Host Wing Commander—The individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
(Added-MAXWELLAFB) Landing Zone—The LZ consists of a runway and taxiways. It is a
prepared surface used to conduct operations in an airfield environment similar to forward
operating locations. LZ runways are typically shorter and narrower than standard runways.
Because training airfields are constructed for long-term operations, semi-prepared surface
structural requirements are more stringent than for contingency airfields.
Light Gun—A handheld directional light signaling device which emits a brilliant narrow beam
of white, green, or red light as selected by the tower controller. The color and type of light
transmitted can be used to approve or disapprove anticipated pilot actions where radio
AFI13-213_MAXWELLAFBSUP 3 DECEMBER 2013                                                          55


communication is not available. The light gun is used for controlling traffic operating in the
vicinity of the airport and on the airport movement area.

Commands plus the Air National Guard Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command, Direct
Reporting Units, and Field Operating Agencies. MAJCOM also refers to the OPR for Airfield
Operations in this AFI.
Negative—No, or permission not granted, or that is not correct.
Out—The conversation is ended and no response is expected.
Over—My transmission is ended; I expect a response.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded and unloaded and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under an aircraft or its wings. Slow speed and extreme caution are required in these areas.
Perimeter Road—A road around the runway perimeter designed to connect the access roads.
Precision Obstacle Free Zone—An 800 foot wide by 200 foot long area centered on the runway
centerline adjacent to the threshold designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from
ground vehicles and other aircraft when ceiling is less than 250 feet or visibility is less than 3/4
statute mile (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet.)
Privately Owned Vehicle (POVs)—A vehicle that is owned or leased by a private party.
Proceed—Authorization to begin/continue on approved routes.
Ramp—Either concrete or asphalt (depending on the weight of the aircraft and the sub-base of
the ground beneath) used to park aircraft or equipment.
