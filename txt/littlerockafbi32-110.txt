SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes were
made to reference the new position in the Air Mobility Command. Para 3.1 was added to
explain the meaning of Real Property for Civil Engineering responsibility purposes. Para 3.1.7
changed “periodic” inspections to “monthly”. Para. 3.1.14 Lamps will only be replaced with
low mercury lamps. These lamps are identified by either a green tip or green writing on them
was added in support of energy conservation. Para. 4.4.1 added to incorporate the new electronic
332 system in CE Portal. Removed 3.4.4. All applicable coordination’s should be made prior to
submitting the request to the CE customer Service Center. This is now accomplished in the
electronic program. Para 7.6 Cipher Locks was added to address the security, maintenance, and
budget issues in regards to the use of cipher locks on the base. Removed 8.2.1.3, per Civil
Engineer Operations Support the current grounds contract does not cover tree and stump
removal. This will be done using GPC or in house resources. Para. 15 was added to give
guidance on sign standards on LRAFB. Para. 16. was added to address historical landmarks and
buildings on the base in compliance with National Preservation Historical Act. Due to repeated
request from facility managers, we have attached (attachment 1) a suggested inspection
checklist for them to use to maintain their facilities. Changed Para. 4.6 due to LRAFB Form 9
being obsolete. Facility managers will maintain a locally developed log for keeping records of
submitted work orders and key control.

1. Program Objectives. The objective of the Little Rock AFB Facility Manager program is to
assist Unit commanders and staff agencies in their endeavor to ensure that all facilities are
maintained and used in accordance with this instruction and other applicable directives. The
facility manager (FM) is the key to effective facility use, care, energy conservation, and adjacent
grounds care.
2. General Information.
   2.1. Facility Manager Assignment Procedures. Organizational commanders will appoint
   in writing a primary and alternate FM for each facility in the organization. FM’s are
   considered mission essential. The commander can assign one primary, but as many
   alternates as needed to ensure that there is always a facility manager that can be contacted as
   the need arises. The sample appointment memorandum format at Attachment 2 may be used
   for this purpose. The appointment memorandum will be submitted to the Civil Engineer
   (CE) Customer Service Center (19 CES/CEOER) located in the Operations Flight in Building
   536. The phone number for the CE Customer Service Center is 501-987-6553/6554.
       2.1.1. Where practical, the primary duty assignment of the individual appointed as the
       FM should be in the building for which he/she is manager. The FM can be an officer,
       senior airman or above, or Department of Defense civilian employee with sufficient
       authority and ability to perform the assigned duties. When two or more units occupy the
       same facility, the unit occupying the most square footage of the facility will govern all
       aspects of facility management.
       2.1.2. Changes in FMs must be submitted to CE Customer Service Center at least 10
       days prior to change. This change will be in the form of a new appointment
       memorandum, signed by the organizational commander.

     2.2. Privacy Act. Information in this instruction requires the collection of information
     covered by the Privacy Act of 1974. Commanders should ensure that personnel being
     appointed as FMs read and understand the Privacy Act Statement.
3. Facility Manager Responsibilities.
     3.1. Responsibilities. The FM, in cooperation with all occupants and users of a building or
     facility, is responsible for the care, custody, and protection of all assigned real property. Real
     Property is defined as the facility itself and any items permanently a part of that facility, such
     as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and electrical and Real
     Property Installed Equipment (RPIE), which are items of government-owned or leased
     accessory equipment, apparatus and fixtures that are essential to the function of the real
     property and are permanently attached to, integrated into or on government-owned or leased
     property. Any non RPIE bought and installed by the facility user will NOT be maintained by
     the BCE. Facility users are required to maintain all non RPIE. FMs serve in an
     administrative and advisory capacity to all occupants in their facility. FMs will:
        3.1.1. Schedule initial FM training with CE Customer Service Center at 501-987-6732.
        Attend annual refresher training.
        3.1.2. Maintain FM program book, which can be in electronic form. It is the FM’s
        responsibility to provide this program book to their designated replacement to ensure
        continuity. The program book will contain the following:

Figure 1. Program Book.
Current delegation letter (Format Attachment 2)
Key Log
Work Order Log
Proof of Training
Reference Emails
Copies of active AF Form 332’s
        3.1.3. Assume responsibility for all keys to the facility: to include the redistribution of
        keys to other occupants or users as directed by the organization commander, and maintain
        a log of all facility keys. This log will be a local form developed by the FM. The FM is
        also responsible for initiating replacement of lost keys. CE will not make duplicate keys
        unless the FM submits an electronic 332 to the CE Customer Service Center (see
        paragraph 7.3 for key and lock control procedures).
        3.1.4. Brief the occupants and/or users of the facility on their collective responsibility for
        care and protection of the property, including monetary liability for loss or damage in
        excess of fair wear and tear, unless it is the result of acts beyond their control. Facility
        abuse is any willful damage to a facility or its installed equipment. The FM, organization
        commander, Base Civil Engineer, and the Mission Support Group Commander all play an
        integral part in identifying, investigating, and resolving any possible facility abuse.
        3.1.5. Ensure facility occupants do not alter the facility or real property installed
        equipment in any manner without FM first submitting an electronic AF Form 332 and
        obtaining the appropriate approval. This includes adding, moving, or removing plumbing
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                           5


     (including water coolers), lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, or related
     fixtures, to include painting, wall covering, carpet, walls, and locking devices.
     3.1.6. Publish rules for opening and closing the facility, including security measures to
     be observed at all times. If the facility is required to be secured after duty hours and is
     found open during Security Forces checks, the FM may be required to be present prior to
     the facility being secured.
     3.1.7. Conduct monthly inspections, to include after darkness, of the assigned facility
     and installed equipment, with particular attention to doors, windows, lights, plumbing,
     heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment. Use AF Form 1219, BCE Multi-
     Craft Job Order, to annotate inspection findings, form must be signed, and can be faxed
     to 987-2497.
     3.1.8. Inspect contracted custodial, refuse collection, and grounds maintenance services
     daily, or as service is provided. Report any unsatisfactory work directly to the Quality
     Assurance Evaluators (QAE’s) at 501-987-7187 or 501-987-5540.
     3.1.9. Escort facility contractors in the execution of work in restricted areas of the base.
     The using/requesting organization will be responsible for all escort duties concerning
     contractors.
     3.1.10. Maintain cleanliness of grounds and parking areas within 200 ft of facility. This
     includes removal of debris from strong winds, thunderstorms, tornadoes, etc. Removal of
     snow/ice on porches, awnings, any light weight structures, sidewalks, and icicles from
     roof overhangs. Obtain sand and/or deicer from CE, if necessary, by calling the CE
     Customer Service Center.
     3.1.11. Perform monthly fire inspections and follow up on any discrepancies or
     irregularities noted to ensure corrective action and annotate inspections either in written
     or automated form.
     3.1.12. Consolidate all work requirements for the facility. All occupants of the facility
     will channel work requirements through the FM for validation, consolidation, and
     elimination of duplicate requirements. The FM will also maintain a log of all work
     submitted to the CE Customer Service Center using any locally developed form or
     spreadsheet that will maintain this information in a well-organized manner. This form or
     spreadsheet can be kept electronically.
     3.1.13. Notify the CE Customer Service Center immediately in the most expeditious
     manner when emergencies occur. In the event of an emergency, calls will be accepted by
     anyone that has knowledge of the nature and location of the emergency.
     3.1.14. Procure and replace all fluorescent lamps and bulbs. If the replacement requires
     special equipment (excluding 8’ step ladder), the FM may request assistance from the CE
     Customer Service Center after they have procured the lamps. For energy conservation
     purposes, FMs will ensure that flickering fluorescent lamps are replaced promptly, due to
     energy usage doubling with faulty lamps. FMs will further ensure that used lamps and
     bulbs are properly disposed if in accordance with base Hazardous Waste Management
     Plan. Contact Hazardous Material Office (HAZMO) at 501-987-5247 if you have any
     questions regarding disposal of suspected hazardous waste. Lamps will only be replaced
 6                                           LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


        with low mercury lamps. These lamps are identified by either a green tip or green
        writing on them.
        3.1.15. Maintain close coordination with their unit and/or group Environmental
        Coordinator for all environmental issues, such as asbestos, lead-based paint, hazardous
        material storage, hazardous waste collection and disposal, and spill reporting. FMs
        should maintain a copy of the installation “Red Plan” for Spill Prevention, Control, and
        Countermeasures, which provides immediate spill reporting guidance in the event of a
        petroleum or hazardous material release.
        3.1.16. Report vacant space to the CE Asset Management Flight, 19 CES/CEIAP, 501-
        987-5882 and Operations Support QAE’s, 501-987-7187/5540. If a facility or parts of a
        facility are vacated, the FM will ensure it is left neat and clean. The FM’s responsibility
        will be formally terminated by inspection when the property is vacated. Cleanliness of
        the facility will be considered during the final inspection performed by 19 CES/CEIAP.
        3.1.17. Comply with cold weather procedures when required (see paragraph 9).
        3.1.18. Register on CE Portal https://a7ims.amc.af.mil/CEToolsPortal/pages/home.jsf
        to gain access to the electronic 332 process.
4. Procedures for Processing Work Requirements.
     4.1. Emergency Work Requirements. Emergency facility repair requirements should be
     reported immediately to the CE Customer Service Center at 501-987-6553/6554. Emergency
     repair work is required where the condition is detrimental to the mission, or unacceptably
     reduces operational effectiveness. The CE goal is to complete repair work, or mitigate the
     emergency to a lesser condition, within 24 hours of notification. Examples of emergency
     conditions include:
        4.1.1. Fire or safety hazards.
        4.1.2. Compromise security.
        4.1.3. Failure of any utility (water, sewer, gas, electric, HVAC) for an entire facility
        and/or entire base.
        4.1.4. Stopped up toilets, when others are not available or the entire building is clogged.
        4.1.5. Causes mission or work stoppage.
        4.1.6. The FM will post procedures for reporting emergency work on bulletin boards in
        the facility, citing examples as noted above, and providing the CE Customer Service
        Center phone number. They will also post numbers they can be reached at for any calls
        other than emergencies and stress that CE will only take calls from the facility manager,
        except in an emergency.
     4.2. Urgent Work Requirements. Urgent facility repair requirements should be telephoned
     promptly to the CE Customer Service Center at extension 501-987-6553/6554. Urgent repair
     work is work that is not an emergency in nature but must be responded to in an expedited
     manner. The CE goal is to complete urgent repair work, or mitigate it to a lesser condition
     within 7 calendar days of notification or receipt of materials. Examples of urgent conditions
     include:
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                          7


     4.2.1. Air conditioning or heating inoperative in a single room.
     4.2.2. Any waste of utilities.
     4.2.3. Broken window panes.
     4.2.4. Stopped up toilets, when others are available in the building.
     4.2.5. Broken light switches or electrical outlets.
  4.3. Routine Work Requirements. Routine facility maintenance or repair requirements
  should be consolidated on a single, signed AF Form 1219 and forwarded to CE Customer
  Service Center through distribution, email, fax or hand carried. This form is only to be used
  for routine repair work. Routine work is work that is not of an emergency or urgent in nature
  and does not require planning or design for repair, modification, alteration, construction, or
  self-help improvements. The CE goal is to complete routine maintenance or repair work
  within 30 calendar days after identification of the requirement or receipt of materials.
  Routines are for issues that are not an emergency or urgent in nature, i.e. cracked window.
  4.4. Planned Work Requirements. Work requiring planning or design for repair,
  modification, alteration, construction, or self-help improvements should be consolidated on a
  single electronic AF Form 332, BCE Work Request, https://eprotools.eglin.af.mil/ and
  submitted to the CE Customer Service Center. With the exception of DeCA and AAFES,
  paper copies cannot be accepted, unless in emergency situations and the system is inoperable.
     4.4.1. The FM will prepare the electronic AF Form 332. All requirements for a single
     facility should be included on a single AF Form 332 submission. For new work
     involving modification or construction, the AF Form 332 must have an email/letter from
     the organization commander attached, stating he/she is aware of the request and is willing
     to fund.
     4.4.2. The description of work requested should be supported to the maximum extent
     possible by sketches, plans, diagrams, photographs, specifications, drawings, justification
     reference material (i.e. inspection safety or fire write ups or regulations). That and any
     other relevant data or information should be included with the form to include a clear and
     concise description of the location and scope of the work requested.
     4.4.3. Approval of work requests is based on the justification provided. As such,
     justification should be complete, factual, indicate the urgency of the request, and include
     the impact on the organization/mission if the work is not accomplished. The statement of
     requirements and attachments must be clear and concise so it can be fully understood by
     reviewing and approving authorities. References to regulations, manuals, and directives
     are not adequate justification. The AF Form 332 should also include the required date of
     completion. All back-up paperwork should be attached, to include, safety write-ups and
     portion of regulations that apply.
  4.5. Work Requests Requiring Communications Support. Work requests requiring
  communications support (e.g., installation, removal, replacement, and repair of telephone
  circuits or communications cables) will require advance approval by the 19th
  Communications Squadron (501-987-5401/5403). Approval is obtained through your
  squadron Telephone Control Officer (TCO). Your TCO will enter a request thru the CS
  automated system. The requester must contact 19 CS no less than 30 days in advance of any
 8                                           LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


     work requiring relocation of communications equipment. Conduit installation is the
     responsibility of the CS/user when the conduit is being installed specifically for
     communication purposes.
     4.6. Facility Manager’s Civil Engineer Work Request Log. If the FM has responsibility
     for more than one facility, a separate maintenance request register must be maintained for
     each facility. To properly control all work requests, the FM should enter the following items
     on the locally developed work order request log:
        4.6.1. Complete description of work being requested.
        4.6.2. Location of work (building number, room number, etc.).
        4.6.3. Avenue used to request work (i.e., Telephone, AF Form 1219, and AF Form 332).
        4.6.4. Date submitted or time called in.
        4.6.5. Work order or work request number given by customer service representative.
        4.6.6. Date of completion of corrective action.
        4.6.7. Estimated Delivery Date of parts (if this information is available), if a repair
        cannot be made because parts must be ordered.
5. Self-Help Program. The self-help program is a resource multiplier, especially in a resource
constrained budget environment. Self-help is an effective alternative to manage limited
resources to more effectively improve the quality of life for our personnel. Not only does self-
help save money, but it also fosters a pride of ownership and involves the users in maintaining
what they have. The self-help program’s primary purpose is minor maintenance and repair.
     5.1. Base Self-Help Store. The base Self-Help Store is located in Building 530.
        5.1.1. Issue of material from the Self-Help Store will be limited to approved FMs and
        alternates. The CE Customer Service Center will provide the Self-Help Store with a
        current facility manager list. Materials which are common maintenance and repair items
        are readily available for issue to customers. Items needed in large quantities (more than
        one i.e. two boxes of ceiling tiles) will be ordered, via electronic AF Form 332. If
        ordered, partial release of materials will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
        5.1.2. Prior to any self-help activities that would disturb any portion of the facility, FMs
        will submit an AF Form 332 to the CE Customer Service Center in accordance with
        procedures outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5, and obtain approval. Requests will clearly
        identify the entire scope of the project. This is critical so that the proper steps can be
        taken to ensure personnel are not exposed to the hazards of asbestos or lead based paint
        during the course of the project.
        5.1.3. The Self-Help Store will provide customers with available tools to accomplish
        tasks for materials being issued. The store maintains a supply of common tools, such as
        hammers, screwdrivers, wrenches, and power tools available for immediate issue. Tools
        issued to customers will be signed for (via AF Form 1297), and will have a suspense date
        for their return. Customers will be held accountable for tools issued, and reimbursement
        will be required for lost or destroyed tools. If tools are not returned within 3 days of job
        completion the supported commander may be requested to take appropriate action.
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                             9


     5.1.4. Contact the Self Help Store for information concerning minor maintenance and
     repair tasks, which can be accomplished Self Help.
     5.1.5. Organizations are not authorized to perform maintenance on equipment items such
     as furnaces, boilers, air conditioning system, exterior electrical systems, or other utilities
     such as gas, fuel, water, and sewer systems.
  5.2. Self-Help Projects Requiring CE Support.
     5.2.1. FMs, and appointed alternates, are authorized to perform minor maintenance and
     repair on their facilities via self-help projects. Self-help projects must be processed on an
     electronic AF Form 332 and submitted to the CE Customer Service Center for approval.
     The procedures for submission of the request are the same as for any other work request
     (see para 4.4), except the donated resources section of the AF Form 332 will be
     completed. Approval is based on the evaluation of the following:
         5.2.1.1. If the work is valid and required.
         5.2.1.2. If the requester has the technical capability and resources available to
         complete the job.
         5.2.1.3. What CE support will be required if the requester has limited capability.
         5.2.1.4. Whether or not it would be economical to accomplish under CE supervision.
         Self-help work may not always be cost effective and the BCE is ultimately
         responsible for all work on real property.
     5.2.2. The Civil Engineer Operations Flight will obtain planning and other support for
     self-help projects, monitor progress, conduct in-progress inspections, and final
     inspection. Self-help work will not be started until the appropriate authority has
     approved the work and the requester has been notified to pick up material.
     5.2.3. The requester or occupant may, with prior approval, retain ownership of privately
     owned equipment installed under self-help procedures provided that appropriated funds
     are not used, and only if upon removal the facility is returned to its original condition. A
     certification to this effect will be accomplished by the requester and retained in the real
     property file by the CE Real Estate Section, until the equipment is removed. The
     occupant should state on the AF Form 332 if ownership is to be retained by someone
     other than the government. Materials, supplies, and equipment for alterations and minor
     construction will not be furnished unless ownership of the finished project will be passed
     to the government.
     5.2.4. Under no circumstances will facility occupants use the Government Purchase Card
     (GPC) for any type of repair, maintenance, construction or alteration of a facility. CE is
     mandated to track all costs related to Air Force Real Property and must use CE GPCs to
     ensure these costs are accurately accrued against the facility.
  5.3. Self-Help Pest Control. The CE Entomology Section provides pest control services for
  base facilities; however FMs may perform self-help pest control if it is in the best interests of
  the mission (as determined by CE). However, they must promptly provide information on
  chemicals used to the CE Entomology Section in accordance with AFI 32-1053, Integrated
  Pest Management Program, Pest management is located in Building 241 (501-987-6581).
  Contact Entomology for information concerning self-help pest control.

6. Fire Prevention.
   6.1. Responsibilities. Fire prevention is everyone’s job. Not only are you responsible for
   real property as a FM for a given facility, but you are also responsible to other individuals for
   ensuring a safe environment – free from the possible outbreak of fire. If each of us does our
   part, the goal of fire prevention can be met. This section is designed to provide guidance to
   FMs in the establishment and execution of an effective fire prevention program. Air Force
   policy requires the establishment of an effective fire prevention program and charges each of
   us with the responsibility of ensuring its success. Refer to LRAFBI 32-2001, para 1.2.2.,
   (Fire Protection and Prevention) for facility manager responsibilities in regards to fire
   prevention.
   6.2. Fire Hazards. A fire hazard is defined as an existing condition or situation which, if
   not corrected, could result in undesired ignition and subsequent fire or rapid spread of fire
   causing personal injury, loss of life, loss of materials, and the destruction of property. All
   fire hazards must be corrected immediately. Fire prevention is concerned with the
   elimination of fire hazards through the efforts of all personnel.
7. Key and Lock Control for Real Property Facilities.
   7.1. Applicability. Key and lock procedures will be followed by all facility managers in
   obtaining duplicate keys and changing locks on real property facilities. It applies to all
   assigned, attached, and tenant organizations, and to all officer, enlisted, civilian personnel
   and contractors at Little Rock AFB. Only the CE locksmith will accomplish re-keying of
   facilities. Locksmith services are provided by the CE Operations Flight.
   7.2. Responsibilities. The FM is responsible for all keys to his/her assigned facility(ies) and
   must ensure they are accounted for upon re-assignment, PCS, retirement, or separation.
   Transfer of facilities from one organization to another must be approved by the base Facility
   Board Working Group. FMs will use a locally developed log to maintain positive key
   control.
      7.2.1. The CE locksmith will issue keys only to the FM. Keys to buildings or structures
      that are vacant or pickled are the responsibility of CE Real Estate Section.
   7.3. Issuance of Duplicate or Replacement Keys.
      7.3.1. The FM will submit electronic AF Form 332 for duplicate or replacement keys and
      vault combination changes to the CE Customer Service Center for approval. CE
      Customer Service Unit (CSU) will notify the FM when and where they may be picked up.
      After changes have been made, the FM will add new keys to the key inventory. When
      complete re-keying of a facility is necessary, three master keys will be issued.
      Subsequent master keys must be requested in accordance with paragraph 7.3.3. below.
      7.3.2. Replacement of keys lost through neglect must first be paid for by the individual
      responsible before a replacement will be made. The unit commander, through his/her
      FM, will submit an electronic AF Form 332, along with an attached DD Form 1131, Cash
      Collection Voucher, to the CE CSU.
      7.3.3. Requests for issuance or replacement of master /sub-master keys and re-coring
      actions must be requested by the FM on an electronic AF Form 332, with an attachment
      from the commander, approving the request and will be responsible for funding. It is
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                          11


     required to be approved by the Base Civil Engineer, Deputy Base Civil Engineer, or the
     Chief/Deputy Chief of the Operations Flight.      Facilities requiring re-coring due to
     negligence will be funded by the unit having ownership of the facility.
     7.3.4. One set of Grand Master keys are authorized for the following personnel, who will
     sign for their receipt and turn-in:
         7.3.4.1. Wing Commander.
         7.3.4.2. Wing Vice Commander.
         7.3.4.3. Mission Support Group Commander.
         7.3.4.4. Base Civil Engineer.
         7.3.4.5. CE Operations Flight Commander.
         7.3.4.6. CE Operations Flight Deputy.
         7.3.4.7. Fire Chief.
         7.3.4.8. Fire Shift Supervisor.
         7.3.4.9. Security Forces.
  7.4. Safes. Free standing safes are not Air Force real property and therefore CE does not
  maintain them. The user is required to obtain services from a local vendor.
  7.5. Privately owned vehicles/office doors. Civil Engineering is not authorized to unlock
  privately owned vehicles or office doors. Persons needing these services must contact a local
  locksmith for POVs and contact the FM or Law Enforcement Desk for office doors.
  7.6. Cipher Locks. Push button mechanical lock devices have become a very popular
  device to allow users to access their facilities/rooms without the use of a key. A very
  common justification received is the cipher lock will provide additional security. The fact is
  cipher locks provide less security. Cipher lock combinations can be easily compromised and
  provide no true accountability of access control, where key issuance/control does. Civil
  Engineer and Security Forces discourage the use of cipher locks. Cipher locks are not
  considered real property and therefore funding will be the responsibility of the user. Once
  funding has been secured CE will order and install the locks. The user will be responsible for
  all maintenance and repairs to the lock after it is installed. Additionally, CE Structures
  personnel are not trained to work on cipher locks, this could result in additional expenses for
  the user to get a private bonded locksmith after normal duty hours. In most cases the locks
  cannot be repaired and have to be replaced. Replacement locks will be funded by the user
  and installed by CE. Should the decision be made to remove the cipher lock the user will be
  responsible for funding a new keyed door lock, new door, and paint costs to finish the door.
  7.7. Backup Generators. Backup generators are only authorized for mission critical
  functions as outline in AFI 32-1063 and Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 11-21 (HQ Air
  Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (HQ AFCESA)). Backup generators (RPIE installed
  or portable) will only be authorized by HQ AFCESA/CEO. A new authorization is required
  if the mission of the facility changes. MAJCOM/A7s shall revalidate authorizations every
  five years and forward validation reports to HQ AFCESA/CEO for review.
 12                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


   7.7.1. FM’s in facilities with backup generators will receive annual certification on normal
   operations and emergency procedures for these generators. This training will be conducted
   and training record maintained by CE Power Production shop personnel. A copy of the
   training record will be furnished to FM upon request.
       7.7.2. FM will include inspection of the generator in their monthly facility inspection.
       This inspection will consist of checking the fuel tanks and lines for visible leaks and/or
       damage. Any discrepancy will be called into CE Customer Service Call Center
       immediately.
       7.7.3. CE Power Production will perform preventative maintenance inspections (PMI) on
       the generators as required, to include a full-system test of the generator and automatic
       transfer system (ATS). This test will require an actual disconnect from commercial
       power supplied to the ATS and will be performed during peak load periods to ensure
       proper ATS operation, generator capacity, and overall system reliability. Simulations or
       use of key/test switch is not allowed. The FM’s will be required to sign the AFCESA
       Form 487, Emergency Generator Operating Log, after every full system test, verifying
       proper function of all building equipment and systems while operating under generator
       operation. IAW ETL 11-21, the using organization cannot deny CE permission to
       accomplish a full-system test. However, CE shall make every effort to accommodate the
       user’s mission operations within the testing month, but in no case shall the time since the
       last full-system test exceed 6 months. Exception: A full-system test can be denied one
       time, if approved by the MAJCOM/CV in writing; effectively, the maximum time
       between full-system tests is 12 months. If the MAJCOM/CV directs that a full-system
       test not be performed, the Base CE shall advise the Wing Commander in writing that
       second postponement will result in decertification and removal of the RPIE generator
       from the facility. The MAJCOM/CV may not delegate this authority.
8. Base Beautification and Anti-Litter.
   8.1. Responsibilities. This chapter establishes responsibilities and outlines procedures for
   the maintenance, repair, and improvement of grounds at Little Rock AFB. It is applicable to
   all assigned, attached, and tenant organizations. Limited funding and manning dictate that all
   base organizations take an active part in the base beautification and anti-litter program.
   8.2. CE Contracted Services. CE provides custodial, refuse collection, and grounds
   maintenance services via support contractors, and ensures compliance with requirements
   through Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) on staff. It is important that FMs are aware of
   contractor responsibilities and report non-compliance to the CE Customer Service Center or
   the QAE.

         8.3.1.9. Ensuring that all recycling collection points are setup as needed and
         maintained once setup.
         8.3.1.10. Mandate and ensure all employees participate in the recycling program.
         This requires distribution and enforcement of wing/unit/building policies and
         procedures. The process for implementing and enforcing this program will be
         accomplished by briefings or training sessions. Document the briefings and/or
         training on a written record for assessment purposes.
         8.3.1.11. Ensuring that facility occupants support (i.e. encourage occupants) the
         recycling program by separating/bagging cardboard, brown paper bags, newspaper,
         white and colored paper plastics, aluminum and metallic containers, scrap metal, all
         glass, wire, cooking oil/grease, batteries- rechargeable and lead acid .
 14                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


          8.3.1.12. Ensuring the recoverable products are free of contaminants.
          8.3.1.13. Ensuring all refuse/trash containers are free of recyclable materials.
          8.3.1.14. Ensuring the collection point is maintained regularly to discourage the

          this instruction.
          8.3.1.16. Refer all questions and advisement to 19 CES/CEIE, Qualified Recycling
          Program Manager.
          8.3.1.17. Ensuring that ONLY the facility manager has the key to the bulk recycling
          container located outside of the building; verifying that only sorted, bagged, and
          approved material goes into the container. Additional bags and bins are available at
          the Recycling Center. Pickup needs to be coordinated with the Recycling Center
          Staff (501-987-6611).
          8.3.1.18. Ensuring that ALL recyclable material is transported to the Recycling
          Center, 1568 Lachmund Drive during normal business hours (0700-1500L).
   8.4. Anti-Litter Enforcement. The Security Forces monitor acts of littering and, when
   appropriate, prepare a DD Form 1569, Incident/Complaint Report. Violators may be subject
   to disciplinary action. In the case of dependents, violation may result in withdrawal of
   appropriate base facility privileges.
   8.5. Designated Smoking Areas. Designated Tobacco Areas. Tobacco use is prohibited on
   LRAFB except in Designated Tobacco Areas approved by the installation commander.
   Reference AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force, para. 1.9.4 and 2.2.
9. Cold Weather Procedures.
   9.1. Responsibilities. FMs will take the following actions any time the temperature is
   forecast to be below 32 degrees F:
      9.1.1. Leave water dripping in all sinks and lavatories (both hot and cold faucets).
      9.1.2. Remove hoses from outside hose bibs.
      9.1.3. Prop doors open to small rooms such as latrines and janitor closets which contain
      plumbing fixtures.
      9.1.4. Ensure all windows, storm windows, and outside doors are completely closed.
      9.1.5. Remove ice and snow on porches, awnings, any light weight structures, sidewalks

      calling the CE Customer Service Center.
      9.1.6. Notify the CE Customer Service Center as soon as a problem is discovered so
      action to minimize damage can be taken.
10. Energy Conservation.
   10.1. Responsibilities. Presidential Executive Order 13423, 26 Jan 07, as supplemented by
   Executive Order 13514, 8 Oct 09 mandates energy and water conservation in all Federal
   buildings; they require a 30% reduction in energy consumption by the year 2015 (from 2003
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                         15


  levels) and a 26% reduction of water consumption intensity by the year 2020 relative to a
  baseline of the consumption in fiscal year 2007. The base oversees this effort through the
  Cross Function Environmental Quality subcommittee (CFEQS), comprised of Group and
  Unit commanders. The FM plays a vital role in achieving these goals by monitoring energy
  and water consumption, ensuring facilities are well maintained, and that facility occupants do
  not waste utilities or energy.
     10.1.1. Energy Management and Control System (EMCS). Heating and cooling of
     facilities constitute a primary consumption of energy. Consequently, CE maintains a
     centralized EMCS system that controls heating and cooling for most base facilities. This
     system conserves energy by maintaining temperature levels within a standard range set
     by the CFEQS, with setbacks on nights and weekends. For the cooling season, the
     standard is for temperature settings to not go below 75F. For the heating season, the
     standard is for temperature settings to not exceed 70F. During unoccupied times, the
     heating temperature setting shall not exceed 55F and cooling systems shall be less than
     83F unless specifically designed and justified for all after hours use. During the
     changeover season in the spring and fall, facilities may experience hot or cold days,
     depending on the weather. Generally, changes should be made to cooling systems no
     earlier than 1 April and after five consecutive daily max temperatures higher than 75F;
     and to heating no earlier than 1 October and after five consecutive daily max
     temperatures of less than 70F. Once a system has been changed from heating to cooling,
     or vice versa, it may not be switched back.
     10.1.2. Complete guidance for Energy Managers and Facility Managers is contained in
     LRAFBI 23-301, Utilization and Conservation of Utilities. FMs will:
         10.1.2.1. For facilities not controlled by EMCS, maintain temperature levels within
         the CFEQS-established standard.
         10.1.2.2. Set back thermostats at night and on weekends, where the mission will
         allow.
         10.1.2.3. Close off unoccupied rooms and set back the temperature appropriately.
         10.1.2.4. Keep storm windows, windows, and doors closed during the heating
         season.
         10.1.2.5. Keep blinds/drapes opened on the sunny side of buildings and closed on the
         shady side during the heating season.
         10.1.2.6. Keep lights turned out in unoccupied rooms.
         10.1.2.7. Use natural lighting when available.
         10.1.2.8. Reduce lighting in work areas to the minimum level acceptable to the task
         being performed.
         10.1.2.9. Reduce lighting in hallways, entrance ways, and restrooms to minimum
         safe levels.
         10.1.2.10. Turn off exterior lights during daylight hours and limit their use to the
         hours actually needed at night. Facility Managers are responsible for reporting
         exterior lights that are on during daylight hours to CE for corrective action.
 16                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


          10.1.2.11. Replace fluorescent lamps (when required) with low mercury type lamps.
          Examples of bulbs that meet this criteria include: Sylvania Ecologic, GE Ecolux, or
          Phillips Alto. (low mercury bulbs typically have either green end caps or green
          lettering).
          10.1.2.12. Use compact fluorescent lamps in incandescent fixtures, where feasible.
          This will have an even greater energy reduction than a lower wattage incandescent
          lamp – and yield a longer life.
          10.1.2.13. Centralize and minimize use of coffee pots, and reduce electric load by
          disconnecting coffee pots not in use.
          10.1.2.14. Turn off appliances when not in use.
          10.1.2.15. All appliances must be energy star compliant, including refrigerators,
          water heaters and other large appliances as well as coffee pots.
          10.1.2.16. Report running or leaking restroom fixtures and hot water heaters to the
          CE Customer Service Center immediately.
          10.1.2.17. Set hot water temperature no higher than the maximum temperature as
          established by the CFEQS, where practical (current maximum setting is 120 degrees;
          preferred setting is 110 degrees).
          10.1.2.18. Portable electric heaters are not authorized according to LRAFBI 32-2001,
          para. 3.2.
          10.1.2.19. Request assistance from the CE Customer Service Center, if needed, on
          the following:
              10.1.2.19.1. Change in thermostat settings, if they are not occupant controlled.
              10.1.2.19.2. Reduction in lighting levels, if disconnecting is required.
              10.1.2.19.3. Water and steam leaks.
              10.1.2.19.4. Broken windows and doors.
              10.1.2.19.5. Building winterization, if the facility is vacant.
11. Asbestos/Lead-Based Paint.
   11.1. Asbestos Awareness. Asbestos containing materials were used in the past as building
   materials, and continue to exist today in many buildings on base. Locations of potential
   asbestos include pipe insulation, floor tile and mastic, and wallboard joint compounds.
   Asbestos containing materials can remain in facilities for many years and never cause any
   concern. However, if it becomes disturbed or friable, it can constitute a health hazard. It is
   Air Force policy to mitigate and reduce possible exposure to airborne asbestos fibers.
   Damaged asbestos that cannot be reliably maintained, repaired, or isolated, must be removed.
   CE has surveyed base facilities for asbestos, and they continue to be monitored for potential
   damage. In furtherance of this effort, FMs will, as part of their monthly facility inspections,
   note the condition of any possible asbestos containing material. If damaged or in suspect
   condition, FMs will report it to the CE Customer Service Center for follow up and
   abatement/removal if necessary.
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                            17


   11.2. Lead-Based Paint Awareness. Lead-based paints were also used in the past and
   continue to exist today in some buildings on base. CE has surveyed all high use facilities that
   children under the age of seven could occupy for lead-based paint. Paint that could have
   been hazardous to children was removed. Other facilities on base do not require sampling
   unless activities are planned that would disturb the walls, floors, or ceilings. FMs will, as
   part of their monthly facility inspections, note the condition of any possible lead-based paint.
   If damaged or in suspect condition, FMs will report it to the CE Customer Service Center for
   follow up and abatement/removal if necessary.
12. Installation, Maintenance, and Repair of Non-Real Property Equipment. CE is not
authorized to install, maintain, or repair non-real property equipment. However, critical facility
interfaces (e.g. structural, power, gas, water, wastewater, etc.) required to make equipment work
may dictate CE involvement. Costs incurred by CE in the performance of work required to
enable hook-up of equipment may be charged to the using organization. Prior to purchase or
installation of any non-real property equipment the submission and approval of an electronic AF
Form 332 is required.
   12.1. Ice Machines. CE does not install, maintain, or repair ice machines. Exceptions to
   this include ice machines located in the dormitories and essential feeding facilities. Essential
   feeding facilities are the Hercules Dining Facility (Bldg 834) and the In-Flight Kitchen (Bldg
   120). All other ice machines are not real property and are the responsibility of the user.
   12.2. Systems Furniture. Organizations desiring to install systems furniture must purchase
   it at their own expense. Requests to install systems furniture via self-help must be submitted
   to the CE Customer Service Center on an electronic AF Form 332 for approval. Requests
   must include the systems furniture layout and any other pertinent information. CE’s
   evaluation will include the following:
       12.2.1. Required electrical interfaces and availability of power.
       12.2.2. Effect on facility lighting.
       12.2.3. Compliance with Life Safety Code and Fire Protection requirements.
   12.3. Irrigation Systems. Civil Engineer will maintain the following irrigation systems:
   Building 1250, Wing Headquarters, Ball fields located along 6th Street, Youth fields across
   the street from the current location of the commissary, Ball fields located near the WARFIT
   track and the WARFIT field. Should an emergency situation arise with any sprinkler system
   not identified above (broken underground water line) CE will cap the line. Additional costs
   to repair the irrigation system will be at the expense of the using organization. New requests
   for irrigation systems are discouraged and will normally be disapproved.
   12.4. Flag Poles. Civil Engineers, in cooperation with Public Affairs and Wing Historian(s),
   will maintain the following flag poles: facility 1252, located in front of building 1250;
   facility 1505, Heritage Park; and 1493, located at the south end of Vandenberg Road near
   highway 67/167. All other flag poles on base are the responsibility of the using organization.
   Any costs to repair/maintain these flag poles will be at the expense of the using organization,
   to include lighting associated with the flag pole.
   12.5. Mold Prevention and Removal. Facility Managers will:
       12.5.1. Prevent and correct moisture problems before mold becomes problematic.
 18                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


       12.5.2. Ensure clean environment is maintained within the facility.
   12.5.3. Conduct monthly visual inspections of the facility HVAC system vents are cleaned
   as needed.
       12.5.4. Monitor facility for water damage as a part of routine building inspections and
       notify CE immediately of any problem areas
13. Non-Fair Wear and Tear. Non-fair wear and tear of Air Force Real Property will not be
tolerated. Non-fair wear and tear can be defined as any willful damage to a facility or any of its
components. The FM, in cooperation with all facility occupants, has the primary responsibility
to prevent facility abuse. Any damage must be reported immediately to CE Customer Service at
501-987-6553. Security Forces will also be notified for issuance of an incident report.
Documentation and tracking of abuse damage is the responsibility of CE Customer Service
Center. CE Customer Service Center will initiate a repair work order for estimate/repairs. In
some cases, immediate repairs, as opposed to an estimate, may be required in order to maintain
the integrity of the facility or maintain security, safety, and/or fire protection systems. Upon
completion of the repair action, CE Customer Service Center will submit cost breakdowns to the
CE resource advisor. The financial management analysis (FMA) office will be notified for the
transfer of the using organization’s Operating and Maintenance (O&M) funds to the RC/CC and
EEIC provided by the CE resource advisor. If requested for pecuniary liability assessment, an
electronic cost report can be obtained from CE Customer Service Center. If the using
organization commander feels the facility abuse assessment is not justified, and the CE Chief of
Operations agrees with his/her rationale, the facility abuse assessment will be dropped. If the
Chief of Operations disagrees, the case will be referred to the Mission Support Group
Commander, as needed who will make the final determination.
14. Sign Standards and Reserved Parking. In order to standardize the design, construction
and placement of Air Force signs in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria 3-120-01. The
UFC is available at http://65.203.17.188/report/doc_ufc.html. This guidance sets the standards
for identification, direction, regulation, motivation and information signs; street address signs;
base destination signs; parking regulation signs; and interior signs. It does not, however, apply
to the portion of these criteria which are based on such national standards as the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines (ADAAG), and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS).
   14.1. Responsibility.
       14.1.1. Facility Manager. FM will submit all sign requests on an electronic AF Form
       332 through the 19th Civil Engineer Squadron, Customer Service Office. The approval
       authority for all sign requests is the Traffic Engineer Working Group through 19
       CES/CEO.
       14.1.2. 19th Civil Engineer Squadron. The Base Civil Engineer will ensure all new sign
       requests will comply with UFC 3-120-01 and will improve base appearance by keeping
       signs within standards and to a minimum.
   14.2. Sign Types
       14.2.1. Building Identification Signs. These signs identify essential functions such as
       command elements and functions frequently used by visitors and newly assigned
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                            19


       personnel. There are two types of building identification signs, those attached to the
       building and stand-alone (not attached to the building). A building will normally have
       only one type of sign. Using more than one sign may be necessary when a single facility
       has more than one major activity, widely separated entrances, or units of different
       commands. Good judgment will dictate the actual number of signs for a facility with
       these conditions. In all cases, signs must be kept to a minimum.
       14.2.2. Signs Attached To Buildings. These consist of signs painted on a building,
       letters and logos attached to a building, and signs engraved into the façade of a building.
       Letters attached to a building are preferred over stand-alone signs. Since the letters are
       applied directly to the surface of the wall rather than to a background panel, they must be
       of sufficient size to stand out against the architectural detail of the building. A minimum
       12” capital letter height is specified for one and two story buildings, while larger letters
       are used for larger buildings. Messages for wall mounted signs are limited to a maximum
       of four words. UFC 3-120-01 Chapter 10 depicts numerous examples of signage for
       different building types.

Figure 2. Signs attached to buildings.




       14.2.3. Military Building Entry Signs. Type B4 signs identify organizations that have
       more than one primary entrance and are reached through alternate entries. These
       organizations are usually squadron level units, squadron components, or their
       equivalents. Colors are white letters and numbers on standard brown background.

Figure 3. Military Building Entry Signs.




       14.2.4. Building Identification Number Signs. Building number will be displayed on all
       buildings and will be located on right corner of perpendicular faces of building. Standard
       size is 18-inch by 36-inch reflective brown background and 12-inch white numbers.

      14.3.1. Military Identification sign type B4. These signs identify squadron units and
      squadron components or their equivalents. These signs are existing throughout Little
      Rock AFB and will continue to be maintained. Location diagrams for placement can be
      found in Chapter 4 of UFC 3-120-01.
LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013                                                            21


Figure 6. Military Identification sign type B4.




       14.3.2. Directional Signs. Signs showing ways to activities, buildings, or locations on the
       base must be constructed of reflective materials with 4-inch upper case and 3-inch lower
       case white letters on a brown background and a 1/2-inch white border. No more than
       four entries should be displayed on a sign. Make directional signs for places most likely
       to be used by visitors and newcomers to the base. Do not frame signs, mount them on 4-
       inch by 4-inch square tubular structural steel posts. A large number of existing
       directional signs at Little Rock AFB are in compliance with UFC 3-120-01 and will be
       maintained under those standards.

Figure 7. Directional Signs.




       14.3.3. Parking Signs. Limit the number of parking spaces reserved for individuals such
       as the base commander or senior NCO, or groups such as general officers. Reserve
       parking areas for unit personnel only if it is necessary to ensure that parking is available
       in the immediate area. Strictly limit the number of reserved parking signs. Temporary
       freestanding parking signs for official functions are not authorized on a continuous basis.
       See paragraph 15.5 below for instructions on reserved parking.

      Rock AFB:

Figure 9. Curb Signs.




      14.3.5. Handicap Reserved Parking Signs. Freestanding signage visible with vehicle in
      spot will be used for handicap parking and, where multiple spaces are together, the
      number of freestanding signs can be reduced by the use of arrows mounted at top of sign.
      Painting signs on pavements is discouraged. Van accessible signs will be mounted
      directly under the handicap sign and sized to compliment the handicap sign on which it is
      mounted. Color of sign is engineer brown background with white letters, border, and
      emblem. Dimension for a handicap sign are, 1 foot by 1 foot 6-inches, letters 1 ½-inch

      14.3.6. Motivational Signs. Unit awards authorized for display are the Presidential Unit
      Citation, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Air Force Organizational
      Excellence Award. Lettering for Majcom award signs will be 4 inches high and centered
      between the edges of the sign. Multiple awards will be equally spaced between the edges
      of the sign. Awards shall be no more than 4 years old.
          14.3.6.1. Existing building identification signs type B-3. These signs at Little Rock
          AFB may be used to hang unit award signs upon approval. Unit award signs are
          normally 30-inch by 16-inch painted aluminum, brown background with white letters.
          Signs are centered directly under the building identification sign. Signs other than
          those specified in this memorandum will be designed in accordance with to UFC 3-
          219-01.

Figure 11. Motivational Signs.




   14.4. Reserved Parking. The below guidelines establish reserve parking authority and
   outline who and/or what type of vehicle may park in reserved parking spaces. These
   guidelines apply to all units on Little Rock Air Force Base with the exception of 189 AW
   who will maintain their own parking plan. The Traffic Engineer Working Group (TEWG) is
   the approving and prioritizing authority for all reserved parking requests. The TEWG is
   chaired by the 19 MSG/CD and will meet quarterly, or as needed, to review all traffic,
   parking, roadway construction or landscaping related AF 332 (Base Civil Engineer Work
   Request). All reserved parking signs will be issued/installed by 19 CES.
      14.4.1. Processing Reserved Parking Requests.
24                                       LITTLEROCKAFBI32-110 6 DECEMBER 2013


        14.4.1.1. The Facility manager will evaluate each request and complete an electronic
        AF Form 332. The request must indicate the type of reserved space required, a
        narrative justification, and a diagram of the proposed area. Proof of commander
        approval must be attached. 19 CES Customer Service who will assign a work request
        number and forward the package to the TEWG for consideration. The board will
        approve or disapprove the work request then prioritize all approved AF 332s.
        Approved work requests will be sent back to 19 CES for installation according to the
        priority set by the board. Disapproved requests (i.e. exceeds the 20 percent limit,
        creates a traffic hazard etc.) will be returned to the originator by 19 CES. The
        requestor may appeal the board decision by forwarding a letter to the 19 MSG/CC
        outlining why their reserved parking request should be reconsidered. The appeal will
        be reviewed by the 19 MSG/CC, who will render a final decision.
        14.4.1.2. The facility manager is responsible for maintaining a listing of all reserved
        parking spaces around their facility(ies). The listing will include the total number of
        spaces, the number of handicap reserved spaces, and the number of all other reserved
        spaces.
        14.4.1.3. Reserved parking spaces will be approved for no more than twenty (20)

        14.4.2.1. Permanent Distinguished Visitor or VIP spaces. Are not authorized
        anywhere on base. Individual units can maintain their own portable/temporary DV
        signs. Protocol also maintains a collection of temporary DV signs that individual
        units can sign out when needed. The signs may be put in place the night prior to the
        visit to ensure the space is empty. They will be allowed to remain in place for the
        duration of the visit and must be removed immediately following the departure of the
        visiting dignitaries or completion of the function. Personnel requesting to use or
        reserve another organization’s parking spaces must coordinate with the respective
        facility manager or senior leadership for authorization.
        14.4.2.2. Permanent reserved parking spaces are limited. To Government Owned
        Vehicle (GOV)/Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) parking, handicapped, visitors,

          Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket, for parking violations. This designation
          will be in letter form and maintained by SFS. Additionally, personnel must attend a
          training course conducted by SFS prior to issuing any citations.
          14.4.6.2. Authorized Forms. Parking wardens may only use DD Form 1408 to cite
          parking violations around their respective unit buildings. Completed DD Forms 1408
          will be sent to SFS for appropriate action.
15. Cultural Resources.
   15.1. "Cultural resources" is a term used to describe buildings, structures, districts, sites,
   objects of significance in history, architecture, archaeology, engineering or culture.
   15.2. Buildings can be valuable cultural resources just as artifacts, bones and historic sites.
   Architecture, its style, materials, and methods of construction define eras throughout history.
   Preservation not only allows us to be partially transported back to an era, but adaptively re-
   using buildings from the past promotes conservation of resources and allows future
   generations to appreciate and value the work of their ancestors.
   15.3. National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is the largest piece of legislation
   designed to protect sites of historic and archaeological interest. It defines historic
   preservation to include the "protection, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction of
   districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects significant in American history, architecture,
   archeology, or culture". The NHPA created the National Register of Historic Places, the list
   of National Historic Landmarks, and the posts of State Historic Preservation Officers.
   15.4. NHPA applies to projects on military installations and has two major components that
   affect federal agencies when they manage their historic lands. Section 106, which is a very
   lengthy process, can prevent costly and time-consuming delays if complied with early.
   15.5. Section 106 requires the heads of federal agencies to ensure that the provisions of the
   NHPA are met. This section obligates administrators to consider what effect their projects
   will have on historic sites that are either already listed on the National Register of Historic
   Places or are eligible for listing. They must also afford the Advisory Council on Historic
   Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on the undertaking. The process also
   involves consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office in the state where the
   property is located.
   15.6. Section 110 was incorporated into the NHPA amendments of 1980 and requires federal
   agencies to play a leadership role in the preservation, restoration, and maintenance of the
   historic and cultural climate of the nation. Under this section, federal agencies must consider
   the preservation of historic resources as part of their managerial responsibilities.
   15.7. The Arkansas Historic Preservation Program (AHPP) identifies, evaluates, registers
   and preserves historic and cultural resources for the state of Arkansas. The AHPP recognizes
   properties significant at the local, state, and national levels for their association with historic
   themes, significant people or architects, their method of construction, architectural style, or
   their archaeological potential.
   15.8. No work of any type will be done to any building eligible or potentially eligible for the
   National Register of Historic Places, without written concurrence from both the base cultural

  Asset Management Flight will determine whether a facility falls under the NRHP eligibility.

  Flight at 987-3681.
