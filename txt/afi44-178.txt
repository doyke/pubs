SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include condensed sections describing the requirements for a positive HIV test and algorithms
for determining HIV infection which reference current guidelines by the American Public Health
Laboratories (APHL) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The location of the USAF HIV
Medical Evaluation Unit was updated to San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) and
the location of HIV laboratory testing was updated to the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine
(USAFSAM) HIV Testing Services, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The clinical evaluation
visit structure was modified, with HIV evaluations performed at SAMMC for initial visits,
followed by a second visit in 6 months, then yearly thereafter while the patient remains on active
duty (AD) status. Interim clinical visits will be performed as necessary in the local area based on
recommendations from the USAF HIV Medical Evaluation Unit. The sections detailing the
components of HIV clinical evaluations have been condensed with all elements of HIV clinical
evaluations to be performed according to current clinical guidelines.

                                       HIV PROGRAM

2.1. General. The AF tests all members for human immunodeficiency virus, medically
evaluates all AD infected members, and educates members on means of prevention.
2.2. Populations Tested.
   2.2.1. Accessions. All applicants for enlistment or appointment to the ADAF or ARC are
   screened for evidence of HIV infection (Attachment 3). Applicants infected with HIV are
   ineligible for enlistment or appointment to the ADAF and the ARC. Waiver for HIV
   infection is not authorized.
   2.2.2. ADAF personnel. All ADAF personnel are screened for serological evidence of HIV
   infection every two years, preferably as part of their Preventive Health Assessment (PHA).
   They are also tested for clinically indicated reasons, when newly diagnosed with active
   tuberculosis, during pregnancy, when diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI),
   upon entry to drug or alcohol treatment programs, or prior to incarceration. HIV testing is
   conducted IAW Attachment 3. (T-1)
   2.2.3. ARC personnel. Air Force Reserve personnel are screened for serological evidence of
   HIV infection every two years, preferably during their PHA (Preventive Health Assessment).
   ARC members will have a current HIV test within two years of the date on which they are
   called to active duty for 30 days or more.HIV testing is conducted IAW Attachment 3. (T-1)
   2.2.4. DoD Civilians. DoD Civilian employees are tested for serological evidence of HIV to
   comply with host nation requirements for screening of DoD employees (Attachment 6) and
   after occupationally related exposures. (T-1)
2.3. Initial Procedures for Positive Tests. All ADAF personnel testing positive are counseled
by a physician regarding the significance of a positive test. They are given information on modes
of transmission, appropriate precautions to mitigate transmission, and prognosis. ADAF
members are administered an order to follow preventive medicine requirements as described in
Attachment 7. ARC members will also be administered this order. The preventive medicine
requirements/order will not be delayed pending any administrative action. All eligible
beneficiaries are offered counseling. Contacts of HIV-infected members are notified of potential
exposure to HIV infection according to state or local law. (T-0)
2.4. Clinical Evaluation, to Include Evaluation for Continued Military Service. All ADAF
members, as well as ARC members on extended active duty, who test positive for HIV are
referred to SAMMC for medical evaluation. Per AFI 48-123 and AFI 41-210, HIV-positive
personnel must undergo medical evaluation for the purpose of determining status for continued
military service. ARC members who are not on extended active duty or who are not on full-time
National Guard duty, and who show serologic evidence of HIV infection, will be referred for a
medical evaluation of fitness for continued service in the same manner as service members with
other chronic or progressive illnesses in accordance with DoDI 1332.38. In the case of an ANG
member, it is only required if the state identifies a nonmobility, nondeployable position in which
the member can be retained. All ADAF members will have an initial evaluation at SAMMC,
followed by a visit at 6 months, then yearly thereafter while remaining on AD status. ARC and
 6                                                                  AFI44-178 4 MARCH 2014


ANG members whose condition is determined to meet Line of Duty requirements may have
initial and/or annual HIV evaluations performed at regional military facilities. ARC and ANG
members not meeting Line of Duty requirements will have an initial evaluation by a civilian HIV
specialist. The medical evaluation follows the standard clinical protocol outlined in Attachment
8 and utilizes procedures for evaluating T-helper cell counts described in Attachment 12. ARC
members not on extended active duty must obtain a medical evaluation that meets the
requirements of Attachment 8 from their civilian healthcare provider (in the case of the ANG,
only if the state identifies a nonmobility, nondeployable position in which the member can be
retained). An epidemiological assessment (including sexual contacts and history of blood
transfusions or donations) is conducted to determine potential risk of HIV transmission (see
Attachment 11). (T-1)
     2.4.1. Outcome of Evaluation for Continued Military Service. HIV seropositivity alone is
     not grounds for medical separation or retirement for ADAF members. Members shall be
     retained or separated as outlined in Attachment 9. (T-1)
     2.4.2. Periodic Re-evaluation. HIV infected ADAF members retained on active duty and
     ARC members retained in the Selected Reserve must be medically evaluated annually at
     SAMMC. Such personnel must be assigned within the continental United States (CONUS).
     Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are also acceptable. ARC HIV infected members may not
     be deployed outside of CONUS (except for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico). HIV-infected
     members shall not be assigned to OCONUS mobility positions, and those on flying status
     must be placed on Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF) status pending medical
     evaluation/waiver determination. Waivers are considered using normal procedures
     established for chronic diseases. Aeromedical waivers are considered according to the
     Aerospace Medicine Waiver Guide. Members on the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)
     or other security sensitive positions shall evaluated for suspension or temporary
     decertification during medical evaluation, as determined by their Certifying Official/Unit
     Commander on the advice of a Competent Medical Authority. The Secretary of the Air Force
     may, on a case-by-case basis, further limit duties and assignment of members to protect the
     health and safety of the HIV-infected member or other members. Submit such requests to
     Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Air Force Pentagon,Washington, DC 20330-1670.
     (T-1)
2.5. Limitations of Use of Information. Commanders and other personnel comply with
limitations on the use of information obtained during the epidemiological assessment of HIV-
infected members as outlined in Attachment 10. (T-1)
2.6. Public Health. Provides HIV education to all ADAF members, offers education to other
eligible beneficiaries, maintains a list of HIV positive personnel to be gained, reports to gaining
bases departing HIV positive personnel, and educates HIV positive members and their
dependents. (T-1)
2.7. USAFSAM. USAFSAM performs HIV testing (PHE) of submitted specimens and
conducts epidemiological surveillance (PHR) of HIV infection in Air Force members and
dependents. (T-1)
2.8. AF Blood Centers. AF Blood Centers follow policies of the Armed Services Blood
Program Office, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the accreditation requirements of the
American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). (T-0)

2.9. Combat Zone Procedures. Routine HIV testing is suspended in declared combat zones,
defined as those areas where hostile pay is authorized.
2.10. Work Restrictions. Force-wide, HIV-infected employees are allowed to continue
working as long as they are able to maintain acceptable performance and do not pose a safety or
health threat to themselves or others in the workplace. If performance or safety problems arise,
managers and supervisors address such problems using existing personnel policies and
instructions. HIV-infected healthcare workers, however, should be relieved from patient care
responsibilities until an expert review panel has met to advise the healthcare worker on work
restrictions. Recommendations to the panel will be made by HIV treatment experts during the
individual’s initial HIV evaluation at SAMMC in accordance with the most recent guidelines
from the Centers for Disease Control and Society for Health Care Epidemiology of America. The
panel should be encouraged to contact SAMMC for advice (via telephone conference call) to
ensure organizational consistency. (T-1)

                           HIV TESTING MEASUREMENT

3.1. HIV Testing Measurement. The AF’s goal is to reduce the incidence of HIV infection in
its personnel. USAFSAM tracks trends of HIV incidence in AF members. AF labs that do their
own HIV testing must communicate test results and ship corresponding serum specimens to
USAFSAM so they may ship samples to the DoD serum repository, and track trends. (T-1)

4.1. Forms. AF Form 1762, HIV Log/Specimen Transmittal, will be used for requesting HIV
testing and specimen transmittal for those sites that do not have CHCS access (see Attachment
4). AF Form 3844, HIV Testing Notification Form, will be used to notify personnel of required
HIV testing. AF Form 3845, Preventive Medicine Counseling Record, will be used to record
counseling provided for HIV positive individuals. AF Form 74, Communication Status
Notice/Request, is sent to MTF/CCs and Reserve Medical Unit (RMU)/CCs along with a copy of
the patient’s positive HIV testing screen and confirmation testing results. The MTF/CC and
RMU/CC will document on AF Form 74 that the patient has been notified of the positive HIV
results, then return the form to USAFSAM. Positive HIV results will not be finalized until
USAFSAM/PHE receives the AF Form 74. (T-1)

A2.1. Screen applicants to the USAF or ARC for serologic evidence of HIV infection. Test and
interpret results, using the procedures in Attachment 3. Counsel applicants on the significance
of test results and the need to seek treatment from a civilian physician. (T-1)
A2.2. Screen applicants for enlisted service at the Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS)
or the initial point of entry to military service. Applicants who enlist under a delayed enlistment
program who exhibit serologic evidence of HIV infection before entry on active duty may be
discharged due to erroneous enlistment. (T-1)
A2.3. Screen applicants accepted for the Air Force Academy as part of the processing for entry
into the Academy and again as part of their medical screening prior to appointment as officers.
Screen other officer candidates during their preappointment or precontracting physical
examination. (T-1)

preappointment programs established for officers. Those individuals with serologic evidence of
HIV infection, who must meet accession medical fitness standards to enlist or be appointed, are
not eligible for service with the ARC. (T-1)
A2.5. Take the following actions on officer applicants who are ineligible for appointment due to
serologic evidence of HIV infection:
   A2.5.1. Disenroll enlisted members who are candidates for appointment through Officer
   Training School (OTS) programs immediately from the program. If OTS is the individual's
   initial entry training, discharge the individual. If the sole basis for discharge is serologic
   evidence of HIV infection, issue an honorable or entry-level discharge, as appropriate. A
   candidate who has completed initial entry training during the current period of service before
   entry into candidate status shall be administered in accordance with Service directives for
   enlisted personnel. (T-1)
   A2.5.2. Disenroll individuals in preappointment programs, such as Reserve Officer Training
   Corps (ROTC) and Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) participants. The head
   of the Military Service concerned, or the designated representative, may delay disenrollment
   until the end of the academic term in which serologic evidence of HIV infection is
   confirmed. Disenrolled participants retain any financial support through the end of the
   academic term in which the disenrollment takes place. Financial assistance received in these
   programs is not subject to recoupment, if the sole basis for dis-enrollment is serologic
   evidence of HIV infection. (T-1)
   A2.5.3. Separate Air Force Academy cadets and personnel attending the Uniformed Services
   University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) from the Academy or USUHS and discharge
   them. The superintendent of the Academy may delay separation to the end of the current
   academic year. A cadet granted such a delay in the final academic year, who is otherwise
   qualified, may graduate without commission and then is discharged. If the sole basis for
   discharge is serologic evidence of HIV infection, issue an honorable discharge. (T-1)

  A2.5.4. Disenroll commissioned officers in DoD-sponsored professional education programs
  leading to appointment in a professional military specialty (including medical, dental,
  chaplain, and legal or judge advocate) from the program at the end of the academic term in
  which serologic evidence of HIV infection is confirmed. Except when laws specifically
  prohibit it, waive any additional service obligation incurred by participation in such
  programs; do not recoup any financial assistance received in these programs. Apply the time
  spent by the officers in these programs towards satisfaction of any preexisting service
  obligation. (T-1)
  A2.5.5. Counsel people disenrolled from officer programs who are to be separated; include
  preventive medicine counseling and advise the individual to seek treatment from a civilian
  physician. (T-1)

   1011, Automated HIV Shipping Form, which can be downloaded from the Brooks web site:
   http://www.tmssc.brooks.af.mil.
   A4.2.7. Guard and Reserve bases not utilizing CHCS can use developed software from US
   AFI HIV Testing Service (phone number DSN 240-8934). Guard and Reserve sites that
   access the Wright-Patterson CHCS remotely will use the CHCS ad hoc “ASL” (USAFSAM
   (Epi) Lab Referral Shipping List) function to generate their shipping list(s). This ad hoc

   function is given to all Guard and Reserve users who request CHCS access through the
   Epidemiology Laboratory Information Systems Department.
   A4.2.8. Common Errors in filing out AF Form 1762:
       A4.2.8.1. Not putting Base ID/Submitting Activity at the top of each form
       A4.2.8.2. Name - incomplete or not legible. Has name recently changed or is there a
       suffix (e.g. "Jr." or "III") after the name?
       A4.2.8.3. SSN - more or less than 9 digits; not legible. Failure to include FMP with SSN.
       A4.2.8.4. No Duty Code, no Source Code, or entry of unauthorized code.
       A4.2.8.5. No Date or Shipping official to contact in case of problems.
       A4.2.8.6. No DSN phone or commercial number if DSN unavailable.
       A4.2.8.7. Failure to retain copy of AF Form 1762. A4.2.9. Forward the first two copies
       of the AF Form 1762 to USAFSAM HIV Testing Services along with the specimens.
       Keep the third copy in the laboratory for MTF record keeping purposes to track timely
       return of results. If test results have not been received within three days, contact
       USAFSAM HIV Testing Services for assistance.
   A4.2.8.8. The MTF/CC reviews the reports and provides copies of positive results to the
   physician designated to advise and counsel HIV antibody positive individuals. (T-1)
   A4.2.8.9. DoD laboratories authorized to perform HIV antibody clinical screening in-house
   use AF Form 1762 as a log for all HIV antibody ELISA screenings performed. All five items
   of information are to be completed. By the fifth working day of the month, forward all results
   from the previous month electronically or by floppy disc to USAFSAM HIV Testing
   Services. Forward specimens tested negative to USAFSAM HIV Testing Services marked
   “DoDSR” for placement in the DoDSR. Forward a specimen from each individual who
   screens positive for HIV in local testing to USAFSAM HIV Testing Services for
   confirmatory testing. (T-1)
A4.3. AF Form 4 is used only to request Western Blot Confirmation Testing. Do not use
this form for HIV screening requests; use an AF Form 1762 as required in section A5.1.1 For
bases who perform local clinical testing and MTF Blood Banks that screen donors, all specimens
that screen positive must be sent to the HIV Testing Services for FDA confirmation algorithm
testing. Complete the form as follows: Fill out the top of the form with all required information.
Blocks 13 and 14 must be completed with Duty Code and Source Code or testing will delayed
until information is obtained.
A4.4. Duty Codes: To obtain the most accurate information possible, submitting laboratories
must use the patient category code (pat cat code) from CHCS for duty codes on the AF Form
1762 to identify the status of the individual being tested. This is an Alpha, two numeric code
which is a mandatory field when registering members into CHCS. Therefore, this information
should be available to download to an ADHOC report when computer generating the CHCS AF
Form 1762. These codes closely emulate the DEERS codes for status of individual member
being tested. For submitting activities not on CHCS, use the Pat Cat that closely defines the
status of the individual. The following are the most commonly used:

A4.6. Shipment of Specimen Requirements.
   A4.6.1. Ship specimens using instructions provided by USAFSAM HIV Testing Services. It
   is very important that the MTFs follow these instructions. Deviation could cause rejection of
   a shipment and necessitate redrawing each individual.
   A4.6.2. USAFSAM HIV Testing Services will only accept 12x75 mm polypropylene tubes.
   If the whole shipment arrives in anything other than these type tubes, the shipment will be
   returned to the submitting MTF at their expense to process in the correct tubes. Single
   specimens will have to be redrawn. Tubes and caps can be ordered from most laboratory
   supply catalogues (see below) or can be obtained by completing a supply order form and
   submitting to our Customer Service Team via email at usafsam.phe.cst@wpafb.af.mil.
   This order form can be found on our website at https://kx.afms.mil/epi.calling the
   Epidemiology Laboratory Services at DSN 240-8751 or 8378. If the submitting MTF’s stock
   runs out, it will have to hold specimens until a supply of the correct tubes are received.

                     HIV TESTING OF DOD CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES

A6.1. Direct requests for authority to screen DoD civilian employees for HIV to the Assistant
Secretary of Defense (ASD)/Force Management and Personnel (FM&P). Only requests that are
based on a host nation HIV screening requirement are accepted. Requests based on other
concerns, such as sensitive foreign policy or medical health care issues, are not considered under
this instruction. Approvals are provided in writing by the ASD/FM&P and apply to all the DoD
Components that may have activities located in the host nation. (T-0)
A6.2. Specific HIV screening requirements may apply to DoD civilian employees currently
assigned to positions in the host nation and to prospective employees. When applied to
prospective employees, HIV screening is considered a requirement imposed by another nation,
that must be met before the final decision to select the individual for a position, or before
approving temporary duty or detail to the host nation. Individuals who refuse to cooperate with
HIV screening requirements or those who cooperate and are diagnosed as HIV seropositive, may
not be considered further for employment in host nations with HIV screening requirements. (T-0)
A6.3. DoD civilian employees who refuse to cooperate with the screening requirements are
treated, as follows:
   A6.3.1. Those who volunteered for the assignment, whether permanent or temporary, are
   retained in their official position without further action and without prejudice to employee
   benefits, career progression opportunities, or other personnel actions to which those
   employees are entitled under applicable law or instruction.
   A6.3.2. Those who are obligated to accept assignment to the host nation under the terms of
   an employment agreement, regularly scheduled tour of duty, or similar and/or prior
   obligation may be subjected to an appropriate adverse personnel action under the specific
   terms of the employment agreement or other authorities that may apply.
   A6.3.3. Host nation screening requirements, which apply to DoD civilian employees
   currently located in that country, must be observed. Appropriate personnel actions may be
   taken, without prejudice to employee rights and privileges to comply with the requirements.
   (T-0)
A6.4. Individuals who are not employed in the host nation, who accept the screening, and who
are evaluated as HIV seropositive shall be denied the assignment on the basis that evidence of
seronegativity is required by the host nation. If denied the assignment, such DoD employees
shall be retained in their current positions without prejudice. Appropriate personnel actions may
be taken, without prejudice to employee rights and privileges, on DoD civilian employees
currently located in the host nation. In all cases, employees shall be given proper counseling and
shall retain all the rights and benefits to which they are entitled, including accommodations for
the handicapped as in the applicable ASD/FM&P Memorandum, and for employees in the
United States (29 U.S.C. 794). Non-DoD employees are referred to appropriate support service
organizations. (T-0)
A6.5. Some host nations may not bar entry to HIV seropositive DoD civilian employees, but
may require reporting of such individuals to host nation authorities. In such cases, DoD civilian
employees who are evaluated as HIV seropositive shall be informed of the reporting
 32                                                                   AFI44-178 4 MARCH 2014


requirements. They shall be counseled and given the option of declining the assignment and
retaining their official positions without prejudice or notification to the host nation. If assignment
is accepted, the requesting authority shall release the HIV seropositive result, as required.
Employees currently located in the host nation may also decline to have seropositive results
released. In such cases, they may request and shall be granted early return at government
expense or other appropriate personnel action without prejudice to employee rights and
privileges. (T-0)
A6.6. A positive HIV screening test must be confirmed by an FDA approved confirmatory test
according to an APHL/CDC approved algorithm. A civilian employee may not be identified as
HIV antibody positive, unless the confirmatory test is positive. The clinical standards in this
instruction shall be observed during initial and confirmatory testing. (T-0)
A6.7. Provide tests at no cost to the DoD civilian employees, including applicants. (T-0)
A6.8. Counsel DoD civilian employees infected with HIV. (T-0)
AFI44-178 4 MARCH 2014                                                                          33

A7.1. After the member is notified by a health care provider that he or she has tested positive for
HIV infection, and the significance of such a test, the MTF/CC expeditiously notifies the
member’s unit commander of the positive test results. For active duty members, the member’s
unit commander issues an order to follow preventive medicine requirements. For unit assigned
reservists, this order is issued only after their immediate commander determines the member will
be retained in the Selected Reserve. When the order is given, a credentialed provider is present to
answer any medical concerns of the member. Use the order at Attachment 13. It is signed and
dated by the commander and member. If the member refuses to sign, the commander notes that
the member refused to sign in the acknowledgment section. The order is securely stored to
protect the member's privacy and confidentiality. A copy of the order is provided to the member.
Upon the individual's reassignment, the unit commander forwards the order in a sealed envelope
to the gaining commander. The envelope is marked "To Be Opened By Addressee Only." Upon
the individual's separation from the Air Force, the order is destroyed. (T-1)
A7.2. AD members testing positive for HIV infection undergo a complete medical evaluation at
SAMMC. Upon arrival, all HIV positive members are counseled by a health care provider or by
the HIV Community Health Nurse (CHN) assigned to the HIV Medical Evaluation Unit at
SAMMC. Use AF Form 3845, Preventive Medicine Counseling Record, or similar form. The
CHN signs the form. The member signs the counseling record acknowledging receipt of the
counseling. One copy of the record is given the member and one copy filed in the records of the
HIV CHN. (T-1)
A7.3. If the member is returned to duty from the HIV Medical Evaluation Unit to a different unit
from which he or she came, the gaining unit commander issues an additional order to follow
preventive medicine requirements to the member. A copy of this order is given to the member.
Use the order at Attachment 13. The commander may request the MTF/CC or other health care
provider is present when the order is administered to answer any medical concerns of the
member. The commander and member sign and date the order. If the member refuses to sign, the
commander notes the member refused to sign in the acknowledgment section. Securely store the
order to protect the member's privacy and confidentiality. (T-1)
A7.4. It is unnecessary to recall members issued orders under former procedures. HIV
seropositive members, who have not been previously issued preventive medicine requirement
orders, must be counseled by a health care provider assigned to the local medical facility on AF
Form 3845 and issued an order (Attachment 13) by his or her unit commander. (T-1)

NOTE: DoD requested the Military Departments standardize the administration of the order to
follow preventive medicine requirements to individuals infected with HIV. The guidelines above
standardize and simplify procedures.

                          STANDARD CLINICAL PROTOCOL

A8.1. Medical Evaluation:
   A8.1.1. Accomplish a complete medical evaluation of AF personnel with HIV infection with
   an initial visit, a second visit at 6 months, and subsequent visits every 12 months at SAMMC
   as long as the member is retained on active duty. HIV disease will be staged according to
   current CDC guidelines for every clinical visit. Interim medical visits will be performed as
   necessary in the member’s local area in accordance with current DHHS Guidelines for
   Management of Adult HIV Infections. For unit assigned reservists not on extended active
   duty, this evaluation is not accomplished until after the commander’s decision to retain the
   member. If the member is retained, the evaluation must be accomplished and documented
   IAW AFI 48-123, AFI 41-210, and AFRC medical guidance on nonduty related medical
   conditions. (T-1)
   A8.1.2. Maintain a frozen serum specimen on all HIV positive individuals at a central serum
   bank for at least three years at -70 degrees Celsius. (T-1)
   A8.1.3. Seek psychiatric consultation if there are concerns about fitness for duty or if the
   screening evaluation suggests more detailed psychiatric evaluation is needed. If the patient
   has persistent evidence of diminished intellectual skills, personality changes, and motor
   impairment, more specialized studies (neurologic studies, computed tomography or magnetic
   resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, psychiatric examination, and neuropsychiatric testing)
   may be required to evaluate the possible presence of a HIV-related mental or neurological
   syndrome. (T-1)
   A8.1.4. Perform additional testing in both initial and follow-up epidemiologic/clinical
   assessments as indicated to maintain compliance with changes in accepted standards of care
   for management of HIV infection. (T-1)
A8.2. Medical Record Coding of HIV-1 Infections. Follow current ICD CM coding
guidelines for medical record coding of HIV infection.
A8.3. Disposition of Members Infected:
   A8.3.1. DoD Directive 1332.18, Separation From the Military Service by Reason of Physical
   Disability, November 4, 1996, and AFI 41-210, Medical Evaluations Boards (MEB) and
   Continued Military Service, provides guidelines for fitness for duty determinations.
   However, MEB pre-screening will occur with an Initial Review in Lieu of an MEB (I-RILO)
   under the guidelines of AFI 41-210, chapter 4, section 4k. This guidance provides I-RILO
   screening procedures for both ADAF members Air Reserve Component members. (T-0)
   A8.3.2. Refer AD members infected with HIV for I-RILO in accordance with AFI 41-210,
   immediately following the initial evaluation. However, while I-RILOs usually require a letter
   from the member's Commander indicating the impact of a member's condition upon his/her
   duty performance, such a letter is not required in the case of HIV seropositive members
   because of the risk of Privacy Act violations while routing such letters through the
   Commander's support staff. I-RILOs will only be submitted from the HIV Medical
AFI44-178 4 MARCH 2014                                                               35


  Evaluation Unit at SAMMC and individual home bases are not to submit I-RILOs or annual
  ALC-C RILOs for HIV infection. (T-1)

                             RETENTION AND SEPARATION

A9.1. Retention:
   A9.1.1. Members with laboratory evidence of HIV infection who are able to perform the
   duties of their office, grade, rank and/or rating, may not be separated solely on the basis of
   laboratory evidence of HIV infection. (T-0)
   A9.1.2. HIV-infected members who have been evaluated for continued military service and
   are retained will receive an Assignment Limitation Code (ALC-C). Please refer to AFI 41-
   210 for ALC-C stratifications and for a list of waiver authorities for OCONUS TDY and/or
   assignment. (T-1)
A9.2. Separation:
   A9.2.1. AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation,
   provides guidance for separation or retirement of AD members who are determined to be
   unfit for further duty.
   A9.2.2. AD and Reserve members with laboratory evidence of HIV infection found not to
   have complied with lawfully ordered preventive medicine procedures are subject to
   administrative and disciplinary action, which may include separation.
   A9.2.3. Separation of AD members with laboratory evidence of HIV infection under the
   plenary authority of the Secretary of the Air Force, if requested by the member, is permitted.
   A9.2.4. The immediate commander of ARC members not on extended active duty who show
   serologic evidence of HIV infection will determine if the member can be utilized in the
   Selected Reserve. If the member cannot be utilized, he/she may be transferred involuntarily
   to the Standby Reserve or separated. If separated, the characterization of service shall never
   be less than that warranted by the member's service record. (T-1)
   A9.2.5. Air Force members determined to have been infected with HIV at the time of
   enlistment or appointment are subject to discharge for erroneous enlistment or appointment.

A12.1. Analytical Procedure:
   A12.1.1. Determine the percentage of CD4+ and CD3+ positive lymphocytes by
   immunophenotyping blood cells using flow-cytometry instrumentation per applicable CDC
   guidelines. Each laboratory performing T-helper cell counts maintains a current and complete
   standard operating procedure manual. The absolute T-helper cell count is a product of the
   percentage of T-helper cells (defined as CD4+ and CD3+ positive lymphocytes) and the
   absolute lymphocyte level.
A12.2. Internal Quality Control Program:
   A12.2.1. Each laboratory maintains a comprehensive internal quality control program.
   Minimally, on each day of operation monitor the following flow-cytometry procedures or
   reagents:
       A12.2.1.1. Optical focusing and alignment of all lenses and light paths for forward-angle
       light scatter, right-angle light scatter, red fluorescence, and green fluorescence if these
       functions are adjustable on the instrument.

       in the range of biological samples.
       A12.2.1.3. Verify fluorescent compensation beads, particles, or cells with fluorescence
       in the range of biological samples.
       A12.2.1.4. A human blood control sample or equivalent.
   A12.2.2. Each laboratory establishes tolerance limits for each of the procedures or reagents
   in paragraph A12.1 Take corrective action and document when any quality control reagent
   exceeds established tolerance limits. Accomplish routine maintenance and function
   verification checks. The laboratory director regularly reviews corrective and quality control
   records.
A12.3. External Quality Control Program: The Army establishes and operates an external
quality control program to evaluate the results reported by the flow-cytometry laboratories. The
external quality control program includes a hematology survey to monitor the performance of the
absolute lymphocyte count and a flow-cytometry survey to monitor the performance of each
immunophenotyping procedure.
A12.4. Recording and Reporting Data: The laboratory director reviews and verifies the
reported results. The laboratory report contains data from which absolute and relative values may
be calculated for each lymphocyte subpopulation along with locally derived normal ranges
inclusive of the fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles. The laboratory maintains permanent files of
patient reports, internal and external quality control records, and instrument maintenance and
performance verification checks.
A12.5. Personnel Qualifications:
   A12.5.1. Properly train all personnel involved with the flow-cytometry instrumentation.

   A12.5.2. Director of the flow-cytometry laboratory holds a doctoral degree in a biologic
   science or is a physician and possesses experience in immunology or cell biology.
   A12.5.3. Technical supervisor holds a bachelor’s degree in a biological science and has at
   least two years of experience in flow-cytometry.
A12.6. Safety: All laboratories comply with the CDC biosafety level 2 standards. All
procedures having the potential to create infectious aerosols shall be conducted within the
confines of a Class II biological safety cabinet. Although certain specimen processing procedures
may inactivate infectious agents, all material is treated as infectious throughout all procedures.
Decontaminate all material generated in the processing and evaluation of blood specimens and
dispose of using established hazardous waste disposal policies.

          ORDER TO FOLLOW PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REQUIREMENTS

       Because of the necessity to safeguard the overall health, welfare, safety, and reputation of
this command and to ensure unit readiness and the ability of the unit to accomplish its mission,
certain behavior and unsafe health procedures must be proscribed for members who are
diagnosed as positive for HIV infection.

     As a military member who has been diagnosed as positive for HIV infection, you are
hereby ordered:

(1) to verbally inform sexual partners that you are HIV positive prior to engaging in sexual
relations. This order extends to sexual relations with other military members, military
dependents, civilian employees of DoD components or any other persons;

(2) to use proper methods to prevent the transfer of body fluids during sexual relations, including
the use of condoms providing an adequate barrier for HIV (e.g. latex);

(3) in the event that you require emergency care, to inform personnel responding to your
emergency that you are HIV positive as soon as you are physically able to do so.

(4) when seeking medical care, you may wish to inform the provider that you have HIV so that
the provider can use that information to optimize your evaluation and treatment;

(5) not to donate blood, sperm, tissues, or other organs.

      Violating the terms of this order may result in adverse administrative action or
punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for violation of a lawful order.

                                   ACKNOWLEDGMENT

       I have read and understand the terms of this order and acknowledge that I have a duty to
obey this order. I understand that I must inform sexual partners, including other military
members, military dependents, civilian employees of DoD components, or any other persons,
that I am HIV positive prior to sexual relations; that I must use proper methods to prevent the
transfer of body fluids while engaging in sexual relations, including the use of condoms
providing an adequate barrier for HIV; that if I need emergency care I will inform personnel
responding to my emergency that I am HIV positive as soon as I am physically able to do so; that
when I seek medical or dental care I may wish to inform the provider that I have HIV in order to
optimize my evaluation and treatment; and that I must not donate blood, sperm, tissues, or other
organs. I understand that violations of this order may result in adverse administrative actions or
punishment under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for violation of a lawful order.
