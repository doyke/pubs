This instruction implements AFPD 10-2, Readiness, and AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and
After-Action Reporting Program. This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for planning
and executing training deployments and exercise participation for Air Force Reserve Command (HQ
AFRC). It applies to all HQ AFRC Unit Equipped and Associate flying units. Requests for waivers to this
instruction will be submitted to HQ AFRC/A3XX no later than 30 days prior to the event. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been significantly revised and must be completely reviewed. Key changes to the
Instruction include: (1) redefining the responsibilities of key players in the process, including placing
ownership of approval for all deployment review requests at the director level; (2) revising the intent of
Deployment Review Group (DRG) by encouraging each Director to establish and convene a directorate
level DRG to vet DR requests for their functional area; (3) convening the Deployment Review Board after
to the Airlift Allocation Conference; and (4) redefining the purpose of the DRB as an informational brief-
ing to the CV on upcoming deployments and the results of the allocation conference.

                                         GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. The Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) exercise and deployment programs exist to
enhance readiness. This instruction outlines procedures for coordinating, planning, executing, and report-
ing on Reserve unit participation in exercises and off-station training deployments. It also aligns the train-
ing/deployment airlift requests with the Reserve Airlift Allocation Conference (AAC).

1.2. Policy: Basic guidelines for both exercise participation and training deployments include the follow-
ing:
    1.2.1. Air Force Reserve Command off-station deployment activities of all types require Headquar-
    ters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) advance notification and/or approval.
    1.2.2. As full members of the total force, AFRC must fully support the Air Force’s Aerospace Expe-
    ditionary Force (AEF) construct. Wings’ support of their AEF commitments will be their first priority.
    Wing Commanders will certify that any proposed exercise or off-station training deployment will not
    affect the unit’s capabilities to meet its scheduled AEF commitments.
    1.2.3. AFRC sponsored exercises and deployments are not to replace exercise/training programs of
    the active duty, but to augment those programs. Units are to make every attempt to accomplish their
    training requirements under the auspices of existing active duty exercises and training programs.

                           DEPLOYMENT REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Events/Deployments that require submission of a DR (Deployment Review) Request.
   3.1.1. A DR request must be submitted when one or more of the following criteria applies:
      3.1.1.1. Transportation using Reserve organic assets is requested
      3.1.1.2. Commercial travel funds are requested
      3.1.1.3. Participation in a named exercise (regardless of the operating location)
      3.1.1.4. Training/Exercises that involve foreign nationals
      3.1.1.5. Training/Exercises that involve other non-AF Services and/or non-DoD government
      agencies, personnel or facilities
      3.1.1.6. Events that support Weapons School curriculum
      3.1.1.7. Any OCONUS deployment for training/exercises (regardless of the number of personnel
      or aircraft involved)
   3.1.2. CAF units must refer to Chapter 6 for additional guidance.

3.2. Information Only Requests.
   3.2.1. Once it is determined that a DR request is required, the unit must determine if the submitted
   request is for airlift and/or transportation funds support, or for informational purposes only.
   3.2.2. A deployment request is considered "Information Only" when it DOES NOT require:
      3.2.2.1. AFRC supplied airlift or
      3.2.2.2. AFRC commercial DRB fund support
   3.2.3. If either of the above is required, then the DR request must be submitted for transportation sup-
   port and go through the DR process.

3.3. Deployment Request.
   3.3.1. Units should submit deployment requests using the documents located on the HQ AFRC/
   A3XX website at https://wwwmil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/doo/doox/.
   3.3.2. The web forms automatically transmit to the applicable NAF/A5.
   3.3.3. Use of the web form is optional for deployment activities levied down from the NAF or HQ
   FAM provided the appropriate coordination and approvals are documented via other means.

3.4. When a DR request is NOT Required.
   3.4.1. For CONUS deployments that do not meet any of the criteria in Section 3.1., a DR request is
   not required. A DR request is not required if deploying to fulfill any of the following requirements:
      3.4.1.1. Career Field and Education Training Plan (CFETP)
10                                                                          AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007


         3.4.1.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) required events
         3.4.1.3. Combat readiness ancillary training events
     3.4.2. CAF units must refer to Chapter 6 for additional guidance.

3.5. Timeline requirements.
     3.5.1. If transportation support is requested, submit a DR at least 2 months prior to the FY quarter in
     which the deployment commences (i.e., a DR for a deployment scheduled to begin in June should be
     submitted by the end of Jan). If the unit does not meet this timeline it is doubtful that airlift assets will
     be available. Refer to Chapter 6 for further functional guidance.
     3.5.2. Information only submissions should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the deployment or as
     soon as possible if the requirement comes up inside of the 30 days..

3.6. Changes to previously approved deployments.
     3.6.1. Previously approved deployments that increase the costs or number of PAX associated with the
     deployment do not require resubmission unless the increase is more than 10 percent of the original
     PAX or approved commercial funds allocation.
     3.6.2. Any change that increases (or decreases) the number of aircraft involved in the deployment, or
     the number of airlift or tanker aircraft supporting the deployment, regardless of how big the increase
     or decrease, will require re-coordination. Coordination with HQ AFRC functional OPR is mandatory
     and will ensure the appropriate databases are updated

3.7. Priorities. When assigning a priority code to a deployment, combine the applicable Airlift Priority
from Table 3.1. with the applicable Training Priority from Table 3.2. to determine overall AFRC Priority.
AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007                                                                          11


Table 3.1. Transportation/Funding Priority Codes.
Airlift Priorities
         Organic airlift is the only viable means of transportation (i.e., ORE/ORI, fighter
         deployment, austere and/or hostile location, Aeromedical training, large number
   A     personnel [i.e., more than 50 pax], palletized and/or rolling stock cargo [baggage/
         baggage pallet are not considered “cargo”], and/or non-availability or non-viability
         of commercial air).
         One or more of the following criteria:
            • 25 - 50 pax
   B
            • Deployment has a $25K commercial ticket value
            • Cargo other than baggage
         One or more of the following criteria:
            • 24 pax or less (several may be combined to make an A or B requirement).
   C
            • Deployment has less than a $25K commercial ticket value
            • No cargo other than baggage

Table 3.2. Training Priority Codes.

                                     EXERCISE PARTICIPATION

4.1. JCS/USAF/MAJCOM Exercises.
     4.1.1. HQ AFRC/A3XX will attend HHQ-level exercise planning conferences to build awareness
     among the active duty forces of Air Force Reserve mission capabilities, to educate our active duty
     counterparts about the unique limitations inherent in using Reserve forces in peacetime, and to
     develop opportunities to provide our forces with high quality, realistic training.
     4.1.2. Requests for AFRC participation in HHQ sponsored exercises may come directly through HQ
     AFRC and forwarded to the applicable Functional Area Managers (FAMs) for dissemination, or
     requests may filter up through unit, NAF or FAM points of contact. Before committing forces to par-
     ticipate in a HHQ exercise, the Unit or NAF must contact the appropriate HQ AFRC functional to val-
     idate the requirement.

4.2. HQ AFRC/NAF/Unit Sponsored Exercises. A planned AFRC-sponsored exercise involving mul-
tiple functional areas and/or assets from more than one NAF, must receive concept approval from AFRC/
CV (see section 4.3. below).

4.3. Exercise Concept Approval.
     4.3.1. When it is determined that an exercise requires concept approval, exercise planners will coor-
     dinate exercise plans through their Wing CC and NAF to HQ AFRC functional. AFRC functional
     OPRs will submit approval requests to AFRC/A3XX for staffing to AFRC/CV for approval.
     4.3.2. Exercise concept approval requests should be submitted a minimum of 6 months prior to the
     proposed exercise start date. The Exercise Concept Request Form can be accessed via the A3XX web-
     site at https://wwwmil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/doo/doox/Default.htm.
     4.3.3. If a planned AFRC-sponsored exercise will involve a single unit, a single functional area, or
     otherwise limited AFRC resources, an Exercise Concept Request is not necessary.
     4.3.4. As a minimum, submitted requests will include:
        4.3.4.1. An exercise name that begins with "PATRIOT". AFRC sponsored exercise names must
        begin with the title “PATRIOT” in order to distinguish Air Force Reserve exercise names from
        those used by other organizations. Care should be used to ensure exercise names are not offensive
        or easily confused with other military operations or exercises.
        4.3.4.2. Justification and proposed training goals for the exercise.
        4.3.4.3. Proposed dates and location(s).
        4.3.4.4. Proposed funding requirements.
        4.3.4.5. Identification of all AFRC units and number of personnel projected to participate.
        4.3.4.6. Identification of all non-AFRC organizations, assets, and number of personnel projected
        to participate. If said personnel or assets are expected to be carried on AFRC aircraft, also provide
        justification and details of required approvals (i.e., can be approved by AFRC/CC, needs an

       4.3.4.8. A detailed projection of other required assets and support requirements, including force
       bed-down arrangements (PERSCO, Services, Communications, TALCE, Medical, Transportation,
       etc.).
       4.3.4.9. A detailed projection of proposed command structure (must include an overall mission
       commander/Director of Mobility Forces and an air operations commander for the air mobility
       assets).
       4.3.4.10. Detailed reporting requirements and procedures.

4.4. Exercise Tracking. All participation by AFRC unit(s)/personnel in exercise activity will be tracked
by HQ AFRC. To facilitate this effort, any unit(s)/personnel participating in a named exercise will submit
a DR as outlined in Chapter 3. As a minimum, when a transportation request is not applicable or an Exer-
cise Concept Request is not appropriate, an Information Only DR request will be submitted.

4.5. After Action Report.
   4.5.1. After Action Reports (AAR) document and provide a description of operations including dates,
   locations, objectives, major participants, and limitations.
   4.5.2. Units should prepare and submit after action summary reports to NAF and AFRC FAMs NLT
   30 days following an exercise or training deployment. As a minimum, reports should contain the fol-
   lowing essential information:
       4.5.2.1. ORIGINATOR: POC Name/Rank.
       4.5.2.2. CONTACT INFORMATION: Telephone DSN/Commercial, E-mail etc.
       4.5.2.3. EVENT NAME: Operation/Exercise/Experiment Name, e.g. OPERATION NOBLE

                                                 Chapter 5

                                                 FUNDING

5.1. Manday and Per diem Funding.
     5.1.1. RPA and Annual Tour funding is normally provided by the participating Reserve unit for JCS,
     AF, and/or HQ AFRC tasked exercise participants.
     5.1.2. The participating unit can request additional funding for mandays thru the COCOM/MAJCOM
     using the CMAS process. Additionally, AFRC participation to support a MAJCOM test must be MPA
     funded by the appropriate MAJCOM/agency.
     5.1.3. Funding for Per diem is either the unit’s responsibility or paid by the exercise.
     5.1.4. Manday and Per Diem funding should be coordinated with the exercise Action Officer prior to
     Mid-Planning Conference.

5.2. Travel Funding.
     5.2.1. Organic Reserve airlift will be the priority for travel for all approved deployments. The func-
     tional director has authority to approve/disapprove the use of commercial travel when a DR request is
     submitted.
     5.2.2. After verification that AFRC-owned airlift is not available and the director approves the use of
     commercial transportation, the unit will formally submit a funding request for commercial travel/
     transportation reimbursement to the AFRC functional OPR.
        5.2.2.1. Upon receipt of the request for funds, the AFRC functional manager verifies the commer-
        cial transportation request against the approved deployments. The verified and approved funding
        request is then forwarded to HQ AFRC/FMAR for processing. DR approved commercial transpor-
        tation costs are paid by funds that are provided by FMAR.
        5.2.2.2. AFRC/FMAR calls/emails the receiving base to notify the unit FM of the forthcoming
        adjustment to the current funding document. AFRC/FMAR, then, allocates the funds to the appli-
        cable unit FM. The unit should publish orders using the authorized fund cite obtained from the ser-
        vicing FM.
     5.2.3. Commercial funds will not be obligated as a backup to AFRC organic airlift until after the allo-
     cations conference and the request remains unfilled. Unless otherwise authorized, commercial funds
     should not be obligated any earlier than 30 days or the last UTA prior to deployment.

                                               Chapter 6

                           ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONAL GUIDANCE

6.1. Mobility Air Forces (MAF) Flying Units.
   6.1.1. Flying unit deployment requests or notifications must be submitted through channels to WG/
   CC/DRB POC, NAF/A2A3/A5 and HQ AFRC/A3XX, respectively, when a mandatory DR notifica-
   tion has been determined according to Chapter 3 guidelines. Self-deploying CONUS movements do
   not always require A2A3 DRG approval, but the data on the deployment should be submitted to the
   NAF and HQ AFRC to keep the AFRC/CC/CV and staff appraised of unit activities and provide data
   for command historical records.
   6.1.2. Interfly during exercises must be approved by AFRC/A2A3, unless, there is a standing formal
   agreement between the other command and HQ AFRC. Check with HQ AFRC/A3T to validate the
   status of interfly agreements. Interfly is defined as filling crew positions in AFRC aircraft (single
   place or multi place) with other than AFRC personnel.
   6.1.3. Fire protection and rescue services for exercises involving aircraft are required. Vehicles and
   personnel for these services may not normally be available at other than USAF installations. Coordi-
   nate fire protection and rescue requirements with HQ AFRC/A7XF.
   6.1.4. The lead unit for all preplanned flying unit deployments (where support packages are included
   in addition to aircraft and crews) will present a pre-deployment briefing to their respective NAF/CC.
   Normally, the senior commander participating in the deployment presents the briefing. A member of
   the AFRC/A2A3 staff will monitor the briefing, normally conducted using Video Teleconferencing
   (VTC). If VTC is not available or impractical due to certain circumstances, another means agreed to
   by the NAF/CC and the HQ AFRC/A2A3 representative may be used, with prior coordination.
      6.1.4.1. Selection of the briefing officer is at the discretion of the local unit. However, all func-
      tional areas within the unit necessary to answer questions concerning the deployment briefing
      should be present at the VTC. The briefing should be given at the completion of all planning, but
      far enough in advance of deployment (approximately 30 days) to permit inclusion of special guid-
      ance or changes desired by the NAF/CC.
      6.1.4.2. The NAF/A5 provides the format for the briefing to the lead unit based on the current
      benchmark briefings for the type of deployment being briefed.
      6.1.4.3. It is the responsibility of the lead unit to coordinate the VTC briefing date and time with
      the offices of the NAF/CC/A5 and HQ AFRC/A2A3 representative only. Additional personnel
      from the NAF and HQ AFRC may attend at the discretion of the NAF/CC.
      6.1.4.4. Prior to the briefing, the lead unit sends an electronic copy of its contents (slides and
      script) to the NAF/A5 and HQ AFRC/A3XX for distribution within the respective locations.
      6.1.4.5. This briefing requirement applies to all preplanned participation in contingency opera-
      tions and OCONUS exercise deployments to include Global Power and SOUTHCOM DFT mis-
      sions. NAF/CC may waive the pre-deployment briefing requirement for small deployment
      packages on a case-by-case basis. Waiver of the briefing requirement does not waive the require-
      ment for the lead unit to send deployment details to HQ AFRC/A3XX.
16                                                                     AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007


        6.1.4.6. The following routine, non-exercise rotational OCONUS taskings are exempt from the
        formal briefing requirement: CORONET OAK and NATO AWACS Support. Units participating
        in these events must, at a minimum, ensure that their NAF and HQ AFRC/A3XX have been noti-
        fied of who the mission commander is for each rotation. HQ AFRC/A3XX will, in turn, inform the
        AFRC/CV through normal staff channels on a periodic basis. Units participating in these events
        provide, in writing, the following to their NAF/A5 and HQ AFRC/A3XX no later than 30 days
        prior to deployment:
            6.1.4.6.1. Mission Commander’s name and rank.
            6.1.4.6.2. Mission Commander Qualifications. Explain briefly why this individual is highly
            qualified to perform this duty and previous experiences.
     6.1.5. An after action report is due to the NAF and AFRC functional OPRs no later than 30 days after
     return from the deployment. Refer to paragraph 4.5. of this instruction for further information.

6.2. Combat Air Forces (CAF) Flying Units.
     6.2.1. CAF deployment requests must be submitted via the online DR form on the AFRC/A3XX
     webpage                          (https://wwwmil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/doo/doox/Forms/
     DeploymentRequestForm10AF.htm) after it has been approved by the wing DRB POC and the WG/
     CC. In addition to the guidance in Chapter 3, 10AF units will submit a DR when executing deploy-
     ments or missions that may generate General Officer, Higher Headquarters or media attention or that
     are outside of normal day to day training events (e.g., F-16s flying from Florida to Utah on a long
     range strike mission to drop live JDAMs). Contact 10 AF/A5 for more explicit guidance and MDS/
     mission specific examples. The DR will keep 10 AF/CC and AFRC/CC/CV appraised of unit activi-
     ties and provides data for command historical records.
     6.2.2. Flying by other than AFRC crewmembers in AFRC CAF aircraft during exercises and deploy-
     ments is governed by AFI 11-401_AFRC Sup 1.
        6.2.2.1. Some exercise OPORDS may require units to fly active duty personnel assigned to the
        exercise staff. The details of who will fly and the number of sorties will be addressed in
        pre-deployment planning. If an agreement cannot be reached between the exercise staff and the
        deploying unit, the 10 AF/A2A3 will negotiate the details and forward to AFRC/A2A3.
        6.2.2.2. Requirements of AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer
        Program, must be adhered to when Foreign visits include flights on Air Force aircraft. (AFI
        11-401_AFRC Sup 1, Table 1.1, Note 24)
     6.2.3. Fire protection and rescue services for exercises involving aircraft are required. Vehicles and
     personnel for these services may not normally be available at other than USAF installations. Coordi-
     nate fire protection and rescue requirements with AFRC/A7XF.
     6.2.4. The 10 AF/A5 is required to coordinate for pre-deployment briefings. This may require units to
     inform the 10 AF/A5 of deployments prior to the deadline for MI worksheets to meet the 30-day brief-
     ing goal. Units should e-mail the 10 AF/A5 with deployments dates, location, purpose, and number of
     aircraft in advance of the 30-day deadline to ensure briefing coordination is accomplished.
     6.2.5. The lead unit for all CAF flying unit deployments that require DR approval will present a
     pre-deployment briefing to the 10 AF/CC. Briefings for all other deployments will be at the discretion
     of the 10 AF/CC after unit coordination with 10 AF/A5.
AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007                                                                                17


   6.2.6. Briefings will normally be given by VTC after all planning is completed, but should be accom-
   plished at least 30 days prior to the deployment. 10 AF/A5 will coordinate briefing time, date and
   attendance, but the briefing unit is responsible to arrange for VTC usage. If the VTC is not available
   or impractical due to circumstances, another means, such as conference call agreed to by the 10 AF/
   CC, will be used.
   6.2.7. Representatives of the 10 AF/A2A3, A4, A5 and SE staffs will attend the briefing. Representa-
   tives of the AFRC/A2A3 staff will be invited to monitor the briefing. Selection of the briefing officer
   is at the discretion of the local unit. However, all functional areas within the unit necessary to answer
   questions concerning the deployment should be present.
   6.2.8. 10 AF/A5 provides the briefing formats that require DR approval based on the current bench-
   mark briefing for the type of deployment being briefed. Most briefings will be PowerPoint-based.
       6.2.8.1. PowerPoint presentations should be sent to 10 AF/A5 for review. Allow sufficient time
       for corrections and concerns to be addressed before the presentation is sent to AFRC.
       6.2.8.2. Briefing slides are required by HQ AFRC/A3XX NLT the day prior to the briefing to
       allow time for paper copies to be produced and distributed.
       6.2.8.3. The format for other deployment briefings will be at the discretion of the 10 AF/CC after
       unit coordination with 10 AF/A5.
   6.2.9. The 10 AF/CC may waive briefings entirely for small, routine deployments or may require
   in-depth briefings on deployments that did not require DR approval. It is critical that units confirm
   briefing requirements with 10 AF/A5 as soon as deployment planning is complete, but prior to 30
   days before deployment. Other than briefings on deployments that require DR approval, units may be
   required to present a briefing if:
       6.2.9.1. The deployment involves a third or more of the unit’s authorized aircraft, to include
       backup aircraft.
       6.2.9.2. The deployment is more than 5 days.
       6.2.9.3. The deployment involves the first time use of new equipment or tactics, or if the use/
       employment of the new equipment/tactics are unfamiliar to a majority of the deploying personnel.

6.3. Aerial Port Units.
   6.3.1. For aerial port deployments refer to AFRCI 24-101, Reserve Aerial Port Program, Chapter 2.

6.4. En Route Maintenance.
   6.4.1. HQ AFRC FAM for en route maintenance deployments is HQ AFRC/A4XR. Units must route
   all matters dealing with the exercise and deployment requests through the respective WG/CC, Wing
   DRB POC and NAF/A4 before submission to HQ AFRC/A4XR functional.
   6.4.2. After DRWG meets, HQ AFRC/A4 functional will update the SMS database for unit approval/
   disapproval status, funding, etc. Once complete, forward information to HQ AFRC/A3XX and notify
   NAF and Wing DRB POC of DRWG results.
   6.4.3. An after-action report is due to the NAF/AFRC FAMs no later than 30 days after return from
   the deployment. Refer to paragraph 4.5. of this instruction for further information.

     6.4.4. Scheduling. 4 AF/22 AF, in coordination with 15 EMTF/21 EMTF, accomplishes all planning
     and scheduling of Reserve personnel prior to the annual scheduling workshop. All participating repre-
     sentatives will formulate the fiscal year schedule at the annual scheduling and management workshop
     held each April. After the DRB meets, HQ AFRC/A4XR must notify the NAF and Wing DRB POC
     office(s) of DRB results, as necessary.
     6.4.5. Funding. A coordinated memo must be submitted 45 days prior to deployment date to AFRC/
     A4XR with an info copy to the NAF/A4.

6.5. Civil Engineer (CE) Prime BEEF, EOD, and RED HORSE Squadrons/Flights.
     6.5.1. This guidance is applicable to all AFRC Prime BEEF (Operations, Fire Emergency Services,
     Readiness, and EOD) and RED HORSE UTCs.
     6.5.2. Requirements and guidelines for AFRC civil engineering deployments are contained in AFI

        Project Manager’s (PM) Handbook, to include:
            6.5.2.1.1. Daily / Weekly SITREP: SITREPs are required from all DFT (Deployment for
            Training) teams. Tasked unit commanders will coordinate with AFRC/A7XO prior to deploy-
            ment the method of delivery (email or facsimile) and appropriate frequency (daily or weekly).
            Copies will be sent to AFRC/A7X, the NAF/A7XO, and Wing MSG/CC.
            6.5.2.1.2. After action reports are required to be submitted to AFRC/A7XO through respec-
            tive NAF/A7XO within 30 days of returning from deployed activity. Applicable Wing and
            Group commanders will be provided courtesy copies of this report. Reports will include a list-
            ing of all personnel deployed, project scope of work, degree of project completion, assessment
            of training received, quality of host base support provided, any safety or project LIMFACs
            encountered.
     6.5.3. Call for Annual Tour/DFT:
        6.5.3.1. AFRC/A7X will send the request for Annual Tour (AT)/DFT requirements to each NAF/
        A7C in January (second quarter FYxx) for implementation of the Annual Tour/DFT program in
        the following year (FYxx plus 1).
        6.5.3.2. Units must respond to the Deployment for Training call letter as directed.
            6.5.3.2.1. Units failing to respond by the required date may not receive DFT consideration and
            will default to home station training.
            6.5.3.2.2. Responses to the Annual Tour/DFT request must be submitted as a unit (do not send
            Operations/Fire/Readiness/EOD requirements separately).
AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007                                                                               19


         6.5.3.2.3. Unit deployment and exercise requests must be first routed through and coordinated
         with the Wing DRB POC, Airlift Coordinator, MSG/CC, and WG/CC before submitting to the
         NAF/A7C.
     6.5.3.3. Each NAF/CEO will coordinate the unit DFT request with NAF A7C/A5 offices prior to
     submission to AFRC/A7X for initial programming consideration.
     6.5.3.4. Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings (including other real-world missions)
     will receive FIRST priority for annual deployments, scheduled Silver Flag Exercises are consid-
     ered SECOND priority, and DFT and other training requirements are the THIRD priority.
         6.5.3.4.1. Units participating in an AEF cycle must include a Wing Commander certification
         that any proposed exercise or off-station training deployment will not affect the unit’s capabil-
         ity to meet its scheduled AEF commitments. Every effort will be made to avoid conflicts
         between AEF and Silver Flag Exercise.
         6.5.3.4.2. Units will indicate Silver Flag (SF) exercise training participation requirements and
         Regional Equipment Operators Training Site (REOTS) allocations needed on the annual DFT
         call letter response.
         6.5.3.4.3. All units/UTCs (except EOD) scheduled for Silver Flag training will be required to
         attend the ECS-TCC (Expeditionary Combat Support/Technical Certification Center) the
         week prior to going into SF. Exceptions will be permitted on a case by case basis on request of
         the unit commander. Both SF and TCC will be viewed as a single deployment with multiple
         itinerary stops and programmed accordingly in SMS. Intermediate itinerary PAX movement
         for large groups from the TCC to SF (Tyndall) will be by commercial charter bus pre-arranged
         by the deploying unit's Traffic Management Office (TMO).
     6.5.3.5. AFRC Civil Engineer Readiness Division (AFRC/A7X) will coordinate with each NAF/
     A7XO to allocate DFTs to units after a review of SORTS, AEF participation, dates of availability,
     training requirements, prior deployment history, airlift availability, and theater wartime task crite-
     ria.
     6.5.3.6. Units with unfavorable SORTS rating (C-2 or lower) in any training measured area will
     not be considered for off-station DFT participation unless the DFT will satisfy individual/unit
     training deficiencies.
     6.5.3.7. AFRC/A7XO will coordinate with each NAF/CEO to direct all Annual Tour/DFT
     requirements based on MAJCOM opportunities provided through AFCESA and the results of the
     annual HQ AFCESA/CEX DFT workshop in addition to Innovative Readiness Training (IRT), as
     well as late exercise and MAJCOM requests if coordinated through AFCESA.
     6.5.3.8. Unit commanders must acknowledge receipt of DFT tasking/s by 15 July, Once accepted,
     any DFT changes must be approved by the MSG/CC, wing CC, NAF CE and AFRC/A7X.
  6.5.4. Contract quarters for Prime BEEF deployments away from home station are acceptable only if
  the host base will provide government lodging and subsistence or is willing to cover the difference
  between on-base and the contract rate, including the difference in per diem. Otherwise the deployment
  will be cancelled
  6.5.5. Individual unit initiatives to secure AT/DFT opportunities is highly discouraged. Stand alone
  initiatives are subject to the same coordination and approval process as outlined in AFRCI 10-204.
20                                                                      AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007


     6.5.6. For larger construction related deployments requiring two or more multiple rotations from two
     or more AFRC Prime BEEF forces, a HQ AFRC/A7C will assign a staff project/deployment manager
     for the duration of the deployment to facilitate project progress and assist with redeployment manage-
     ment.
        6.5.6.1. HQ AFRC A7C staff members assigned for the duration of the deployment are not in the
        chain of command of deploying units and will not direct rotational forces.
        6.5.6.2. Deploying Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers in charge (OIC and NCIOC) will
        retain and exercise full control over all rotational forces during their period of deployment.

6.6. Communications and Information.
     6.6.1. Planning. HQ AFRC/A6 is the functional manager for all AFRC communications and informa-
     tion personnel deployments. HQ AFRC/A6OR is the OPR for monitoring all annual tour training and
     deployment activities for AFRC communications and information personnel and is responsible for
     submitting all A6 functional area deployment requests to the HQ AFRC/A6 for approval and the HQ
     AFRC DRWG for support.
        6.6.1.1. Each NAF/A6 consolidates and maintains copies of all respective communications and
        information organizational annual training plans and deployment plans.
        6.6.1.2. AFRC communications and information organizations are responsible for developing,
        planning, and reporting their training and deployment activities. Each organization is required to
        prepare and distribute an Annual Training Plan to their wing, NAF/RSG functional, and HQ
        AFRC/A6OR NLT 31 March. In addition, units are required to develop and provide a training plan
        at least two months prior to any exercise or deployment activity in which they participate.
     6.6.2. AFRC/A6OR will input C&I DR requests into SMS for tracking. After the DRWG meets,
     AFRC/A6OR FAM will notify the NAF/A6 and units of DRWG results and update SMS accordingly.
     6.6.3. An after-action report is due to the NAF/RSG and AFRC FAMs no later than 30 days after
     return from deployment. Refer to paragraph 4.5. of this instruction for further information.
     6.6.4. Annual training requests should be based on your unit mission type. Units should always train
     towards their “full wartime mission”. Primary consideration should be given toward UTC training,
     whether in or off-garrison. Secondary priority is given to “skills training”. Training not centered on
     the UTC (MISCAP) will be considered “skills training”. Consideration for requests not meeting these
     priorities will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

6.7. Medical Units.
     6.7.1. An acceptable annual tour site provides all requested/required training for each Air Force Spe-
     cialty Code (AFSC) deploying. Unit mission, upgrade, AFSC, and Unit Type Code (UTC) sustain-
     ment training requirements establish training parameters. Unit commanders request CONUS annual
     tours only. NAF AE FAM forwards all clinical requests to AFRC/SGX FAM prior to entering request
     into SMS. Final selections for annual tour sites are based on unit requirements, as well as, those pro-
     vided by the supporting MAJCOM, Health Services Inspection (HSI) results, and Staff Assistance
     Visit (SAV) findings. All deployment requests must be coordinated and approved through WG/CC
     and forwarded by Wing DRB POC office to NAF.
AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007                                                                               21


  6.7.2. Medical units prepare and distribute training plans 90 days before tour start date to host Medi-
  cal Treatment Facility (MTF) and Regional Support Group (RSG). Refer to paragraph 6.7.6. below for
  home station and/or incremental tours procedures.
  6.7.3. Medical readiness training requirements are authorized if units request it in the training plan
  and it is approved by the host medical treatment facility.
  6.7.4. Units forward credentials of health care providers, as defined in AFI 44-119, Clinical Perfor-
  mance Improvement, to host facility no later than 60 days prior to start date or IAW MAJCOM or
  MTF policy. Units request host facility credentials committee special requirements.
  6.7.5. Squadron medical element (SME) personnel assigned to the flying squadron must perform
  annual tour with the reserve medical unit unless a flying unit deployment requires SME support. This
  ensures maximum possible AFSC upgrade and sustainment training.
  6.7.6. When planning home-station and/or incremental tours, a single training plan includes all incre-
  ments. Prepare an addendum to the training plan for each increment; include tour dates, personnel ros-
  ter, and training requirements. Increments of six persons or less performing annual tour at home
  station (at a collocated medical facility) may prepare a single after action report to include all incre-
  ments. Suspense for this single report is 30 days following the completion of the last increment. Refer
  to paragraph 4.5. of this instruction for further information.
  6.7.7. Medical units deploying 20 or more personnel may send an advance cadre to the host medical
  treatment facility 45-60 days before the annual tour start date for planning purposes. Advance cadre
  identifies training and logistical support requirements. Send electronic trip report to HQ AFRC/SGM
  through the respective Regional Support Group/SG within 10 days following the visit. This report
  allows assistance in resolving identified problems. Advance cadre visits are unit funded.
  6.7.8. Deployments to attend the annual Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. (AMSUS) Con-
  ference require DR approval for military airlift support. HQ AFRC will not provide funds for com-
  mercial travel reimbursement to attend this activity.
  6.7.9. Unit members are not to coordinate directly with a facility for their Annual Tour. All Annual
  Tour requests must be processed through their respective RSG/SG.
  6.7.10. Formal after action reports are required for annual training tours to active duty medical facil-
  ities. Problems or situations that detract from an otherwise successful annual tour should be identified,
  in writing, to your HQ AFRC/SGM. But, an after action report is due to the NAF and AFRC function-
  als no later than 30 days after return from deployment. Refer to paragraph 4.5. of this instruction for
  further information.
  6.7.11. After DRWG meets, the AFRC/SGXO will update the SMS database for unit approval/disap-
  proval status, funding, etc. Once complete, forward information to HQ AFRC/A3XX and notify NAF
  and Wing DRB POC office(s) of DRWG results.

6.12. Comptroller Personnel.
     6.12.1. Because of its technical and statutory nature, comptroller reservist training is conducted by
     GMAJCOM comptrollers at their selected locations, Top Dollar exercises and AFRC-sponsored train-
     ing. However, comptroller reservists may deploy with their units if comptroller training is available at
     the deployment site and prearranged with the Accounting and Finance Office at the deployed location.
     All requests for deployment of comptroller Reserve personnel must be coordinated through the WG/
     CC for approval, forwarded by Wing DRB POC to the NAF and approved by HQ AFRC/FMX.

6.13. Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) Team.
     6.13.1. The AFRC functional OPR for PERSCO teams is the Personnel Readiness Operations Branch
     (A1XX). PERSCO teams deploy for training according to AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contin-
     gency Operations, when tasked by the NAFs and wing commanders.
     6.13.2. Route all matters dealing with the exercise and deployment program through the respective
     WG/CC/DRB POC and NAF before submission to HQ AFRC functional OPR. Go to https://www-
     mil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/doo/doox/Default.htm to submit request.
     6.13.3. If the PERSCO team is going to be utilized in an exercise environment and expected to begin
     force accountability immediately upon arrival, all efforts must be made to get the team manifested on
     the first chalk. It becomes practically impossible to account for personnel in the initial stages of an
     exercise, if the PERSCO team arrives after significant forces have arrived and been dispersed to per-
     form their duties.
     6.13.4. During exercises the PERSCO Team is responsible for training on the following, but not lim-
     ited to these items: arriving and accounting for all personnel, processing Data Pattern Traffic (DPT),
     completing daily duty status change messages (DSC), casualty reporting, and all other reports as
     required by AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contingency Operations. Scenarios must be available
     to ensure training on all aspects of MANPER-B operations. At the conclusion of the exercise/training
     deployment the PERSCO team must submit an after action report within 30 days after return IAW AFI
     10-215 and/or guidance referenced in paragraph 4.5. of this instruction.

6.14. Aeromedical Evacuation.
     6.14.1. The AFRC functional OPR for Aeromedical Evacuation Squadrons (AES) is the HQ AFRC
     Aeromedical Evacuation Branch (HQ AFRC/A3TM).
     6.14.2. Aeromedical Readiness Mission (ARM) airlift requests in support of flight training, flight
     currency and/or qualification requirements are not required to complete a DR request form.
AFRCI10-204 21 MARCH 2007                                                                             25


     6.14.2.1. ARM sorties must be submitted in SMS NLT 2-months prior to the FY quarter in which
     the ARM sortie commences. Refer to paragraph 3.5.1. of this document for additional informa-
     tion.
     6.14.2.2. AE schedulers will build unit ARM airlift requirements directly into SMS using Activity
     Code (ACT) “I” (information only). Local ARM sortie requests do not require SMS submission
     unless requesting an airframe not assigned at home station.
     6.14.2.3. When an ARM sortie is scheduled for an OCONUS destination an informational DR
     request is required. The SMS activity code used is “P.” Units must complete a DR request as ref-
     erenced in paragraph 3.3. of this publication.
         6.14.2.3.1. Units deploying personnel on annual tour or RPA status and requesting commer-
         cial back-up funding for transportation must include the total estimated commercial cost for all
         personnel on the DR request form and in the estimated commercial cost block in SMS.
         6.14.2.3.2. An acceptable annual tour site provides all requested/required training for each Air
         Force Specialty Code (AFSC) deploying. Unit mission, upgrade, AFSC, and Unit Type Code
         (UTC) sustainment training requirements establish training parameters.
         6.14.2.3.3. Deployments into OCONUS areas where USAF bases are NOT the deployed des-
         tination or site must be reviewed by the AFRC Threat Working Group (TWG) prior to depar-
         ture. AE units will coordinate through the assigned wing and/or access the AFRC TWG web
         page on the GCCS SIPRNET at http://intel.afrc.robins.af.smil.mil/. Contact HQ AFRC/
         A3TM for further guidance to the AFRC TWG web page.
     6.14.2.4. Deployment request are not required for TACC AE bid missions, mobilization or contin-
     gency tasking.
     6.14.2.5. Deployments to attend the annual Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.
     (AMSUS) Conference require DRG approval for military airlift support. HQ AFRC will not
     authorize funds for commercial travel reimbursement to attend this activity.
     6.14.2.6. All deployment requests must be coordinated and approved through the WG/CC and
     forwarded by the Wing DRB POC to the NAF.
  6.14.3. NAF AE FAMs will coordinate and resolve flight training aircraft availability with the NAF/
  A2A3 to assure NAF assigned units are capable of maintaining currency and qualification require-
  ments.
     6.14.3.1. AE units should maximize airlift requests by consolidating airlift requirements with
     other AE units. All off station ARM requests (i.e., cross country) will be consolidated by the
     requesting unit to jointly fly with another AE unit or programmed to a destination of one of the
     following non-collocated AE aircraft equipped wings (i.e., Lackland, MacDill, Scott,
     Wright-Patterson and Westover).
     6.14.3.2. NAF AE FAM will validate all AE requirements. Identify unresolved mission shortfalls
     to HQ AFRC/A3TM.
     6.14.3.3. NAF AE FAMs will represent assigned AE units at the airlift allocation conference to
     advocate AE unit requirements.

     6.14.4. Training. Submit training plans in advance to NAF AE FAM. NAF AE FAM will submit to
     HQ AFRC/A3TM any identified and validated problem areas or trends that impact the quality or
     availability of training.
     6.14.5. An after action report is due to the NAF and HQ AFRC/A3TM no later than 30 days after
     return from a deployment. This includes annual training tours to active duty medical facilities, exer-
     cises and any OCONUS tours (e.g. PACAF Bravo Alert/EUCOM MOA). Refer to paragraph 4.5. of
     this instruction for further information.
     6.14.6. After DRWG meets, the AFRC/A3TM will update the SMS database for unit approval/disap-
     proval status, funding, etc. AFRC/A3TM will notify NAF AE FAM of DRWG results.
