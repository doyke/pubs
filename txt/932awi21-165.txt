1. GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY.
2                                                       932AWI21-165 14 NOVEMBER 2013


    1.1. Responsibilities: 932 Operations Support Flight (OSF) Current Operations (OSO) is
    responsible for coordination, scheduling and tasking processes required to accomplish Higher
    Headquarters (HHQ)-assigned missions and local training sorties requiring the C-40C. In
    accordance with these responsibilities, 932 OSF/OSO: (1) schedules training sorties to meet
    the training needs identified by the flying squadrons (2) processes Office of the Assistant
    Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Special Air Missions Division (CVAM), Joint
    Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), and Headquarters Air Force Reserve
    Command, Directorate of Current Operations, Branch of Air Operations (HQ AFRC/A3OO)
    mission requests, (3) assigns CVAM, JOSAC and HQ AFRC/A3OO tasked missions to
    flying squadron’s (4) assists 932d Maintenance Group, Plans, Scheduling and Documentation
    Section (MXG/PS&D) with publishing the Monthly Schedule. The 73d Airlift Squadron
    (AS) and 54 AS ensure aircrew availability. 932 MXG/ PS&D is the wing’s focal point for
    aircraft availability to meet mission and training sortie taskings and for producing the
    weekly, monthly and quarterly schedules. The 932 AW and 54 AS organizations share the
    responsibility of ensuring mission requirements are properly coordinated between supported
    and supporting agencies.
    1.2. Applicability: This publication is applicable to all 932AW and 375AMW personnel
    responsible for managing, supporting, servicing, maintaining, or operating 932 AW aircraft
    at Scott AFB, IL.
2. FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES.
    2.1. Annual Flying and Maintenance Planning. The 932 AW annual plan is based upon the
    following unique factors. The 932 AW mission is short notice customer demand oriented.
    Typically OSF/OSO will receive only a two week notice for HHQ missions. Additionally,
    flying mission training in the 932 AW Distinguished Visitor/Very Important Person Special
    Air Mission (DV/VIPSAM) is normally scheduled during HHQ missions. When HHQ
    missions cannot support the mission training required, the 73AS and 54AS will generate off
    station trainer (OST) mission/s to accomplish this mission training. Local sortie/proficiency
    training is normally scheduled around HHQ missions. Therefore the annual flying and
    maintenance plan is produced by 932 MXG/PS&D in coordination with 932 OSF/OSO by
    scheduling programmed maintenance and a straight line planned execution for the year.
       2.1.1. Quarterly Scheduling. In coordination with 73AS and 54AS, 932 OSF/OSO will
       provide planned training requirements and known operational requirements by posting
       them to the master flying schedule planning document no later than 25 days prior to the
       next quarter.
       2.1.2. Monthly Scheduling. The planning monthly schedule is generated each month by
       932 OSF/OSO and 932 MXG/PS&D. Because of the unique mission of the 932 AW, the
       monthly schedule is a fluid working document managed by both agencies concurrently
       and published by 932 MXG/PS&D. It is a source document for all flying activity for the
       932 AW.
           2.1.2.1. The monthly schedule is used to ensure training requirements and
           programmed flying hours are matched with aircraft and aircrew availability while
           balancing operational missions and training needs with fleet health requirements. In
           an effort to increase flexibility and simplify scheduling requirements the 73AS and
932AWI21-165 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               3


         54AS agree to the following when submitting the monthly schedule requests through
         932 OSF/OSO to 932 MXG/PS&D for publication.
         2.1.2.2. 932 OSF, 73AS and 54AS share the responsibility of efficiently identifying
         training requirements and using available resources to provide a stable monthly
         training schedule adequate to maintain aircrew currency and proficiency. Prior to the
         last weekly scheduling meeting of the month prior, 73AS and 54AS will present 932
         OSF/OSO with the month’s training requests. 932 OSF/OSO will then input the
         requests in the Ops monthly flight planning document along with all known HHQ
         mission requests. 932 MXG/PS&D will review the inputs and make any necessary
         tail swaps to facilitate maintenance requirements.
  2.2. Weekly Scheduling
     2.2.1. Each week, 932 MXG/PS&D will present a “weekly schedule” for signature to the
     932 AW/CC, 932 MXG/CC and 932 OG/CC. This weekly schedule will finalize the
     upcoming week’s schedule and present an updated plan for the following week. After the
     weekly schedule is published on Friday prior to the execution week, it becomes active.
     2.2.2. 932 AW will submit ground training request inputs to the weekly schedule no later
     than two days prior to the weekly scheduling meeting. Inputs to the schedule will be as
     follows:
         2.2.2.1. Ground Training requests requiring the use of 932 AW aircraft for MQTP,
         MXS, and fire department training will be submitted to PS&D using the 932 MXG
         EIM website. PS&D will schedule all training requests and notify the requesting
         agency if the training cannot be scheduled due to mission requirements or conflicting
         requests. Ground Training requests for pilots and flight attendants will be submitted
         through 932 OG/Scheduling to 932 OSF/OSO for placement on the master flying
         schedule.
     2.2.3. Technical Order Revisions will be provided by 932 Maintenance Group/Quality
     Assurance (MXG/QA) and will be posted to the 932 MXG Enterprise Information
     Management (EIM) website.
     2.2.4. Flying schedule and job control numbers. All CVAM missions will be input into
     AviSource by CVAM. JOSAC missions will be input into AviSource by 932 OSF/OSO.
     932 OSF/OSO will coordinate with JOSAC to ensure Joint Air Logistics Information
     Systems (JALIS) and AviSource information matches. AFRC missions will be input into
     AviSource and Single Mobility System (SMS) by 932 OSF/OSO. All missions should be
     input into Global Decision Support System II (GDSS II) by 932 OSF/OSO no later than
     two working days prior to execution in order to allow the flying squadrons to input
     crewmembers. Flying squadrons should input crewmembers into GDSS II for missions
     and locals no later than (NLT) 1200 hours the work day prior to execution.
  2.3. Changes to the weekly schedule. Changes to the weekly schedule require an AF Form
  2407. Changes occurring after the first crew ready time of the day do not require a 2407 and
  should be coordinated through the Scott AFB Command Post (SCP) to the 932 Maintenance
  Operations Control (MOC). Crew Ready will be determined as during maintenance
  operations hours. Once the MOC is active for the work day changes to that day mission
4                                                         932AWI21-165 14 NOVEMBER 2013


    details will be conducted by phone and radio through the MOC rather than the AF Form
    2407.
    2.4. AF Form 2407 Procedures. The AF Form 2407 will be used to coordinate schedule
    changes to the weekly schedule. The agency generating the change initiates the AF IMT
    2407 using the appropriate preformatted templates on the 932 MXG/PS&D EIM website.
    Refer to AFI 21-101 AFRCSUPI and AFRC 21-165 for guidance on 2407s. The form will
    clearly state the required change and the specific reason for the change.
       2.4.1. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. IAW AFRCI 21-165 when sorties are added
       the OG/CC and MXG/CC or their designated representative will approve the 2407. The
       term "increase the flying window" is interpreted to mean any flying which will require
       maintenance presence during non-duty hours. Duty hours are inclusive of UTA
       weekends. This allows action officer coordination for all mission/sortie changes which
       do not require overtime. All other operations 2407s will be initiated, coordinated and
       approved by 932 OSF/OSO personnel on behalf of the flying squadrons.
    2.5. Local Scheduling Practices. Sortie additions & changes to the final approved document.
    Flying training activity is based on the number of aircraft available for training and validated
    training requirements. Additional training sortie requests are considered on a case-by-case
    basis.
       2.5.1. If an aircraft encounters extended troubleshooting or repair time prior to or during
       the launch sequence of events (SOE), the 932 MXS Production Superintendent will
       provide an accurate pacing Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC) and a plan of action
       to return aircraft to mission capable (MC) status to the MOC which will in turn inform
       the SCP. The Production Superintendent must take into consideration MX manpower
       availability, parts availability, cannibalization (CANN) options, weather, hangar space
       availability, etc. The MOC will pass this information to SCP.
       2.5.2. Sortie Duration, Scheduled Return and Ground Times: Sortie duration time
       includes all planned breaks in flying training. The “BLOCK” time is the “Land/End”
       time published on the weekly flying schedule. Aircrews will block-in +/-15 minutes of
       scheduled block-in time unless coordinated with the SCP/MOC. Deviations, which occur
       after crew ready time, to the scheduled departure and/or landing times must be
       coordinated through the SCP to the MOC then to the Production Superintendent. Any
       difference from the scheduled return time constitutes a schedule deviation.
       2.5.3. Departure Deconfliction: Local training sortie launches are normally planned no
       earlier than 0930L on a standard workday with at least 30 minutes of separation to assist
       launch reliability. If coordinated in advance with 932 MXG/PS&D this time can be
       reduced to meet mission requirements. Local training sortie launches and off-station
       mission departures should be scheduled to avoid simultaneous departure times and
       historical periods of restricted weather conditions. Local training sortie launches will
       normally be scheduled to depart not earlier than 1200L following a non-maintenance
       three day weekend or earlier than 1000L on any non-maintenance two day weekend to
       allow adequate time for preparation of the aircraft from the beginning of the maintenance
       production shift.
932AWI21-165 14 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                    5


           2.5.3.1. Aircraft Turn Times: Provide a minimum of two hours for aircraft turning
           from locals to locals and off-station trainers. Turn times between any sortie and a
           JOSAC or AFRC mission will be planned for no less than 24 hours. Turn times
           between any sortie and a CVAM mission will be planned for no less than 48 hours.
           Any deviation of required turn times will require 932 MXG/CC and 932 OG/CC or
           their designated representative’s approval.
2.6. Training Mission Profiles. 932 OSF/OSO schedules local training sortie durations based on
aircraft availability and sortie training requirements. Aircraft commanders and instructor pilots
are responsible for managing sortie profiles to allow accomplishment of specific training
requirements. Requests to extend the sortie duration should be made at least one duty day prior
to the flight. Aircrews will request approval for a late landing through SCP prior to departure if
possible (i.e. as a result of a late takeoff or additional training requirements) to ensure proper
coordination with MX.

   2.7. Static Displays. All organizations desiring an official static display/aircraft tour (which
   includes DVs or groups larger than 10 people) will be routed through the 932 Airlift Wing
   Public Affairs (932 AW/PA) office. 932 AW/PA will approve/disapprove and route a staff
   summary sheet utilizing the preformatted template and instructions on the 932 MXG EIM
   Website, Hangar 1 tab. In addition to aircraft requirements the 54 AS/73 AS flying
   squadrons may be asked to provide briefer(s) and/or escorts for the static display.
   2.8. Quiet Hour Requests. Periodically throughout the year events such as Change of
   Command Ceremonies, Dedication Ceremonies, etc. warrant quiet hours. Quiet hour request
   potentially impact Team Scott’s mission or training capability. Requests should be submitted
   as early as possible to ensure approval (7 days minimum). After coordinating and/or de-
   conflicting the request through 932 OSF/OSO, forward the staff summary sheet (see
   attachment 2 para A2.2) to 375 OSS/Airfield Operations with an info copy to 932 AW/PA.
   It is essential to confirm receipt of request by Airfield Operations.
   2.9. Public Affairs (PA) Flights (REF AFI 11-401_AFRCSUP1). All public affairs flights
   (Boss Day, Civic Leaders, etc) will be originated by 932 AW/PA and coordinated via staff
   summary sheet (see Attachment 2 para A2.1) by a POC responsible for coordinating the
   approval requirements. 932 AW Current Operations will coordinate the missions through
   Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC/A3OO).
   2.10. Orientation Flights (REF AFI 11-401_AFRCSUP1). All Orientation (DV,
   Familiarization, Incentive, Spouse) flights requests will be originated by the entity
   (organization/office/unit) desiring the flight via staff summary sheet (see Attachment A2.1).
   2.11. Aircraft Fueling Requirements. Standard Ramp Fuel Loads (SRFLs) are not used at
   Scott AFB; MX will refuel aircraft once they are scheduled to fly. Fuel loads for all missions
   will come from current operations and will be annotated on the weekly schedule by 932
   MXG/PS&D.
   2.12. Launch Sequence of Events (SOE). Use Table 1 and 2 to determine the appropriate
   launch sequence for initial home station mission and local sortie launches. The single point
   of contact for all mission coordination before the day of execution (DOE) is OSF/OSO. On
   the DOE all mission coordination is accomplished through SCP.

NOTE: In the event of inclement weather 932 OSF/OSO will determine the
proper SOE NLT entry into crew rest for a given sortie the day prior to execution
and will notify squadron schedulers of the expected show times. Squadron
Schedulers will ensure crews are set up for the correct Legal for Alert (LFA)
time. An additional 30 minutes may be provided for sorties in order to
compensate for deicing requirements.
