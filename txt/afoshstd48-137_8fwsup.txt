and alternate(s) RPP managers for their shop. More than one primary and alternate manager is
allowed for shops supporting multiple shifts. This will be re-accomplished if and when changes

respiratory protection. In case of emergency after duty hours, a BE representative may be
reached through the Command Post.
2.8.16. (Added) Create/maintain a shop-specific respiratory protection program operating
instruction (RPP OI) using the template provided by BE. If there are any changes in the shop
operations, the supervisor will inform BE of these changes so BE can evaluate the process
accordingly and the RPP OI can be updated and approved.
2.8.17. (Added) Maintain a RPP binder that is readily available to all personnel in the shops.
This binder must include, as a minimum, the following:
2.8.17.1. (Added) AFOSH Standard 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program.
2.8.17.2. (Added) This supplement.

questionnaire and hand-carry it to Force Health Management (FHM) for medical clearance.

AFOSHSTD48-137_8FWSUP 20 JANUARY 2012                                                            3


hand-carry it FHM for medical clearance. Note: There is no questionnaire for annual fit-tests.
The worker will be asked during their annual fit-test if they have experienced any difficulty
wearing a respirator. If yes, then they are no longer medically-qualified and will resubmit a
questionnaire to FHM for medical clearance. If the worker has not experienced any problems
with the use of their current respirator then they will be fit-tested under normal circumstances.

unserviceable before discarding them according to paragraph 9.2.4 of this instruction

(RPP) review. The workplace will again notify BE in writing when the discrepancies have been
resolved and closed.
2.12.6.15. (Added) For compressors that are not oil-lubricated, perform a carbon monoxide
(CO) survey using an instantaneous meter. Compressors should be located in a clean air
environment and carbon monoxide readings must be <10 ppm (parts per million). Provide this
survey in writing to the shop and file a copy in their respective casefile. This survey must be re-
accomplished if/when the compressor is moved to a different location (29 CFR 1910.134(i)(6)).
2.12.6.16. (Added) Provide assistance, as required, to procure respirators. BE will assist by
identifying specific replacement cartridges, model and part numbers, National Stock Number

testing. BE will instruct the individual to keep a copy for their records and provide their
supervisor with a copy.
2.12.6.18. (Added) Maintain a hard copy of all personnel fit tested. Should an individual need a
hardcopy and it cannot be located, BE personnel will administer a new fit test for the individual
during the regularly scheduled times.

personnel enrolled in the RPP for protection against airborne infectious diseases.
2.16.4. (Added) Maintain a current personnel roster and provide updates to BE when personnel
change but at a minimum of monthly.
4.2.3.5. (Added) If personnel believe emergency-use respirators are required for egress, the
workplace supervisor must contact BE. BE will review emergency/spill scenarios and select the
best egress respirator, if one is required.
9.3.1. (Added) Applicable shops will provide BE with results of their Breathing Air Quality tests
within 2 weeks of receipt.
