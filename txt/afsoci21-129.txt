                                          Chapter 1

 AFSOC CENTRALIZED REPAIR FACILITY (CRF) MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY
                           AND POLICY

1.1. Introduction. This instruction prescribes the basic AFSOC CRF requirements and
responsibilities. AFSOC CRFs have been established to centralize Intermediate-Level
Maintenance (ILM) for T56-15 engines and 54H60-91/117 propellers, AFSOC unique avionics
Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and C-130 Isochronal Inspections (ISOs). AFSOC CRF senior
managers continually evaluate potential candidates for centralized maintenance and will identify
prospective candidates for inclusion in CRF operations. Additionally, they strive to increase
throughput with standard work processes that improve supply chain velocity, including
maintenance, repair and overhaul. The benefits of Continental United States (CONUS) CRFs
include: training like we fight, production smoothing and workload-leveling, efficiency through
economies of scale, improved reliability-centered maintenance, and enhanced opportunities for
on-the-job training.
1.2. Organization. AFSOC CRFs are currently established at Hurlburt Field within the 1st
Special Operations Maintenance Group (SOMXG) and assigned to the 1st Special Operations
Equipment Maintenance Squadron (SOEMS) and 1st Special Operations Component
Maintenance Squadron (SOCMS). The 1 SOEMS is responsible for the C-130 ISO CRF and the
1 SOCMS is responsible for propulsion (T56-15 engine and 54H60-91/117 propeller) and
avionics CRF.
   1.2.1. AFSOC CRF supported units are 1 SOW, 27 SOW, 352d Special Operations Group
   (SOG), 353 SOG, 58 SOW, 919 SOW, and all deployed AFSOC units with C-130 aircraft
   assigned.
   1.2.2. AFSOC Logistics Operations Cell (LOC) provides improved aircraft availability for
   AFSOC forces through operational support and oversight of command CRF operations. In
   this role, the LOC manages CRF processes by coordinating and prioritizing CRF input and
   output to AFSOC units based on command priorities. It is the single point contact for CRF
   stakeholders and outside agencies into CRF operations. In addition, the LOC identifies and
   coordinates corrective actions for shortages with regard to parts, personnel, and other
   resources for CRF operations.
1.3. Command Authority. Primary CRF oversight will be provided by both the HQ
AFSOC/A4 through the LOC and the 1 SOMXG. However, a teaming concept is essential for
effective CRF operations; therefore, all CRF supported unit leadership should communicate CRF
support concerns or deficiencies to the LOC through the AFSOC CRF Community of Practice
(CoP). Specific Command and Control (C2) responsibilities are covered in Chapter 2 of this
instruction.
1.4. CRF CoP. Logistics and maintenance managers need accurate and timely information to
make command and control decisions over CRF activities. Current data systems will be utilized
to help manage and run the AFSOC CRF network. As future systems are brought on line, the
new systems will be incorporated as appropriate. The CRF C2 network will leverage current and
standard Information Technology systems. For oversight purposes, the LOC will use a CoP that
 4                                                          AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011


combines status, schedules, metrics, and other necessary C2 documentation to give all AFSOC
CRF stakeholders an accurate sight picture of CRF commodities.
     1.4.1. Access/Requirements: The CRF CoP is open to the public; therefore, users will not
     require membership unless they need to post documents. The LOC will approve access to
     those required to post documents. The CoP is accessed via the Air Force Portal at:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-LG-SO-17
1.5. Cannibalization (CANN) of Assets.
     1.5.1. Aircraft CANN actions. Supported units will retain CANN authority for all on-
     aircraft CANN activity.
     1.5.2. Avionics LRU. There will be no CRF-repaired LRUs retained at supported locations
     as off-aircraft CANN assets unless approved by the LOC to meet exceptional mission critical
     circumstances.
     1.5.3. Spare Engines. Units are authorized to CANN from spare engines but must notify the
     LOC Engine Manager of CANN action within 24 hrs to determine best course of actions to
     return engine to serviceable status.
1.6. Documentation. The CRF and supported units will update the CoP and maintain all
required status, inventory, and historical record documentation, including manual documentation
methods and applicable maintenance information systems inputs for CRF-repaired assets.
1.7. Metrics. CRFs will report performance against various customer and production metrics
specified in each of the following sections of this instruction: Chapter 3, Engine CRF, Chapter 4,
ISO CRF, Chapter 5, Avionics CRF, and Chapter 6, Supply Chain Management. The metrics
will be posted to the CRF CoP by the fifteenth duty day of each month.
1.8. Liaison with Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) and the Global Logistics Supply
Center. CRF operations rely on a robust relationship between maintenance, materiel
management and transportation. CRF pipeline velocity must be sustained at a level supporting
unit requirements. Procedures to ensure the rapid movement of retrograde and sustainment
assets between the CRF and supported units are found in chapter 6 of this instruction.
AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011                                                                          5

     systems (GTN, Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS), etc.) and ensure
     prescribed repair echelon and transportation routing is being followed. Make every effort
     to unblock bottlenecks in the transportation pipeline that may occur.
        6.2.2.4.1. Monitor the Due-in Receipt Listing (R28/NGV865) on a daily basis to
        review unserviceable (retrograde) assets inbound to the CRF. Ensure all SBSS
        records have the required data (e.g. each NSN should have applicable org/shop of the
        repair facility) to facilitate automatic processing of the unserviceable receipt.
        6.2.2.4.2. Monitor the Repair Cycle Management List (D23/NGV905) on a daily
        basis to follow-up on unsatisfactory DIFM status or items without status.
        6.2.2.4.3. Monitor the Due-Out Status Listing (R31/NGV851) or local script daily for
        lateral requisitions for supported units. Process lateral shipments from CRF account

     PPMR processing, coordinate with the supported base or Records Maintenance to correct.
     6.2.3.2. Process all transactions to turn in serviceable assets to stock. Ship unserviceable
     assets deemed not repairable at the CRF back to the depot, using approved transportation
     packing orders. Note: Serviceable assets will be placed on the CRF (satellite) account
24                                                        AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011


     for release to CRF supported bases or to worldwide redistribution if no requirement exists
     at the supported units.
     6.2.3.3. Provide personnel to support CRF activities.
     6.2.3.4. Provide temporary storage for repairable assets until delivered to the CRF.
     6.2.3.5. Provide storage for serviceable assets awaiting disposition IAW proper
     warehousing procedures.
     6.2.3.6. Ensure maintenance personnel have the capability to access SBSS reports (e.g.,
     D-23 DIFM listing) needed for day-to-day management of the CRF. Provide a single
     turn-in point for CRF SRUs and LRUs.
     6.2.3.7. Ensure DIFM status updates and ETIC dates are received daily from CRF.
     6.2.3.8. Ensure the expeditious receipt, handling, and shipment of CRF-supported LRUs.
     6.2.3.9. Transport unserviceable assets to the CRF repair facility for repair and
     coordinate the pick-up of repaired/serviceable assets and items deemed not

     Listing), on a daily basis to follow up on unsatisfactory DIFM status or no status.
     Coordinate with the CRF maintenance shop for updates.
     6.2.3.11. Monitor the D-19 Awaiting Parts (AWP) validation listing. Follow-up with
     depots as required ensuring timely receipt of parts required to repair DIFM items.
     6.2.3.12. Establish Forward Supply Points and Quick Reference Lists as identified by
     CRF managers.
  6.2.4. 1 SOLRS Storage and Issue will:
     6.2.4.1. Provide   interface   between    maintenance,     materiel   management,      and
     transportation.
     6.2.4.2. Provide adequate supply capability to receive, store, and distribute required
     items.
     6.2.4.3. Verify funding, packing, and shipment paperwork.
     6.2.4.4. Arrange shipment through CMOS based on established business rules, unless
     LOC/635 SCMG alters normal shipment requirements.
     6.2.4.5. Load, block, and brace the engine as required upon carrier arrival. If moved by
     truck, shipment must be an Air-Ride equipped trailer.
     6.2.4.6. Ensure historical demand rate data from CRF supported bases remain with the
     units.
     6.2.4.7. Maintain parts availability to support steady state and surge operations. This
     will be accomplished by establishing required bench stocks, supply points, and adjusted
     stock levels.
  6.2.5. CRF Supported LRS Units will:
AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011                                                                 25


       6.2.5.1. Process unserviceable repairable as Not Repaired This Station (NRTS) code ―D‖
       (ship to another base to repair) assets for shipment to the CRF within 24 hours but NLT
       next duty day.
       6.2.5.2. Process unserviceable turn-ins for shipment with required documentation
       (Unserviceable Tag/DD Form 1577, Maintenance Action Tag/AFTO Form 350 IMDS
       screen #122 snapshot and supply shipping document/DD Form 1348). Supported bases
       should also include IMDS screen #122 snapshots. At no time should assets be shipped to
       the CRF without being processed through the ES-S. Do not ship assets on a DD Form
       1149 as accountability and visibility of the asset will be lost.
6.3. Mobility.
   6.3.1. Increased workloads at any CRF (CONUS or OCONUS) to support contingencies will
   require the use of MRSPs and CHPMSKs deployed to that CRF’s location.
   6.3.2. The MRSP will be segmented so that only the applicable parts are deployed. For
   example, if a CRF only repairs ALQ-172 systems, then only SRUs to support the ALQ-172
   would deploy to the CRF.
   6.3.3. The MRSP will include a Consumable Readiness Spare Package (FCRSP) for
   consumable parts deployed to the CRF.
   6.3.4. The supported MAJCOMs will compute the SRUs the CRF needs to support the
   increased need to repair FOL LRUs. Tasked units deploying to Forward Operating Locations
   (FOLs) will identify any SRUs in their MRSPs to the supported MAJCOM.
   6.3.5. The deploying unit will segment its kits and transfer the appropriate segments to the
   CRF SRAN.
   6.3.6. The deploying unit will transfer its MRSP segment of SRUs the CRF needs to the
   CRF account. CHPMSK will support any needs above the segmented MRSPs.
   6.3.7. If the CRF requires additional SRUs, the supported command will generate a request
   to AFSOC A4R for a CHPMSK to augment the SRU segments of the MRSPs. CHPMSK
   will be configured to augment MRSP segments as applicable using the Aircraft Sustainability
   Model (ASM) and following guidelines in AFM 23-110, Vol 1, Part I, Chapter 14. Levels
   will be negotiated jointly between the lead MAJCOM and the 635 SCMG Requirements
   Team, and approved by HQ USAF/ILGP.
   6.3.8. Any outside organization supported by AFSOC’s CRF requires an independent shop
   and organization under Department of Defense Activity Account Code (DODAAC) FB1820;
   current AFSOC units are not affected. Any changes to current business rules or outside
   organizations must coordinate with the Command Flying Hour Program Office, HQ
   AFSOC/A4RR.
   6.3.9. Coordinate with the owning SCMG (635/735) to transfer the Automated Information
   System segment of deploying units MRSP to the Avionics CRF location. The CRF levels are
   not developed to support units requesting support from the CRF. Supported units’
   transferred MRSP will provide the needed SRUs to repair their assets.
   6.3.10. Perform review of all CRF supported NSNs (including related ISG NSNs) to ensure
   applicable records are loaded properly once at the deployed site.
 26                                                         AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011


6.4. Transportation.
   6.4.1. Origin Traffic Management Responsibilities. Arranging the movement of CRF
   assets will be the same as those used for like items originating from non-CRF locations.
   Transportation shipping procedures are outlined in AFI 24-203, Preparation and Movement
   of Air Force Cargo, and DOD 4500.9R, Part II. All assets will be tracked using GTN,
   Tracker, or other electronic capability as needed. The LOC will engage with HQ
   AFSOC/A4RE on a case-by-case basis for assistance with delayed assets within the
   commercial and/or military transportation pipeline. The Distribution Flight will coordinate
   funding for assets and assign the designated Working Capital Fund/Second Destination
   Transportation (SDT), Transportation Account Code (TAC) or utilize local funds to ship
   assets. All CRF-specific assets will reflect a FB1820 DODAAC. As a reminder, IAW AFI
   10-403, Deployed Planning and Execution, shippers must utilize the Distribution Flight for
   in-transit visibility purposes. This is especially important when the organic Air Force Special
   Airlift Mission (FSAM) transportation method is utilized. Shippers must never bypass the
   local Traffic Management Office when shipping DOD assets.
   6.4.2. Traffic Management Responsibilities (HQ AFSOC/A4R matrixed position to the
   LOC): The Transportation representative will be a liaison between maintenance, supply, and
   the Distribution Flight to ensure time definite delivery of CRF assets. The transportation
   representative will monitor the movement of all CRF assets from origin to destination. Asset
   movement status will be briefed to LOC managers as needed.
       6.4.2.1. Transportation representatives will initiate a tracer action when an asset transit
       time exceeds the stated movement standard in DOD 4140.1R, DOD Supply Chain
       Material Management Regulation.          Transportation representatives can use the
       transportation company’s web site Global Transportation Network, or any other method
       to obtain in transit visibility status.
       6.4.2.2. All diversions or re-consignments will be coordinated with the origin
       Distribution Flight.
       6.4.2.3. Greensheet requests will be submitted to the CLO transportation representatives.
       The transportation representatives will review the greensheet request(s) and submit the
       AMC Airlift Export request to Air Clearance Authority, AFMC/LSO/LOLA.
   6.4.3. Destination Traffic Management Responsibilities. Procedures will remain as
   outlined in current guidance.
   6.4.4. The supported LRS outbound freight section will ensure assets shipped to CRF
   activity already have the correct TPO and SPI. If the unit doesn’t have the required
   container, they will submit an AF Form 451 to LRS.
6.5. Financials.
   6.5.1. CRF supported MAJCOMs and 635 SCMG C2 Cell Program Manager will monitor
   the CRF supply accounts for the availability of funds and take the necessary actions to ensure
   funds are available to support the CRF maintenance schedule.
   6.5.2. CRFs will use the appropriate PFMR/OCCR SBSS accounts for each supported unit
   until future financials are implemented.
AFSOCI21-129 19 AUGUST 2011                                                              27


  6.5.3. Work with the 635 SCMG to coordinate between supported and supporting units to
  ensure items in the repair process whether in transit, Awaiting Maintenance (AWM), or
  AWP are not left without appropriate funding. This will preclude ―orphaned‖ assets and the

Note: This checklist will be utilized prior to any commodity being added to
CRF operations. There are two primary methods for adding commodities to
the CRF enterprise: 1.) Items which will be identified as base or unit level
repair through the source of repair analysis (SORA) during the system
acquisition process and 2.) Review of existing commodities with the RNI
In/Out Decision Tree to determine if they meet best practice criteria as a
CRF commodity. Proposed CRF commodities will be vetted through the CRF
Process Advisory Council (PAC) for approval by the CRF Executive Council
(EC) via a business case analysis addressing manpower, facilities, SE, return
on investment, etc. New commodities which are determined to be CRF’d
during the SORA or similar process will have MAJCOM analysis conducted
prior to approval.
