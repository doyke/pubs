1.4.6.5.1. (Added) Conduct a Squadron Training Review Board (TRB). At a minimum
squadron commanders will ensure newly assigned aircrew member’s flight records and Flight
Evaluation Folders (FEF) are reviewed and determine the appropriate upgrade for the individual.
Units should open applicable unit assigned training folders through a Memorandum For Record
(MFR) referencing the unit Training Review Board minutes and signed by the Squadron
Commander or Operations Officer. Maintain a copy of the MFR in each applicable 4022.
Aircrew members re-qualifying to levels beyond basic aircraft or mission qualification (non FTU
courseware) can be trained in-unit as specified by the unit commander. In-unit upgrades to
instructor for previously qualified AF instructors will be directed by the 94 OG/CC IAW AFI 11-
2C-130 Vol3 paragraph
1.5.2.1. (Added) Unless otherwise specified, waiver authority for items in this supplement, not
governed by 11-2C-130 Vol 1, is the 94 OG/CC. All waiver requests will be coordinated
through 94 OG/OGV prior to initiation of training. Document all waived items on an AF Form
4023 and AF 4024.
5.4.5. Request for secondary method, when applicable, will be IAW AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 1
through the AFRC web based waiver server. “Secondary method” (in-unit) training waivers will
only be processed after a request for an FTU training slot has been denied. The waiver request
must include the denied quota request. Include a copy of the waiver approval in the AF 4022.
Those members enrolled in specialized training for the first time will use Aircrew Training
System (ATS) courseware and instructions contained in AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 1. All upgrade
candidates’ FEFs will be reviewed by 94 OG/OGV.
5.4.5.1. (Added) Aircrew members previously qualified as AF instructors may train to C-130
instructor qualification by completing the events outlined in the position-specific Instructor Re-
qualification AF Form 4024 (see the 94 OSS/OST CoP) IAW AFI 11-2C-130 Vol1, paragraph
5.4.5. Prior to an instructor evaluation, the instructor candidate will complete a locally-generated
instructor test administered by OGV. Squadron operations officers may direct further events to
ensure adequate training.
5.4.5.2. (Added) Formal Training Unit Instructor Training (FIT). The 94 OG/CC is the
approval authority for all FIT courses and the 94 OSS/OST will maintain them on the 94
OSS/FTU Local Area Network (LAN) folder. See the 94 OSS/OST FIT Process Guide for more
information, training standards, and AF 4024s.
5.4.5.3. (Added) FIT Instructors. FIT instructors will ensure the upgrade instructor has a good
working knowledge of all training material. They will explain the operation of all multi-media
aides, scheduling of training aides outside the unit, and location of other FTU training material.
5.13.1. (Added) See AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3, 94 AW SUP. Functional Check Flight (FCF)
upgrade training will be conducted by 700 AS. At the discretion of the OG/CC, aircrew
members who were previously FCF certified can complete a tailored FCF upgrade training
program. In addition to Pilots and Flight Engineers, OG/CC may also certify highly qualified
Navigators and Loadmasters as FCF Qualified. As a minimum, the FCF upgrade program will
consist of an interview with the 94 OG/CC program manager. Qualification will include a
review of the applicable regulations and completion of the FCF examination. An FCF profile
will be flown during training (simulator training may fulfill this requirement). After completion
of FCF upgrade training, 94 OG/OGV will prepare an FCF certification letter to be signed by the
94 OG/CC. The certification will be documented on the Letter of Xs.

5.13.2. To maintain FCF currency, aircraft commanders and flight engineers are required to
complete the 94 OG/OGV FCF examination annually. An overdue FCF examination results in
loss of FCF currency. To regain currency, re-accomplish the FCF examination.
5.18. (Added) Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup). All individuals entered into the Ops Sup
upgrade program will accomplish training IAW AFI 11-418 94 AW SUP.
