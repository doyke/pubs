JOB PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT LIST
A2.1. Sections Comprising the JPRL.
A2.1.1. The JPR column contains the alphanumeric designation for each JPR.
A2.1.1.1. Area – A grouping of tasks that support the accomplishment of a single mission or
multiple mission components.
A2.1.1.2. Task – An observable/measurable unit of work that independently forms a significant
part of a duty and is selected to reflect mission needs.
A2.1.1.3. Subtasks – A subordinate unit of work derived from a task. Subtasks generally, but not
always, focus on capabilities or reporting requirements that are utilized to accomplish a task.
A2.1.2. The Description column contains the task nomenclature.
A2.1.3. The Exposure heading is supported by four columns indicating different methods of JPR
exposure.
A2.1.3.1. The Proficiency (PROF) column indicates the proficiency level that JPRs are to be
trained and evaluated. Reference Attachment 7 for detailed explanations of proficiency codes.
A2.1.3.2. The TEPS column indicates the task TEPS level that JPRs are to be trained and
evaluated. Reference paragraph 6.3.2. for detailed explanations of the various TEPS/ETEPS
levels.
A2.1.3.3. The Training (TRNG) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies the
environment(s) where that JPR is required to be trained.
A2.1.3.3.1. If the exposure column is blank the task must be trained in the classroom and trained
in the APT or aircraft.
A2.1.3.3.2. Classroom Tasks. A “C” indicates this JPR is only required to be trained in
classroom. Classroom tasks are repetitive and may occur inherently in the APT in order to
accomplish another JPR. Classroom training is adequate; however, additional training may be
accomplished in the APT. There is no requirement to plan or track exposure of these JPRs
outside the classroom environment.
A2.1.3.3.3. Enrichment Task. An “E” indicates a JPR that is not required to be trained.
Enrichment tasks are used to enhance a crew member’s conceptual knowledge or situational
awareness. Enrichment tasks may be trained in any environment. Exposure of these JPRs are not
required to be planned or tracked.
A2.1.3.3.4. Inactive Task. An “I” indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will not be
trained. HQ 20 AF/A3N will establish training requirements if an “I” task becomes active.
A2.1.3.4. The Evaluation (EVAL) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies the
environment(s) where that JPR may be evaluated as well as the eligibility for that JPR to be
evaluated.
A2.1.3.4.1. Required Evaluation Task. An “R” indicates a task that is required to be evaluated in
the APT or in the operational environment. Exposure of these JPRs are required to be planned
and tracked.
A2.1.3.4.2. Optional Evaluation Task. An “O” indicates a task that is not required to be
evaluated. Optional evaluation tasks may be scripted to facilitate scenario presentation or may
occur inherently in order to accomplish another JPR. There is no requirement to plan or track
exposure of these JPRs.
A2.1.3.4.3. Inactive Task. An “I” indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will not be
evaluated. HQ 20 AF/A3N will establish evaluation requirements if an “I” task becomes active.
A2.1.4. Additional training and evaluation guidance for JPRs.
A2.1.4.1. A new task entered in the JPRL is not required to be evaluated before performing the
task on alert. Following completion of initial task training, the task should be emphasized in
evaluations during a 3-month period. This period will start based on the operational factors and
resource constraints affecting each unit’s ability to execute the training necessary to achieve
proficiency in the new task. The level of exposure should be great enough to provide a
representative assessment of training effectiveness.

crew member knowledge and proficiency. Unit level training supports these activities with
formal standardized training. Training must challenge personnel to ensure all concepts are
understood to correctly respond to all tasks. It goes beyond training required for qualification
and is intended to increase a person’s knowledge of job-related tasks, other duty positions, and
the work environment.
     1.1.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will design and implement a structured training program to
     ensure procedures contained in technical orders, checklists, Tactics, Techniques, and

                          TRAINING SCENARIOS AND SCRIPTS

6.1. Training Scenarios. The purpose of a training scenario is to reinforce classroom training,
guide individual self-study, allow students to demonstrate proficiency in performance level tasks
and to maintain an individual’s or crew’s proficiency. Training scenarios will test the ability to
multi-task, and force personnel to react to situations ranging from fundamental to complex in a
controlled environment. Scenarios will emphasize knowledge and skills necessary to execute the
mission.
   6.1.1. Crew members should be trained in a realistic crew environment.
   6.1.2. Scenarios administered to an individual or crew may consist of a single task, a group
   of tasks strung together or multiple tasks occurring simultaneously.
   6.1.3. Training scenario results are based on crew member performance on each task or
   subtask with respect to the applicable performance standard.
   6.1.4. Operational environment training will be used to train tasks that cannot be otherwise
   simulated (e.g., PRICE check, UHF C3 BCA switch, etc.). Use a lesson plan to minimize the
   risk and standardize the training shown in the operational environment.
6.2. Training Scripts. The 625 STOS/ALCS will design and use scripts to conduct training
scenarios to ensure standardization of presentation and proper application of performance
standards. Scripts will include instructions for instructors, simulated inputs, and status card
inputs as applicable.
   6.2.1. All simulation materials will be marked ―For Training Use Only‖.
   6.2.2. Proficiency Scripts will contain valid peacetime and wartime stimuli. Stimuli will be
   identified by JPR, task description, initiation and response agencies, as well as notes or
   expected responses (i.e. TEPS/EWO TEPS (ETEPS) notes, instructor notes and expected
   trainee response).
       6.2.2.1. Estimated scenario run times, if included, are for scenario presentation only and
       do not establish a time standard for completing actions. Applicable time standards must
       be annotated within the script.
       6.2.2.2. The monthly recurring and any qualification APT scenario will have a minimum
       of one Level A performance event.
   6.2.3. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety or cause
   equipment damage.
   6.2.4. EWO and weapon system portions of training may be designed to provide a seamless
   training session.
   6.2.5. Monthly recurring training scripts will be designed not to exceed 3 hours.
   6.2.6. Qualification and supplemental training scripts will be designed not to exceed the
   scheduled APT time.
 18                                                 AFGSCI13-5302V1 17 NOVEMBER 2011


   6.2.7. Scripts must be fully coordinated prior to being used for documented training. At a
   minimum, coordination for training scripts must include the Chief, ALCS Flight and Chief,
   ALCS Training. Scripts will be coordinated with outside agencies as required.
       6.2.7.1. The Chief, ALCS Flight will be the final approval for all training scripts.
   6.2.8. The 625 STOS/ALCS must retain training scripts and ancillary items such as status
   cards and script programs in either paper or electronic copy for a period of at least 12 months
   from the on-line date. This does not require a removable storage element for old revision
   products. Off-line scripts do not require updates.
6.3. TEPS and Timing Constraints. TEPS detail task performance, standards, timing
requirements and constraints for the express purpose of standardizing training and evaluation that
support operational mission ready certification requirements.
   6.3.1. TEPS/ETEPS are designed for preparing and presenting training and evaluation
   materials and will be used to prioritize tasks during an evaluation. TEPS/ETEPS will not
   supplement technical data or instructions.
   6.3.2. TEPS/ETEPS are divided into three levels.
       6.3.2.1. Level A - Tasks, if not performed correctly, could result in mission failure,
       endangerment of human life, serious injury or death, or require an elevated level of
       proficiency.
           6.3.2.1.1. Level A tasks have the greatest potential for mission and/or personnel
           impacts and drive the most stringent training and evaluation program requirements.
           6.3.2.1.2. Asterisked Level A performance standards are not subject to judgment and
           require strict application and adherence. Asterisked Level A’s are used where a direct
           correlation exists between exceeding the time and a tangible undesirable outcome, or
           a task requires a higher level of proficiency necessary for mission accomplishment.
           6.3.2.1.3. Non-asterisked Level A performance standards provide an objective
           measurement guideline for performances requiring urgent action. Because event
           outcome may be influenced by outside factors, there is not always a direct correlation
           between outcome and successful completion of task-associated actions within the
           specified time parameter(s). Exceeding one of these times may not indicate a serious
           deficiency based on judgment and assessment of the specific scenario. Non-
           asterisked performance standards are guidelines to aid unit commanders in
           determining corrective actions.
           6.3.2.1.4. When more than one Level A time standard is running simultaneously,
           time them concurrently only if specifically written for concurrent timing, otherwise,
           time separately and sequentially.
       6.3.2.2. Level B - Tasks deemed integral to the performance of other tasks and required
       to sustain acceptable weapon system operation and mission execution.
           6.3.2.2.1. Operators must accomplish Level B tasks properly without taking any
           intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events,
           adversely affect task performance or outcome.
AFGSCI13-5302V1 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                19


       6.3.2.3. Level C - Rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system operations that
       by themselves have little or no impact on mission execution.
          6.3.2.3.1. Level C tasks apply where no specific time standard is identified. The
          standard is to accomplish the task proficiently in accordance with technical orders and
          governing directives.
   6.3.3. Outside agency responses will not be used to satisfy accomplishment of TEPS. If the
   MCCC-A has the technical data to satisfy their required tasks, the outside agency will not
   provide that data.
   6.3.4. TEPS/ETEPS do not describe the only correct response and do not replace operational
   technical data or instructions. They are intended for a controlled scenario environment and
   are used to improve proficiency.
   6.3.5. Training scenarios may violate TEPS constraints in order to enrich the MCCC-A’s
   proficiency, but should be realistic.
       6.3.5.1. Crew Enrichment Training (CET) scenarios must be clearly identified in training
       materials.
6.4. Status Presentation. Crew members must receive proper configuration and status for
operational realism.
   6.4.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS will adhere to status presentation requirements and
   configuration actions for fire/overheat conditions and Nuclear Event (NE) Restart indications
   as provided by 20 AF.
   6.4.2. Status cards and briefings will be standardized and presented in accordance with 20
   AF direction.
6.5. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the instructors to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of the APT session.
   6.5.1. Instructors will conduct a pre-brief to set the environment of the training and to ensure
   the trainee clearly understands expectations, responsibilities, limitations and other rules of
   engagement before being administered training scenarios.
   6.5.2. Safety and operational requirements take priority over simulated activities
       6.5.2.1. Instructors will intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to equipment.
       Additionally, for training conducted in the operational environment, instructors will
       intervene to prevent mission failure or degradation.
   6.5.3. Instructors may use briefings as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario
   presentation in accordance with the script and to emphasize concepts presented in the lesson
   plan.
   6.5.4. Instructors will not lead or prompt trainees into taking a correct action. To ensure
   effective use of training resources and prevent improper procedures from being reinforced,
   they may step in to redirect trainees once they are satisfied the crew is accomplishing
   incorrect actions or failing to accomplish required actions.
       6.5.4.1. Provide training to correct deficiencies and reinforce the proper actions for task
       accomplishment as soon as practical after a trainee takes an incorrect action.

6.6. Scenario Termination. Once a training session is started, all efforts will be made to
complete the session.
   6.6.1. Situations may arise in which early termination would be required. Training scenarios
   terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally stopped, or it may
   be completely re-accomplished.
6.7. Outbriefing the Trainee. The outbrief provides feedback to the trainee and the training
program.
   6.7.1. The outbrief will include discussion of positive performance, strengths and crew
   goals, any noted deficiencies, probable causes, areas for improvement and direct or indirect
   impacts to the mission, personnel, and other organizations.

                              TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

8.1. Training Documentation. Upon completion of each training session, instructors will
document the training administered to provide a means to track individual performance or
progression and to contribute to internal and external feedback on training program
effectiveness.
   8.1.1. Document all training and deficiencies on electronic or paper forms developed or
   approved by 20 AF.
   8.1.2. The 625 STOS/ALCS must retain documentation of monthly weapon system, codes,
   EWO, APT, recurring nuclear surety training and JPR coverage for every individual crew
   member.
       8.1.2.1. The 625 STOS/ALCS is only required to maintain the dates training was
       accomplished for those training sessions administered by USSTRATCOM personnel.
       8.1.2.2. All training documentation will be retained for the previous calendar year, and
       up to the current month of the current year, or until the individual no longer performs the
       unique duties.
8.2. Documenting Deficiencies. Documenting identified deficiencies provides a means to
identify trends, track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s
supervisor and serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
   8.2.1. When the trainee causes a script deviation and an incorrect action results, the
   instructor will document deficiencies against the JPR to which the deficiency should be
   attributed.
       8.2.1.1. If a crew member recognizes a status change but fails to perform a required JPR,
       document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed.
       8.2.1.2. If a crew member recognizes a status change but performs the wrong JPR,
       document the deviation against the JPR that should have been performed. However, give
       JPR credit for the task or subtask that was performed.
       8.2.1.3. If a crew member does not recognize a status change and a resulting task or
       subtask requirement, document the deviation against the required JPR.
       8.2.1.4. When the JPR being performed directs transition to another task or subtask, and
       the trainee fails to perform the subsequent task or subtask or fails to identify the
       requirement to transition, document the deviation against the JPR that directed the
       transition.
       8.2.1.5. If a crew member performs an unnecessary action which causes or results in a
       deviation, document the deviation against the JPR being performed when the unnecessary
       action was taken.
       8.2.1.6. Error descriptions on the training report will be unclassified.         The 625
       STOS/ALCS will maintain a separate log for classified error descriptions.

   8.2.2. Use Attachment 6 (Deficiency Codes) to describe the root cause of a trainee’s
   deficiency.
   8.2.3. Instructors will forward script discrepancies to the script OPR.
8.3. Training Reports. A standardized training report will be used for monthly recurring or
qualification APT training sessions for each individual to document details of the administered
training.
   8.3.1. A crewmember will receive credit for a JPR by performing any portion of a task,
   regardless if a checklist is used or if all actions are contained within another checklist.
       8.3.1.1. The instructor awarding JPR credit is documenting the crew has been adequately
       trained on the task.
       8.3.1.2. A01A, A01B, A01C, A01D, A02A, A02B, B01L, E09D, E09E, E09F, G02A,
       G03B and G04A are inherently accomplished in every APT training session.
8.4. Individual Qualification Folder (IQF). The 625 STOS/ALCS will maintain individual
training and evaluation documentation in an IQF for all AMR certified personnel. Electronic
formatted IQFs are authorized provided proper security measures, backup capability, and
sustainment plans are in place.
   8.4.1. Although use of the AFGSC Form 92 is preferred, the 625 STOS is authorized to use
   the AFGSC Form 91/91A. The 625 STOS/ALCS will use these forms to document the
   individual’s entire history while assigned to an AMR duty position.
       8.4.1.1. If the AFGSC Form 91 is used, the AFGSC Form 91A is required. The 625
       STOS/ALCS will use this form to record all required certification and decertification
       signatures. The AFGSC Form 91A will relate signatures back to entries on the AFGSC
       Form 91.
       8.4.1.2. Software applications capturing the same information obtained by the AFGSC
       Form 92 or AFGSC Form 91/91A are authorized provided the unit gains AFGSC/A3T
       approval prior to use. Reference AFI 33-360 for guidance on gaining approval.
       8.4.1.3. If electronic forms are used, the 625 STOS/ALCS will develop a plan to ensure
       adequate security procedures are in place to prevent tampering by unauthorized personnel
       and to document timely back-up and recovery procedures. Regardless of format
       (hardcopy/electronic), the unit is ultimately responsible for the information contained on
       these forms.
   8.4.2. As a minimum, the following information will be documented on the AFGSC Form
   92 or AFGSC Form 91/91A:
       8.4.2.1. Arrival and Departure from unit.
       8.4.2.2. Completion of IQT.
       8.4.2.3. Certification(s) and decertification(s) will be annotated. The 625 STOS/ALCS
       will ensure a reason for decertification is included and all decertification paperwork is
       maintained in the IQF.
          8.4.2.3.1. Required certifications include AMR, EWO, Codes, PRP, instructor and
          evaluator certifications.

                     JOB PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT LIST

A2.1. Comprising the JPRL.
   A2.1.1. The JPR column contains the alphanumeric designation for each JPR.
      A2.1.1.1. Area – A grouping of tasks that support the accomplishment of a single
      mission or multiple mission components.
      A2.1.1.2. Task – An observable/measurable unit of work that independently forms a
      significant part of a duty and is selected to reflect mission needs.
      A2.1.1.3. Subtasks – A subordinate unit of work derived from a task. Subtasks
      generally, but not always, focus on capabilities or reporting requirements that are utilized
      to accomplish a task.
   A2.1.2. The Description column contains the task nomenclature.
   A2.1.3. The Exposure heading is supported by four columns indicating different methods of
   JPR exposure.
      A2.1.3.1. The Proficiency (PROF) column indicates the proficiency level that JPRs are
      to be trained and evaluated. Reference Attachment 7 for detailed explanations of
      proficiency codes.
      A2.1.3.2. The TEPS column indicates the task TEPS level that JPRs are to be trained and
      evaluated. Reference paragraph 6.3.2. for detailed explanations of the various
      TEPS/ETEPS levels.
      A2.1.3.3. The Training (TRNG) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies the
      environment(s) where that JPR is required to be trained.
          A2.1.3.3.1. If the exposure column is blank the task must be trained in the classroom
          and trained in the APT or aircraft.
          A2.1.3.3.2. Classroom Tasks. A ―C‖ indicates this JPR is only required to be trained
          in classroom. Classroom tasks are repetitive and may occur inherently in the APT in
          order to accomplish another JPR. Classroom training is adequate; however,
          additional training may be accomplished in the APT. There is no requirement to plan
          or track exposure of these JPRs outside the classroom environment.
          A2.1.3.3.3. Enrichment Task. An ―E‖ indicates a JPR that is not required to be
          trained. Enrichment tasks are used to enhance a crew member’s conceptual
          knowledge or situational awareness. Enrichment tasks may be trained in any
          environment. Exposure of these JPRs are not required to be planned or tracked.
          A2.1.3.3.4. Inactive Task. An ―I‖ indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will
          not be trained. HQ 20 AF/A3N will establish training requirements if an ―I‖ task
          becomes active.
      A2.1.3.4. The Evaluation (EVAL) column assigns a task type to a JPR which identifies
      the environment(s) where that JPR may be evaluated as well as the eligibility for that JPR
      to be evaluated.
AFGSCI13-5302V1 17 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             33


         A2.1.3.4.1. Required Evaluation Task. An ―R‖ indicates a task that is required to be
         evaluated in the APT or in the operational environment. Exposure of these JPRs are
         required to be planned and tracked.
         A2.1.3.4.2. Optional Evaluation Task. An ―O‖ indicates a task that is not required to
         be evaluated. Optional evaluation tasks may be scripted to facilitate scenario
         presentation or may occur inherently in order to accomplish another JPR. There is no
         requirement to plan or track exposure of these JPRs.
         A2.1.3.4.3. Inactive Task. An ―I‖ indicates a JPR that is inactive. Inactive tasks will
         not be evaluated. HQ 20 AF/A3N will establish evaluation requirements if an ―I‖
         task becomes active.
  A2.1.4. Additional training and evaluation guidance for JPRs.
     A2.1.4.1. A new task entered in the JPRL is not required to be evaluated before
     performing the task on alert. Following completion of initial task training, the task
     should be emphasized in evaluations during a 3-month period. This period will start
     based on the operational factors and resource constraints affecting each unit’s ability to
     execute the training necessary to achieve proficiency in the new task. The level of
     exposure should be great enough to provide a representative assessment of training
     effectiveness.
