                                           Chapter 1

                 SPACE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE

1.1. Introduction. AFSPC must maintain a safe, secure, and modern space capability to meet
warfighter and other national security mission needs. All levels of leadership and management
within AFSPC must strive to meet this basic requirement for all missions and resources under
their control. The primary purpose of maintenance is to ensure space systems are available and
able to support AFSPC mission requirements. For purposes of this instruction space systems are
defined as: satellites; ground stations; data links among spacecraft; mission or user terminals,
which may include initial reception, processing, and exploitation; range systems; and systems
directly supporting infrastructure, which may include space surveillance, battle management,
and/or command, control, communications and computers.
1.2. Maintenance Definition and Levels. Maintenance is defined as all actions required to
restore or maintain a system’s operational capacity. The AF-preferred maintenance concept per
AFI 21-129, Two Level Maintenance and Regional Repair of AF Weapon Systems and
Equipment, is two levels of maintenance; organizational and depot. Maintenance categories
include on-equipment and off-equipment.
   1.2.1. Organizational Level Maintenance. The primary focus of organizational level
   maintenance is maintaining operations through scheduled preventive actions and quick
   restoral of the system once a failure occurs. Organizational level maintenance activities shall
   include but not be limited to fault detection, isolation, and replacement of failed Line
   Replaceable Units (LRU), accomplishment of scheduled preventive maintenance actions,
   identification of system improvements and modifications, and configuration control of
   system baseline. Organizational maintenance includes on- and off-equipment maintenance
   tasks and both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Software maintenance at this level
   has the primary responsibility of file and database maintenance, installation of approved
   updates and configuration control of the software baseline. Organizational level maintenance
   will be conducted within the limits established in approved system and equipment
   maintenance technical data.
   1.2.2. Depot Level Maintenance. Depot level maintenance includes both scheduled and
   unscheduled events on both on-and off-equipment hardware and software activities requiring
   specialized equipment, skills, and if needed, special facilities that are not available at the
   organizational level. Depot level maintenance can include both scheduled and unscheduled
   maintenance events.
       1.2.2.1. Depot level software maintenance refers to actions used to maintain current
       weapon system software capabilities by correcting, preventing or adapting software to
       correct anomalies.
           1.2.2.1.1. Corrective maintenance which successfully repairs faults discovered in the
           software.
           1.2.2.1.2. Preventive maintenance which detects and corrects latent faults in the
           software.
 6                                                             AFSPCI21-108 18 AUGUST 2014


            1.2.2.1.3. Adaptive maintenance which incorporates enhancements made necessary
            by modifications in the software or hardware (operational) environment of the
            program. As an example this would include a hardware change which facilitates need
            for software update.
     1.2.3. On-Equipment Maintenance. On-equipment maintenance tasks are those maintenance
     tasks that are, or that can effectively be, performed on or at the system level. Maintenance is
     performed while the equipment remains in the equipment racks or operational configuration.
     1.2.4. Off-Equipment Maintenance.          Off-equipment maintenance tasks are those
     maintenance tasks that are not, or cannot be, effectively accomplished on or at the system or
     end-item level of equipment and require removal for repair.
1.3. Organization. Space wings will organize according to AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization, or as authorized by HQ USAF/A1M. Contractor and civil service maintenance
functions are not required to organize IAW AFI 38-101, but will implement the organization as
outlined in their contract as accepted by the government. (T-2).
     1.3.1. Contract Maintenance Management. Space systems employ a mix of AF, non-
     Department of Defense (DOD) government agencies and contracted agencies to support
     maintenance and operations activities. To ensure proper mission conduct and contractor
     compliance, Air Force (AF) personnel should understand Government rights and
     responsibilities embodied in contracts and their provisions. A general understanding of the
     contract between the AF and the contractor is of particular importance for commanders and
     mission personnel. Organization Commanders owning maintenance activities are responsible
     for ensuring maintenance management actions and activities comply with DOD, AF and
     AFSPC instructions and directives regardless if maintenance is performed by military,
     civilian or contractor.
        1.3.1.1. AFSPC organizations utilizing contract maintenance, including OCONUS
        locations, will ensure the quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) is developed IAW
        AFI 63-138, Acquisition of Services. The QASP shall include performance metrics to
        enable accurate assessment of contractor performance.             Contracting Officer’s
        Representative (COR) should have sufficient knowledge and experience necessary to
        provide technical oversight of contractor performance. (T-2).
1.4. Equipment Status Reporting (ESR) and Maintenance Data Documentation
(MDD). The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for ensuring that maintenance planning
sufficiently addresses how ESR and MDD will be accomplished including compliance with all
applicable DOD, AF, and AFSPC instructions. PMs managing systems with classified
maintenance data will present MDD solutions to AFSPC A4/7 for approval prior to initiating
development of program unique Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) and/or MDD
processes. (T-2).
     1.4.1. Accurate ESR and MDD are critical for situational awareness of mission capability
     and ability to accurately identify negative trends and issues as part of Reliability &
     Maintainability (R&M) metrics analysis. The Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
     is the AF standard maintenance data collection (MDC) system and is mandatory for use for
     AFSPC systems/equipment. Maintenance organizations will accomplish MDD IAW
     Technical Order (TO) 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation, and ESR IAW AFI 21-
AFSPCI21-108 18 AUGUST 2014                                                                    7


   103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. Requested deviations or
   waivers to IMDS shall be submitted to HQ AFSPC/A4S and should include sufficient
   justification and explanation of why the deviation or waiver is required. An approved waiver
   for IMDS does not cover the maintenance documentation processes contained in TO 00-20-2;
   a separate waiver request must be submitted for this purpose. Requested waivers to MDD
   requirements within TO 00-20-2 shall be submitted through HQ AFSPC/A4S and will only
   be approved under exceptional circumstances. (T-2).
   1.4.2. Do not input classified data into the IMDS. Data within IMDS is classified as
   “FOUO”. Programs with classified maintenance data are still required to submit an IMDS
   deviation or waiver request to formally document and approve the exemption due to security
   classification reasons. Programs with classified maintenance data are not exempt from the
   MDD procedures contained in TO 00-20-2.
1.5. Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Metrics Analysis. Maintaining
high readiness levels is dependent on having a robust RAM program enabling the ability to
identify system deficiencies and negative trends before they impact operational capability. Both
HQ AFSPC and system program offices are responsible for accomplishing RAM metrics
analysis for assigned systems/programs. In addition to internal periodic reviews, RAM metrics
shall be included as part of the following meetings/conferences:
   1.5.1. Product Improvement Working Group (PIWG). AFI 21-118, Improving Air and
   Space Equipment Reliability and Maintainability, outlines the requirements for conducting a
   PIWG. The PIWG is designed to bring all organizations responsible for product support
   together to address R&M issues beyond the scope of field organizations to resolve and
   require a coordinated approach between multiple organizations. After any Interim Contractor
   Support (ICS) periods, space programs will conduct a PIWG at least annually unless a waiver
   is granted by the MAJCOM co-chair. PIWG co-chairs will be HQ AFSPC/A4S (or delegated
   official) and the system PM (or delegated official). (T-2).
       1.5.1.1. As a minimum, the PIWG agenda should include the following items: (T-2).
           1.5.1.1.1. Old action items (deficiencies).
           1.5.1.1.2. New agenda items (deficiencies).
           1.5.1.1.3. Current modifications.
           1.5.1.1.4. Sustainment (RAM) metrics.
           1.5.1.1.5. Bad actor review (review of supply assets with chronic failure rates).
           1.5.1.1.6. Software releases.
           1.5.1.1.7. Sustaining engineering efforts.
           1.5.1.1.8. Sustainment issues and ranking.
           1.5.1.1.9. Scheduling of next PIWG (location/date).
           1.5.1.1.10. Other items as requested by the PIWG co-chairs.
1.6. Skip-echelon. Maintenance functions will make maximum use of skip-echelon processes.
Under the skip-echelon concept maintenance management functions are consolidated at the
MAJCOM. Wing maintenance activities shall communicate directly with MAJCOM elements
 8                                                             AFSPCI21-108 18 AUGUST 2014


via Chief of Maintenance (COM) or designee for assistance with maintenance and sustainment
issues.    MAJCOM organizations shall communicate directly with wing maintenance

Terms
Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE)—Ground processing end items that are required to
make a space system operational, not designated as Special Tooling or other production tooling
defined as being allocated to an airborne configuration item, and not designated as Real Property
Installed Equipment.
Annual—When used as a requirement, the term “annual” refers to a 12-month interval.
Approval—Approval signifies AFSPC approval/acceptance/coordination                IAW     AFSPC
instructions and Memorandum of Agreements.
Combatant Command (COCOM)—Nontransferable authority established by Title 10, United
States Code, Section 164, exercised only by commanders of unified or specified combatant
commands. COCOM (command authority) is the authority of a Combatant Commander to
perform those functions of command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing
commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction
over all aspects of military operations, joint training, and logistics necessary to accomplish the
missions assigned to the command.
Contract Administration/Surveillance—Active surveillance of contractor performance to
ensure compliance with various contract or statement of work requirements. Examples include
safety, quality assurance, security, property management, and base support. Surveillance tasks
may be performed by the contracting office or delegated to another Government office, which
has resident expertise and/or is co-located with contractor operations.
Contract Management—Active management of the contract and/or contractor by the
contracting officer for the purpose of ensuring satisfactory delivery of end items meeting USAF
requirements. This includes such activities as contract negotiation and business clearance, as
delegated by SMC or AFLCMC.
Direct Support—Provide a comprehensive, structured, support process to bring workable
systems to the customers. Maximize support of HQ functions to promote operational and
administrative effectiveness.
Discrepancy—An unexpected or unplanned condition that does not meet system performance
parameters but which can be corrected by organizational maintenance resources in accordance
with validated procedures at the organizational level.
Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V)—An independent technical review
performed by an organization that is technically, managerially, and financially independent of
the development organization.
Insight—The Government gaining an understanding of the contractor’s progress to meet their
contract’s requirements through watchful observation.
Mission Assurance—Accomplished through the contractor’s demonstration of their production,
operation, maintenance, and problem resolution processes with Government personnel
performing surveillance to ensure these processes result in an acceptable level of mission risk to
the government.

Maintenance—all actions required to retain an item in, or restore it to, a specified condition.
This includes diagnosis, repair and inspection.
Maintenance Functions—Transportation, assembly, checkout, preparation, corrective
maintenance, and preventative maintenance inspections of space lift vehicles, payloads, space
launch complexes, support equipment (SE), command and control equipment, tracking and
communications complexes; and real property (RP) that support launch, surveillance, warning
and on-orbit activities.
Maintenance Surveillance—Observations, risk analysis and activities conducted by
maintenance personnel to include Contract Surveillance, which are used to ensure/determine if
space systems system assets are reliable and ready for operation by ensuring adherence to
technical procedures, general maintenance practices, safety requirements, security guidelines,
environmental compliance, efficient utilization of resources, and resource safety to include
directing an immediate halt to actions detrimental to personnel or equipment.
Mission Support (MS)—MS personnel (e.g., communications, intelligence, safety personnel)
who provide critical mission support, designated by the organization commander, will be
certified in their unique duty requirements. In these cases, the organization commander will
determine certification requirements. At a minimum, the certification requirements must include:
an annual training plan identifying applicable job requirements, recurring training requirements,
procedures for placement on/removal from restricted status, and procedures for
decertification/recertification. The organization commander or next senior commander or deputy
in the operational chain of command certifies the individual.
Observation—Direct Government observation of the execution and recording (if applicable) of
a test procedure or task. An “Observed” test procedure or task is one in which all steps (or
certain pre-defined steps) have been completed, all anomalies have been noted (with appropriate
documentation generated), and all applicable data captured while being observed by a
Government representative. Observed test procedures or tasks are typically those that must be
accomplished correctly, cannot be easily verified by data review or post-test, and include a high
risk of inducing collateral damage that could remain undetected.
Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&E)/Mission Assurance—Process
for establishing and preserving the safety, suitability, and effectiveness of Air Force systems and
end-items over the entire operational life by preserving technical integrity via prudent use of
disciplined engineering practices, assurance of proper operations and maintenance, effective
supply systems, and field utilization and maintenance trends feedback to systems program
offices.
Oversight—Maintaining watchful care or supervision over projects, processes, information,
systems, and/or services.
Performance Plan (PP)—Wing service contracts subject to delegations/support requests operate
under PPs. This plan describes how contractor performance will be measured and assessed
against performance standards. The PP should also outline the acceptance process and state how
acceptance of services will occur and describe how performance results will be captured and
documented so that the data gathered can later serve as past performance information.
Public Safety—Safety involving risks to the general public of the United States or foreign
countries and/ or their property.
AFSPCI21-108 18 AUGUST 2014                                                                 43


Real Property (RP)—Land, buildings, structures, utilities, improvements and appurtenances
thereto. Includes equipment attached to, and made part of, buildings and structures but not
movable equipment. Primarily consisting of facilities and other non-equipment support system
infrastructure.
Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE)—Government-owned or leased support
equipment, apparatus and fixtures that are essential to the function of the real property and
permanently attached to, integrated into or on Government-owned or leased property.
Resource Safety/Protection—The protection of Air Force facilities, support equipment, or other
property from damage due to mishaps.
System Program Manager—In accordance with DoDD 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition
System, the SPM is the Air Force designated individual with responsibility for and authority to
accomplish system objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s
operational needs.
System Sustainment Manager—The individual with functional responsibility for the
sustainment portion of a system’s life cycle in support of a SPM.
Support Equipment (SE)—All equipment (i.e., Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), RPIE,
etc.) required to make or keep a space or space related system, subsystem or item of support
equipment operational in its intended environment.
Verify—To review, inspect, test, check, measure, audit or otherwise confirm that products,
processes, or documents conform to specified requirements. Verification may be performed after
work completion, e.g., safety wiring.
