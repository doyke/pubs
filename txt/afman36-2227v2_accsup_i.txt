                                           Chapter 1

           M60 OR M240B MEDIUM MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

1.1. M60 or M240B Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Courses (AFQC). These courses
provide Air Force members with the minimum training, evaluations and the Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (TTPs) required to ensure the gunners ability to tactically employ either the M60
or M240B Machine Guns. If Crew Served Machine Gunner training is required at their next duty
station, personnel qualified to the Individual Machine Gunner standard during the Security
Forces Apprentice Course only need to complete the training (classroom and live-fire) to meet
the Crew-Served Machine Gunner standard (this training would not extend the qualification
expiration date).
   1.1.1. Individual Machine Gunner. A machine gunner qualified to tactically employ the M60
   or M240B in the bipod mode (from 300 to 800 meters), when vehicle mounted and has met
   the training requirements mandated within this AFMAN.
   1.1.1. (ACC) Personnel assigned to ACC EOD, Prime BEEF, and RED HORSE Unit Line
   Numbers with associated line remarks requiring machine gun qualification to fill Unit Type
   Code taskings will qualify to the individual machine gunner standards. As a minimum they
   will fire Phases 1 and 2. Phase 5 will be conducted if full distance ranges capable of firing
   from a static vehicle are available.
   1.1.2. Crew-Served Machine Gunner. A machine gunner qualified to tactically employ the
   M60 or M240B in all modes with the aid of an assistant gunner and has met the training
   requirements mandated within this AFMAN. Assistant machine gunners must complete the
   same training program and meet the same qualification standards as primary machine
   gunners. All Security Forces personnel trained on the M60 or M240B will be trained to the
   Crew Served Machine Gunner standard. Personnel trained for the purpose of mobility should
   be trained to the Crew Served Machine Gunner Standard.
1.2. Training Overview:
1.2. (ACC)Initial and recurring qualification with the M240 should be conducted using full
distance training. 10 meter qualifications will only be used when filling short notice, 30 days or
less, deployment/contingency requirements or when full distance ranges are more than a two
hour drive away (one way.)
   1.2.1. Initial Machine Gunner Qualification. This is the trainee’s first participation in the
   M60 or M240B Individual Qualification Training Program. Initial training consists of
   classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation phases of AFQC, and passing
   the performance tests. Since full distance (AFQC/FD) training is desired, the use of 10-meter
   initial qualification should only be used as a last resort. However, MAJCOM Functionals
   may grant individual bases permission to qualify personnel using Figure 1.2 as an initial 10-
   meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range facilities cannot be used. The
   installation commander may grant permission to qualify personnel using Figure 1.2 as an
   initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) for personnel attending technical training courses at
   Lackland AFB when full distance ranges cannot be used. The AF Form 522, USAF Ground
   Weapons Training Data, will reflect a 12-month qualification.

     1.2.2. Live-fire Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial
     qualification. It consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation
     phases of the AFQC (Full Distance or 10-Meter) and passing the performance evaluations.
     Since full distance (AFQC/FD) training is desired, the use of 10-meter recurring
     qualification should only be used as a last resort. However, MAJCOM Functionals may
     grant individual bases permission to qualify personnel using Figure 1.2 as a recurring
     10-meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range facilities cannot be used. This
     evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis for all machine gunners. Non Security Forces
     personnel moving from individual to crew served status must meet all the requirements as
     mandated in this AFMAN. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
     1.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
     causing an individual to fail an evaluation.
     1.2.4. Performance Evaluation. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, require
     weapon operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial and recurring
     training for individual and crew-served personnel.
1.3. Instructor Guidelines.
     1.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training techniques
     requiring physical handling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance
     evaluations and assist trainees during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-
     2226, The Combat Arms Program, for student to instructor ratios.
     1.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and
     procedures during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point
     instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To
     ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range safety
     instructor and all point instructors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
     1.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and
     has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training
     sessions. This individual may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not
     on the range. NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The
     Range Safety Instructor may not simultaneously serve as a firing point instructor or complete
     live-fire, unless relieved of Range Safety Instructor Duties. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
1.4. M60 or M240B Machine Guns Qualification: Plan of Instruction. The plan in Table 1.1
is intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and
recurring qualification training. Remedial training is in-depth, concentrating on known problems.
Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives.
NOTE: Training times will vary depending on class size, trainee experience level, range
location, etc. Regional training centers/technical training centers with large student loads may
encounter increased training times exceeding the times in Table 1.1 and may need to increase
training times accordingly.

1.10. Course Information, AFQC/FD:
20                                         AFMAN36-2227V2_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012


  1.10.1. Targets for the Course. Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums,
  salvaged vehicles or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.
  1.10.2. Standards:
     1.10.2.1. The entire course of fire is based on the students ability to fire a 6 to 9-round
     burst during training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of
     the machine gun. In an actual real-world scenario, the shooter would continue to fire
     (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated.
     1.10.2.1. (ACC) All orders of fire will start from the half-load configuration.
     1.10.2.2. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move
     to the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the
     gunner and finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough
     to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.
     Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T
     & E adjustments at the same time. This technique is used for training and simulates no
     known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically engage the portion of the
     target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
     1.10.2.3. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of
     targets, any remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back
     into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct
     number of rounds fired by the student.
     1.10.2.4. Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire.
     1.10.2.5. On all evaluation phases, if the beaten zone covers the target, it is considered a
     hit.
  1.10.3. Course Notes:
     1.10.3.1. Instructors are to teach trainees as needed during the practice phase/orders.
     During evaluation phases, instructors will help trainees between orders of fire, as needed,
     correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate action procedures.
     1.10.3.2. Assistant gunners will not be used for Phases I, II or V. On those courses where
     an assistant gunner is used, assistant gunners will give all fire corrections to the gunners
     (with the exception of zero). Ensure trainees are equipped with the appropriate tripod,
     T&E mechanism and spare barrel kit. Gun crews will wear a helmet, flak vest, nomex
     gloves and hearing protection during all firing orders. Both the gunner and assistant
     gunner must have the protective mask and gloves on their person during the entire course.
     1.10.3.3. Sight corrections may be made at any time throughout the course.
     1.10.3.4. All orders in Phases I and II are fired in the bipod mode.
     1.10.3.5. On all orders, gunners will engage targets as a single gun covering the entire
     target.
     1.10.3.6. After completing Phase I, Order 4 and Phase II, Order 2, the firing point
     instructor will give the command ―Gas, Gas, Gas‖ and the gun crew will immediately put
AFMAN36-2227V2_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                          21


     the gun on safe and don the protective mask and gloves. Gunner will then engage the area
     target.
     1.10.3.7. Phase V is optional to fill mission training needs for units using or UTCs using
     vehicle mounted weapons. Implementation of this phase is at the discretion of
     MAJCOMs. In Phase V, gunners should use one area target at 300 meters with at least
     four double "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon drums. Position the vehicle parallel to the firing
     line with the weapon pointed down range (perpendicular to the vehicle). When
     conducting moving vehicle firing, the vehicle should move parallel to the firing line at a
     speed of 3 to 5 miles per hour (mph).
     1.10.3.8. Should gunners fail to achieve a qualified score on any order, they are
     unqualified. However, if refired within 30 days, gunners need only refire and qualify on
     those orders failed. Beyond 30 days, gunner must refire entire course.
     1.10.3.9. AF Form 522 need only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the entire
     course. However, instructors must annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form 522)
     any order the student fails and does not requalify during the class to ensure only the failed

1.11. Course Information: AFQC/10M:
   1.11.1. Targets for the Course. Use the 10-meter machine gun target for Phases I-IV (NSN
   6920-00-078-5123). Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums, salvaged vehicles
   or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets for Phase V (see
   paragraph 1.11.4.8 for Phase V course notes).
   1.11.2. Half-Loading: Half loading, unloading from a half-load and clearing from a half
   load is only authorized per the operator’s manual. Weapons not authorized the use of a
   half load will perform all loading operations using the full load procedures.
   1.11.2. (ACC) Within ACC, the use of the half-load is required for daily garrison posting.
   The weapon will not be full-loaded unless the use of deadly force is warranted.
   1.11.3. Standards
      1.11.3.1. The entire course of fire is based on the students ability to fire a 6 to 9-round
      burst during training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of
      the machine gun. In an actual real-world scenario, the shooter would continue to fire
      (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated.
      1.11.3.1. (ACC) All orders of fire will start from the half-load configuration.
      1.11.3.2. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move
      to the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the
      gunner and finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough
      to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.
      Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T
      & E adjustments at the same time. This technique is used for training and simulates no
      known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically engage the portion of the
      target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
      1.11.3.3. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of
      targets, any remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back
      into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct
      number of rounds fired by the student.
      1.11.3.4. Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire.
   1.11.4. Course Notes:
      1.11.4.1. Instructors are to teach trainees as needed during the practice phase/orders.
      During evaluation phases, instructors will help trainees between orders of fire, as needed,
      correct safety infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate action procedures.
      1.11.4.2. Assistant gunners will not be used on Phases I, II or V but are mandatory for
      Phases III and IV. The gunner must wear a helmet, flak vest and hearing protection
      during all firing orders. The gunner must also have the protective mask and gloves on his
      or her person during the entire course.
      1.11.4.3. Sight corrections and T&E adjustments (Phases III and IV) may be made at any
      time throughout the course.
      1.11.4.4. All orders in Phases I and II are fired in the bipod mode.
AFMAN36-2227V2_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                              25


       1.11.4.5. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move
       to the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the
       gunner and finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough
       to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.
       Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T
       & E adjustments at the same time. This technique is used for training and simulates no
       known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically engage the portion of the
       target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
       1.11.4.6. After completing Phase I, Order 4 and Phase II, Order 2, the firing point
       instructor will give the command ―Gas, Gas, Gas‖ and the gun crew will immediately put
       the gun on safe, don the protective mask and gloves and then engage the next target.
       1.11.4.7. Phase V is optional to fill mission training needs for units using or UTCs with
       vehicle mounted weapons. Implementation of this phase is at the discretion of
       MAJCOMs.
       1.11.4.8. If required, conduct Phase V vehicle firing using blank ammunition and the
       Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) equipped weapons and targets.
       Use one area target at 300 meters, with at least four double "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon
       drums. Hang MILES harnesses over the targets or drums. Position the vehicle parallel to
       the firing line with the weapon pointing down range (perpendicular to the vehicle). An
       instructor must be available with a MILES reset key and radio. The instructor indicates
       target hits and resets MILES harnesses for each gunner. When conducting moving
       vehicle firing, the vehicle should move parallel to the firing line at a speed of 3 to 5 mph.
       1.11.4.9. Should gunners fail to achieve a qualified score on any order, they are
       unqualified. However, if refired within 30 days, gunners need only to refire and qualify
       on those orders failed. Beyond 30 days, gunner must refire entire course.
       1.11.4.10. AF Form 522 need only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the
       entire course. However, instructors must annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form
       522) any order the student fails and does not requalify during the class to ensure only the
       failed order is refired IAW paragraph 1.11.4.9 above. A numerical score is not required in
       the score block of AF Forms 522 or 710.

pressure down and to the rear with both hands (pull the gun down and tightly into the shoulder).
Rest cheek lightly against the stock and left hand with shoulders level and elbows an equal
distance apart below the receiver of the gun. Recommend sandbagging the bipod legs. NOTE:
Left-handed firing is unauthorized during peacetime training because of the cartridge ejection
pattern and location of cover latch.

with the right hand. With the left-hand palm down, grasp the elevating handwheel. Maintain a
firm downward and rearward pressure with both hands. Rest the cheek (optional) lightly against
the cover. Keep elbows inside the tripod legs, but not touching the tripod. Place right shoulder
lightly against the stock but do not apply pressure as this could move the gun out of alignment.
Recommend sandbagging the tripod legs. NOTE: Left-handed firing is unauthorized during
peacetime training because of the cartridge ejection pattern (location of cover latch) and all T&E
adjustments are made with the left hand.

                     MK-19 MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. MK-19 Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC). This course provides
the minimum training, evaluation and the TTPs required to ensure the gunners ability to
tactically employ the MK-19. Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training
program and meet the same qualification standards as primary machine gunners.
2.2. Training Overview:
   2.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee’s first participation in the MK-19 Qualification
   Training Program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the
   required evaluation phases of the AFQC (Figure 2.1) and passing the performance
   evaluations. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
   2.2.2. Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial
   qualification. It consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation
   phases of the AFQC (Figure 2.1) and passing the performance evaluations. Evaluation is
   mandatory on an annual basis. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
   2.2.3. Mechanical Recurring Training -- 6-Month. This is weapon operator skill re-
   certification training. This training consists of classroom instruction and passing all the
   performance evaluations. This evaluation is mandatory during the 6th month after initial
   or recurring training and should not be accomplished prior to the 6 th month (Individual
   Unit Commanders may authorize early mechanical training to meet AEF
   requirements). Personnel who do not complete mechanical training during the 6th month
   after live-fire qualification are unqualified until they complete the 6th month mechanical
   training. Once training is complete, the original 12-month qualification expiration date will
   be reinstated. Students will be given the performance tests and those who fail the
   performance tests will be given remedial instruction and retested.
   2.2.3. (ACC) The requirement for six month mechanical training was changed with the
   release of AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, dated 24 February 2009. MK-19 gunners
   must now complete mechanical training five to seven months after live-fire training.
   Gunners are considered unqualified on the first day of the eighth month if mechanical
   training is not accomplished, however personnel who complete mechanical training any time
   between the eighth month and before the annual qualification expiration date will once again
   be considered qualified until the annual expiration date.
   2.2.4. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation.
   2.2.5. Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of
   weapon operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial, 12-month
   recurring and 6-month mechanical recurring training.
   2.2.6. Unit Training. To help maintain the gunner’s proficiency, units should provide
   refresher training on operator skills and knowledge. Units should conduct this training before
   exercises and deployments.

2.3. Instructor Guidelines:
   2.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and
   assist trainees during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226 for student
   to instructor ratios.
   2.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and
   procedures needed during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing
   point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing
   point. To ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range
   safety instructor and all point instructors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   2.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and
   has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training
   sessions. The instructor may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on
   the range. NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range
   Safety Instructor may not simultaneously serve as a firing point instructor or live-fire, unless
   relieved of Range Safety Instructor duties. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
2.4. MK-19 Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is
intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and
recurring training. Remedial training is in-depth, concentrating on known problems. Trainees
must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives. NOTE:
Training times will vary depending on class size, trainee experience level, range location, etc.
Approximate training times for this program are:
   2.4.1. Initial training -- 30 hours.
   2.4.2. Recurring training (12 months) -- 22 hours.
   2.4.3. Mechanical Recurring training (6 months) – as needed for the student to successfully
   complete the required performance tests.
   2.4.4. Remedial training -- as needed.
2.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and
maintain the capability to use the MK-19 against enemy targets and maintain the weapon to the
level authorized for the operator. With the exception of operator maintenance, trainees must
perform all evaluated tasks without assistance.
2.6. Training Objectives. The training objectives required for successful completion of this
program are listed in Table 2.1.
   2.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       2.6.1.1. Roles of the MK-19.
       2.6.1.2. Safety rules and procedures.
       2.6.1.3. Characteristics, nomenclature and general data.

2.9. Course Information, MK-19 AFQC.
   2.9.1. Targets for the Course:
      2.9.1.1. Zero Target. Use a 3 meters by 3 meters reinforced panel or target of comparable
      size, preferably of metal construction. Example: refuse dumpster, 55-gallon drums, armor
      plating, etc.
      2.9.1.2. Target #1, Single Vehicle. Use a medium-size vehicle, approximately 8 meters
      by 3 meters. Other material such as 55-gallon drums, large vehicle tires or aircraft tires,
      etc., may be used to simulate a single-vehicle size target.
      2.9.1.3. Target #2, Single Vehicle With Personnel. Use one vehicle-size target, 8 meters
      by 3 meters, and several (7 to 10) personnel size targets. Personnel targets will be
      approximately 2 meters high by 1 meter wide. Place personnel targets around the vehicle
      on the firing line side to define a 30-meter target area.
      2.9.1.4. Target #3, Line of Troops. Use several (15 to 20) personnel size targets (2
      meters by 1 meter). The size of the "Line of Troops" target area is 60 meters by 5 meters.
      Place targets in linear or semicircle configuration.
      2.9.1.5. Target #4, Vehicle Convoy. Use at least three large vehicle-size targets. The
      length of the "convoy" target area is 90 meters.
      2.9.1.6. Optional Moving Vehicle Phase Targets. This is a shoot on the move phase. A
      moving vehicle range may be superimposed on an existing range. If a separate area is
      used, construct targets according to the description of target 2 through target 5. Four
      targets are required with distances varying from 300 meters to 800 meters. Plainly mark
      the driving course where firing is permitted. For example, place traffic cones along the
      portion of the course where firing is permitted. The gunner will only fire upon the
      command of the instructor. The driver, assistant gunner (instructor) and the gunner are
      encouraged to work as a mobile fire team to identify targets, determine range and identify
      kills or misses. If the driving course is an improved and maintained driving surface,
      vehicle speed will not exceed 10 mph. If driving surface is unimproved and rough,
      vehicle speed will not exceed 5 mph. NOTE: Present range design and target
      configuration may vary from those described for this phase. Do not reconstruct or make
      major modifications solely for the purpose of this phase of fire if present range
      configuration meets the intent of this phase.
      2.9.1.6. (ACC) Units having ranges capable of firing from a moving vehicle will fire
      Phase IV. The range surface danger zone must be able to safely contain all fired rounds
      from all portions of the vehicle route.
   2.9.2. Standards:
      2.9.2.1. Phase II. All four targets should be effectively engaged within 8 minutes. This
      time includes reloading. All four targets should have at least two hits each.
          2.9.2.1.1. Target #1. Desired minimum of two hits within the 5-meter kill radius.
          2.9.2.1.2. Target #2. Desired minimum of two hits within the 5-meter kill radius.
          2.9.2.1.3. Target #3. Desired minimum of two hits within the 15-meter casualty
          radius.

         2.9.2.1.4. Target #4. Desired minimum of two hits within the 15-meter casualty
         radius.
     2.9.2.2. Evaluation Phase III. A minimum of one hit per target within the 15-meter
     casualty radius within 5 minutes. All four targets must have at least one hit each.
     2.9.2.3. Familiarization Phase IV. Desired minimum of one hit per target within the 15-
     meter casualty radius. All four targets should have at least one hit each.
  2.9.3. Course Notes:
     2.9.3.1. Phase I through IV of the AFQC will be completed for initial training conducted
     at Air Education and Training Command (AETC) formal courses. The AETC formal
     course will conduct moving vehicle training if the designated range facility can
     accommodate this phase of training.
     2.9.3.2. Implementation of moving vehicle training is at the discretion of the MAJCOM.
     2.9.3.2. (ACC) Units having ranges capable of firing from a moving vehicle will fire
     Phase IV. The range surface danger zone must be able to safely contain all fired rounds
     from all portions of the vehicle route.
     2.9.3.3. If evaluation Phase III or Phase IV are used, they become an integral part of
     qualification training and gunners must meet the standards of these phases to be qualified.
     2.9.3.4. Gunners must qualify on phase III. If the gunners fail to meet the minimum
     standards they are unqualified with the weapon. Instructors may immediately refire an
     individual on phase III if a gunner failed; however, if the gunner fails to qualify after
     remedial training, the gunner is unqualified and must be totally retrained to meet all
     standards of 12-month recurring training.
     2.9.3.5. Instructors will not teach or coach during actual firing of the evaluation phase;
     however, the guncrew should be encouraged to work as a team for maximum
     effectiveness during firing and instructors will provide assistance between orders of fire
     as needed. Instructors will correct safety infractions and supervise the application of
     immediate action procedures by the guncrew if they experience stoppages.
     2.9.3.6. All orders of fire will be fired using training practice ammunition.
     2.9.3.7. The suppression stop on the cradle mount will be adjusted to prevent rounds
     from impacting closer than 310 meters to the weapon.
     2.9.3.8. Trainees will wear flak vests and helmets while firing.
     2.9.3.9. Hearing and eye protection are mandatory for all personnel on the firing line.
     2.9.3.10. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of
     targets, any remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back
     into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct
     number of rounds fired by the student.

                       M2 MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

3.1. M2 Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC). This course provides the
minimum training, evaluation and the TTPs required to ensure the gunners ability to tactically
employ the M-2. Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training program and meet
the same qualification standards as primary machine gunners.
3.2. Training Overview:
3.2. (ACC)Units with properly equipped m-series vehicles and ranges capable of
conducting vehicle firing may use the course of fire shown in Figure 3. 1.1. for initial and
recurring training. This course of fire was approved by the AFSFC on 21 July 2009. The
recommended sequence of events for classroom training will mirror what is outlined in this
AFMAN.
   3.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee’s first participation in the M2 Training Program.
   Initial training consists of classroom instruction, passing the performance evaluations and
   qualification on the required phases of the AFQC (Figure 3.1). The AF Form 522 will reflect
   a 12-month qualification.
   3.2.2. Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial
   qualification. It consists of classroom instruction, passing the performance evaluations and
   qualification on the required phases of the AFQC (Figure 3.1). Evaluation is mandatory on
   an annual basis. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
   3.2.2. (ACC) The requirement for six month mechanical training was changed with the
   release of AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, dated 24 February 2009. M2 gunners must
   now complete mechanical training five to seven months after live-fire training. Gunners are
   considered unqualified on the first day of the eighth month if mechanical training is not
   accomplished, however personnel who complete mechanical training any time between the
   eighth month and before the annual qualification expiration date will once again be
   considered qualified until the annual expiration date.
   3.2.3. Mechanical Recurring Training -- 6-Month. This is weapon operator skill re-
   certification training. This training consists of classroom instruction and passing all the
   performance evaluations. This evaluation is mandatory during the 6th month after initial
   or recurring training and should not be accomplished prior to the 6 th month (Individual
   Unit Commanders may authorize early mechanical training to meet AEF
   requirements). Personnel who do not complete mechanical training during the 6th month
   after live-fire qualification are unqualified until they complete the 6th month mechanical
   training. Once training is complete, the original 12-month qualification expiration date will
   be reinstated. Students will be given the performance tests and those who fail the
   performance tests will be given remedial instruction and retested.
   3.2.3. (ACC) The requirement for six month mechanical training was changed with the
   release of AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, dated 24 February 2009. M-2 gunners must
   now complete mechanical training five to seven months after live-fire training. Gunners are
   considered unqualified on the first day of the eighth month if mechanical training is not

   accomplished, however personnel who complete mechanical training any time between the
   eighth month and before the annual qualification expiration date will once again be
   considered qualified until the annual expiration date.
   3.2.4. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies
   causing an individual to fail an evaluation.
   3.2.5. Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of
   weapon operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial, 12-month and 6-
   month recurring training.
   3.2.6. Unit Training. To help maintain guncrew proficiency, units should provide refresher
   training on operator skills and knowledge. Units should conduct this training before exercises
   and deployments.
3.3. Instructor Guidelines:
   3.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical
   handling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and
   assist trainees during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226 for student
   to instructor ratios.
   3.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and
   procedures as needed during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing
   point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing
   point. To ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range
   safety instructor and all point instructors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   3.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and
   has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training
   sessions. The instructor may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on
   the range. NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range
   Safety Instructor may not simultaneously serve as a firing point instructor or live-fire, unless
   relieved of Range Safety Instructor duties. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.
3.4. M2 Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is intended to
provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and recurring training.
Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives.
NOTE: Training times will vary depending on class size, trainee experience level, range
location, etc. Approximate training times for this program are:
   3.4.1. Initial training -- 40 hours.
   3.4.2. Recurring training (12-month) -- 32 hours.
   3.4.3. Mechanical Recurring training (6-month) -- as needed for the student to successfully
   complete the required performance tests.
   3.4.4. Remedial training -- as needed.
3.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and
maintain the capability to successfully use the M2 against enemy targets and maintain the
weapon to the level authorized for the operator. With the exception of operator maintenance,
trainees must perform all evaluated tasks without assistance.

3.9. Course Information, M2 AFQC.
   3.9.1. Course Targets:
      3.9.1.1. Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums, salvaged vehicles or
      mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.
      3.9.1.2. Point targets should consist of three separate vehicle type targets.
      3.9.1.3. Deep targets should consist of a minimum of five targets.
      3.9.1.4. Linear with depth targets should consist of at least eight double "E" silhouette
      targets or paired 55-gallon drums.
      3.9.1.5. Area targets should consist of at least five double "E" silhouette targets or paired
      55-gallon drums and arranged to form a group.
      3.9.1.6. On Phase V, designate four targets to be identified on the range cards.
      3.9.1.7. On Phase VI, conduct fire missions in random order of the targets designated on
      the range cards.
   3.9.2. Course Standards:
      3.9.2.1. On Phase II, Order 1, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit.
      Gunner must hit three targets.
      3.9.2.2. On Phase II, Order 2, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit.
      Gunner must hit 13 targets. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the
      gunner will move to the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest
      point from the gunner and finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets
      are large enough to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number
      of bursts. Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap while firing. Gunners will not fire
      and make T & E adjustments at the same time. This technique is used for training and
      simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically engage the
      portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
      3.9.2.3. On Phase IV, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner
      must have at least three bursts on target from a stationary position.
      3.9.2.4. On Phase VI, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner
      must hit four targets.
AFMAN36-2227V2_ACCSUP_I 2 AUGUST 2012                                                         55


  3.9.3. Course Notes:
     3.9.3.1. There are no time limits during practice phases. Instructors will observe setting
     headspace and timing, render help needed, observe rounds impacting in target areas,
     correct safety infractions and supervise trainees who perform immediate action.
     3.9.3.2. Assistant gunners will be used for all orders of fire. Instructors should emphasize
     the importance of teamwork. Except for zeroing, the assistant gunner will give fire
     corrections to the gunner. Gun crews will wear helmets, flak vests and hearing protection
     during all firing orders. Both gunner and assistant gunner must have protective masks and
     gloves on their person during the entire course.
     3.9.3.3. Whenever possible, gun crews should fire 4:1 ball and tracer mix. All firing
     should be three to five round bursts; however, if assistant gunner is unable to observe
     beaten zone, five to seven round burst may be necessary. During qualification, once the
     student has fired at the required number of targets, any remaining ammunition will be
     returned to the instructor for placement back into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the
     AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the student.
     3.9.3.4. Sight corrections and T&E adjustments may be made at any time throughout the
     course.
     3.9.3.5. All phases must be fired on a full-distance range.
     3.9.3.6. On orders requiring CWDE, the guncrews will don their protective masks and
     gloves before starting the firing orders.
     3.9.3.7. Linear and deep targets will be engaged as a single gun covering the entire
     target.
     3.9.3.8. On Phase III and Phase IV, the vehicle may be positioned parallel with or at a
     right angle to the firing line with the weapon pointed down range.
     3.9.3.9. Phase V and Phase VI are used to train and evaluate the guncrews" ability to
     prepare range cards and engage targets using range cards. On Phase V, they will use a
     100-round belt during daylight hours to obtain direction and readings for the targets
     indicated. They will have 15 minutes to prepare field expedient range cards using
     bandoleer boxes, wooden spacers from ammunition crates, etc., and complete Phase V.
     During phase VI, gun crews will fire four fire missions using range cards prepared during
     phase V. Night vision devices, illumination rounds or flares may be used with night-fire
     training.
     3.9.3.10. In the event night fire cannot be accomplished, Phases V and VI will be
     conducted during the day.
     3.9.3.11. Do not reconstruct firing ranges for the sole purpose of complying with this
     course of fire.
     3.9.3.12. Should the gunner fail to achieve a qualifying score on any evaluation order,
     the gunner is considered unqualified. However, if refired within 30 days, gunners need
     only to refire and qualify on those orders failed. Beyond 30 days, gunner must refire
     entire course.

       3.9.3.13. AF Forms 522 or 710 should only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for
       each firing phase. A numerical score is not required in the score block of these forms.

Figure 3.2. M2 Machine Gun Prone Position.




Prone Position. The gunner lays to the rear of the tripod and directly behind the gun. The
gunner’s legs are spread and feet are as flat as possible with toes turned outward. The left elbow
may rest on the ground but the left hand should be placed on the T&E mechanism to allow rapid
elevation and or traverse adjustments. The right hand is on the right spade grip and positioned to
actuate the trigger. The assistant gunner’s position is to the gunner’s left. The assistant gunner is
responsible for spotting targets, calling adjustments of fire to the gunner, clearing expended brass
from under the receiver, etc.
