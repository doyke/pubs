                                           Chapter 2

                                           CONCEPT

2.1. Objectives:
   2.1.1. Maintain a stable combat ready force through the annual flying hour program.
   2.1.2. Ensure an adequate response capability to support AMC's contingency mobility
   mission.
   2.1.3. Satisfy training requirements.
   2.1.4. Stabilize aircrew, aircraft maintenance, and aerial port/terminal workloads through
   efficient scheduling.
   2.1.5. Satisfy user mobility requirements worldwide.
   2.1.6. Assure efficient use of mobility resources.
   2.1.7. Standardize air mobility management procedures at each management level.
   2.1.8. Standardize aircrew and aircraft mission scheduling at wing, group, or squadron level.
2.2. General. Air mobility management is a dynamic process; however, for simplification this
instruction divides it into four steps:
   2.2.1. Determining requirements. Congress funds the total flying hour program. Hours other
   than those for unilateral aircrew training, maintenance test and ferry, and active duty Joint
   Airborne Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), are available through the Defense
   Business Operating Fund (DBOF). See Chapter 4 for additional information.
   2.2.2. Planning and scheduling missions. Mission planning starts after receiving annual
   Department of Defense (DoD) user requirements and continues throughout the year. These
   requirements are the basis for developing AMC schedules, commitment plans, wing
   operating plans (WOPs) and group operations plans (GOPs), maintenance schedules, and
   individual aircrew schedules. When developing a unit schedule, consider user and
   operational requirements, available flying hours, and maintenance capabilities and
   limitations. HQ AMC TACC XOOM/XOOT will coordinate the scheduling procedures for
   USAFR associate and unit-equipped AMC-gained units flying AMC missions. Coordinate
   ANG mission schedules with NGB/XOXE and USAFR mission schedules with HQ
   AFRES/DOOM. See Chapter 5 for additional information.
   2.2.3. Committing flying hours. HQ AMC TACC will allocate active duty flying hours to
   wings and groups. See Chapter 6 for additional information.
   2.2.4. Implementing schedules. Schedules are implemented using the AMC Deployment

   3.8.2. Deployments and operations requiring a sufficient number of aircraft to necessitate the
   use of a command element and/or planning staff will, to the maximum extent possible,
   employ aircraft from the same organizational unit. Unit integrity begins with the smallest
   recognized unit, a flight, deploying with its own flight commander and crews.
   3.8.3. Required support (command, operations, maintenance, communications, logistics,
   security, contracting, personnel, etc.) will, to the maximum extent possible, be provided from
   the corresponding organization.
   3.8.4. If resources are required in excess of a unit's capability, sister or associate units will be
   chosen when possible to provide augmentation. The command element at the deployed
   location will be determined by the unit providing the predominance of aircraft. Once fixed,
   the command structure will remain in place unless changed by competent authority.
   3.8.5. Rotations will maintain unit integrity to the maximum extent possible. The TACC will
   publish an annual rotation schedule for the next fiscal year no later than 31 Jul. Deployment
   and redeployment dates in the schedule may be adjusted by the TACC up to 3 days to
   accommodate the movement of fighter aircraft.
   3.8.6. If necessary, a unit's Single Integrated Operational Plan requirements will be tasked to
   another unit for the duration of the deployment.
   3.8.7. This policy applies to all tanker operations, exercises, and contingencies.
   3.8.8. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units have unique considerations.
   Depending on the state of mobilization, due regard and consideration will be given in the
   maintenance of unit integrity.
3.9. AMC Mission Identifiers. Instructions for encoding and decoding all AMC mission
identifiers are published in Part C to AMC Schedules.

                                       REQUIREMENTS

4.1. General. Airlift capability will be assigned according to the DoD Transportation
Movement Priority System (DTMPS). Tanker capability will be assigned according to the
priority system in AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135). TACC/XOO
will develop and coordinate procedures with NGB/XO and HQ USAFR/DO to determine AMC-
gained mobility capability.
4.1. (DOVERAFB) 436AW Current Operations is responsible for ensuring all higher
headquarters mission taskings are distributed between the 436 and 512 AWs in a fair and
equitable fashion. Current Operations will ensure the Initial Channel Buy is distributed with
60% of the available channels offered to the 512 AW. Add On missions will be allocated in a
manner that keeps the level loading of the schedule consistent (consideration should be given to
the 512 AW to fill those missions, which ideally fit their availability and training requirements to
include add on missions that Dover AFB is tasked with outside of 96 hours of execution). It is
the 436 AW Current Operations’ charter to ensure that the commitment rate is commensurate
with the negotiated “contract” levels as outlined by the AMC COMAFFOR Apportionment and
Allocation Process (CAAP). Any deviations from the agreed upon rates will be coordinated
through the 436 OG/CC, 436 MXG/CC and when required through the 436 AW/CC.
4.2. Training. Active duty AMC mobility units will identify their monthly training aircraft
requirements to their AMC NAF/DOT and TACC/XOO.
4.3. Exercise and JA/ATT. These mobility user requirements are coordinated with the
TACC/XOO.
4.4. Aeromedical . TACC/XOO and HQ TRANSCOM/GPMRC (Global Patient Movement
Requirements Center) receive proposed aeromedical evacuation schedules from HQ PACAF/SG
and HQ USAFE/ SG. TACC/XOOM evaluates the schedules from an operational standpoint and
the GPMRC evaluates the schedules from a medical standpoint. Conflicts in either area must be
resolved with the requesting command. If the schedules are feasible and are approved from a
budgetary basis, they will be published in the AMC schedules.
4.5. Channel/SAAM. TACC/XOO/TRK are the only agencies authorized to accept, evaluate,
and consolidate intertheater SAAM and forecast channel mobility requirements.
   4.5.1. Channel. AMC/TACC maintains passenger and forecast cargo requirements by
   channel by service. NOTE: TACC/TRK receives forecast cargo and passenger requirements.
   4.5.2. SAAM. Requirements are sent using joint regulation AFR 76-38/AR 59-
   8/OPNAVINST 4630.18D. See Chapter 11 for planning and implementation details.
4.6. KC-135 Airlift Operations:
   4.6.1. Air Mobility Command will optimize the use of all AMC aircraft to support the air
   mobility mission areas of air refueling and airlift.
   4.6.2. The KC-135 is AMC's core tanker. The KC-135 has airlift capability; however, the
   majority of KC-135s are dedicated to wartime air refueling (Air Mobility Master Plan,
   section 5).
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                               13


   4.6.3. To ensure a mission capable KC-135 crew force, and to ensure DoD receiver pilot's
   wartime readiness is not jeopardized, air refueling training requirements will not be canceled
   to support peacetime airlift requirements (exception in paragraph 4.6.6).
   4.6.4. Airlift mission taskings will be spread equally among AMC units, to the maximum
   extent possible, to evenly distribute impacts and benefits of flying additional hours.
   4.6.5. The process for tasking KC-135 units for peacetime operations will be based on
   flexible mission support priority systems located in AFI 11-221 for air refueling and Joint
   Publication 4-01 for airlift. Mission requests of ARC units will be coordinated with HQ
   AFRES or ANGRC.
   4.6.6. KC-135s may be redirected, with the approval of the TACC/CC, in response to a crisis
   or to support short-notice high priority missions.
   4.6.7. KC-135 dual role missions are missions where both air refueling and airlift are
   provided to the user. Planning agencies will use the following rules and requirements when
   approving support for dual role missions:
       4.6.7.1. A valid dual role must satisfy the following:
           4.6.7.1.1. The user must have a MAJCOM validated air refueling (AR) requirement.
           4.6.7.1.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and HQ AMC TACC/XOOM
           approved cargo requirement of a minimum of two pallets of cargo, not including
           baggage.
           4.6.7.1.3. Appropriateness and availability will be validated by the HQ AMC TACC,
           who will issue mission approval and tasking order.
       4.6.7.2. Completed dual role requests must be received by HQ AMC TACC/XOOT a
       minimum of 14 days prior to the mission.
       4.6.7.3. The dual role mission is primarily an air refueling mission, and the AR
       requirement must be met first without regard to protecting ancillary cargo capability.
NOTE: Dual role ancillary cargo capability is not contractual or guaranteed in any way.
Guaranteed cargo requires a dedicated funded SAAM.

       4.6.7.4. Additional tanker sorties/hours will not be expended to refuel the dual role KC-
       135 (i.e., force extension) solely for protecting ancillary cargo.
NOTE: Exceptions may be granted by HQ AMC/DO with recommendation of HQ AMC
TACC/CC for missions that do not meet this criteria but reduce total fiscal cost, do not impact
other tanker requirements, and are the most practical means available.

       4.6.7.5. Dual role requests that require excessive KC-135 positioning or repositioning
       time will not be supported unless effective KC-135 aircrew training can be accomplished
       on the positioning/repositioning legs.
NOTE: For ARC missions, unit identified training needs are considered in justifying
positioning/repositioning time.

   4.7.3. Airlift mission taskings will be spread equally among AMC units, to the maximum
   extent possible, to evenly distribute impacts and benefits of additional flying hours.
   4.7.4. The process for tasking KC-10 units for peacetime operations will be based on flexible
   mission support priority systems located in AFI 11-221 for air refueling and Joint Publication
   4-01 for airlift.
   4.7.5. KC-10s may be redirected, with the approval of the HQ AMC TACC/CC, in response
   to a crisis or to support short-notice high priority missions.
   4.7.6. KC-10 Dual Role missions are missions where both air refueling and airlift are
   provided to the user. Planning agencies will use the following rules and requirements when
   approving support for Dual Role missions:
       4.7.6.1. The user must have a MAJCOM validated air refueling (AR) requirement.
       4.7.6.2. The user must have a MAJCOM validated and HQ AMC TACC/XOOM
       approved cargo requirement for at least six pallets of cargo, not including baggage.
       4.7.6.3. Completed Dual Role requests must be received by HQ AMC TACC/XOOT a
       minimum of 14 days prior to the mission.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    MISSION PLANNING

5.1. General. This chapter outlines the responsibilities for developing fiscal year mobility
aircraft planning, the monthly AMC mobility management plan, and the wing or group
operations plan (WOP or GOP). Documentation developed, produced, and published from these
procedures is used in planning mobility operations.
5.2. General Planning:
   5.2.1. AMC Deployment and Analysis System (ADANS) is used to apply military and
   commercial aircraft capability against forecast DoD passenger and cargo requirements. It
   converts requirements and capability into passenger and cargo schedules, and provides
   TACC/XOO/TRK with data to develop the monthly mobility management plan.
   5.2.2. Airlift planning falls within the following time ranges:
       5.2.2.1. Short-Range. Covers the period 100 days before the actual operating month.
       During this time, ADANS is used to develop and publish the AMC Passenger and Cargo
       Schedules.
   5.2.3. Air refueling planning will be in accordance with AFI 11-221.
5.3. Long-Range Scheduling Process:
   5.3.1. This guidance establishes and implements procedures and responsibilities for AMC
   long-range scheduling. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of air mobility assets. There
   are three desired outcomes: provide a vehicle for conflict resolution at the earliest possible
   time; provide a vehicle to analyze for expected OPSTEMPO; and enable coordination
   between AMC, ANG, and AFRC under a single air mobility system (SAMS).
   5.3.2. Information Gathering and Consolidation:
       5.3.2.1. The key to this process is to gather the scheduling inputs from all available
       sources. The effectiveness of the long-range planning process is dependent on accurate
       data and timely transmission. Additionally, translation of inputs into a consolidated
       picture of future activity is the only way in which effective analysis and conflict
       resolution can occur, and is crucial to improving efficiencies in our air mobility system.
       5.3.2.2. TACC/XOB will be the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for database
       management. The AFRC and NGB agencies that have visibility on long-range scheduling
       issues will submit inputs to TACC/XOB by the first workday of each quarter. The long-
       range schedule covers the time period of 3 months out to 5 years. Figure 5.1 is a matrix
       which shows reporting agencies and the activities they will report. All active duty
       agencies will input their data by the first workday of each quarter (1 Oct, 1 Jan, 1 Apr, 1

          5.3.2.2.1. Inputs do not need to be precise statements of requirements; estimates of
          activity based on past experience or current trends are acceptable. Estimates should
          include : type activity, number of aircrews and aircraft, required base operating
          support forces, and projected dates or time frames (to the nearest quarter, minimum).
          All agencies should tentatively list (not task) activities by wing.
          5.3.2.2.2. TACC/XOB will transfer necessary manual inputs into a master database
          by the 15 'h of the first month of each quarter (Oct, Jan, Apr, Jul). This database will
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                           19


         be made accessible to all agencies via hard copy, electronic copy, or web access by
         the 20'h of the first month of each quarter.
  5.3.3. Activity Deconfliction.
     5.3.3.1. One of the primary purposes of the long-range planning process is to provide a
     vehicle for identifying and resolving conflicts between events as far in advance as
     possible. By identifying conflicting requirements well before their execution, planners
     can reduce changes, confusion, turbulence, and generally increase the overall efficiency
     of air mobility assets.
     5.3.3.2. Upon receipt of inputs and following consolidation into a single database,
     TACC/XOB will highlight time frames where obvious conflicts exist between activities.
     Conflicts will be communicated to input agencies when the database is made available
     (per 2.2.2 above). Input agencies are also responsible for identifying potential conflicts
     not already identified by TACC/XOB.
         5.3.3.2.1. Each agency is responsible for coordinating conflicts with other affected
         agencies to attempt to resolve the conflict. This coordination should commence as
         soon as the discrepancy is noticed and be completed by the 1st day of the 2 nd month
         of each quarter (1 Nov, 1 Feb, 1 May, 1 Aug).
         5.3.3.2.2. If there are any unresolved conflicts as of the 1 ' of the 2 d month of each
         quarter, TACC/XOB will convene the Long-Range Scheduling Board. This board
         will consist of a member from each input agency (preferably 0-5 and below). The
         board will be charged with developing a plan of action to rectify the conflict,
         complete with time frames and OPRs. TACC/XOB will then be responsible for
         monitoring the progress in executing the plan. Elevation of the issue to a higher level
         will be considered if the problem is intractable or if the board is aware of extenuating
         circumstances that merit higher level involvement.
         5.3.3.2.3. Final resolution of conflicts will be monitored and documented by
         TACC/XOB. Input agencies retain the responsibility to work issues assigned by the
         Long-range Scheduling Board. The quarterly update to the long-range schedule will
         be complete by the 15 th of the last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep).
     5.3.3.3. TACC/XOB will brief the 5-year schedule to AMC/CC in July of each year.
         5.3.3.3.1. The 5-year plan will be thoroughly coordinated through all customers and
         staff agencies prior to the July presentation. This will keep all parties informed and
         maintain process integrity.
  5.3.4. Long-Range Scheduling Product.
     5.3.4.1. The actual output of the long-range scheduling process must support many types
     of queries, provide an accessible basis for analysis, and be portable to many users. These
     elements are essential to allowing easy identification of possible conflicts, accurate
     analysis of future levels of activity, and providing a vehicle for effective coordination
     under the one mobility system.
     5.3.4.2. TACC/XOB will send a copy of the long-range schedule in spreadsheet/
     sandchart format on the 20th of the last month of the quarter (Dec, Mar, Jun, Sep) to the
     AMC/DO, AMC/LG, AFRC/DO, ANG/DO, AMC/IG and TACC/CC. The quarterly
 20                                          AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008


      report will be sorted by unit. As a minimum the report will depict the MDS, date of
      activity, number of aircraft, and number of aircrews for all the items listed in Figure 5.1
      The AMC/DO, TACC/CC, NAF/ CCs and an appropriate representative from the AFRC
      and ANG will be invited to attend the annual July brief to the AMC/CC.
          5.3.4.2.1. Agencies desiring changes to the fonnat or mode of transmission of the
          long-range scheduling product will submit requests to TACC/XOB. XOB will
          consider requests and coordinate proposed changes with affected agencies if required.
          5.3.4.2.2. The long-range scheduling product should also include an analysis of
          future activity including projected annual OPSTEMPO, as well as periods when
          peaks and valleys in activity can be expected. This forecast should include estimates
          of TWCF and 0 and M flying hour usage rates.
   5.3.5. Feedback and Evaluation Process.
      5.3.5.1. The continued effectiveness of the long-range scheduling process depends on
      routine updates and improvements to respond to changing conditions or newly identified
      opportunities. AMC/DOOO is the primary OPR for changes to the long-range scheduling
      process.
      5.3.5.2. The primary vehicle for assessing the effectiveness of the long-range scheduling
      process will be user feedback. Forward suggested changes and improvements to
      AMC/DOOO.
          5.3.5.2.1. All members of the Long-Range Scheduling Board will solicit feedback
          from customers. The 5year schedule briefed to the AMC/CC in July of each year will
          be made available to customers in August. Agencies will follow up to get feedback
          from customers by the end of September.
          5.3.5.2.2. Customer feedback will be discussed and evaluated at the November Long-
          Range Scheduling Board meeting. If no meeting was otherwise planned, TACC/XOB
          will convene the meeting for the purpose of re-evaluating the previous year's process.
          The long-range scheduling log will also be used in these process improvement
          discussions.
          5.3.5.2.3. The Long-Range Scheduling Board will submit proposals for change to
          AMC/ DOOO by the end of November of each year. AMC/DOOO will provide staff
          support to coordinate and implement changes.

                                  MISSION SCHEDULING

7.1. General. This chapter outlines policies and responsibilities for developing AMC mobility
mission schedules. The goal is to maintain aircrews and aircraft in a constant state of readiness
and provide global logistic support as a by-product. The air mobility mission schedule should
provide an even flow of aircrews and aircraft throughout the mobility system. This reduces
scheduling turbulence for aircrews, maintenance, traffic, and other support areas.
   7.1.1. AMC mission schedules are published in GDSS or C2IPS, or AIRS for WINDOWS
   and, when required, by AUTODIN message as far in advance as practical, but not normally
   later than 24 hours before scheduled operations. GDSS or C2IPS are the primary tasking
   methods.
   7.1.2. TACC/XOO develops and publishes mission schedules for the following:
       7.1.2.1. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). This category includes
       continuation and proficiency combat training supporting DoD agencies. Missions include
       airdrop, air assault, and aircraft static load training, and service school support.
       TACC/XOOMJ publishes JA/ ATT tasking in Appendix 1 to Annex C, AMC OPORD
       17-76.
       7.1.2.2. Exercises. This category covers all missions supporting CJCS exercises.
       Exercise directives (or equivalent) are published by TACC/XOOX as appropriate.
       7.1.2.3. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). This category includes user
       funded requirements requested because of the unusual nature of the cargo,
       sensitivity/urgency, or operations to airfields other than those normally transited by AMC
       aircraft. TACC/XOOM dispatches mission directives.
       7.1.2.4. Channel Traffic. This category includes scheduled missions operating over
       established routes to provide service between specified locations. TACC/XOOM
       publishes AMC cargo and passenger schedules.
       7.1.2.5. Air Refueling. This category includes all worldwide user requirements and is
       published by TACC/XOOT quarterly.
   7.1.3. Active duty wings/groups develop and publish mission schedules for the following:
       7.1.3.1. Unilateral Air Force Training. This category includes AMC aircrew training to
       achieve and maintain mission ready status in both Training Funded (TF) and DBOF-T
       coded aircraft. Missions include qualification and upgrade training, standardization,
       evaluation, and continuation training. Training missions are planned, scheduled, and
       flown within the hours committed/allocated for training.
       7.1.3.2. Other. This category includes non-revenue support, maintenance test/ferry, etc.
7.2. TACC Responsibilities:
   7.2.1. TACC/TRK:

                                           Chapter 8

                                 AIRCREW SCHEDULING

8.1. General. Flying unit commanders (AMC, Reserve Associate, and AMC-gained) will
follow the policies of AFI 11-401, Flight Management; AFI 11-206, General Flight Rules; MCI
10-202; MCI 11-XXX series; AFI 11-408, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
Organization and Administration; and this instruction when scheduling crews on AMC missions.
   8.1.1. Flight Authorizations. Issue flight authorizations using MAJCOM procedures.
   8.1.2. Security Clearances. All attached and assigned aircrew members must have at least a
   SECRET security clearance or one that meets the security requirements of the mission. If
   access to TOP SECRET or SECRET information (AFI 31-501, Personnel Security
   Management Program) is necessary, indicate this in DD Form 398, Item 9, Statement of
   Personal History, as justification for an OSI Investigation.
8.2. Aircrew Complement. Minimum basic and augmented crew complements are outlined in
the MCI 11-XXX series. Normally, augmented crews will not be used; however, they may be
authorized by HQ AMC/DO, even when the mission profile does not meet the criteria, if justified
by the mission priority.
8.3. Scheduling Priorities:
   8.3.1. Initial/Upgrade/Requalification/Difference training.
   8.3.2. Keep all aircrews current and qualified.
   8.3.3. Accomplish as many currency items as possible on operational missions to reduce
   unilateral flying training.
   8.3.4. Distribute flying time as evenly as possible within the same crew position and comply
   with individual training and proficiency requirements.
8.4. Scheduled Return Times (SRT):
   8.4.1. SRT and Firm SRT (FSRT) are scheduling tools used by air mobility units to predict
   when crews will return to home station. It allows force managers to plan aircrew availability
   and provides crews visibility over monthly flying activities. AMC and AMC-gained C-5, C-
   9, KC-10, KC-135, C-141, and C-17 aircrews (except those on standby at home station) will
   have an SRT established on their flight orders. Units, aircrews, and C2 agencies (including
   TACC) must be aware that flight orders and AMC Form 59 SRT entries refer to mission end
   time, not FSRT. FSRT must be computed as in 8.4.1.1. below. The FSRT for the crew will be
   entered in the crew information section of the flight orders.
       8.4.1.1. Computations. Wing/group current operations will calculate SRTs using the
       mission end time. The SRT is the same as the scheduled mission end time and will be
       used on the AMC Form 59 for tracking purposes. Mission end time is defined as the time
       the aircrew is scheduled to return to home station based on scheduled mission timing or
       return times printed in OPORDs (for deployments). AMC’s goal is to return all crews to
       home station NLT 2 hours past SRT. FSRT for active duty, is scheduled mission end time
       plus 48 hours. ANG and AFRC is defined as SRT plus 24 hours.
28                                           AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008


     8.4.1.2. Missions with stages of unknown duration. Use mission duration estimate plus
     48 hours for each time the crew enters a stage.
     8.4.1.3. Missions of unknown duration (e.g., contingencies). SRT is determined by the
     TACC/ XOO. SRTs for ARC crews flying contingency missions will be coordinated with
     HQ AFRC or ANGRC.
     8.4.1.4. Integral Tanker Unit Deployments (ITUD). Deployed units will compute
     mission SRTs based on the planned time of the deployment and the specific deployment
     requirements. Redeployments may be adjusted by the TACC up to 3 days to
     accommodate the movement of fighter aircraft (not applicable for ANG/AFRC personnel.
     Changes to AFRC/ANG ITUD SRTs will be requested through HQ AFRC and/or
     ANGRC).
     8.4.1.5. C-130 Unit Deployments. SRT is computed as scheduled redeployment date (or
     deployment duration). Deployed units will adhere to SRT specified in deployment orders.
     8.4.1.6. BRAVO/ALFA alert. Crews on alert will have “TBD” on their orders for an
     SRT. Upon notification, the controlling agency (normally the TACC) will determine SRT
     based on projected mission duration, enter this SRT in the Global Decision Support
     System (GDSS) and inform the aircraft commander. If launching against a mission of
     unknown duration, the TACC/XOO will determine SRT. SRT and FSRT rules apply to
     crews launched from BRAVO/ALFA alert.
     8.4.1.7. Local training missions. As determined by crew duty day.
  8.4.2. Changing scheduled return time.
     8.4.2.1. During mission setup/planning, wing/group current operations will change the
     SRT as dictated by mission changes, itinerary, stages, and so forth. All changes shall be
     coordinated through the aircrew's squadron.
     8.4.2.2. Within 12 hours of crew alert at home station (24 hours for ARC crews), the
     SRT will not be changed by the command and control system. Every attempt should be
     made not to change preestablished SRTs for ARC crews.
  8.4.3. Overflying scheduled return time.
     8.4.3.1. During periods of routine mobility operations, aircrews will not be diverted or
     delayed in the AMC system so as to prevent their return by FSRT. The following applies
     to both active and ARC aircrews:
         8.4.3.1.1. If it appears the FSRT will be overflown, TACC/XOC will coordinate with
         the aircraft commander and unit commander to determine the action to be taken. If
         the crew returns home prior to mission completion, TACC/XOC is responsible for
         working another crew. For ANG/AFRC crews, TACC/XOC will also coordinate with
         aircraft commander and home unit for SRT overflight.
         8.4.3.1.2. Priority one add-ons, natural disaster relief, emergency air evacuation
         missions, and JCS-directed requirements will be supported, even when the SRT will
         be overflown. TACC/ XOZ will direct FSRT overflight for active duty crews, when
         required on a case-by-case basis. TACC/XOZ will coordinate with ANG/AFRC
         aircraft commander and unit commander for FSRT overflight approval.
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                         29


     8.4.3.2. For active units, TACC will notify the crew and parent wing of the new expected
     return time. If the home wing or group identifies an overriding problem associated with
     keeping an individual crew member past their FSRT, the home station command post will
     notify TACC of the special circumstances. TACC/XOZ will make every effort to meet
     special circumstance requests.
     8.4.3.3. For ANG/AFRC units. FSRTs for ANG/AFRC aircrews will be considered firm
     and will not be overflown without the approval of the aircraft commander and the parent
     unit. ANG/AFRC units will be notified of pending SRT and FSRT overflight as early as
     possible so a crew replacement may be accomplished, or crew member extension
     approved, if needed.
     8.4.3.4. All replacement crew members travel in ACM status (positioning/depositioning
     crew-member) according to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. If this is
     impossible, HQ AMC TACC/XOCA will verify that no military or contract
     transportation is available, then call the unit commander, associate wing commander
     (AFRC) or wing/group commander (ANG) for approval to send the crew members(s) via
     commercial transportation. All crew members on AMC missions may use DD Form 1610
     for commercial transportation if required (see MACR/AFRESR 45-14, Management of
     the Reserve Associate Program, chapter 3, for funding provisions). In addition,
     TACC/XOOM will coordinate for any required Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA)
     man-days for ARC personnel.
  8.4.4. Managing scheduled return time. Crews will be monitored closely by TACC and all
  en route command and control centers (CCCs) to ensure recovery by the FSRT. CCC must
  consider SRTs in the management of stage crews. If SRTs are not a factor, first-in, first-out
  concept will normally apply. TACC/XOC is responsible for managing crew members who
  are separated from their aircraft so they return to home station by FSRT.

                                            Chapter 9

                         EN ROUTE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

9.1. Policies:
   9.1.1. Stable operations depend on a steady flow of missions in the mobility system. Since
   operations schedules are developed for stability, management actions must follow them.
   Policies and responsibilities established in this chapter apply to all aircraft operating on AMC
   missions.
9.2. Responsibilities. Commanders must monitor their support capability and inform TACC if
it changes enough to affect mission scheduling.
9.3. Aircraft Holds/Early Departures. All planning/scheduling agencies are responsible for
identifying operational requirements or restrictions early enough to avoid schedule deviations. If,
however, good judgment requires deviations, evaluate the effect on downline operations before
making any decision. Approval authority for early departures or holds is the agency with
operational control or management responsibility (TACC, or AF component commander for
exercise or contingency employments). Deviations may be authorized for weather, ARTC
restriction, or airfield limitations (scheduled runway closure, etc.) and must be explained with the
appropriate AMCI 10-202, volume 6, deviation indicators.
9.4. Ground Times. When a mission is operating late, attempt to meet the schedule by
reducing ground time at intermediate stops or turnaround stations, but do not violate AMC crew
rest policy or paragraph 9.3. Unless an early departure is authorized (paragraph 9.3.), early
arrivals must be held until scheduled departure time. Otherwise ground times are:
   9.4.1. As published in TACC schedules, GDSS, C2IPS, OPLAN/OPORD or as required for
   a SAAM.
   9.4.2. According to TACC operating procedures for other missions, aircraft which make
   unscheduled landings, or with mission identifier changes.
   9.4.3. As required by the mission, aircrew capability, and TACC operating procedures for
   offshore floater aircraft.
9.5. Overflying En Route Stations . Aircraft commanders may ask TACC Command and
Control to overfly a scheduled stop. The TACC will ensure change of destination:
   9.5.1. Will not impact onload/offload requirements.
   9.5.2. Will not exceed the maximum on the ground (MOG) at the new destination.
9.6. Returning Aircraft. Wings must include due home dates in the remarks section of
departure messages when aircraft depart home station. This date is based on planned
maintenance actions (scheduled minor/major isochronal inspection, aircraft refurbishment, major
TCTO/modification, mid-internal PDM, depot-level maintenance, and so forth).
9.7. Priorities . Use the following mission priority listing as a guide for supporting en route
aircraft.
   9.7.1. Active search and rescue.
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                                 31


   9.7.2. 89 AW (when transporting the President/Vice President).
   9.7.3. Priority 1A1 through 1B2.
   9.7.4. Urgent aeromedical evacuation.
   9.7.5. 89 AW (value judgment based upon user).
   9.7.6. Priority aeromedical evacuation.
   9.7.7. Priority 1B3 through 2B2.
   9.7.8. Routine aeromedical evacuation.
   9.7.9. Passenger missions/operational support airlift.
   9.7.10. Priority 3A1 through 4B3.
   9.7.11. Training, route familiarization/aircraft transfer.
NOTE: This applies to routine transfers only. If an aircraft is being transferred to accomplish a
specific mission, that aircraft will receive the same priority at an en route stop as the mission it is
going to fulfill. For example, if an aircraft is being transferred to replace a broken aircraft that is
tasked to support an urgent aeromedical evacuation, the transferring aircraft will carry the urgent
aeromedical evacuation priority when it stops for fuel en route.

9.8. : Conversions.
   9.8.1. Operating missions may be converted to support higher priority requirements
   provided:
NOTES:

ARC aircraft/crews will not be converted without approval of appropriate ARC headquarters.

KC-10s may be redirected from an air refueling mission to a higher priority airlift mission after
coordination with TACC/XOOT.

       9.8.1.1. The requirement is justified.
       9.8.1.2. Qualified people and equipment are readily available to convert the mission.
       9.8.1.3. In-bound mission offloading will not seriously impact station workload or cargo
       shipment time.
       9.8.1.4. The converted mission will operate over the same basic route structure.
       9.8.1.5. Additional deviation will not seriously affect stage crew operations.
       9.8.1.6. Mission number changes are relayed to aircrews and en route/destination
       stations.
9.9. Reroutes or Schedule Changes:
   9.9.1. The AMC objective is to carry out schedules as originally published. Do not
   reschedule missions solely to avoid incurring departure/arrival delays. Schedule changes or
   reroutes must be for user requests, additional higher priority missions, changing forecast
 32                                           AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008


   requirements, forecast weather problems, or other operational considerations ensuring
   productive use of mobility assets. Schedule changes must be coordinated with the affected
   stations and approved by one of the following:
       9.9.1.1. TACC/XOZ. For ARC aircraft and crews, TACC/XOZ will coordinate with the
       appropriate ARC headquarters.
       9.9.1.2. Air Force component commander having operational control. For ARC aircraft
       and crews coordinate with the appropriate ARC headquarters.
   9.9.2. Basis for rerouting CONUS aeromedical evacuation missions will be aeromedical
   requirements and optimization of airlift. Aeromedical requirements includes, but are not
   limited to, Aeromedical Staging Facility (ASF) patient capabilities, specific patient
   requirements, and forecast aeromedical airlift capability for further movement of patients to
   destination hospitals, and location of other aircraft operating in the system and their mission
   priority. Most aeromedical evacuation missions operating to and within CONUS generally
   require further patient movement by C-9 missions. Interface with the C-9 aeromedical
   evacuation missions is extremely important. The GPMRC coordinates patient airlift
   requirements within CONUS and offshore areas. Additionally, they coordinate strategic
   aeromedical interface with the appropriate overseas Theater Patient Movement Requirements
   Center (TPMRC) and TACC/XOOMM (Strategic Aeromedical Airlift Branch).
9.10. Operational Support Flights:
   9.10.1. AMC active duty operational support flights must be limited. They require GDSS,
   C2IPS, and ADANS message traffic (and telephone coordination with the AMC airlift
   director as needed) to insure managers are aware of all operations. Positioning,
   depositioning, support and ferry missions in CONUS may be used for operational support
   flights.
9.11. Replacement Aircraft. Aircraft on high priority missions with actual or potential
extended deviations may be replaced provided the selected aircraft does not negatively impact
the mission or aircraft integrity.
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                                33


                                            Chapter 10

                                   AMC STANDBY FORCES

10.1. Policy. While AMC policy is generally to keep a minimum number of aircrews and
aircraft on short-notice standby, it is sometimes necessary to have a standby force capability.
Therefore, AMC aircrews and aircraft must be ready to respond to short-notice mobility tasks.
AMC-gained AFRC/ANG units will not normally be requested to perform home station standby
duties. Units flying AMC missions may be placed into standby status at en route locations.
   10.1.1. Standby Forces Capability:
       10.1.1.1. ALFA Standby. Crews shall be ready to take off within 1 hour after notification
       for C-141, KC-10, KC-135, and C-17 aircraft. C-5 can take off within 1.5 hours. Crews
       will be billeted at a location that will allow them to meet launch requirements. This will
       normally be on base.
       10.1.1.2. BRAVO Standby. Crews shall be ready to take off within 3 hours after
       notification for C-141, KC-10, KC-135, and C-17. C-5 can take off within 3.5 hours.
       Crews may be billeted on or off base.
       10.1.1.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews shall be identified and capable of entering crew rest
       within 2 hours of TACC notification to their controlling unit, becoming legal for alert 12
       hours later. Crews may then be placed in ALFA or BRAVO alert, or may be tasked to fly
       a mission. As with BRAVO, TACC will task wings to provide a specific number of
       CHARLIE crews.
       10.1.1.4. Wing Standby Forces. As established by unit commander.
       10.1.1.5. PHOENIX BANNER. See AFI 11-289, PHOENIX BANNER, PHOENIX
       SILVER, and PHOENIX COPPER Operations.
   10.1.2. Authority:
       10.1.2.1. TACC commander may establish and task ALFA, BRAVO, or CHARLIE
       standby forces for priority missions. TACC will coordinate with ANGRC/DOC or
       USAFR/DOOC as appropriate for standby forces.
       10.1.2.2. Unit commanders may establish a wing standby force over and above other
       standby forces, when expecting short-notice priority taskings.
   10.1.3. Forming the Standby Force. A standby force is formed when the unit completes the
   actions that will allow the aircraft to take off or crews to enter crew rest in the specified time.
   NOTE: AMC Commander may waive any crew rest periods but normally only during high
   priority mobility tasks or changes in unit readiness.
       10.1.3.1. ALFA.
          10.1.3.1.1. Form ALFA standby forces as soon as possible after being tasked.
          10.1.3.1.2. This force is ready when the aircraft is configured, serviced, and mission
          capable, and the crew has completed the preflight up to "Before Starting
          Engines/Ready To Start Engines Checklist" and is legal for alert.
34                                           AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008


        10.1.3.1.3. Units must plan to keep tasked aircraft on standby for 48 hours.
        Exceptions require TACC coordination.
     10.1.3.2. BRAVO.
        10.1.3.2.1. Form BRAVO standby forces ASAP after notification.
        10.1.3.2.2. This force is ready when the crew has completed prestandby crew rest
        and is legal for alert.
     10.1.3.3. CHARLIE.
        10.1.3.3.1. Form CHARLIE standby forces ASAP after notification.
        10.1.3.3.2. This force is ready when the crew has been identified of their standby
        responsibilities and they can be notified to enter crew rest within 2 hours of TACC
        notification.
     10.1.3.4. Unit commanders may form wing standby forces at their discretion. NOTE:
     When ALFA or BRAVO standby forces are launched, a new standby force must be
     formed using the criteria in paragraphs 10.1.3., 10.1.4.1., and 10.1.4.2 after the takeoff of
     the original standby aircraft. If activated, CHARLIE standby forces do not need backfill
     unless specifically tasked by TACC. If not activated, wings will continue the CHARLIE
     alert commitment until relieved by TACC.
  10.1.4. Standby Force Management and Crew Rest:
     10.1.4.1. ALFA Standby.
        10.1.4.1.1. Aircrews must have 12 hours of prestandby crew rest before or after
        aircraft preflight.
        10.1.4.1.2. Aircrews must complete all preflight duties within 6 hours of crew show
        time. If preflight time exceeds 6 hours, the crew must have an additional 12-hour
        prestandby crew rest.
        10.1.4.1.3. Once an ALFA standby force is formed, additional preflights may be
        necessary to maintain the ALFA aircraft. Additional preflights which are started and
        completed during normal waking hours do not interrupt predeparture crew rest.
     10.1.4.2. BRAVO Standby. Crews may be alerted after 12 hours of prestandby crew rest.
     Preflight duties are not authorized during crew rest.
     10.1.4.3. CHARLIE Standby. Crews are not restricted from normal duties and activities
     while on CHARLIE standby. Crews must be physically available to enter crew rest
     within 2 hours of TACC notification of the controlling unit. If crews are alerted to enter
     crew rest, the TACC will direct appropriate crew actions following the crew rest period
     (assume ALFA or BRAVO standby, or fly a mission). CHARLIE standby duty is
     considered complete for the standby crew upon notification to enter crew rest.
     10.1.4.4. Wing Standby.
        10.1.4.4.1. Wing commanders must give wing standby crews normal predeparture
        crew rest IAW AFI 11-2-MDS Specific, Volume III.
AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008                                                        35


         10.1.4.4.2. Standby duty is limited to 12 hours. Crews will receive at least 12 hours
         of crew rest prior to another 12 hours of standby duty.
     10.1.4.5. Post-standby missions. Upon completion of standby duty, aircrew members
     may be dispatched on a mission.
         10.1.4.5.1. Standby duty and predeparture crew rest may be concurrent if notification
         is provided at least 12 hours before departure.
         10.1.4.5.2. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of
         predeparture crew rest.
         10.1.4.5.3. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission in lieu of post-standby
         crew rest, compute the post-mission crew rest time on standby time plus mission time
         (do not include CHARLIE standby time).
     10.1.4.6. Post-Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission
     following standby duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
         10.1.4.6.1. If standby duty was performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time
         is computed from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
         10.1.4.6.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is
         authorized. EXCEPTION: For wing standby, see paragraph 10.1.4.4
  10.1.5. Command and Control. The TACC commander controls the AMC standby force.
  TACC may direct fuel loads, planned routing configurations, basic aircrew, or other specific
  details. All standby force tasking information and subsequent changes will be sent through
  command and control channels so that TACC and wing command posts will have current
  standby force status at all times.
  10.1.6. Crew Duty Time.
     10.1.6.1. Do not keep ALFA standby crews on duty for more than 48 hours. ALFA crew
     duty time begins when the unit is told to launch unless the crew is preflighting, in this
     case crew duty time begins when the crew first reported for that duty.
     10.1.6.2. Do not keep BRAVO standby crews on duty for more than 48 hours. After 48
     hours, the crew must have been launched, released, or placed on predeparture crew rest.
     Crew duty time begins when the crew shows for duty.
     10.1.6.3. Do not keep CHARLIE standby crews on duty for more than 72 hours. After 72
     hours, the crew must be released for 12 hours before reentering CHARLIE standby or
     crew rest for other activities. Alerting CHARLIE standby crews does not begin a crew
     duty period.
     10.1.6.4. Wing standby crew duty times are limited to 12 hours.
     10.1.6.5. Do not use a standby crew (except CHARLIE standby crews) to preflight
     aircraft, other than their own, or perform any other duties while on standby.
  10.1.7. Standby Reporting. Report unit standby forces status through command and control
  channels. Report the following to TACC:
     10.1.7.1. Forecast and actual forming of a standby force.

10.3. ALFA Standby and J-Alert Aircraft Security. Each unit will complete a maintenance
and aircrew preflight inspection when they put an aircraft on ALFA standby status. Secure all
hatches and access doors and seal the crew entrance door with a metal boxcar seal or controllable
device, which will prevent entry without damage to the door, seal, or controllable device. The
aircraft commander will ensure the aircraft is closed and doors sealed before entering crew rest.
The command post (TACC/XOC if there is no command post) must grant permission before any
person may enter an aircraft once the plane is sealed. Ensure standby aircraft is resealed any time
the aircraft has been opened. The aircraft commander or designated representative must be
present if access to the assigned aircraft is required.

                                 Attachment 4 (DOVERAFB)
             P-ALERT PROCEDURES AND LAUNCH RESPONSIBILITIES

This section of this Dover Air Force Base Instruction (DAFBI) outlines procedures and
responsibilities for the management and execution of the JCS-directed P-Alert commitment of
the 436 Airlift Wing, Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. This guidance is applicable to the 436
OSS/OSO, 436 AW/CP, 436 OSS/OSL, 436 OSO/OSAA, 436 OSS/OSK, 436 OG/IN, 736
AMXS, Jetside Service, and 3 AS.
A4.1. (DOVERAFB) GENERAL: P-Alert is a high-priority JCS alert posture. It requires two
Augmented Airland crews consisting of 1 Aircraft Commander, 1 Augmenting Air Refueling
Pilot (as described in AFI 11-2C-17v3 Table 3.1 note 3), 1 First Pilot, 2 Loadmasters, and 1
Flying Crew Chief (FCC). Alert aircrew members will be provided 12 hours crew rest prior to
alert duty. Changeover days will be identified by 436 OSS/OSO. 436 OSS/OSO is responsible
for overall P-Alert program management. Reference AFI 11-2C-17V3 and the DOVERAFBSUP
for additional information.
   A4.1.1. (DOVERAFB) Quick Reaction Checklists (QRCs). QRCs that are created in
   response to this attachment will be routed through 436 OSS/OSO Chief of Airlift Operations
   (CAO). The CAO will validate QRCs and forward them to 436 AW/XP for publication on
   their EIM webpage.
   A4.1.2. (DOVERAFB) Strict adherence to the procedures in this attachment is critical to
   ensure a successful alert launch. Any problems associated with the P-Alert posture must be
   reported immediately to 436 OSS/OSO for resolution.
A4.2. (Added-DOVERAFB) PROCEDURES:
A4.2.1. (DOVERAFB) Swap Out. On-coming P-Alert crews will officially assume alert
responsibilities at 0900L on alert swap out day, normally every other Wednesday. At that time,
all off-going, on-coming, and P-Alert crewmembers remaining on alert will report to the 3 AS
Conference Room, Building 204. The Alert Manager will perform a roll call of all
crewmembers. Off-going crewmembers will place their Alert Phones and chargers in the Alert
Phone Box in the mission planning room. The off-going crewmembers will be released from P-
Alert, as long as their replacement crewmembers are present. The off-going crewmembers will
return all applicable equipment to Aircrew Flight Equipment once released. The Alert Manager
will then brief the on-coming crews of their alert responsibilities and procedures on Alert and in
the event of a launch. Following the briefing, aircraft commanders will conduct crew briefs.
The Alert Manager will reissue Alert Phones to the on-coming crewmembers by position.

   A4.2.2. (DOVERAFB) Interim Swap Outs. Interim crewmember swap outs are not a
   normal occurrence and will be used as a last resort for maintaining the alert force. For
   interim crewmember swap outs, Alert Phones will be exchanged face-to-face with the Alert
   Manager, at Current Operations during normal duty hours (0730-1630), by individual alert
   crew position (e.g., the off-going aircraft commander will exchange the Alert Phone with the
   on-coming aircraft commander in person). Swap outs will not occur without an updated
   Flight Authorization and Alert Recall Roster from the 3 AS. Crewmembers will not turn
46                                         AMCI11-206_DOVERAFBSUP_I 8 MAY 2008


  Alert Phones over to anyone other than their replacement or the Alert Manager. In extreme
  cases where a swap out must occur after normal duty hours, the Alert Manager will be
  contacted by the On-Call 3 AS DO/ADO to coordinate the Alert Phone exchange.
  Crewmembers and the Alert Manager must ensure there is no gap in alert coverage. Alert
  aircraft commanders will brief interim swap out crewmembers prior to alert assumption. In
  the event of an alert aircraft commander interim swap out, the new aircraft commander will
  brief the entire crew prior to alert assumption.
A4.3. (DOVERAFB) RESPONSIBILITIES:
  A4.3.1. (DOVERAFB) 436 OSS/OSO Alert Manager will:
     A4.3.1.1. (DOVERAFB) Interface with higher headquarters and primary users.
     A4.3.1.2. (DOVERAFB) Act as the 436 AW focal point for all P-Alert issues.
     A4.3.1.3. (DOVERAFB) Manage and issue all P-Alert Phones.
     A4.3.1.4. (DOVERAFB) Brief on-coming P-Alert crews.
     A4.3.1.5. (DOVERAFB) Maintain current alert Flight Authorizations and an Alert
     Recall Roster containing a list of aircrew members and crew chiefs on alert, with home
     and personal cell phone numbers.
         A4.3.1.5.1. (DOVERAFB) Send the current Flight Authorizations and Alert Recall
         Roster to 436 AW/CP prior to alert assumption.
         A4.3.1.5.2. (DOVERAFB) Provide revised Flight Authorizations and Alert Recall
         rosters to 436 AW/CP prior to alert assumption in the event of interim swap outs.
     A4.3.1.6. (DOVERAFB) Accomplish appropriate Quick Reaction Checklist (QRC) in
     the event of a launch.
     A4.3.1.7. (DOVERAFB) Periodically exercise P-Alert launch procedures.
     A4.3.1.8. (DOVERAFB) Notify TACC/XOOS of any break in P-Alert capability and
     provide a get well time.
