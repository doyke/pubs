                                             Chapter 1

                   OVERVIEW AND FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

Section 1A—General Information

1.1. Program Purpose. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program
reinforces the Air Force’s commitment to eliminate sexual assaults through awareness and
prevention training, education, victim advocacy, response, reporting, and accountability. The Air
Force promotes sensitive care and confidential reporting for victims of sexual assault and
accountability for those who commit these crimes.
1.2. Applicability and Scope. Supersedes all regulatory and policy guidance within the Air
Force not expressly mandated by law that is inconsistent with this Instruction.
1.3. Definitions. Terms used in this Instruction are defined in Attachment 1.
1.4. Policy. The United States Air Force does not tolerate sexual assault. Sexual assault is
criminal conduct that falls well short of the standards America expects of its men and women in
uniform. It violates Air Force Core Values. Inherent in the Air Force Core Values of Integrity
First, Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do, is respect: self-respect, mutual respect,
and respect for the Air Force as an institution. It is Air Force policy to:
     1.4.1. Eliminate sexual assault within the Department of the Air Force by fostering a culture
     of prevention, providing education and training, response capability, victim support,
     reporting procedures, and accountability that enhances the safety and well-being of all its
     members.
     1.4.2. Provide an immediate, trained response capability for each report of sexual assault and
     ensure victims are protected and treated with dignity and respect, and receive timely access
     to appropriate treatment and services.
     1.4.3. Ensure strong commander-focused prevention and response programs, as well as law
     enforcement, investigative, and criminal justice policies and procedures that address victim
     safety and hold assailants accountable for their actions to the fullest extent of the law.
     1.4.4. Encourage prompt, complete, unrestricted reporting of sexual assault allegations to
     activate victim services and accountability responses. Victims should be appropriately
     encouraged to make unrestricted reports.
     1.4.5. Provide a restricted reporting option that allows a Service member who is sexually
     assaulted to confidentially disclose information about the assault to specified individuals and
     receive medical treatment, counseling, and advocacy without automatically triggering an
     official investigative process.
     1.4.6. Prohibit the enlistment or commissioning of personnel in the active duty Air Force,
     Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserve components when the person has a qualifying
     conviction (see Attachment 1) for a crime of sexual assault.

Section 1B—Functional Responsibilities

1.5. Air Force Headquarters.
   1.5.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs
   (SAF/MR) serves as an agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and
   oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans,
   policies, programs, and budgets addressing sexual assault.
   1.5.2. The Inspector General (SAF/IG) is responsible for oversight of criminal investigations
   performed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and for other
   investigations and matters under his or her authority as Inspector General. SAF/IG is
   responsible for ensuring proper training of AFOSI personnel in sexual assault policy and
   related matters, and ensures all unrestricted reports of sexual assault received by AFOSI are
   tracked and reported regardless of who conducts the investigation. Maintains effective
   liaison with HQ USAF/A7S for all matters related to sexual assault reporting and

                                 PROGRAM EXECUTION

Section 2A—Principal Stakeholders and Responsibilities for Execution

2.1. Offices Primarily Responsible for Program Execution. MAJCOM and installation-
level SARCs are responsible for executing the SAPR Program. First Responders (see
Attachment 1), commanders, supervisors, and leaders (those not covered by prior
categories such as Superintendents, First Sergeants, and Chief Master Sergeants) are also
responsible for the effectiveness of the SAPR Program throughout their organizations and
installation.
2.2. MAJCOM SARC.
   2.2.1. The MAJCOM SARC is responsible for administering the Sexual Assault Prevention
   and Response program within that MAJCOM and provides functional oversight and guidance
   for installation SARCs to ensure compliance with this Instruction and other applicable
   authority.
   2.2.2. The MAJCOM SARC provides professional supervision and assistance for the
   installation SARC on matters such as policy interpretation, execution of duties, and other
   matters as warranted. When determined by the MAJCOM SARC, this assistance may
   require discussions with the installation SARC or VAs regarding restricted reporting
   communications from victims in order to assist the SARC in the performance of his or her
   duties. Such discussions may include personal identifying information for effective
   oversight.
2.3. Installation SARC.
   2.3.1. Reporting directly to the installation WG/CV or equivalent, the SARC executes the
   Air Force’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program at the installation level.
      2.3.1.1. Because of the potential for legal, professional, or community conflicts of
      interest, the following military members cannot serve as SARCs, Alternate SARCs, or
      VAs: individuals on G-series orders, first sergeants, chief master sergeants, individuals
      associated with law enforcement or investigations, individuals assigned to the Office of
      the SJA, MTF personnel working in clinical roles with whom assault victims may come
      in contact, individuals assigned to Equal Opportunity (EO) offices, individuals assigned
      to the Office of the Installation Staff Chaplain, or individuals assigned to the wing’s
      Inspector General staff.
   2.3.2. The SARC serves as the installation’s single point of contact for integrating and
   coordinating sexual assault victim care services. Services may begin at the initial report of
   sexual assault and continue through disposition and resolution of issues related to the
   victim’s health and well-being. The SARC shall assist unit commanders as necessary to
   ensure victims of sexual assault receive the appropriate responsive care.
      2.3.2.1. The SARC will track the status of sexual assault cases in his or her designated
      area of responsibility and provide regular updates to the WG/CV. For restricted reports,
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                  11


     only non-identifying environmental information, as defined in paragraph 3.1.10.1. of this
     AFI, will be provided to command authorities.
  2.3.3. Eligibility to be a SARC. SARCs can be either an Air Force officer or DoD civilian
  employee.
     2.3.3.1. Military SARCs must be in the grade of captain or above, designated as
     deployable resources, and support the Air Force’s commitment to expeditionary missions,
     ensuring that SAPR capability is transferable to the battlefield (real or exercise).
         2.3.3.1.1. Due to readiness commitments and AF-level deployment planning, military
         SARC positions cannot be converted to civilian positions without the approval of HQ
         USAF/A1.
         2.3.3.1.2. SARC responsibilities are part of the 38F (Force Support) core
         competencies. Other officers or civilians, except those noted in paragraph 2.3.1.1.,
         may serve as SARCs provided they are released by their career field program
         manager, successfully complete requisite training identified in paragraph 2.8., and are
         approved by AFPC Assignments Branch.
     2.3.3.2. Installation civilian SARCs must be GS-12 or NSPS equivalent and are
     governed by the mandatory SARC Standard Civilian Position Description.
         2.3.3.2.1. Civilian SARCs may volunteer to deploy contingent upon meeting required
         prerequisites (i.e., security clearance, weapons qualification, etc.) and subject to
         commander’s approval.
         2.3.3.2.2. At installations where there is a civilian and a military SARC, the civilian
         will hold the position of SARC and the military SARC will serve as the deputy.
     2.3.3.3. Special Considerations for the Reserves.
         2.3.3.3.1. Civilian Reserve SARC positions are graded at GS-12 or NSPS equivalent
         and are governed by the mandatory Reserve SARC Standard Civilian Position
         Description.
         2.3.3.3.2. Civilian Reserve SARCs may volunteer to deploy contingent upon meeting
         required prerequisites (i.e., security clearance, weapons qualification, etc.) and
         subject to wing commander and HQ AFRC SAPR Program Manager approval.
         2.3.3.3.3. Each co-located reserve wing will have a Reserve SARC Liaison (RSL)
         who will serve as the primary reserve POC to the active duty SARC. The RSL
         should be a member of the reserve unit’s Physical Examination Package and have the
         ability to facilitate a Line of Duty (LOD) determination. They will assist the active
         duty SARC in scheduling delivery of training to reserve personnel and managing of
         any reserve victim LOD issues.
  2.3.4. WG/CV will ensure that appropriate and qualified personnel are identified, trained,
  and available to serve as Alternate SARCs in the event of the primary SARC’s absence due
  to leave, TDY, illness, etc.
     2.3.4.1. An officer or civilian equivalent who has completed the VA/SARC course and
     has performed SARC or VA duties under SARC supervision may serve as an Alternate
     SARC for duties of a short duration, usually not to exceed 7 days at a time.
12                              AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


     2.3.4.2. For periods exceeding 7 days, the Alternate SARC must meet the eligibility
     requirements of paragraph 2.3.3. Exceptions to grade requirements may only be made
     under extenuating circumstances and require the WG/CV’s approval in writing.
     2.3.4.3. Installation SARCs, or the WG/CV if the SARC is unavailable, will coordinate
     all initial appointments of Alternate SARCs with the MAJCOM SARC, to include
     personal data and qualifications of the appointee.
  2.3.5. SARC duties and responsibilities. The primary focus of the SARC is on victims (see
  Attachment 1) of sexual assault.
     2.3.5.1. The SARC is responsible for ensuring a victim support system exists capable of
     responding to all reported sexual assaults, 24 hours a day-7 days a week, occurring on or
     off the installation within his or her area of responsibility to include geographically
     separated units (GSUs) attached to or supported by the installation. See paragraph
     2.3.5.8. detailing off-installation collaboration efforts.
         2.3.5.1.1. The SARC must provide clear, accurate information on the available
         avenues for reporting sexual assault throughout his or her area of responsibility.
         2.3.5.1.2. Where appropriate, memoranda of understanding (MOU) with other
         military installations may be used to ensure sexual assault response capability.
     2.3.5.2. Upon notification the SARC will, unless services are declined by the victim,
     assign a VA as soon as possible (see paragraph 2.5. for VA duties). The VA should not
     be from the same unit as the victim.
     2.3.5.3. The SARC is responsible for facilitating continuity of care and case management
     in the event the victim has a permanent change of station, is deployed or redeployed.
     Continuity of care and case management transfer is contingent upon victim’s
     concurrence. SARCs must counsel the victim and document the victim’s election. When
     a case transfer is authorized, the SARC will contact the SARC at the new location. For
     ANG, if the victim is returning to his or her ANG unit and concurs with case transfer,
     SARCs will contact the state Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) SARC who will
     coordinate transfer to the victim’s Wing SARC.
     2.3.5.4. Support services will continue until the victim indicates support is no longer
     required, or the SARC makes this determination based on the victim’s response to offers
     of assistance. The SARC will continue to monitor the victim’s health and well being
     through final disposition and/or resolution of the case.
     2.3.5.5. Transporting victims. WG/CVs are responsible for providing government
     transportation as required to transport victims to receive medical assistance following
     their initial call to report a sexual assault. The requirement includes transport to both on-
     and off-installation medical facilities as necessary for immediate medical attention and
     any follow-on forensic examination.
     2.3.5.6. As a key advisor for commanders, the SARC will:
         2.3.5.6.1. Assist commanders to meet annual SAPR training requirements, provide
         orientation briefings for newly assigned personnel, and help publicize available
         SAPR services. For more information on annual and other training requirements, see
         paragraphs 2.10 and 2.11.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                  13


        2.3.5.6.2. Provide information and statistical data to assist commanders and key
        leaders in promoting institutional and cultural change.
        2.3.5.6.3. Within 24 hours of a report of sexual assault, provide the WG/CV with
        non-identifying personal information of a restricted report, and a more thorough
        summary of any unrestricted report.
     2.3.5.7. Prevention is a full-time endeavor involving many individuals. Education,
     training, awareness, and community involvement make up the foundation of the SAPR
     Program’s prevention efforts. The SARC should:
        2.3.5.7.1. Establish and maintain a positive and proactive presence among Airmen on
        the installation. Consistently convey Wingman tenets, the need for Airmen to look
        out for one another, and to intervene in ways that impact the outcome positively.
        2.3.5.7.2. Establish and maintain a positive and proactive network in the surrounding
        community to increase awareness of trends, upcoming events, and potential changes
        in levels of safety. Communicate those findings with the installation population
        through leadership channels and public awareness campaigns, to include planning
        local events for Sexual Assault Awareness Month which is nationally observed
        during the month of April.
        2.3.5.7.3. Continue educating self and others on sexual assault trends, local and
        national initiatives, and ways to improve support to victims. Share this information
        with commanders and key leaders at appropriate venues such as staff meetings,
        conferences, and luncheons. Integrate findings with the installation’s Community
        Action Information Board (CAIB) programs and Integrated Delivery System (IDS).
        2.3.5.7.4. Ensure appropriate emphasis during potentially problematic periods such
        as holidays and 3-day weekends.
     2.3.5.8. Collaboration with off-installation service providers. The SARC, working with
     appropriate installation agencies, will pursue MOU with appropriate authorities and
     community service providers addressing the coordination of support and adequate
     standard of care for Air Force personnel who seek support off the installation. Such
     arrangements are beneficial in order to:
        2.3.5.8.1. Provide medical and counseling services related to care for victims of
        sexual assault that may not be available on their installation, but are available in the
        civilian community.
        2.3.5.8.2. Enhance the sharing of information concerning investigations, arrests, and
        prosecutions of reported sexual assault cases, as well as sexual assault care and
        forensic examinations involving military personnel.
        2.3.5.8.3. Enhance training through collaboration with local community crisis
        counseling centers.
     2.3.5.9. Collaboration with on-installation agencies, if available, is essential for sexual
     assault victim support.
        2.3.5.9.1. Medical Treatment Facilities. Establish procedures for notifying the
        SARC for all incidents of reported sexual assault. Provide training on the various
 14                               AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


            duties of Healthcare Personnel, SARCs, and VAs as they relate to supporting victims
            of sexual assault.
            2.3.5.9.2. Family Advocacy Program (FAP). SARCs who receive reports that
            involve domestic abuse will contact the Family Advocacy Officer (FAO) who will
            ensure an immediate assessment of the victim’s safety, determine eligibility for
            Domestic Violence Restricted Reporting, and coordinate victim advocacy services
            through the FAP. Normally, the FAO will assume the lead role in domestic violence
            cases involving sexual assault.
2.4. Installation SARC Administrative Assistants.
   2.4.1. Reporting directly to the installation SARC, the Administrative Assistant performs
   clerical duties to directly support the SARC and the installation’s SAPR program. Generally,
   as a minimum, they will:
   2.4.1.1. Complete VA training and be trained prior to being granted access to covered
   communications.
      2.4.1.2. Track services and training provided, maintain VA on-call schedule, record
      meeting minutes, provide administrative support for VAs, schedule SARC appointments
      and follow-ups, and perform other duties as required.
      2.4.1.3. Manage the program's budget to include Government Purchase Card
      management and purchasing.
      2.4.1.4. Use office automation software to produce a range of documents. Produce and
      distribute monthly and quarterly reports.
2.5. VAs.
   2.5.1. The VA provides essential support, liaison services and care to victims of sexual
   assault. The VA ensures victims continue to receive the necessary care and support until the
   victim states or SARC determines that support is no longer needed. The Air Force relies on
   volunteers to fill this critical function.
      2.5.1.1. Only active duty military personnel, Reserve or National Guard personnel in
      active status, and DoD civilian employees may serve as VAs. Reserve Personnel
      assigned to the MTF may serve as VAs only if they are assigned to a reserve medical
      squadron and have no patient-related duties. See paragraph 2.3.1.1. regarding conflicts of
      interest precluding some military members from serving as SARCs—these individuals
      are likewise precluded from serving as VAs. The SARC will determine if any VA has or
      develops a conflict of interest and will reassign accordingly.
            2.5.1.1.1. In order to ensure continuity of care for the Reserve Component, victim
            advocacy may continue through changes in duty status at the discretion of the
            victim’s Reserve or National Guard unit.
      2.5.1.2. Eligible personnel volunteer by submitting a Commander’s or Agency Head’s
      Statement of Understanding (Attachment 3), Volunteer’s Statement of Understanding
      (Attachment 4), and Volunteer Victim Advocate Application (Attachment 6) that will be
      used to facilitate the SARC’s interview with the prospective volunteer. By signing the
      volunteer application, the volunteer agrees to submit to a criminal background check.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                  15


      SARCs will submit the volunteer application to the AFOSI detachment that provides
      support to the installation for consideration of a background check, in accordance with
      AFOSI Manual 71-122, Criminal Investigations.
          2.5.1.2.1. Supervision. The SARC recruits, screens, interviews, selects, and
          supervises the installation VAs while they are providing support to sexual assault
          victims. When a VA is performing advocacy duties, he or she reports directly to the
          installation SARC; however, no change of rater is initiated.
          2.5.1.2.2. The SARC has sole discretion to decide whether an individual will serve or
          continue to serve as a VA.
          2.5.1.2.3. To the extent required to ensure sexual assault response capability at GSUs
          or deployed locations, military personnel may be detailed by the WG/CV or deployed
          commander to serve as VAs. Appointed individuals must meet experience or training
          requirements to perform VA duties.
      2.5.1.3. VAs’ responsibilities include providing crisis intervention, referral and ongoing
      non-clinical support, including providing information on available options and resources
      to assist the victim in making informed decisions about the case. VAs do not provide
      counseling or other professional services. See Attachment 5, Victim Advocate Sexual
      Assault Response Protocols Checklist.
      2.5.1.4. The assigned VA will meet with the victim as soon as possible and provide the
      victim information on the sexual assault response process, unrestricted reporting and the
      option of restricted reporting if not already accomplished by the SARC. The VA will
      inform the victim of the availability of healthcare to include the option of a forensic
      medical examination and the collection of evidence.
      2.5.1.5. VAs may accompany the victim, at the victim’s request, during investigative
      interviews and medical examinations, including, but not limited to interviews with
      medical personnel, law enforcement, investigators, trial counsel and defense counsel.
      However, VAs and the victims that they accompany must be made aware that the VA’s
      presence at an interview could later result in the VA being called as a witness in court-
      martial or administrative proceedings. VAs should also understand that the investigative
      interview process is controlled by the interviewing official. To the greatest extent
      possible, concerns about an interview should be resolved before or after the interview.
      2.5.1.6. Civilian VAs should have their supervisors document their volunteer status and
      duties in their personnel files consistent with current procedures managed by the Civilian
      Personnel Office.
2.6. Medical.
   2.6.1. Healthcare Providers must ensure that, at a minimum, the following medical care is
   made available to a victim (see Attachment 1) of sexual assault:
      2.6.1.1. Complete physical assessment, examination, and treatment of injuries including
      immediate life-saving interventions with follow-up and referral care as needed.
      2.6.1.2. Once clinically stable, Healthcare Providers shall consult with the victim
      regarding further healthcare options which shall include, but are not limited to:
 16                               AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


          2.6.1.2.1. Testing, prophylactic treatment options, and follow-up care for possible
          exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted
          infections or diseases.
          2.6.1.2.2. Assessment of the risk of pregnancy, options for emergency contraception,
          and any necessary follow-up care and/or referral services.
          2.6.1.2.3. Assessment of the need for behavioral health services and providing a
          referral, if necessary and/or requested by the victim.
      2.6.1.3. Healthcare Providers must advise the victim of the availability of an optional
      Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE). Healthcare Providers must maintain
      adequate supply of SAFE kits.
      2.6.1.4. The Medical Group Commander, or equivalent, must designate someone from
      the medical group to serve as the MTF’s primary point of contact (POC) on medical
      matters as they relate to DoD and AF SAPR policy.
2.7. Case Management Group.
   2.7.1. DoD Directive requires the establishment of a multi-disciplinary case management
   group, chaired by the SARC, to meet monthly to review unrestricted cases, improve
   reporting, facilitate monthly victim updates, and to discuss process improvement to ensure
   system accountability and victim access to quality services.
      2.7.1.1. For unrestricted cases, the case management group includes the SARC, VA,
      AFOSI, SF, Healthcare Provider, HC, JA and the reporting victim’s commander.
      2.7.1.2. For restricted cases, the group membership is limited to the SARC, assigned VA
      and Healthcare Provider.
   2.7.2. The case management group will review sexual assault trends for the area of
   responsibility, including environmental information provided to the WG/CV under restricted
   reporting. The group will provide a report to the WG/CV no less than quarterly, including
   recommendations.

         2.13.2.4. HQ USAF/A1 SAPR Program Manager will collect and compile the data for
         the restricted reports and prepare the quarterly report for submission to DoD by the
         required suspense.
         2.13.2.5. AFLOA/JAJM, in conjunction with SAF/IG, will collect and compile the data
         for the unrestricted reports and prepare the quarterly report in the format specified by
         DoD, and forward to the HQ USAF/A1 SAPR Program Manager for consolidation.
   2.13.3. Annual Reports will be accomplished as directed by DoD. HQ USAF/A1 SAPR
   Program Manager will notify all parties of the data requirements and suspense dates.

   protected in accordance with AFI 33-322, Records Management Program, and other
   guidance contained in this Instruction.
         2.13.5.1. SARC records will consist of information recorded for victim support and care,
         program operating and functioning, training, and other completed forms or notes required
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                      19


       for daily activities. Records may be either electronic or paper. Ensure electronic storage
       is password protected if on a shared drive.
       2.13.5.2. All SARC/VA records may be subject to review in legal proceedings.
       2.13.5.3. Victim care records may consist of restricted or unrestricted reports.
           2.13.5.3.1. Case files will be prepared and maintained for restricted and unrestricted
           reports based on victim’s reporting selection, provided the report is not covered under
           exceptions listed in this Instruction.
           2.13.5.3.2. All restricted reports will be assigned a Restricted Report Control
           Number (RRCN). The RRCN will be developed using a two-digit year, two-digit
           month, the first four letters of the installation name, a three-digit numerical sequence,
           and followed by the letter ―R‖. For example, ―0709RAND001R‖ represents the
           incident occurred in 2007, during September, at Randolph AFB, is the first report of
           this sequence, and is a restricted report.
           2.13.5.3.3. Restricted and unrestricted reports will be kept in a locked file cabinet
           when not in use. Restricted reports will only be available to SARCs, Alternate
           SARCs, VAs, or Healthcare Personnel trained in handling restricted reports and need
           access to the information to provide and manage services to a victim. Unrestricted
           reports will only be available to appropriate individuals with an official need to know.
           Those who have an official need to know in the Air Force routinely include law
           enforcement, the commanders and first sergeants of the victim and the alleged
           assailant, legal personnel, the SARC, the VA, and Healthcare Personnel as required to
           perform their respective duties.
           2.13.5.3.4. When receiving transferred cases from other installations, SARCs will
           create and maintain an appropriate record based on the type of report. For restricted
           reports, add a ―T‖ to the end of the RRCN and ensure transferred cases are not
           counted as new cases.

Section 2D—Finance and Logistics Considerations

2.14. Budget.
   2.14.1. Installation and MAJCOM SARCs must budget for prevention materials, office
   supplies, training, and travel (to include travel expenses related to the annual SARC
   Workshop noted in paragraph 2.8.2.).
   2.14.2. SARCs are encouraged to purchase small advertising/marketing materials and
   products (i.e., pens, stress balls, magnets, etc.) in support of outreach and awareness support
   programs. These expenditures are considered authorized as long as they comply with the
   micro-purchase threshold requirements of AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide
   Purchase Card (GPC) Program, paragraph 2.1.2.
2.15. Facilities.
   2.15.1. The SARC office should be in an easily accessible area of the installation while still
   providing for confidential visits.
   2.15.2. SARC facilities will present a professional setting and must include:
20                            AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


     2.15.2.1. Private consultation area to facilitate personal discussions without being
     overheard.
     2.15.2.2. Lockable working space that affords privacy to staff and victims. Also
     required are lockable filing cabinet(s) for securing victim case files (UNCLASSIFIED).
     2.15.2.3. Communication equipment and services that permit coverage 24 hours a day-7
     days a week, to include office telephones with instant long distance capability and
     government-funded cellular phones for emergency response/contact, computers,
     printer(s), fax, and copier.
        2.15.2.3.1. SARCs should ensure installation agencies, such as the Command Post
        and Installation Operators, add the SARC contact phone numbers to phone listings
        and/or rosters for emergency contact. SARCs and VAs should not provide victims
        with their personal home or personal cellular phone numbers.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                  21


                                           Chapter 3

                                  REPORTING OPTIONS

3.1. Restricted Reporting and Confidentiality.
   3.1.1. The Department of Defense and the Air Force are committed to ensuring that victims
   of sexual assault are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and provided support,
   advocacy and care. To achieve these objectives, we recommend prompt, complete,
   unrestricted reporting of sexual assault allegations to activate victim services and
   accountability responses.
   3.1.2. While the Air Force makes every effort to treat victims with respect and dignity, and
   to respect their privacy to the maximum extent of the law, commanders and leaders need to
   be aware of the concerns that may deter a victim from making an unrestricted report. The
   most common concerns are:
      3.1.2.1. Lack of privacy and confidentiality;
      3.1.2.2. Stigma and shame based on the nature of the crime;
      3.1.2.3. Fear of being reduced in the eyes of one’s commander or colleagues;
      3.1.2.4. Fear of disciplinary action due to possible own misconduct;
      3.1.2.5. Fear of re-victimization;
      3.1.2.6. Fear of operational impacts on training status, security clearance, and
      deployment; and
      3.1.2.7. Fear of adverse impact on the unit or mission.
   3.1.3. The Department of Defense has directed the implementation of confidentiality in the
   form of a restricted reporting option that enables military members to report allegations of
   sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an investigation. This reporting
   option is intended to remove barriers to medical care and support while giving the victim
   additional time and increased control over the release and management of personal
   information.
   3.1.4. Eligibility for Restricted Reporting. Sexual assault restricted reporting is available
   only to victims who are Service members and must concern a sexual assault made against
   them. Service member, for restricted reports, is defined to include:
      3.1.4.1. Air Force members on active duty;
      3.1.4.2. Members of the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard performing active
      or inactive duty training as defined in 10 United States Code 101(d)(3);
      3.1.4.3. Members of the Army, Navy or Marine Corps in comparable status to
      paragraphs 3.1.4.1. or 3.1.4.2;
      3.1.4.4. Members of the Coast Guard when operating as a service of the Department of
      the Navy; and
22                              AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


     3.1.4.5. A victim who was in a status described by paragraphs 3.1.4.1. through 3.1.4.4. at
     the time of the assault and who remains a member of the Air Reserve Component or its
     equivalent.
  3.1.5. Any individual who does not meet the requirements of paragraph 3.1.4. is not eligible
  to make restricted reports. These include:
     3.1.5.1. Retired members of any component;
     3.1.5.2. Military Family Members;
     3.1.5.3. DoD civilian employees; and
     3.1.5.4. Civilians.
  3.1.6. Allegations of assault that do not constitute sexual assault as defined in Attachment 1
  are not governed by this AFI.
     3.1.6.1. If a report contains an allegation of sexual assault and qualifies for restricted
     reporting, any other offenses revealed by the victim are considered covered
     communications and will not be disclosed except as authorized in paragraph 3.1.9.2. See
     paragraph 3.1.12. regarding limits to covered communications.
     3.1.6.2. Consult with the SJA as required for clarification and guidance concerning
     whether a report concerns an allegation of sexual assault.
  3.1.7. Who may receive a restricted report. Only SARCs, VAs, and Healthcare Personnel
  may receive restricted reports of sexual assault. The requirement of AFI 44-102, Medical
  Care Management, paragraph 17.4.1., to report incidents of sexual assault to the AFOSI or
  other authorities as appropriate is expressly waived for restricted reports.
     3.1.7.1. A VA who is contacted by a victim wishing to make a restricted report but who
     has not been assigned by the SARC to serve as the VA for that individual, will not enter
     into a discussion of the circumstances but will immediately refer the victim to the SARC.
     The VA is not required to report the initial contact to command or law enforcement
     officials.
     3.1.7.2. VAs must ensure they do not discuss covered communications with a victim
     until they have been appointed by the SARC to act as the VA for that individual.
     3.1.7.3. A report may be made to a chaplain; however, while communications with
     chaplains or other individuals may be entitled to privileged status under the Military
     Rules of Evidence (Mil.R.Evid) or other statutes and regulations, such communications
     are not restricted reports. Before such a communication can be considered a restricted
     report, it must be reported or forwarded to a SARC for determination of eligibility.
     3.1.7.4. If a victim tells Healthcare Personnel that a sexual assault has occurred, the
     Healthcare Personnel will notify the SARC. Per DoD 6025.18-R, ―DoD Health
     Information Privacy Regulation,‖ pertinent protected health information from the victim's
     medical records may be released to the SARC without the consent of the victim. Such
     release, however, requires appropriate accounting in accordance with Chapter 13 of the
     regulation.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                    23


  3.1.8. If a report is made to a SARC, VA, or Healthcare Personnel, and it cannot reasonably
  be ascertained whether the report is intended to be restricted, such a report (or visit to the
  MTF) will be treated as restricted, to the greatest extent possible, until the SARC can
  ascertain the victim’s eligibility and intentions.
  3.1.9. Effect of a Restricted Report. Failure to protect restricted reports and specified
  confidentiality is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ, for military members and AF civilian
  employees may be subject to administrative disciplinary action.
     3.1.9.1. A SARC, VA, or Healthcare Personnel who has received covered
     communications as part of a restricted report is prohibited from disclosing those
     communications to any law enforcement official, command authority, or other entity not
     authorized to receive restricted reports except as provided in paragraph 3.1.9.2.
     3.1.9.2. Disclosure of covered communications. Covered communications may only be
     disclosed under the following circumstances:
         3.1.9.2.1. To command and law enforcement when disclosure is authorized by the
         victim in writing;
         3.1.9.2.2. To command and law enforcement when disclosure is necessary to prevent
         or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the victim or another
         person;
         3.1.9.2.3. To Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a
         Healthcare Personnel is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement
         determinations;
         3.1.9.2.4. To a SARC, VA, or Healthcare Personnel when disclosure is required for
         the supervision and/or coordination of direct victim treatment or services;
         3.1.9.2.5. To a military or civilian court of competent jurisdiction when disclosure is
         ordered by a Military, Federal, or State judge; or
         3.1.9.2.6. To officials or entities as required by a Federal or State statute or
         applicable U.S. international agreement.
     3.1.9.3. With the exception of paragraph 3.1.9.2.1., disclosure will be limited to only the
     information necessary to satisfy the basis for disclosure.
     3.1.9.4. The SARC will make the determination as to whether disclosure is appropriate.
     The SARC may consult their MAJCOM SARC for guidance as to whether disclosure is
     appropriate under this policy. If disclosure is contemplated under other than paragraph
     3.1.9.2.1., the SARC should consult with the servicing SJA, using non-identifying
     personal information, to determine whether the exception applies. When there is
     uncertainty or disagreement on whether disclosure is appropriate, the matter shall be
     brought to the attention of the WG/CV for decision.
         3.1.9.4.1. Until those determinations are made, only non-identifying information
         should be provided to individuals not authorized to receive covered communications.
     3.1.9.5. Medical records related to a restricted report must be kept so as to ensure that the
     existence of a restricted report or the contents of covered communications are not
     disclosed to unauthorized personnel. HQ USAF/SG will issue guidance.
24                               AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


     3.1.9.6. Unauthorized disclosure of a covered communication, improper release of
     medical information, and other violations of this AFI may result in administrative action,
     including loss of medical credentials, or action under the UCMJ.
         3.1.9.6.1. If a VA, or Healthcare Personnel makes an inadvertent, unauthorized
         disclosure of a covered communication, the SARC will be notified. The SARC will
         notify the victim of the inadvertent disclosure and review the process or circumstance
         that led to the unauthorized disclosure. As noted above, the unauthorized disclosure
         of a covered communication may result in disciplinary action.
     3.1.9.7. Healthcare Personnel may also convey to command any possible adverse duty
     impact related to the victim’s medical condition and prognosis in accordance with DoD
     6025.18-R, as well as any applicable Air Force Instructions. Such circumstances,
     however, do not otherwise warrant an exception to this policy and, therefore, the covered
     communication related to the sexual assault may not be disclosed. Any disclosure by
     Healthcare Personnel made under this provision should include only the minimum
     necessary relevant information regarding the medical situation and should not disclose
     any covered communication.
         3.1.9.7.1. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). Victims on PRP status are not
         disqualified from making a restricted report. Only medical information regarding the
         condition and/or treatment is releasable to commanders under PRP. The MTF is
         obligated to protect the underlying cause (sexual assault) as covered communication
         incident to a restricted report.
         3.1.9.7.2. Line of Duty Determination. Healthcare Provider, SARCs, and VAs
         should be aware that a line of duty determination may be required IAW AFI 36-2910,
         Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination. See paragraph 6.6.2 of this Instruction and
         AFI 36-2910 for further guidance.
     3.1.9.8. Independent Reports. In the event that information about a sexual assault is
     disclosed to command from a source independent of restricted reporting avenues or to
     law enforcement from other sources, and an investigation into an allegation of sexual
     assault is initiated, the SARC, VA, and Healthcare Personnel will not disclose covered
     communications, including the existence of a restricted report or prior contact with the
     victim, unless the victim authorizes the disclosure in writing or another exception applies.
         3.1.9.8.1. When the SARC or VA learns that an official investigation has been
         initiated based on independently-acquired information, the SARC should notify the
         victim as soon as possible.
         3.1.9.8.2. SARCs and VAs should also notify victims that any disclosure of
         information about their sexual assault to individuals other than the SARC, VA or
         Healthcare Personnel may result in the initiation of an official investigation regarding
         the allegations that the victim disclosed.
     3.1.9.9. The victim will acknowledge his or her understanding of the restricted reporting
     process; i.e., that restricted reporting necessarily limits, in an effort to protect the victim’s
     privacy, the ability of the Air Force to investigate and take action. Victims should be
     made aware of protections available when making unrestricted reports. Use DD Form
     2910; see paragraph 3.1.8. for incidents where a victim may not be in a condition to make
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                    25


     an election; see paragraph 3.2.2. for incidents where a victim refuses to complete the DD
     Form 2910.
  3.1.10. Notification to Command of a Restricted Report. Within 24 hours of receipt of a
  restricted report of an alleged sexual assault, the SARC will notify the WG/CV that a
  restricted report has been made.
     3.1.10.1. The SARC will only provide the following information while ensuring that the
     information is not sufficient to identify the victim or incident:
         3.1.10.1.1. When the assault occurred, using one of the following three categories:
             3.1.10.1.1.1. While the victim was in military service and within the last 30 days;
             3.1.10.1.1.2. While the victim was in military service and more than 30 days ago;
             or
             3.1.10.1.1.3. Prior to military service.
         3.1.10.1.2. Whether the assault occurred during the night (1800 – 0559) or day (0600
         – 1759);
         3.1.10.1.3. General information as to location (on or off installation);
         3.1.10.1.4. Number of alleged assailants;
         3.1.10.1.5. Number of alleged victims; and
         3.1.10.1.6. Nature of assault (rape, forcible sodomy, indecent assault, etc.).
     3.1.10.2. Non-identifying information under the restricted reporting option is intended to
     provide commanders with general environmental information about the number and types
     of sexual assaults on the installation and is to be used to provide a better understanding of
     incidents of sexual assault. Neither commanders nor law enforcement officials may
     initiate investigations based on information about restricted reports provided by SARCs.
     3.1.10.3. Commanders, however, may use the information to enhance preventive
     measures, to enhance the education and training of their personnel, and to more closely
     scrutinize their organization’s climate and culture for contributing factors, but they may
     not use the information for investigative purposes or in a manner that is likely to
     discover, disclose, or reveal the identities being protected.
  3.1.11. The restricted reporting process does not affect any privilege recognized under the
  Mil.R.Evid.
  3.1.12. The confidentiality policy does not create an actionable right in the alleged assailant
  or the victim and does not constitute a grant of immunity for any actionable conduct by the
  assailant or victim. Any covered communication that has been disclosed, whether disclosure
  was authorized or unauthorized, may be used as the basis for disciplinary action against the
  assailant or victim as appropriate. However, disposition authorities should take these
  circumstances into account in determining what, if any, action may be appropriate regarding
  the victim.

3.2. Unrestricted Reporting. Any report of a sexual assault made through normal reporting
channels, including the victim’s chain of command, law enforcement, and the AFOSI or other
criminal investigative service is considered an unrestricted report. Any report of sexual assault
made through SARC, VA, or Healthcare Personnel by individuals who are not eligible for
restricted reporting will be treated as an unrestricted report and forwarded to the AFOSI.
   3.2.1. The individual to whom the report was made will notify the SARC who will assign a
   VA to the individual.
   3.2.2. Victims who are eligible for and elect restricted reporting must do so using the DD
   Form 2910. If a victim refuses to complete the DD Form 2910, the SARC will consult with
   the Health Care Provider to ascertain the victim’s capacity for making the decision. The
   Health Care Provider may advise a reasonable delay to ensure the victim’s capacity to
   respond. If after consultation the SARC and the Health Care Provider determine the victim is
   stable enough or capable enough of personal judgment to make a decision and the victim still
   refuses to complete the DD Form 2910, the SARC will advise the victim that the report will
   be registered unrestricted and the AFOSI will be notified. If the SARC has concerns or
   discovers that fear of an alleged offender’s retaliation or reprisal may be influencing the
   decision of the victim, the SARC should consult with the local SJA with the case presented
   as a hypothetical situation. Depending on the circumstances presented, the SARC may refer
   to exceptions to restricted reporting identified in 3.1.9.2.
       3.2.2.1. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) This guidance establishes the procedural
       process for Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) unrestricted sexual assault forensic exam
       referrals, should the active duty victim choose to have an exam conducted, as of 11
       October 2007.
3.3. Nonmilitary Victims Under the Age of 18.
   3.3.1. Victims who qualify as dependents, other than spouses of military members, or who
   are otherwise entitled to DoD medical care, will be referred to the FAO.
   3.3.2. Victims who are not dependents will be referred to the appropriate civilian agency.
   The SARC and FAO will coordinate as to the appropriate referral and will ensure procedures
   are in place to address this contingency.
3.4. (Added-MOUNTAINHOMEAFB) Policy and Procedures for Victim Consent of
Forensic Exam:

                                          Chapter 4

      PREVENTION AND RESPONSE FOR THE DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT

4.1. Presence in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). The Air Force will identify trained
military SARCs (and/or trained civilian SARCs who volunteer) for Air Expeditionary Force
(AEF) rotational support for global contingency operations consistent with requirements
established by a Commander of Air Force forces (COMAFFOR). Normally, each Air
Expeditionary Wing (AEW) will warrant at least one SARC requirement. For deployments
smaller than an AEF, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault response capability
consistent with the requirements of this AFI.
   4.1.1. For emerging operations, when practicable, the Air Component A1 should coordinate
   development of any SARC requirements with the SARC Functional Area Manager (FAM) at
   AFPC/DPSIAP. The Air Component A1 and the FAM should keep in mind the
   COMAFFOR’s responsibility to ensure theater-wide support to Airmen in smaller units at
   potentially isolated sites, and determine if central or regional management can be effective.
   4.1.2. During transition to sustained operations, the Air Component A1 planner must
   account for future rotations and coordinate those requirements with the SARC FAM. Ensure
   line remarks and overlap considerations are reviewed to ensure seamless exchange between
   outgoing and incoming SARCs.
   4.1.3. For sustained operations, the Air Component A1 provides the functional oversight to
   ensure a continued response capability exists to support their AOR. This includes, but is not
   limited to:
      4.1.3.1. Designating locations that require a SARC, and ensuring that those locations are
      sufficient to support the AOR throughout mission fluctuations.
      4.1.3.2. Identifying VAs in theater and resolving with local commanders any gaps in this
      critical element of support.
      4.1.3.3. Coordinating with SARC FAM and HQ USAF/A1 SAPR Program Manager on
      all issues needing resolution.
4.2. Training. Home station unit commanders must ensure Service members are trained on
sexual assault issues prior to any deployment. The SARC assists commanders with this
responsibility and coordinates these efforts with the Personnel Readiness Function (PRF).

                                           Chapter 5

                 COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE

5.1. Collection and Proper Handling of Evidence.
   5.1.1. In accordance with AFOSI Manual 71-124, Crime Scene Handbook, AFOSI is
   designated as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for evidence collection during
   sexual assault investigations.
   5.1.2. Medical services offered to victims of sexual assault include the ability to request a
   sexual assault forensic examination (SAFE). The SAFE is an examination of a sexual assault
   victim by Healthcare Personnel who, ideally, have specialized education and clinical
   experience in the collection of forensic evidence and treatment of sexual assault victims.
5.2. Collection and Preservation of Evidence in Restricted Reports.
   5.2.1. SARCs or VAs have no responsibility for the collection of evidence when a restricted
   report is made. SARCs or VAs will not collect or receive evidence of a sexual assault from a
   victim.
   5.2.2. When the SARC receives a restricted report of a sexual assault, the SARC or VA will
   inform the victim of the option of a SAFE and of any state or local sexual assault reporting
   requirements that may affect restricted reporting.
   5.2.3. SAFEs conducted at the MTF will be performed in accordance with the current
   version of the United States Department of Justice National Protocol for Sexual Assault
   Medical Forensic Examinations.
   5.2.4. Installations that do not have a SAFE capability are responsible for transporting the
   victim to a military facility or an off-installation, non-military facility that has a SAFE
   capability. If off-installation, non-military facilities are used, MOUs should be completed
   establishing procedures for conducting SAFEs.
   5.2.5. If a SAFE is completed, the SARC or VA will assign a unique Restricted Report
   Control Number (RRCN) in accordance with paragraph 2.13.5.3.2., to be used in lieu of
   personal identifying information. Upon completion of the SAFE, the Health Care Provider
   will package, seal, and label the evidence containers with the RRCN.
   5.2.6. The local AFOSI detachment responsible for taking custody of the evidence from the
   Health Care Provider will log, store and preserve the SAFE in accordance with AFOSI
   procedures, for a period of at least one year.
   5.2.7. If, prior to the one-year anniversary date, a victim changes the reporting preference to
   an unrestricted report, the SARC shall notify the AFOSI, who shall then process the SAFE as
   evidence in accordance with AFOSI procedures.
   5.2.8. AFOSI will notify SARCs 30 days prior to the expiration of the one-year evidence
   storage period. The SARC or VA will then notify the victim of the upcoming anniversary
   and that the evidence will be destroyed unless the victim decides to make an unrestricted
   report.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                               31


  5.2.9. The SARC will notify the AFOSI to destroy the SAFE kit after the one-year
  anniversary date if:
     5.2.9.1. The victim does not elect to make an unrestricted report;
     5.2.9.2. The victim does not request the return of any personal effects or clothing
     maintained in the SAFE;
     5.2.9.3. The victim does not advise the SARC of his or her decision after being notified
     of the upcoming one-year anniversary; or
     5.2.9.4. The victim cannot be located.
  5.2.10. The SARC will appropriately document the efforts to obtain a decision from the
  victim or efforts to locate the victim. The SARC is authorized to complete any
  documentation required from AFOSI for destruction on behalf of the victim.

                                          Chapter 6

            COMMAND ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL ASSAULT

6.1. Commander’s Response to Allegations of Sexual Assault.
   6.1.1. Commanders notified of a sexual assault must take immediate steps to ensure the
   victim’s physical safety, emotional security, and medical treatment needs are met, and that
   the AFOSI or appropriate criminal investigative agency and SARC are notified. The
   appropriate commanders should determine whether temporary reassignment or relocation of
   the victim or alleged assailant is appropriate.
   6.1.2. Commanders should consider whether no contact orders or Military Protective Orders
   (DD Form 2873) are required. See Attachment 2 for a checklist of other important
   considerations for commanders.
6.2. Keeping the Victim Informed and Use of Information.
   6.2.1. The victim’s unit commander is responsible for ensuring the victim receives, at a
   minimum, a monthly update on the current status of all investigative, medical, legal, and
   command proceedings pertaining to the unrestricted case, until final disposition of the sexual
   assault case. Information provided will be consistent with any applicable directives
   governing release of information and should be coordinated with the SARC to ensure the
   victim’s case file is updated.
      6.2.1.1. For purposes of this Instruction, final disposition means the conclusion of the
      latter of any judicial, nonjudicial, or administrative action (including administrative
      separation actions) taken in response to the allegation of sexual assault. These
      requirements are independent of other requirements of notification established by law or
      regulation.
   6.2.2. In unrestricted reports of sexual assault or in cases in which information is disclosed
   through an independent source, details of the allegation will be provided only to those
   personnel who have an official need to know.
      6.2.2.1. Commanders should examine all procedures involved in the use of sexual assault
      information to ensure that the goals of this AFI are met.
      6.2.2.2. All disclosures must comply with the provisions of AFI 33-332, Privacy Act
      Program.
6.3. Victim Collateral Misconduct.
   6.3.1. An investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual
   assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged in misconduct.
   6.3.2. In accordance with the UCMJ, the Manual for Courts-Martial, and Air Force
   Instructions, commanders are responsible for addressing misconduct in a manner that is
   consistent and appropriate to the circumstances.
   6.3.3. Commanders have the authority to determine the appropriate disposition of alleged
   victim misconduct, to include deferring disciplinary action until after disposition of the
   sexual assault case. When considering what corrective actions may be appropriate,
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                     33


   commanders must balance the objectives of holding members accountable for their own
   misconduct with the intent to avoid unnecessary additional trauma to sexual assault victims
   and the goal of encouraging reporting of sexual assaults. The gravity of any collateral
   misconduct by the victim, and its impact on good order and discipline, should be carefully
   considered in deciding what, if any, corrective action is appropriate. Commanders should
   consult with the servicing SJA prior to taking any action regarding collateral misconduct.
6.4. Sexual Assault Case Disposition Authority.
   6.4.1. Disposition of investigations involving allegations of sexual assault is a responsibility
   of command. In accordance with the Manual for Courts-Martial, reports of investigations
   will normally be forwarded as soon as practicable to the immediate commander of the
   alleged assailant for appropriate action.
      6.4.1.1. Authority to dispose of cases resulting from an allegation of sexual assault is
      withheld from squadron section commanders and is reserved for commanders of
      squadrons and above. Further, to ensure consistent and appropriate level of command
      attention, group commanders or higher will sign the commander's report of disposition to
      the investigating agency detailing the action taken. Any commander authorized to
      dispose of cases involving an allegation of sexual assault may do so only after receiving
      the advice of the servicing SJA.
   6.4.2. Failure to comply with this disposition policy does not create any independent rights
   in an individual who has made an allegation of sexual assault or an individual who is accused
   of committing a sexual assault.
6.5. Separation Actions Involving Victims of Sexual Assault.
   6.5.1. Separation actions involving victims of sexual assaults will be processed in
   accordance with the applicable AFI.
   6.5.2. When a commander recommending administrative or medical separation action is
   aware, or is made aware by the respondent or others, that the respondent is alleging or has
   alleged that he or she was the victim of a sexual assault, the commander shall notify the
   separation authority that the discharge proceeding involves a victim of sexual assault.
      6.5.2.1. The following statement should be included in the recommendation for
      discharge memorandum: ―The respondent, (grade and name), reported being a past victim
      of sexual assault.‖
      6.5.2.2. The commander recommending administrative or medical separation must
      provide sufficient information to the separation authority concerning the alleged assault
      and the respondent’s status to ensure a full and fair consideration of the victim’s military
      service and particular situation. Commanders should consult with AFOSI and the
      servicing SJA for guidance on the level of information that may be applicable.
6.6. Personnel Actions.
   6.6.1. Commanders, SARCs, and VAs should be aware of the array of personnel actions that
   are available and may be appropriate in specific cases. These actions may include, among
   others, alternative duty locations, hours, or assignments within a unit, permanent change of
   assignment on the installation, and permanent change of station, including humanitarian
 34                               AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


   reassignment. Consult with the Military Personnel Element and applicable AFIs for guidance
   and eligibility criteria.
   6.6.2. Commanders, Healthcare Providers, SARCs, and VAs should be aware that a line of
   duty determination may be required IAW AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct)
   Determination.
       6.6.2.1. A Line of Duty (LOD) determination is an administrative tool for determining a
       member's duty status at the time an injury, illness, disability, or death is incurred. On the
       basis of the LOD determination, the member may be entitled to benefits administered by
       the Air Force or exposed to liabilities. The key is the nexus between the injury, illness,
       disability, or death and the member's duty status.
       6.6.2.2. A Line of Duty (LOD) determination is required to ensure that Air National
       Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel are able to access medical treatment and
       counseling for injuries and illness incurred from a sexual assault inflicted upon a Service
       member while in a status where the member is eligible to make a restricted report.
       Specific procedures for initiating a LOD in connection with a restricted report of sexual
       assault are contained in AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination. For
       LOD purposes, the victim will provide documentation to the SARC that substantiates the
       victim's duty status. The SARC will provide that documentation along with a copy of the
       DD 2910 wherein the victim has chosen restricted reporting to the LOD processing
       official.
       6.6.2.3. The policy modifying the LOD process for restricted reporting does not extend
       to pay and allowances or travel and transportation incident to the healthcare entitlement.
       However, at any time the victim may request an unrestricted LOD to be completed in
       order to receive the full range of entitlements authorized under DoD Instruction 1241.2
       and AFI 36-2910.
6.7. Coercion, Discrimination, or Reprisals. WG/CCs must establish procedures to protect
SARCs, Alternate SARCs, and VAs from coercion, discrimination, or reprisals related to their
execution of their SAPR duties and responsibilities.

AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                        39


victim to the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), Victim Advocate (VA), or
Healthcare Personnel related to his or her sexual assault.
Final Disposition—The conclusion of any command action, including judicial, nonjudicial, and
administrative action, to include separation action taken in response to the offense, whichever is
later in time, or a no action determination.
First Responders—Individuals from functional communities who are normally the first to
respond to a sexual assault or are involved in the investigation and disposition of a sexual assault
allegation. For the purposes of this AFI they include: SARCs, Victim Advocates (VAs),
Security Forces, AFOSI, and Healthcare Personnel. The SARC should establish a Sexual
Assault Response Team (SART) comprised of certain First Responders, to ensure efficient and
timely integrated response to sexual assault victims.
Healthcare Personnel— This term applies to all healthcare providers who are employed or
assigned as healthcare professionals, or are credentialed to provide healthcare services at a
medical or dental treatment facility or who are providing such care elsewhere at a deployed
location or otherwise in an official capacity. The term also includes individuals assigned to the
Military Treatment Facility (MTF) who are directed by or assigned to assist or otherwise support
healthcare professionals in providing healthcare services (e.g., administrative personnel assigned
to an MTF).
Healthcare Provider— This term applies to those individuals who are employed or assigned as
healthcare professionals, or are credentialed to provide health care services, at a military medical
or military dental treatment facility, or who provide such care at a deployed location or in an
official capacity. This also includes military personnel, DoD civilian employees, and DoD
contractors who provide health care at an occupational health clinic for DoD civilian employees
or DoD contractor personnel.
Identifying Personal Information—This term applies to the alleged victim or alleged assailant
in a sexual assault and is that information which would disclose or have a tendency to disclose
the person’s identity. Identifying personal information includes the person’s name or a
particularly identifying description (e.g., physical characteristics or identity by position, rank, or
organization) or other information about the person or the facts and circumstances involved that
could reasonably be understood to identify the person (e.g., a female in a particular squadron or
barracks when there is only one female assigned).
Non—identifying Personal Information—Includes those facts and circumstances surrounding
the sexual assault incident or information about the individual that enables the identity of the
victim or alleged assailant to remain anonymous.
Other Sex Related Offenses—All other sexual acts or acts in violation of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice that do not meet the definition of sexual assault in this Instruction or the

Reprisal—Taking or threatening to take an unfavorable personnel action, or withholding or
threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action, or any other act of retaliation against a DoD
member for making, preparing, or receiving a covered communication.
Restricted Reporting—A process used by a Service member to report or disclose that he or she
is the victim of a sexual assault to specified officials on a requested confidential basis. Under
these circumstances, the victim’s report and any details provided to the SARC, Healthcare
Personnel, or a VA will not be reported to law enforcement to initiate an official investigation
unless the victim consents or an established exception is exercised under DoDD 6495.01.
Sexual Assault—The following definition of sexual assault has been directed by DoD and is for
training and educational purposes only. This definition does not affect in any way the definition
of any offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Commanders are encouraged to
consult with their Staff Judge Advocate for complete understanding of this definition in relation
to the UCMJ.
Sexual Assault is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by use of force, threats,
intimidation, abuse of authority, or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault
includes rape, forcible sodomy (oral or anal sex), and other unwanted sexual contact that is
aggravated, abusive, or wrongful (to include unwanted and inappropriate sexual contact), or
attempts to commit these acts.


―Consent‖ means words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual conduct at
issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means
there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the
accused’s use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute
consent. A current or previous dating relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person
involved with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent.
Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC)—An Air Force civilian employee or Air Force
officer reporting to the Wing Vice Commander (WG/CV) who serves as the commander’s
central point of contact at installation level or within a geographic area to ensure appropriate care
is coordinated and provided to victims of sexual assault and tracks the services provided to a
victim from the initial report through final disposition and resolution.                Ensures the
implementation of prevention programs, to include sexual assault awareness, prevention and
response training.
Unrestricted Reporting—A process a Service member uses to disclose, without requesting
confidentiality or restricted reporting, that he or she is the victim of a sexual assault. Under these
circumstances, the victim’s report and any details provided to the SARC, Healthcare Personnel, a
VA, command authorities, or other persons are reportable to law enforcement and may be used
to initiate the official investigation process.
Victim—For the purpose of this Instruction, a victim is a person who alleges direct physical,
emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the commission of a sexual assault and who has a
connection with the installation. If the victim is incompetent or incapacitated, the term ―victim‖
includes one of the following (in order of preference): spouse, legal guardian, parent, child,
sibling, another family member, or another person designated by a court. Victims will be eligible
for and provided services by the Air Force consistent with their legal status. The services
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                      41


contemplated range from referral to the appropriate civilian or foreign agency to the provision of
all services available to an active duty member. Nothing in this policy shall be constructed to
authorize or require the provision of specific services (such as medical care or therapeutic
counseling) unless the victim has an independent entitlement to such services under relevant
statutes or Department of Defense directives. The restricted reporting option is only available to
those sexual assault victims who are service members.
Victim Advocate (VA)—Military and DoD civilian employee volunteers, selected and trained
by the SARC, who provide essential support, liaison services and care to victims.
Victim and Witness Assistance Program (VWAP)—The program to mitigate the physical,
psychological, and financial hardships suffered by victims and witnesses of offenses investigated
by U.S. Air Force authorities; foster cooperation between victims, witnesses, and the military
justice system; and ensure best efforts are extended to protect the rights of victims and witnesses.
WG/CV—Wing Vice Commander, or for the purposes of this AFI, the civilian equivalent where
no military vice is present. This term is used throughout this AFI and in each case it will
represent the level of authority directly subordinate to the installation Wing Commander,
responsible as the vice or deputy. This does not include Directors of Staff or other staff officers
in wings or similar organizations.

      COMMANDER’S CHECKLIST FOR UNRESTRICTED REPORTS OF SEXUAL
                              ASSAULT


                                  VICTIM’S COMMANDER
( ) Ensure the physical safety of the victim--determine if the alleged assailant is still nearby
and if the victim desires or needs protection.
( ) Determine if the victim desires or needs any emergency medical care.
( ) Ensure the SARC is notified immediately.
( ) Notify the Military Criminal Investigation Organization (MCIO) concerned as soon as the
victim’s immediate safety is assured, and medical treatment procedures elected by the victim are
initiated.
       ( ) To the extent practicable, strictly limit knowledge of the facts or details regarding the
incident to only those personnel who have an official need to know.
        ( ) Take action to safeguard the victim from any formal or informal investigative
interviews or inquiries, except those conducted by authorities who have an official need to know.
( ) Collect only the necessary information (e.g., victim’s identity, location, and time of the
incident, name and/or description of assailant(s)). DO NOT ASK DETAILED QUESTIONS
AND/OR PRESSURE THE VICTIM FOR RESPONSES OR INFORMATION ABOUT THE
INCIDENT.
( ) Advise the victim of the need to preserve evidence (by not bathing, showering, having
anything by mouth, voiding bladder, or washing garments) while waiting for the arrival of
representatives of the military criminal investigative organization.
( ) If needed, assist with or provide immediate transportation for the victim to the hospital or
other appropriate medical treatment facility.
( ) Ensure the victim understands the availability of victim advocacy and the benefits of
accepting advocacy and support.
( ) Ask if the victim needs a support person, can be a personal friend or family member, to
immediately join him or her. Be sure to advise the victim this support person could later be
called to testify as a witness if the case goes to trial.
( ) Ask if the victim would like a chaplain to be notified and notify accordingly.
( ) Throughout the investigation, consult with the victim, listen/engage in quiet support, and as
needed, and provide the victim appropriate emotional support resources. To the extent
practicable, accommodate the victim’s desires regarding safety, health, and security, as long as
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                          43


neither a critical mission nor a full and complete investigation is compromised.
( ) Continue to monitor the victim’s well-being, particularly if there are any indications of
suicidal ideation, and ensure appropriate intervention occurs as needed.
        ( ) If needed, confer with victim’s Healthcare Provider and consider the need for
convalescent leave or other administrative leave options as Military Service policy permits.
        ( ) Determine if the victim desires or needs a ―no contact’ order or a DD Form 2873,
―Military Protective Order (MPO),‖ to be issued, particularly if the victim and the alleged
assailant are assigned to the same command, unit, duty location, or living quarters. Coordination
with other commanders may be necessary if the alleged assailant is assigned to a different
commander.
        ( ) Determine the need for temporary reassignment to another unit, duty location, or
living quarters on the installation of the victim or the alleged assailant being investigated,
working with the alleged assailant’s commander if different than the victim’s commander, until
there is a final legal disposition of the sexual assault allegation, and/or the victim is no longer in
danger. To the extent practicable, consider the desires of the victim when making any
reassignment determinations.
       ( ) Ensure the victim understands the availability of other referral organizations staffed
with personnel who can explain the medical, investigative, and legal processes and advise the
victim of his or her victim support rights.
       ( ) Emphasize to the victim the availability of additional avenues of support; refer to
available counseling groups and other victim services.
       ( ) Attend the monthly case management meeting as appropriate.
        ( ) Ensure the victim receives monthly reports regarding the status of the sexual assault
investigation from the date the investigation was initiated until there is a final disposition of the
case.
( ) Consult with servicing SJA as needed, to determine when and how best to dispose of the
victim’s collateral misconduct, if any.
        ( ) Absent extenuating or overriding considerations which, in the commander’s judgment,
make it inappropriate to delay taking action, the commander should consider deferring discipline
for such victim misconduct until all investigations are completed and the sexual assault
allegation has been resolved. Keep in mind the implications of this decision on speedy trial
and/or statute of limitations.
      ( ) When practicable, consult with the servicing SJA, MCIO, and notify the assigned
VA or SARC prior to taking any administrative or disciplinary action affecting the victim.
( ) Avoid automatic suspension or revocation of a security clearance and/or Personnel Reliability
Program (PRP) access, understanding that the victim may be satisfactorily treated for his/her
 44                                AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


related trauma without compromising his/her security clearance or PRP status. Consider the
negative impact that suspension of a victim’s security clearance or PRP may have on building a
climate of trust and confidence in the Military Service’s sexual assault reporting system, but
make final determination based upon established national security standards. (See DoD 5210.42-
R, Chapter 5 for specific requirements.)




ALLEGED ASSAILANT’S COMMANDER
( ) Notify the appropriate MCIO as soon as possible after receiving a report of a sexual assault
incident.
( ) Avoid questioning about the sexual assault allegation with the alleged assailant to the extent
possible, since doing so may jeopardize the criminal investigation.
        ( ) Any contact with a Service member suspected of an offense under the UCMJ may
involve rules and procedures that ensure due process of law and are unique to the military
criminal justice system. Therefore, before questioning or discussing the case with the alleged
assailant, commanders and other command representatives should first contact the servicing SJA
for guidance.
      ( ) However, if questioning does occur, advise the Service member suspected of
committing a UCMJ offense of his or her rights under Article 31, UCMJ.
( ) Safeguard the alleged assailant’s rights and preserve the integrity of a full and complete
investigation, to include limitations on any formal or informal investigative interviews or
inquiries by personnel other than those by personnel with an official need to know.
( ) Strictly limit information pertinent to an investigation to those who have an official need to
know.
( ) Ensure procedures are in place to inform the alleged assailant as appropriate, about
the investigative and legal processes that may be involved.
( ) Ensure procedures are in place to inform the alleged assailant about available
counseling support. As appropriate, refer the alleged assailant to available counseling
groups and other services.
( ) With the benefit of the SARC, VA, legal, and/or investigative advice, determine the need for a
―no contact‖ order or the issuance of an MPO, DD Form 2873.
( ) Monitor the well-being of the alleged assailant, particularly for any indications of suicide
ideation, and ensure appropriate intervention occurs if indicated.
AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010                                                     45


 UNIT COMMANDER OF VICTIM AND/OR ALLEGED ASSAILANT PREVENTION
( ) Establish a command climate of prevention that is predicated on mutual respect and trust; that
recognizes and embraces diversity; and that values the contributions of all its members.
( ) Emphasize that sexual assault violates the core values of what being a professional in the
Armed Forces is all about and is something that ultimately destroys unit cohesion and the trust
that is essential for mission success.
( ) Emphasize DoD and Military Service policies on sexual assault and the potential legal
consequences for those who commit such crimes.
( ) Keep a ―finger on the pulse‖ of the organization’s climate and respond with appropriate action
toward any negative trends that may emerge.

 IN THE EVENT OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT
( ) Discourage members from participating in ―barracks gossip‖ or grapevine speculation about
the case or investigation. Remind everyone to wait until all the facts are known and final
disposition of the allegation has occurred before reaching conclusions.
( ) Remind members that discussion of a possible sexual assault incident might compromise an
ensuing investigation.
( ) Emphasize that the alleged assailant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
( ) Advise those who may have knowledge of the events leading up to or surrounding the
incident to fully cooperate with any investigation involved.
( ) Consider some form of unit refresher training or have an outside expert address the unit
regarding preventive measures as well as some of the emotional or psychological feelings that
may manifest themselves, affect the unit, and require the unit’s response during the course of the
investigation.
( ) Continuously monitor the unit’s overall climate to ensure neither the victim and/or the
alleged assailant is being ostracized and prevent organizational splintering.

      COMMANDER’S OR AGENCY HEAD’S STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING

VICTIM ADVOCATE VOLUNTEER

1.      I know _________________________________ has volunteered to serve as a victim
advocate (VA).
2.      The Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) has briefed me on the roles and
responsibilities of a VA.
3.      I understand the VA position may involve or require a significant amount of time for
training and performance of VA duties when assigned to a victim. These duties may include
accompanying a victim to various referral appointments, interviews, and judicial proceedings.
This time will be in addition to regular duties, and may occur after normal duty hours.
4.      I understand a VA will be periodically on call to perform VA duties. While on call, the
VA must be available to respond within a reasonable period of the notification to report.
5.      I understand that while a VA is performing duties as a victim advocate, the VA reports
directly to the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC).
6.      I understand I will be informed of any absences from the work center as soon as possible,
and if the mission dictates the VA must report to work for normal duty hours they will be given
compensatory time as soon as possible after the event.
7.      I and the supervisor will not interfere with, or otherwise attempt to negatively influence, a
VA’s sexual assault victim advocacy duties. If there is a conflict between a VA’s primary duty
and advocacy responsibilities, the SARC and I will discuss to resolve the conflict.
8.      I will advise the SARC if my volunteer develops any negative quality indicators, and will
discuss options regarding continued service as a VA.
9.      I understand the VA will not report any details of the case to me nor will I ask them for
any details.
10.     If I should encounter any problems or concerns, I will contact the SARC or the VA
Coordinator.
11.     I understand the responsibilities of the VA and am willing to support them.
12.     I have reviewed the volunteer's Personal Information File (PIF), evaluations history, and
PRP (if applicable) and have found no factors that would disqualify this volunteer.

      VICTIM ADVOCATE VOLUNTEER STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING

VICTIM ADVOCATE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
I volunteer to serve as a victim advocate. My commander or agency head has agreed to make me
available to act as a volunteer victim advocate. As such, I understand:
 My duties will be to provide essential support, liaison services and care to a victim. My
    responsibilities will include providing crisis intervention, referral and ongoing non-clinical
    support, including information on available options and resources to assist the victim in
    making informed decisions about the case.
 VA services will continue until the victim states support is no longer needed or the SARC
    makes this determination based on the victim’s response to offers of assistance. I understand
    that my duties do not include providing counseling or therapeutic services to victims of
    sexual assault.
 My status as a volunteer VA may be terminated at any time at the discretion of, the Vice
    Wing Commander or the Sexual Assault Response Coordinator.
 I must successfully complete the entire mandatory 40 hours of training before I perform
    duties as a VA and that continuing education and training will be required.
 This position may involve or require a significant amount of my time for training and
    performance of victim advocate duties (when assigned to a victim).
 I will be periodically on call to perform VA duties and this time will be in addition to my
    regular duties. While I am on call, I must be available to respond within a reasonable period
    of the notification to report.
 While I am performing duties as a victim advocate, I report directly to the Sexual Assault
    Response Coordinator (SARC) and I must let my supervisor know when I am absent due to
    VA duties.
 I have no victim advocate responsibilities or authority regarding a victim unless I am
    specifically assigned to a victim by a SARC.
 I understand the need to treat all information, restricted or unrestricted, as sensitive personal
    information warranting limited access and effective controls.
Covered Communications Under Restricted Reporting
I understand
 While performing my duties as a VA, I will be told and have access to covered
    communications (confidential personal information under restricted reporting).
 Covered communications include any oral, written or electronic communication of
    personally identifiable information made by the victim to the SARC, assigned VA or a
    Healthcare Personnel or by and between the individual, SARC, assigned VA and Healthcare
    Personnel related to the sexual assault or alleged assailant.
 Personal identifying information includes information from and about a victim or alleged
    assailant in a sexual assault that would disclose or have a tendency to disclose a victim’s or
    alleged assailant’s identity. This personal identifying information might include the person’s
    name or particularly identifying description (e.g., physical characteristics or identity by
    position, rank, or organization), or other information about the person or the facts and
    circumstances involved that could reasonably be understood to identify the person (e.g., a
    female in a particular squadron or dormitory when there is only one female assigned). In
 48                               AFI36-6001_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP_I 1 JULY 2010


   contrast, non-identifying personal information includes those facts and circumstances
   surrounding the sexual assault incident or individuals that generally describe the incident and
   individuals without tending to disclose an individuals’ identity.
 I may not reveal personal or other identifying information without the express written
   consent of the victim or a determination that one of the exceptions to the AFI and Guidance
   on Sexual Assault Prevention and Response applies. Unless circumstances clearly warrant
   otherwise, I will disclose this information only after receiving permission from the SARC.
Acknowledgements
 I acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure of a covered communication, improper release of
   medical information and other violations of this directive may result in administrative action
   or action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
 I acknowledge that I have read and received a copy of the AFI and guidance on Sexual
   Assault Prevention and Response.
