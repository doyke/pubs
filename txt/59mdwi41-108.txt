This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 41-1, Health Care Programs and
Resources. This instruction establishes policies and procedures for reviewing, clearing, and
accounting for duty-related medical research writings and oral presentations prepared by
personnel assigned to the 59th Medical Wing (MDW) and intended for public release (domestic
or foreign). Examples include full journal papers, technical notes, case studies, abstracts or
presentations (poster or slide), and documentary photographic prints. Note: “Domestic release”
includes societies composed primarily of Department of Defense (DoD) personnel but whose
proceedings may be distributed to the public or may be reported by the public news media (e.g.,
The Society of Air Force Physicians, The Society of Armed Forces Medical Laboratory
Scientists, The Air Force Society of Clinical Surgeons). “Foreign release” includes any
symposium or conference which is open to foreign representation. This instruction applies to
personnel assigned, attached, or under contract to the 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply
to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. The authority to waive requirements is the
publication approval authority. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed
in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System Records Disposition Schedule.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
2                                                          59MDWI41-108 18 OCTOBER 2013

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: updated 59 MDW Form 3039, Processing of Professional Medical Research
Publications/Presentations, references and office symbols.

1. Policy. The Air Force is interested in fully informing the public about Air Force medical
research activities. Accordingly, the 59 MDW encourages publication and oral presentation of
its professional medical research activities. However, before such information is released to the
public, it must be accounted for, reviewed, and cleared for security and consistency with Air
Force, DoD, and federal policies.

2. Benefits Provided by Accountability Review and Clearance.

    2.1. The 59th Clinical Research Division (59 CSPG/SGVUS) will maintain a current master
    computer database of all medical research publications, posters, and oral presentations
    cleared for public release.

    2.2. Division directors, squadron commanders, group commanders, and the commander of
    the 59 MDW are made aware of medical research publication and oral presentation efforts by
    assigned personnel through the use of the 59 MDW Form 3039. This awareness aids the
    preparation of officer performance report and enlisted performance report ratings and
    endorsements, and letters of recommendation.

    2.3. The 59 MDW can compile its annual medical research scholarly output. These data
    facilitate accreditation of residency and fellowship programs, justify funds for continuing
    health education and, with respect to reports of clinical investigation, defend costs of the
    medical center's clinical research program.

    2.4. The 59 MDW's Office of Public Affairs (PA) will provide a security and policy review
    of all proposed publications, abstracts, and presentations for publication or dissemination in
    any public medium. This review facilitates coordination with other agencies, as required
    (e.g., Air Education Training Command, Air Force Surgeon General's Office, Medical Law,
    etc.).

3. Responsibilities and Procedures.

    3.1. The originator (author) is responsible to prepare the medical research manuscript,
    abstract, or other materials, as appropriate. The originator will ensure effective organization
    and technical accuracy; correct grammar, spelling and sentence structure; appropriateness of
    discussion and conclusions; compliance with the scientific journal's or society's requirements;
    and inclusion of the statements cited in AFI 40-402, Protection of Human Subjects in
    Biomedical and Behavioral Research, paragraph 7.2 (see note below) and AFMAN 40-
    401_IP, The Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in DoD Programs, paragraph 13d (see
    note below). The originator should include the following statement on the title page of the
    medical research manuscript or presentation: “The views expressed are those of the
    [author(s)] [presenter(s)] and do not reflect the official views or policy of the Department of
59MDWI41-108 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    3

  Defense or its Components. A manuscript/presentation should not be considered final unless
  the above criteria are met.
  Note: The statement required by AFI 40-402 in all printed papers, articles and reports of
  research involving humans is: “The voluntary, fully informed consent of the subjects used in
  this research was obtained as required by 32 CFR 219 and AFI 40-402.” The statement
  required by AFMAN 40-401_IP in reports of research involving animals is: “The
  experiments reported herein were conducted according to the principles set forth in National
  Institute of Health Publication No. 80-23, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
  and the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended.”

  3.2. The originator will complete page 2 of 59 MDW Form 3039, sign the form, have their
  commander sign the form, attach the publication/presentation (including illustrations) and
  submit the documents to SGVUS for processing. Illustrations and tables will be returned to
  the originator on request.

  3.3. The originator will retain the original manuscript or abstract for eventual submission to
  the publisher or society. Proposed medical research manuscripts for publication must be
  submitted through SGVUS prior to any commitment to civilian publishers. The originator
  should not submit a medical research manuscript or abstract to publishers or societies for
  consideration until they receive telephone or written notification from SGVUS that the work
  was approved for public release.

  3.4. For medical research presentations not based on a manuscript or article (e.g., lectures
  from slides, table-top clinics, etc.), the originator should submit a general description of the
  subject matter to be presented. If a previously approved presentation is presented again
  without substantive changes, the presenter may simply submit a copy of the original
  presentation, plus 59 MDW Form 3039, to document the most recent presentation request.
  Proposed medical research presentations must be submitted through SGVUS prior to any
  commitment to civilian societies. The originator should not submit a medical research
  presentation to societies for consideration until they receive telephone or written notification
  that the work was approved for public release.

  3.5. Upon receipt of the proposed medical research manuscript, abstract, or presentation,
  SGVUS will assign a file number and enter the processing information into the master
  computer database.

  3.6. SGVUS will review all submissions for the criteria cited in paragraph 3.1. The reviewer
  may detect errors or suggest changes which would enhance the chances of acceptance by the
  publisher or society. The reviewer will notify the originator of any recommended change(s).

  3.7. SGVUS will forward all submissions and illustrations to 59 MDW/PA for an official
  security and policy review for medical research manuscript/presentation clearance.

  3.8. PA will forward manuscripts/presentations to higher headquarters or other appropriate
  DoD offices, if additional review/clearance is deemed necessary.
4                                                          59MDWI41-108 18 OCTOBER 2013

    3.9. PA will work with the originator to revise any items not consistent or compliant with
    current Air Force, DoD, or federal security policies.

    3.10. PA will expeditiously return the cleared material to SGVUS for further processing.

    3.11. Following 59 MDW/PA actions, SGVUS will promptly notify the originator as to the
    approval or disapproval of the publication, abstract, or presentation material. If approval is
    granted, the originator may then submit the manuscript, abstract, or presentation to the
    journal, publisher, or society for public release.

    3.12. SGVUS will retain all records pertaining to the medical research approval process.

    3.13. If a publisher or society requests copyright or republication rights to a submitted
    abstract, paper, or presentation, the originator should complete the publisher’s or society’s
    copyright form indicating that the medical research work was prepared as part of his/her
    official duties and thus is deemed a “work of the United States Government.” If the
    publisher’s or society’s copyright form does not give this response option, the originator
    should reply using the letter format at Attachment 2.

    3.14. The originator will coordinate any publisher page charges or color plate charges with
    his/her organization prior to submitting a medical research article for publication (not
    necessary, if the originator plans to personally pay for such charges). The originator will
    forward all requests for reprints or technical information from persons in former or current
    communist block countries to 59 MDW/PA. 59 MDW/PA will then forward the request to
    the Air Force Office of Special Investigations or higher headquarters, as appropriate.

4. Time Requirements. As a general rule, the entire review and clearance process can be
accomplished at the 59 MDW within ten working days. However, if additional higher level
review is required, more time must be allowed. Information for foreign release must be processed
through disclosure channels, which may take 60-90 days to complete. An individual who does
not obtain proper review and clearance of his/her medical research presentation will not receive
temporary duty orders to deliver the presentation.
