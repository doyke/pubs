1. General Base Honor Guard Policy: The 100th Air Refueling Wing, RAF Mildenhall Base Honor
Guard (BHG) participates in base and community functions; however, our primary mission is to render
Military Funeral Honors (MFH) for all active-duty members, retirees, and veterans. Designated Area of
Responsibility (AOR) is defined for United Kingdom as Southern England from Birmingham southward
to include Ireland and Wales:
   1.1. Military funeral honors in the AOR.
   1.2. In addition to military funerals the BHG performs the following:
       1.2.1. Honors and ceremonies for distinguished persons (see AFR 900-6, Honors and Ceremonies
       Accorded Distinguished Persons).
       1.2.2. Change of Command ceremonies (see AFMAN 26-2203, Drill and Ceremonies).
       1.2.3. Military and civilian programs, parades and celebrations deemed appropriate by the 100th
       Air Refueling Wing Commander (100 AW/CC) (see AFMAN 36-2203 and AFPD 34-2).
       1.2.4. Supplemental details not supporting military honors if manpower is available.
   1.3. The BHG will adhere to specific guidelines for performing military honors and will use AFI
   34-242, chapter 8, paragraphs 8.28 through 8.33 as guidelines for support given.
   1.4. Requesting the BHG.
       1.4.1. Mortuary affairs and distinguished visitor support are the priority missions of the BHG.
       1.4.2. Due to limited resources, requests will be handled on a first come, first served basis. The
       honor guard is a volunteer program, but if personnel are in demand we will resort to the base Fair
       Share program for squadron participation to increase our manning.
       1.4.3. Requests should be made no later than 10 duty days prior to the proposed function. Excep-
       tions to any requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the HG OIC/NCOIC. At a min-
       imum, requesting officials must provide a point of contact, description of service desired, date,
       time, and location (i.e., POW/MIA table, flag for retired members, anthems). To request the BHG,
       the requesting official will contact the HG OIC/NCOIC by one of the following means:
           1.4.3.1. In person (Mortuary Affairs/Honor Guard Office, Building, #450, Rm 110)
           1.4.3.2. By phone. (238-2758 or cell 07876-148870)
           1.4.3.3. Through the Honor Guard web page. Team Mildenhall Honor Guard
   1.5. The requesting official will be notified verbally or in writing when the request is approved.
   1.6. The HG OIC/NCOIC will normally be the approving authority for HG requests for other than
   MFH request.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING


BETWEEN: PROSPECTIVE HONOR GUARD MEMBER, MEMBER’S UNIT AND TEAM
MILDENHALL HONOR GUARD


SUBJECT:PARTICIPATION IN THE TEAM MILDENHALL HONOR GUARD


1. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to define the criteria for membership in the
Team Mildenhall Honor Guard and explain the responsibilities and obligations of members. Understand-
ing the need for the units to account for the use of their personnel, the Honor Guard considers communi-
cation with the units of Honor Guard members an essential part of Honor Guard administration. Through
the use of this memorandum, the units of prospective members are involved in the application process and
are ensured a role in the Honor Guard functional process.


2. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF HONOR GUARD MEMBERS


a. APPEARANCE - As a member of the Team Mildenhall Honor Guard, you are expected to maintain a
professional appearance and conduct yourself in a professional manner at all times, both at Honor Guard
functions and in your unit. You will strictly adhere to the dress and appearance standards IAW AFI
36-2903. An “average” appearance or marginal compliance with the AFI standards is not acceptable. Fail-
ure to maintain the standards of excellence that are expected will result in removal from the Honor Guard.


b. DUTIES - All members will be assigned to training status where they will be trained; after completion,
will be assigned to an operational flight for details. Attendance at all training sessions, meetings, and
details is mandatory. If you have a unit mission essential requirement that prevents you from attending an
Honor Guard function, you must get your first sergeant to contact the Flight CC or NCOIC to inform them
of your unavailability ASAP. Official Honor Guard duty, including training, takes precedence over nor-
mal military duties (including unit training or routine appointments). Failure to attend any Honor Guard
function may result in removal from the Honor Guard. You will be on-call for two weeks, followed by a
two-week off-call period. Being late to practice will be considered as grounds for removal from the Honor
Guard as well.


c. TERMS OF SERVICE – After successful completion of a 12 hour probation/training period and evalu-
ation, all members must provide 12 months of creditable service. This service is consecutive. You must
provide your Flight CC with as much advance notice as possible regarding any TDYs or leaves. For
excessive leave/TDY, the member’s service time will be paused, and resumed upon return, for a comple-
tion of the 12 month period. The Honor Guard will provide all uniform materials at no cost to you. If,
before providing 12 months of service, you are removed from the team for failure to comply with this
memorandum, you will turn in your honor guard garment bag and reimburse the Honor Guard for the cost
MILDENHALLI34-1 3 APRIL 2007                                                                             15


of your uniform and any accouterments not returned in serviceable condition. Certain items of clothing
(such as the shoes) can not be returned after use and the member/unit will have to repay that cost.


I understand and agree to comply with the duties and responsibilities as set forth in this memorandum.
