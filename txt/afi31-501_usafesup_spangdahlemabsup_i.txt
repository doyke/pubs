                                           Chapter 2

                                          POLICIES

2.1. Clearance and Sensitive Position Standard. The personnel security standard that must
be applied to determine whether a person is eligible for access to classified information or
assignment to sensitive duties is whether, based on all available information, the person’s
loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting the person with classified
information or assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interest of
national security.
2.2. Military Service Standard. See AFPD 36-29, Military Standards and AFPD 36-20,
Accession of Air Force Military Personnel. It provides policies to ensure the Air Force employs
the right quantity and quality of people in the Air Force.
2.3. Criteria for Application of Security Standards. The criteria for determining eligibility
for a security clearance are listed in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200. Commanders apply the criteria
for security standards when granting access to classified information.
2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. The scope of each type of
personnel security investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See Attachment 2 for
procedures on requesting personnel security investigations (PSI). See Attachment 3 for
guidance on the types of required personnel security investigations and appropriate
questionnaire forms and or Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
   2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this instruction are
   the only PSIs authorized. The Secretary of the Air Force and/or the Under Secretary of
   Defense, Intelligence must approve raising or lowering the scope of the authorized
   investigation.
   2.4.2. Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC). ENTNACS were replaced by the
   NACLC on 1 Oct 99 for military accessions.
   2.4.3. National Agency Check (NAC). NACs are primarily used for positions of trust.
   2.4.4. National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries and Credit Check (NACIC). NACICs
   are conducted by OPM and are required on all civilian employees entering government
   employment and assigned to nonsensitive positions.
   2.4.5. Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACI).
   ANACIs are conducted by OPM and are required for civilian employees’ initial Secret
   security clearance or assignment to noncritical sensitive positions.
   2.4.6. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC).
   NACLCs are required for military access to Secret information.
   2.4.7. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). SSBIs are required for access
   to TOP SECRET, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), special sensitive positions
   and for critical sensitive positions.

   intervals for the purpose of updating a previously completed background investigation.
12               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     2.4.9. Special Investigative Inquiry (SII). SIIs are used to prove or disprove allegations or
     new information concerning the security standards that arise after a person has been granted
     a security clearance.
     2.4.10. (Added-USAFE) National Agency Check Local National (NACLN), Counter
     Terrorist Check (CTC), Security Check (SC), Developed Vetting (DV) and Local National
     Screening (LNS). A NACLN (Attachment 27 (Added)), CTC/SC/DV (Attachment 34
     (Added)), or LNS (Attachment 35 (Added)) as appropriate is required for all non-United
     States (US) citizens or local nationals (LN) employed by Department of Defense (DoD)
     Components overseas whose duties do not require access to classified information.
     2.4.11. (Added-USAFE) Child Care National Agency Check and Inquiries (CNACI).
     CNACI’s are conducted by Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on child care
     providers, volunteers, service workers, and others who work with or around children under
     18 years of age. CNACIs are required for these personnel unless the employee or volunteer
     is within sight and under the direct supervision of an individual whose background checks
     have been completed, with no derogatory reports.
     2.4.12. (Added-USAFE) National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI). New applicants
     for the Common Access Card (CAC) will require a National Agency Check with Inquiries
     (NACI) background investigation. If the position requires a higher level investigation than a
     NACI the higher level investigation will suffice for the issue of a CAC. Current employees
     will not require a new investigation at this time. Special procedures will apply to non-US
     citizens and will be addressed by SAF/AAP at a later date.
2.5. Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.
2.6. Allegations of Criminal Activity. Commanders refer possible criminal conduct to the
supporting Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.
2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the overseas
portion of personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and State Department
counterparts.
2.8. Limitations and Restrictions. A break in service of over 24 months invalidates an
individual’s personnel security clearance eligibility.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                           13


                                            Chapter 3

                                  SECURITY CLEARANCE

3.1. Authority to Designate Sensitive Positions. Commanders with position designation
authority determine the security sensitivity of civilian positions. Each civilian employee is
subject to an investigation depending on the sensitivity of the position to be occupied, except for
reappointment when the break in employment is less than 24 months.
3.2. Nonsensitive Positions.
   3.2.1. The servicing civilian personnel flight (CPF) processes the initial request for NACIC’s
   to OPM for civilians occupying nonsensitive positions, not requiring access to classified
   information. OPM forwards the investigation to the CAF. Suitability determinations for
   civilian government employment are made accordingly:
       3.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) will adjudicate
       National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Checks (NACIC) as either
       ―Favorable‖ or ―No Determination Made‖. If the NACIC is adjudicated ―Favorable‖,
       no further action is required; however, if the Personnel Security Investigation (PSI) was
       adjudicated ―No Determination Made‖, the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) will
       perform a suitability determination. Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) is normally the
       OPR for appropriated fund positions and Human Resource Office (HRO) for non-
       appropriated fund positions.
   3.2.2. The CAF forwards the completed investigation, OPM ―Certificate of Investigation‖
   and the OPM INV Form 79A, Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel
   Investigations to the base servicing CPF.
       3.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Information contained in an investigative report may not be
       released or disclosed to the individual investigated or to unauthorized personnel. CAF
       reports will not be released or disclosed without the permission of the CAF.
   3.2.3. The CPF:
       3.2.3.1. Determines if the individual is deemed suitable for employment IAW 5
       CFR 731.201-202. Coordination and or consultation with the supervisor and or
       commander may be made.
       3.2.3.2. If employee is determined suitable, CPF signs off on the OPM Certificate of
       Investigation and the form is filed in the individual’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF)
       IAW AFI 36.114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
       3.2.3.3. If applicant is determined unsuitable, CPF fills out the OPM INV Form 79A,
       Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel Investigations and
       coordinates with the employee’s supervisor and or commander. CPF forwards the OPM
       INV Form 79A to OPM.
   3.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Unresolved disputes arising from suitability determinations must be
   elevated to the next higher level in the chain-of-command for resolution. Security Forces
   (SF) may dispute a suitability determination when identified or lack of information generates
   concerns pertaining to force protection and other installation and personnel protection issues.
14               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     3.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Suitability determinations results for NACIC PSIs will be entered
     into Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) by the security manager.
     3.2.6. (Added-USAFE) During the suitability determination process, the OPR will
     safeguard all investigative reports and release only to those personnel whose official duties
     require access to them.
     3.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Other PSIs. If derogatory, unfavorable, and or potentially
     disqualifying information is identified on a Host Agency Check (HAC), Defense Central
     Index of Investigations Check (DCII), Local Files Check (LFC), or Federal Bureau of
     Investigations (FBI) check for LNs, the OPR will perform a suitability determination. The
     OPR will coordinate with the individual’s supervisor, commander, and SF to determine if the
     individual is deemed suitable for employment. Appeals for United Kingdom Defence
     Vetting Agency (DVA) denials for cause, residency or no determination made must be to
     DVA and not to/thru US agencies.
     3.2.8. (Added-USAFE) Contractor Suitability Determinations. The requirements outlined
     in para 3.2.7 above apply to suitability PSIs submitted for US contractor personnel.
3.3. Reassignment to a Noncritical Sensitive Position. If a civilian employee is subsequently
selected for a position requiring access to classified information and unescorted entry into
restricted areas (noncritical sensitive), security managers process the completed SF 86,
Questionnaire for National Security Positions, to security forces authorized requesters.
3.3. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Reassignment to a Noncritical Sensitive Position.This applies
to an internal unit position sensitivity change from non-sensitive position to noncritical sensitive
position. The Civilian Personnel Office must process the personnel security questionnaire, SF
86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, if this is an initial Access National Agency

     5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A,
     para 5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the
     completed SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at
     the same time the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security
     Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the processing of the SSBI off the
     installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet
     annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.
5.6. Personal Data Provided by the Subject of the Investigation.
     5.6.1. The Air Force goal for processing personnel security investigation requests at base
     level is 14 duty days. However, commands that have extensive deployments and TDY
     requirements may establish their own internal management controls and or timelines for
     the processing of investigation requests.
        5.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) SF authorized requesters will process and submit PSIs to
        OPM and annotate JPAS to reflect ―investigation submitted‖ within 5 working days of
        receiving a completed and ―correct‖ investigation package.
     5.6.2. The subject of the investigation will provide the required documentation to the
     security manager to verify birth and education information. See Attachment 2 for details.
     5.6.3. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA): Upon accession, IMAs complete the
     PSI during the first three days of the individual duty training (IDT) period or not later than
     90 days at the unit of assignment or attachment and turn-in to the servicing security
     manager and or gaining active duty security manager.
     5.6.4. See Chapter 8 for actions when individuals refuse to provide the required
     information for a personnel security investigation.
     5.6.5. DSS and OPM are the DOD repository of personnel security investigative files. To
     obtain a personal copy of an investigation, forward a notarized request that includes:
     name, SSAN, date of birth, and place of birth to: DSS, ATTN: Privacy Act Office, PO
     Box 46060, Baltimore, MD 21240-6060 or OPM, ATTN: FOIA, PO Box 618, 1137
     Branchton Rd, Boyers, PA 16018-0618. The request should refer to the Privacy Act and
     include a valid return address. All signatures must be notarized. Military personnel may use a
     commissioned officer in lieu of a notary public to attest to the signature. Identify the SSN
     and rank of the officer. Also refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program.
5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian,
contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual
citizen and/or possess/ use a foreign passport.
     5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for
     security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the
     exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a
     disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that
     could mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I,
     Foreign Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is
     one of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                        31


  5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport
  in preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US
  is paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security
  clearance will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or
  obtains official approval for its use from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded
  through respective Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ
  USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the
  AF will gain from a person holding a foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the
  remarks field of the JPAS.
  5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in
  item 15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form
  86, ―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be required to surrender the
  passport via one of the following methods:
     5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate           via
     certified receipt mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and     the
     return receipt will be forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address. If      the
     name of adjudicator assigned to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of    the
     address.
     5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the
     passport and place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the
     destruction of the passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to
     the AFCAF and a copy provided to the subject.
     5.7.3.3. (Added-USAFE) SF authorized requesters will review the personnel security
     questionnaire to determine if the individual has indicated possession of a foreign
     passport. If the review confirms the indication of possession, the SF authorized
     requester will not submit the PSI unless the remarks field in the individual’s JPAS person
     summary reflects prior approval by Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air
     Force (SAF/AA), or the passport has been surrendered or destroyed. A copy of the
     transmittal memo forwarding the passport and return receipt or memorandum signifying
     destruction of the passport will be included with the PSI package and a copy sent to the
     AFCAF.
  5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and
  dual citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the
  following must be completed:
     5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign
     citizenship claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual renouncement
     is not required.
         5.7.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Include a copy of the written statement with the PSI and
         forward a copy to the AFCAF.
     5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.

     5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must
     be provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine
     security clearance eligibility.
     5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance
     determination is made.
     5.7.7. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) The unit commander will suspend access in writing
     until appropriate actions are finalized and verified by the Personnel Security Office and all
     actions have been completed by the Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF).

                                      ADJUDICATION

6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility
(AFCAF) is the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave,
Bolling AFB 20032.
   6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-
   102 and Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a
   security clearance or assignment to sensitive duties.
   6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see
   Chapter 8).
   6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility
   determination.
   6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring
   customers on pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory
   issues are often resolved through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of
   the case. Premature dissemination of unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could result in
   discriminatory practices with respect to such areas as employments or assignments.
6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS
replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.

                     ISSUING CLEARANCE AND GRANTING ACCESS

7.1. General.
     7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel
     security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
     7.1.2. Position Designations (7-100c). Commanders:
        7.1.2.1. Determine the level of access necessary for each military and civilian position
        based on mission needs. Each position is coded with the appropriate security access
        requirement (SAR) and identified in the unit manning document (UMD), the Defense
        Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS), and SK. See Attachment 3, for SAR code
        definitions. If the SAR code requires a change, the unit commander submits an
        authorization change request to the servicing security activity.
        7.1.2.2. Conduct a review annually to determine the accuracy of position coding,
        eliminate unnecessary access codings, and adjust SAR code appropriately.
        7.1.2.3. Record findings in the UMD and SK.
        7.1.2.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
        needs.
7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
     7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military and
     civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to
     determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to
     positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for security clearance. Each position is
     coded with the appropriate position code reflecting the required investigation level in
     the unit manning document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
     (DCPDS). These will also be reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System
     (HAF-MDS).
        7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
            7.2.1.1.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
            7.2.1.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
            7.2.1.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
            7.2.1.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI).
            7.2.1.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
        7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table
        A22.1.
        7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last
        AF-wide directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each May.
        Retain results for review during self inspections, etc.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                             35


       7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential
       needs.
       7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
   7.2.2. Mandatory Secret or Top Secret requirement may be required when every position
   in a specialty is not coded as requiring access to classified information if the functional
   community can validate security access requirements for the AFSC and provide justification
   that demonstrates mandatory qualification required for mission accomplishment, such as
   access to classified information or equipment.
7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). H Q
U S A F / X O S - F I approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC
prerequisites. Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer
Classification and AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement for
entry, award, and retention for the respective mandatory AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table
A22.2, A22.3.
   7.3.1. Security clearance data can be verified by the CAVS, Permanent Change of Station
   Orders, or Temporary Duty Orders.
7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive
programs that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential
Support, Personnel Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.
   7.4.1. AMS is the application used by the CAF and is restricted to CAF personnel only.
       7.4.1.1. It is a centralized database enabling CAF personnel to post adjudication results;
       security clearance determinations; access eligibility; pending actions; status of due
       process actions, i.e. security information files; statistical reporting requirements; and
       other personnel security management functions.
       7.4.1.2. Selected data fields from AMS will be available through CAVS to Air Force
       customers/ users almost immediately after input by CAF personnel and within 24 hours of
       data input by other customers/users.
   7.4.2. CAVS is the application used by MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, ISPMs, SSOs, unit level
   security managers, and other individuals with personnel/physical security responsibilities.
   MAJCOM/FOA/ DRUs will determine those organizations and individuals within their
   organizations who will be given CAVS access. Clearance data elements in the CAVS include
   the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status of security clearance. The
   information is invalid when any of these four data elements are incomplete.
       7.4.2.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the CAVS when more
       than one entry appears for an individual.
       7.4.2.2. An individual may have multiple SAR codes recorded in the CAVS if the
       individual is in multiple positions (i.e. civilian, reserve, or air national guard). The level
       of access given to the individual should be based on the access necessary for the
       position. Commanders make the decision on the level of access required.
       7.4.2.3. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
       subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance, is eligible for SCI
36            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     access if required for mission essential purposes (depending on the currency of the
     investigation) and or may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
     7.4.2.4. The CAVS will provide the following information:
        7.4.2.4.1. An individual’s security clearance level and access.
        7.4.2.4.2. Visit and suspension notifications.
        7.4.2.4.3. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
        7.4.2.4.4. Establishment of a SIF.
     7.4.2.5. Access to the CAVS is restricted to Air Force employees only. Contractors
     and others who are assigned to an ISPM or SSO office must have prior approval by the
     SK Program Management Office (497 IG/INSP (PMO)) for access.
     7.4.2.6. There are 7 User Levels in the CAVS. These levels are defined as follows:
        7.4.2.6.1. Level 1: CAF personnel and Systems Administrators.
        7.4.2.6.2. Level 2: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU SCI security personnel.

        7.4.2.7.1. User levels 2-7 have read access to all Air Force personnel.
        7.4.2.7.2. User levels 2 and            4   may    write   to     records   within   their
        MAJCOM/FOA/DRU PASCODE.
        7.4.2.7.3. User levels 3 and 5 may write to records within their local PASCODE
        and to records of individuals assigned to another MAJCOM/FOA/DRU supported by
        levels 3 and 5.
        7.4.2.7.4. User level 6, entry controller, has the ability to verify an individual’s
        clearance eligibility and access in the CAVS. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU may have
        reports printed for entry controllers by base ISPM security personnel (user level 5)
        listing the clearance eligibility and access of expected visitors. Reports will only be
        valid for the date and time printed.
        7.4.2.7.5. User level 7 has the ability to write non-SCI access (interim, secret, and top
        secret); nondisclosure dates; NATO access; and the indoctrination/debriefing dates.
        Level 7 is also authorized to view non-SCI access history and print reports
        associated with their write capabilities.
     7.4.2.8. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access level for each user within
     their command. The system administrator will establish user accounts. SK allows
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                       37


       unlimited users on one computer, but each user must have an individual account. A user
       account must be restricted to the registered user only.
       7.4.2.9. User Levels 1-3 must have a Top Secret clearance based on an SSBI or PR.
       User Levels 4-7 require a Secret clearance based on an ENTNAC, NAC, NACLC, NACI,
       NACIC, or ANACI.
   7.4.3. The CAF will publish and keep current a SK training guide with instructions on
   the use of AMS and CAVS. The CAF will review/update the SK web page at least monthly, to
   provide additional guidance and references as needed.
   7.4.4. Requests for changes to SK must be forwarded by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
   Security Forces or Special Security Office (SSO) to the SK Requirements Group
   through the 497 IG/INSP, 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC, 20332-7040.
   7.4.5. SK will be replaced with the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) which
   will be the DOD personnel security automated system that contains investigative and
   security clearance data.
7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual
Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as
a minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country
threat briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility ―just in case
of‖ deployment. In these situations, commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period
of up to 180 days. This can be renewed for extended deployment purposes and for
redeployment. Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose of deployment based on the
existing NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will not be required for
this purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more than 24
months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available,
documented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a
joint or theater deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept
interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded
IAW para 7.2 of this instruction.
7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian
Equivalent authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the
servicing Manpower Office codes the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized cannot be
delegated. Approval authorities are as follows:
   7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC
       7.6.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's
       security manager.
       7.6.1.2. The authorized requester and the unit keep the MFR until the CAVS shows a
       final security clearance.
       7.6.1.3. (Added-USAFE) All requests to create a new position or upgrade an existing
       position to one that requires an SSBI PSI will be submitted in a formal staff summary
       sheet package from the appropriate organizational commander. For wing and Third Air
       Force (3AF) positions, packages will be submitted to the 3d Air Force Commander (3
       AF/CC). For USAFE staff positions, packages will be submitted to the United States Air
38               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        Forces in Europe Vice Commander (USAFE/CV). Requests involving wing positions will
        be routed through the installation Manpower Flight, installation ISPM, wing or group
        commander, USAFE Functional Representative, Directorate of Personnel Requirements
        Branch (HQ USAFE/A1MR) and USAFE Security Forces (HQ USAFE/ A7S).
        Requests involving 3AF positions will be routed through 3AF/A1, Directorate of
        Personnel Requirements Branch (HQ USAFE/A1MR), and HQ USAFE/A7S. Requests
        involving USAFE staff positions will be routed through the USAFE Functional
        Representative, Directorate of Personnel Requirements Branch (HQ USAFE/A1MR) and
        HQ USAFE/A7S.
        7.6.1.4. (Added-USAFE) The staff package will contain specific justification
        (Attachment 33 (Added)) for the requested action and include a mission impact
        statement. Additionally, the Position Coding Upgrade Request Checklist (Table A33.1
        (Added)) will be completed and forwarded with the request package. Approved requests
        will be forwarded to the servicing manpower office for processing required Unit
        Manning Document (UMD) changes.
     7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the
     appropriate grade level.
     7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
     7.6.4. HQ USAF:
        7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA.
        7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
     7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation
     will be retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review
     by HQ AFIA or their designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for
     personnel security investigations through the FYDP.
7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents
assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.
7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and
enters the determination into JPAS.
     7.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Security clearance eligibility can only be verified by JPAS or a
     properly authenticated Visitor Authorization Letter for those agencies who do not utilize
     JPAS.
7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense
(DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security
management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers
both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel
systems within the Department thus eliminating manual transactions and expediting the flow of
personnel security information to warfighters.
     7.9.1. JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations
     on individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its
     customers. All information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                        39


  requirements for privacy/sensitive information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in
  accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF
  Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
     7.9.1.1. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Access. JPAS is a ―US ONLY‖ program with strict
     access controls. LNs are prohibited from accessing JPAS. The SF authorized requester is
     responsible for the establishment and management of JPAS accounts for their
     installation, to include CPF, Services Human Resource Office (HRO), PRP Managers,
     and Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) HRO, as required. Personnel
     with JPAS access will comply with the requirements outlined in this supplement and in
     the JPAS AF Account Management Policy. This supplement implements the JPAS AF
     Account Management Policy as ―directive.‖
     7.9.1.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) The 52 SFS ARs serves as the JPAS Account Manager
     for 52 FW and attached tenant units (exceptions are the GSUs and 52 Operations Support
     Squadron Intelligence Flight). These units are self-sustaining ARs managed by the
     appropriate hierarchical Account Manager.
  7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS)
  and Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS).
     7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case
     management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary,
     due process, and future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative
     reports from the investigative providers.
         7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used
         throughout this instruction.
     7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized
     requesters and provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history,
     incident/issue file reporting, history and management of unit personnel security functions.
         7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS),
         as used throughout this instruction.
         7.9.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) All personnel identified as an SF authorized requester
         on the SF authorized requester memorandum must have JPAS access.
  7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance
  data elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date
  and status of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data
  elements are incomplete.
     7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more
     than one entry appears for an individual.
     7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the
     subject of a SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is
     eligible for SCI access if required for mission essential purposes and may already have
     SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
  7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
40               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009

            7.9.5.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Security Managers must in process and "own" or
            "service" all individuals assigned to the organization. Using JPAS, indoctrinate each
            individual according to their position sensitivity and eligibility. Also record any
            indoctrination into Non-Sensitive Compartment Information (SCI) programs such as
            NATO, Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information (CNWDI), PRP, etc.
            7.9.5.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The primary USM and at least one alternate will
            have JPAS access for units that maintain classified information. For units that do not
            maintain classified information, as a minimum, the primary USM will have JPAS
            access.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                     41


       7.9.5.5.2. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Access to JPAS shall be granted only if an
       individual’s day-to-day duties require such access. Account managers will not
       authorize convenience accounts.
          7.9.5.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Level 5 account managers are responsible for
          the JPAS activation of assigned and or supported USMs. USMs may only be
          activated as either a Level 6 account manager or Level 6 user.
          7.9.5.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Before activating a JPAS account, Level 5 account
          managers will be provided a copy of the USM appointment memorandum, JPAS
          System Access Request Form (SAR) and proof of JPAS training.
          7.9.5.5.2.2. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) JPAS Training and Registration.                All
          personnel requiring JPAS access must complete the appropriate training course
          (Security Management), complete a JPAS System Access Request Form, and
          provide the Personnel Security Office with a memo stating that the JPAS Desktop
          Resource guide has been read and will be adhered to.
          7.9.5.5.2.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Persons requesting a JPAS account
          must have the proper security clearances before account access is granted.
          Persons who do not meet the required security clearance requirements cannot be
          assigned a JPAS account. JPAS requires account managers and users to have a
          "completed" Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), Phased Periodic
          Reinvestigation (PPR), National Agency Check with Local Agency Check and
          Credit Check (NACLC), ANACI, or Periodic Reinvestigation Secret (PRS), or a
          completed, Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC), National Agency
          Check with Written Inquiries (NACI), or National Agency Check (NAC) with an
          "open" SSBI, PPR, NACLC, ANACI, or PRS. While JPAS does not contain any
          classified information, DoD determined it does contain information that is For
          Official Use Only and of a "sensitive" nature and that the mandatory investigation
          requirements are needed.
       7.9.5.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Level 6 account managers are responsible for anyone
       they activate, to include completion and maintenance of required JPAS training,
       System Access Request Forms and account deactivation when the user no longer
       requires JPAS access.
       7.9.5.5.4. (Added-USAFE) CPF and HRO are authorized Level 6 user access in
       JPAS; however, most USAFE installations have long-term, trusted LNs managing the
       personnel security program who are not permitted JPAS access. If these offices do
       not have a sufficient US staff to access and or manage JPAS requirements and
       functions, the CPF and HRO as appropriate coordinates with the base Authorized
       Requestor to determine the best possible solution to ensure JPAS requirements and
       functions are completed. If resolution cannot be achieved, forward the issue
       through the wing and or group commander to HQ USAFE/A7S and HQ USAFE
       Director of Personnel (USAFE/A1) for resolution.
       7.9.5.5.4. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Office accounts shall not be created. Each JPAS
       account will correspond to a single user who is responsible for all actions taken when
       using that account.

        7.9.5.5.5. (Added-USAFE) AAFES HRO is authorized Level 6 user access in JPAS.
        7.9.5.5.6. (Added-USAFE) Additional JPAS Level 6 User Access. Level 5 account
        managers are authorized to activate Level 6 User access for the wing or group PRP
        manager and unit PRP monitors. If Level 6 User access is not activated, Level 6
        USMs and or Level 5 account managers are responsible for obtaining JPAS
        information and data to support the PRP program.
        7.9.5.5.7. (Added-USAFE) Deactivation of JPAS for USMs. Personnel no longer
        performing USM duties will be deactivated as a JPAS Level 6 account manager or
        user as soon as possible. Units will forward a ―signed‖ copy of the JPAS System
        Access Request Form or e-mail notification requesting the deactivation of the
        individual’s JPAS Level 6 account to the Level 5 account manager. Once the
        deactivation request is received and the Level 5 account manager deactivates the
        account, the access request form or e-mail notification will be maintained by the level
        5 manager for a minimum of 6 months.
     7.9.5.6. Level 7 - Non-SCI Entry Control Personnel. Individuals who grant access to
     installations, buildings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access -
     NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.)
        7.9.5.6.1. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Level 7 Read Only Access. JPAS Level 7 is a
        ―read only‖ access that does not permit the user to enter and or modify existing
        data. Security monitors that support USMs are only authorized JPAS Level 7 user
        access.
        7.9.5.6.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Level 7. Security monitors: Many organizations
        utilize security ―monitors‖ to support the unit program. Security monitors are not
        required to attend security manager training and therefore will not have the
        capabilities of a security manager when it comes to JPAS (a Level 7 user has ―read
        only‖ access). Level 7 users must meet all investigation, training and registration
        requirements as mentioned above. Other functions and/or positions that Level 7 users
        may be authorized to perform include unit deployment manager and entry controller
        for areas that require a security clearance for entry.
        7.9.5.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Level 6 account managers may activate Level 7 User
        access for assigned security monitors. Level 6 account managers must ensure all
        activation/deactivation documentation as indicated above is completed and
        maintained on file.
     7.9.5.7. Level 8 - SCI Entry Control Personnel. Individuals who grant access to SCIF
     installations, buildings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access -
     SSBI/DCID 6/4 Eligibility.)
     7.9.5.8. Level 10 - Visitor Management. Level 10 users will have the same view of the
     JCAVS Personnel Summary as a JCAVS Level 7 User. They will receive Visit
     Notification when their Security Management Office (SMO) is being notified of a visit.
     A Level 10 User may not be an account manager to create or delete an account at any
     level. NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.

       7.9.5.9. (Added-USAFE) JPAS access is considered information technology (IT);
       therefore, US civilian personnel in non-sensitive positions, who by virtue of their duties
       as listed on the core document, require JPAS access, may be submitted for an ANACI
       without affecting the sensitivity of the position.
       7.9.5.10. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Contents of the JPAS system, to include
       screen images and printed media, contain data that is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974
       and must be marked appropriately if printed. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, personal
       information retrieved through JPAS must be safeguarded. Disclosure of information is in
       accordance with instructions as outlined on the security banner associated with the JPAS
       system.

JPAS web site is: https://jpas.osd.mil Requests for changes to JPAS may be made on-line at
https://jpas.osd.mil.
   7.10.1. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Training Requirements. All account managers and users,
   regardless of access level must complete JPAS training before being granted access. The
   JPAS on-line training is the primary means of obtaining this training. When the JPAS on-
   line training is not working, the USM (if well versed on JPAS functions) or ISPM may
   conduct one-on-one or group JPAS training. Training will be documented.
7.11. Granting Access. Commanders grant access to classified information when a mission
essential need exists and only when all of the following prerequisites are met: (1) individual
has the appropriate security clearance eligibility; (2) individual has signed an SF 312 (see AFI
31-401); and (3) individual has a need-to-know. Authorized base level users will record access in
the JCAVS. See Chapter 3 for other situations when access to classified information may be
granted.
   7.11.1. (Added-USAFE) Prior to granting access to classified, Security Managers will
   verify a SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement has been signed and
   recorded on the individuals JPAS Person Summary.
7.12. Obtaining Information from the AFCAF.
   7.12.1. Authorized requesters may contact the AFCAF Customer Support Section through
   JPAS. In situations where no security clearance data is available at the unit, no information
   is available in the JCAVS, and the AFCAF has valid security clearance information on file,
   a record of the call will be used as evidence of valid clearance data pending update of the
   JCAVS. The authorized requester prepares a memorandum for record (MFR) showing: (1)
   name, grade, and organization of the individual calling the AFCAF; (2) name, grade,
   organization, and SSN of the subject; (3) name of person at the AFCAF providing clearance
   eligibility data, and (4) type and date of investigation and, if granted, level and date of
   security clearance eligibility. Also see para 6.1.
       7.12.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's
       security manager.
44               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        7.12.1.2. The authorized requester and the security manager keep the MFR until
        JCAVS is updated to show the data addressed in the MFR.
        7.12.1.3. (Added-USAFE) E-mail notification is sufficient in lieu of a memorandum
        for record (MFR).
     7.12.2. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests. USMs
     will submit a Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS to the CAF prior
     to seeking assistance from the SF authorized requester. In most cases, the CAF response to
     the Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS will provide the required
     information; however, if further information or clarification is needed, the USM will contact
     the SF authorized requester for assistance.
        7.12.2.1. (Added-USAFE) SF authorized requesters should only call the CAF after first
        verifying the issue could not be resolved by the USMs through JPAS.
     7.12.3. (Added-USAFE) Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in JPAS
     will not be submitted to the CAF until the PSI has been closed at the investigative agency
     for at least 120 days. Additionally, Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests in
     JPAS will not be submitted for any PRP PSI’s.
     7.12.4. (Added-USAFE) Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility Requests will not be
     submitted to the CAF to inquire on the status of a PSI that has been submitted to or open
     at an investigative agency. The CAF is strictly an adjudication facility and has no control
     over investigative agencies. Additionally, Research, Recertify or Upgrade Eligibility
     Requests will not be submitted to the CAF to request personnel data changes in JPAS; such
     as date of birth, place of birth, name changes, unit of assignment, etc.
7.13. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Eligibility Changes. USMs will check the eligibility change
portion of the JPAS Notifications web page frequently to ensure changes are promptly noted and
appropriate action, if any, is taken.
7.14. (Added-USAFE) JPAS Personnel Security Management Network (PSM-Net).As a
minimum, SF authorized requesters will ensure all units and organizations, to include supported
Geographically Separated Units (GSU) are properly serviced within PSM-Net. Additionally,
SF authorized requesters and ISPMs will ensure all units and organizations, to include
supported GSUs have properly established ―ownership‖ or ―servicing‖ of their assigned and/or
deployed personnel assigned to the unit for a period of 30 days or more in their respective JPAS
Security Mangement Office (SMO).

                                           Chapter 8

                    UNFAVORABLE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

8.1. Referral for Action.
   8.1.1. Security Information File (SIF). A SIF is a collection of documents generated as a
   result of the discovery or development of unfavorable information which brings into
   question a person’s continuing eligibility for a security clearance or access to SCI. It may be
   established by a commander, civilian equivalent, or by the CAF. The SIF serves as a
   repository for unfavorable or derogatory information that requires further review, evaluation,
   or investigation to resolve outstanding administrative or adjudicative concerns. Report
   administrative change of status information for individuals with SCI access according to
   AFMAN 14-304.
   8.1.2. Reporting Government Charge Card Abuses and Misuse. Security Officials,
   AFOSI, or AF Government Charge Card program coordinators are required to
   immediately report Government Charge Card abuses and misuses to the appropriate
   commander. This information constitutes serious questions as to the individual’s ability or
   intent to protect classified information or execute sensitive duties. The commander will
   make an immediate determination to either leave the individual’s security status unchanged or
   suspend their access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties until the
   appropriate authority makes a final determination regarding the individual’s eligibility to
   retain a security clearance. In addition, commanders may take action in accordance with
   Chapter 8, to determine if a SIF should be established and/or the person’s access to classified
   information should be suspended.
   8.1.3. Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances
   as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
   Year 2001 – Smith Amendment. Attachment 24 outlines the instructions.
8.2. Suspension.
   8.2.1. Commander:
       8.2.1.1. Reviews unfavorable information on individuals under the commander’s
       jurisdiction when reported or developed which would directly impact an individual’s
       security clearance or SCI access, to include the following (see Attachment 11 for sample
       memorandum):
       8.2.1.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) A consolidated effort coordinating all unfavorable
       information on individuals under the commanders’ jurisdiction must include the USM,
       SF, unit First Sergeants, and any other agency having responsibility for maintaining or
       gathering unfavorable information.
          8.2.1.1.1. Activities’ tenant or geographically separated units.
          8.2.1.1.2. TDY personnel.
       8.2.1.2. Establishes a SIF when an individual’s activity, conduct or behavior is
       inconsistent with the security criteria specified in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200 and
46            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     Appendix I. See Attachment 12 for sample request for SIF establishment to the servicing
     security activity.
     8.2.1.3. Determines whether or not to establish a SIF on a case by case basis, normally
     within 20 days of receipt of unfavorable information (as soon as possible if SCI access
     is involved). This decision is made by considering the seriousness of the incident; the
     individual’s motivation; whether it was out of character for the individual; or whether
     the undesirable conduct or behavior is likely to continue. Coordination and consultation
     with the chief of the servicing security activity, SSO (for SCI access) or program security
     officer (for SAP access) and legal representatives is recommended. However, if the
     commander has sufficient reason to doubt the validity of unfavorable information the
     decision to establish a SIF and notification to the CAF may be extended up to 45 days. If
     the servicing security activity and the commander disagree on establishment of a SIF,
     elevate the issue to the installation commander for resolution. Once a SIF is formally
     established it must be processed accordingly and only the CAF has closure authority.
     8.2.1.3. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) The commander will notify the SF no later than 24
     hours following determination decision. The SF will notify the AFCAF of the decision
     via JPAS Incident Report Module. 8.2.1.4. Suspension of unescorted entry to Protection
     Level (PL) 3 resources is not automatic when access to classified information is
     suspended either by a commander generated Security Information File (SIF) or AFCAF
     generated ―Action Pending.‖ The unit commander will make the determination for
     continued unescorted entry to PL3.
        8.2.1.3.1. Examples of reasons to establish a SIF are outlined in para 2-200, DOD
        5200.2-R and include the following:
            8.2.1.3.1.1. Refusal to sign a required SF 312 or other nondisclosure agreement.
            8.2.1.3.1.2. Refusal or intentional failure of an individual requiring an
            investigation or periodic reinvestigation to provide the personnel security
            questionnaire information or release statements for review of medical, financial,
            or employment records.
            8.2.1.3.1.3. Refusal by an individual to be interviewed in connection with a
            personnel security investigation, regardless of whether the information is
            requested by the investigative agency or the CAF.
            8.2.1.3.1.4. Incidents of theft, embezzlement, child or spouse abuse,
            unauthorized sale or use of firearms, explosives, or dangerous weapons, or
            misuse or improper disposition of government property or other unlawful
            activities.
            8.2.1.3.1.5. Information leading to permanent decertification from PRP for
            other than physical reasons.
        8.2.1.3.2. The following are some examples of reasons that may not warrant
        establishment of a SIF:
            8.2.1.3.2.1. Minor traffic violations.
            8.2.1.3.2.2. Minor one-time alcohol related incident.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                        47


           8.2.1.3.2.3. Permanent decertification from PRP related to medical reasons of a
           physical nature.
           8.2.1.3.2.4. Disciplinary issues; such as failure to repair; poor duty performance;
           failure to maintain weight standards; and any single isolated incident of poor
           judgment based on immaturity or extenuating circumstances which does not
           impact on the individual’s ability to safeguard classified information.
           8.2.1.3.2.5. Federal civilian employees occupying nonsensitive positions.
           8.2.1.3.2.6. Incidents where a SIF has already been established by the CAF
           based on the same unfavorable information.
    8.2.1.4. Determines whether or not to initiate suspension action for the individual’s access
    to classified information upon establishment of a SIF. If the decision is to suspend the
    person’s access to classified information the same decision automatically applies to the
    SCI and SAP access. The access to classified information and SCI is considered one
    under the new DOD personnel security common adjudicative guidelines.
    Additionally, the commander determines suspension of unescorted entry to restricted
    areas if applicable. The determination to suspend should be based on a thorough review of
    the facts and an assessment of the risk to national security. For SCI access see AFMAN
    14-304 and DOD S-5105.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Administrative
    Manual.
    8.2.1.4. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Suspension of unescorted entry to Protection Level
    (PL) 3 resources is not automatic when access to classified information is suspended
    either by a commander generated Security Information File (SIF) or AFCAF generated
    ―Action Pending.‖ The unit commander will make the determination for continued
    unescorted entry to PL3.
       8.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) If a person's JPAS person summary shows "Action
       Pending" or "Access Suspended" all access to classified information, to include
       NATO classified information must be immediately withdrawn.            The unit
       commander or equivalent is responsible for ensuring all access to classified
       information is withdrawn when an individual’s security clearance eligibility is
       suspended by the CAF.
    8.2.1.5. Notifies the individual accordingly with information copy to the servicing
    security activity. See Attachment 13 and Attachment 14 for sample memorandums.
    8.2.1.6. Requests AFOSI investigation, if criminal activity is involved.
    8.2.1.7. Includes a recommendation whether to grant, reinstate, deny, or revoke the
    individual’s security clearance and or SCI/SAP access and the rationale for the decision
    in the completed SIF. The documented facts must fully support the recommendation.
    Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix I, Adjudicative Guidelines.
    8.2.1.8. Requests the CAF to immediately close a SIF favorably via priority message
    (through the MAJCOM or activity SSO for SCI) when special circumstances exist (i.e.,
    individual was falsely accused or holds a special expertise that is essential for
    mission accomplishment). The commander provides the CAF with the SIF (if not
48               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        already at the CAF) and full justification for favorable closure. The CAF will then make
        the security clearance determination or request additional information, if necessary.
        8.2.1.9. Endorses requests by Chief of Servicing Security Activity (SF), SSO, and
        Program Security Officer (PSO) for evaluations and relevant documentation from on base
        activities when issues warrant such coordination.
     8.2.2. Chief of Servicing Security Activity, SSO, and PSO:
        8.2.2.1. Provides guidance to commanders on SIF establishment. SF is OPR for Top
        Secret and Secret security clearance SIFs; SSO is OPR for SCI access SIFs.
        8.2.2.2. Establishes, processes, maintains, monitors SIFs for commanders. See
        Attachment 15 for sample memorandum for notification to the commander of SIF
        establishment. See Attachment 16 for sample SIF custodian checklist.
        8.2.2.2. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) The SF will advise commanders on continued access
        following review of all available unfavorable information and application of the
        personnel security standard to that information.
        8.2.2.3. Provides initial notification to the CAF upon SIF establishment via message
        or CAVS within 10 days. Provide full name, SSAN, security clearance data, date SIF
        established, reason, and if access to classified information and SCI has been suspended or
        withdrawn. If the individual has or is being processed for SCI access, forward the
        notification to the CAF through the MAJCOM or activity SSO. Notify the CAF via
        memorandum when the individual will be permitted to continue access to classified
        information and SCI access. See Attachment 17 for sample memorandum. Notify the
        CAF via memorandum when the individual’s access is withdrawn. Process SIFs
        concerning SCI access according to AFMAN 14-304. If SCI access is involved, the SSO
        is responsible for managing the SIF in its entirety to include actions required for the

8.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. AFOSI conducts personnel security
investigation leads in overseas areas for DSS. All Air Force commanders must report to AFOSI
any alleged criminal activity falling under the security standards criteria. A table of offenses by
case category that AFOSI investigates is available in AFI 71- 101, Volume I, Criminal
Investigations.
   8.3.1. (Added-USAFE) OPM conducts personnel security investigations overseas leads.
8.4. Final Unfavorable Administrative Actions.
   8.4.1. The CAF is the designated authority to make personnel security determinations that
   can result in an unfavorable administrative action. Commanders take actions for removal
   due to unsuitability IAW 5 CFR 731.201-202, Suitability for Government Employment, at
   the same time as actions are being taken for denial or revocation of a person’s security
52                AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     clearance. The unfavorable administrative action on civilian personnel may not include any
     reference to security clearance issues until the results of the final security adjudication are
     available.
8.5. Procedures.
     8.5.1. General. The CAF will make a final personnel security determination resulting in an
     unfavorable clearance action on an Air Force member, civilian employee, contractor (for
     SCI), or any other Air Force affiliated person when the individual concerned has been
     afforded due process procedures according to this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. These same due
     process procedures are also applicable for suspension, denial, or revocation of access to SCI.
     There is no distinction between a security clearance and SCI access in the adjudication
     process. If a clearance is revoked or denied, SCI access is also revoked or denied. The
     CAF will notify individuals concerning unfavorable administrative actions using the
     instructions in this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. Although SAP access is also revoked or denied
     when a clearance is revoked or denied, administrative recourse (appeal) procedures are
     separate and distinct. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
     8.5.2. The Air Force is not authorized to make any adverse security clearance
     determination on a civilian employee occupying a nonsensitive position. Since such
     positions do not involve sensitive duties or access to classified information, the provisions
     of the personnel security program regarding security clearance eligibility do not apply.
     8.5.3. Confinement. When it is determined that an applicant for a security clearance, or a
     person holding a clearance, has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for
     more than one year, the clearance of such person shall be denied or revoked with the
     following actions taken by the CAF:
        8.5.3.1. Verification that the individual is presently imprisoned, serving a term of more
        than 12 months.
        8.5.3.2. A Notice of Revocation or Denial of Security Clearance Eligibility forwarded
        through the Servicing Security Activity and SSO (for SCI) to the individual and the
        commander. The Notice is final and no rebuttal privileges or appeal rights are applicable.
        8.5.3.3. The revocation or denial action is entered in DCII and AMS.
8.6. Unfavorable Administrative Action Procedures.
     8.6.1. Denial Authority. The CAF provides individuals with written statements of reasons
     and other required documentation stating intent to deny or revoke their security clearances
     and SCI access using sample format in DOD 5200.2-R, App L and Atch 11.
     8.6.2. Instructions. Individuals may appeal unfavorable administrative actions
     according to the instructions in this AFI, DOD 5200.2-R, Chapter 8, and Appendix L and M.
     Individuals send communications to the CAF and the local supporting Staff Judge Advocate
     (SJA) through their commanders.
     8.6.3. Designated Point of Contact (POC). Unit commanders will designate a POC to serve
     as a liaison between the CAF and individuals under their jurisdiction when unfavorable
     administrative actions are being taken. POCs conduct the associated duties as outlined in DOD
     5200.2-R, Appendix L-2. The CAF will send communications to the individual through the
     commander, SF, and SSO (for SCI). The supporting SJA will provide the Defense Office of
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                         53


  Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge (AJ) appropriate legal support, upon
  request.
  8.6.4. Individual’s Response to the CAF. Individuals must advise the CAF in writing of their
  intent to respond to the statements of reasons. This must be done within ten days of receipt of
  the statement of reasons. Individuals state whether they intend to submit statements or
  documents to refute, correct, or mitigate the intended actions. Within 60 days from the date
  of receipt of statements of reasons, individuals must provide the CAF with their written
  rebuttals.
  8.6.5. Extensions. Extensions may only be granted by the CAF. A written request for an
  extension for up to 30 days can be submitted to the CAF through the POC and installation or
  unit commander.
  8.6.6. CAF Review of Individual’s Response to the Statement of Reasons. Upon receipt of
  the rebuttal, the CAF will determine whether a security clearance should be reinstated,
  revoked, or denied and a final response will be provided to the individual. This must be done
  within 60 days from the date of receipt of the individual’s response. If a final response
  cannot be completed within 60 days, the individual must be notified in writing of this fact,
  the reasons, and the date a final response is expected. AMS will be updated to reflect the
  CAF decision.
  8.6.7. CAF Decision to Deny or Revoke. If the CAF decision is to deny or revoke a person’s
  security clearance the reasons for the final action will be included in a Letter of
  Denial/Revocation to the individual. Individuals will be afforded an opportunity to appeal to
  a letter of denial/revocation through the Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) by one
  of two methods as outlined in this section and DOD 5200.2-R: (1) appeal without a
  personal appearance; or (2) appeal with a personal appearance before an Administrative
  Judge (AJ) from DOHA. Individuals must elect either (1) or (2); individuals may not do both.
  The CAF will process appeal cases as outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L and Atch 11.
     8.6.7.1. Appeal Without a Personal Appearance. Individuals directly notify the PSAB
     of their intent to appeal without a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the
     letter of denial/ revocation. Address requests to: President, Personnel Security Appeal
     Board, NAIC/IAN, 5113 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3230. Individuals
     send their appeals to the President of the PSAB within 40 days of receipt of the letter of
     denial/revocation.
     8.6.7.2. Appeal With a Personal Appearance. Individuals include the name and telephone
     number of the supporting SJA when requesting a personal appearance from DOHA (see
     Attachment 13). The POC will provide this information to the individual. DOHA initially
     contacts the SJA for support with the appeal proceedings. Individuals advise DOHA in
     writing of their desire for a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the
     letters of denial/revocation. Copies of these advisement’s are provided to the following:
     the POC, the supporting SJA, and the CAF. The SJA will coordinate with the DOHA
     AJ to assist in providing legal support, upon request and will advise on legal matters
     to the commander and the POC. The CAF will provide the individual’s case file to
     DOHA within 10 days upon DOHA’s request. A DOHA AJ will hear the individual’s
     case and forward the file, transcripts, any documentation obtained from the individual,
     and a recommendation to sustain or overturn the letter of denial/revocation to the PSAB.
54               AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


        The deadline for this is 30 days after the personal appearance. The AJ provides the CAF
        with a copy of the recommendation.
            8.6.7.2.1. Within CONUS personal appearances will be conducted at the individual’s
            duty station or at a nearby location for duty stations within the lower 48 states. For
            personnel assigned OCONUS, the appearances will be conducted at: (1) the
            individual’s duty station or a nearby suitable location; or (2) at DOHA facilities
            located in the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, or Los Angeles, California. The
            Director, DOHA or designee determines the appearance location. Travel and TDY
            costs for the individual will be the responsibility of the employing organization.
     8.6.8. Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB). The PSAB will review the individuals
     appeal package, along with DOHA recommendation (if applicable) and notify the individual
     through the CAF of the board’s final decision. See Attachment 5 for additional guidance on
     the PSAB.
8.7. Security Clearance Reinstatement. An individual’s commander may request
reinstatement of their security clearance 12 months after the effective date of revocation or
denial or decision of the PSAB, whichever is later. Requests should be sent to the CAF with
the commander’s recommendation for approval. The commander includes an explanation on
how the individual’s behavior has improved and the appropriate documentation corresponding to
the reason(s) for the denial or revocation. The documentation required depends on the reason(s)
involved, such as, evaluation for mental health issues, evaluation for drug or alcohol abuse; or
current financial statement(s).
8.8. Special Access Programs. Administrative due process for special access programs is
handled separately. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
8.9. Obtaining Permission to Proceed in Courts-Martial, Administrative Discharges, and
Civilian.
     8.9.1. Unit commanders contemplating disciplinary or administrative action against
     military members or civilian employees that could lead to a discharge or removal must first
     obtain permission to proceed when personnel hold a special access. Do not take action on
     personnel who now hold or have held access within the periods specified below, to Single
     Integrated Operational Plan-Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI), SCI, research
     and development (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or other
     special access program information until the appropriate special access program office
     approves. (Exceptions are for investigative and preliminary administrative procedures until
     the proposed action has been reviewed and approved by the functional activities having
     overall ownership for the affected information.) Commanders send a written request to the
     appropriate special access program functional office for permission to proceed with further
     processing as outlined below. Apply security classification according to message
     contents. The request must include:
        8.9.1.1. The individual’s name, SSAN, age, marital status, duty assignment, unit
        assignment, date of separation and length of service of the member.
        8.9.1.2. The name of the official who authorized SCI or other special access. Include
        inclusive dates that the person was given access and the units involved.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                          55


     8.9.1.3. The specific reason for the proposed ―for cause‖ action. Include the maximum
     sentence and type of separation, or discharge, or dismissal allowable.
     8.9.1.4. The type of separation, discharge, or dismissal contemplated in administrative
     cases, and the commander’s recommended type of discharge certificate to be issued.
     8.9.1.5. The type of court-martial, to include a description of offenses, with an outline
     of proposed charges and specifications; data as to any restraint; and any unusual
     circumstances which may affect the trial.
     8.9.1.6. Comparable data for civilian employees.
     8.9.1.7. Any other information bearing on the proposed action.
  8.9.2. For SCI access contact the servicing MAJCOM or FOA Senior Intelligence Officer
  (SIO) for persons having current SCI access, and persons debriefed within the past three
  years, where damage assessment is considered minimal. Contact the servicing Special
  Security Office (SSO) to determine if the individual had SCI access. Commanders will
  continue to forward ―Authority to Proceed‖ requests, where disclosure could result in serious
  damage, to SSO HQ USAF/INSD for AF Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and
  Reconnaissance (HQ USAF/XOI) approval. Send the request as a Defense Special Security
  Communications System (DSSCS) message through the SSO to the MAJCOM or FOA
  SIO and to SSO HQ USAF/INSD. See AFMAN 14-304 for detailed instructions on how to
  prepare the DSSCS message.
  8.9.3. For SIOP-ESI access. Refer to AFI 10-1102, Safeguarding the Single Integrated
  Operational Plan (SIOP).
     8.9.3.1. (Added-USAFE) SIOP is now known as Nuclear Command and Control
     Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2-ESI).
  8.9.4. For R&D access contact SAF/AQL for persons having current access to R&D
  special access programs and persons debriefed within the past year.
  8.9.5. For persons who have had a duty assignment with AFOSI and have held an AFOSI
  special access contact HQ AFOSI/IVO. The personnel records will reflect AFOSI
  employment or assignment. Commanders contact the local AFOSI detachment commander
  or HQ AFOSI/IVO to determine if the person held an AFOSI special access.
  8.9.6. For multiple accesses, commanders must obtain separate authorizations from each
  appropriate action agency listed above prior to proceeding.
  8.9.7. Processing goals at all command levels must comply with the speedy trial requirement
  and the potentially more restrictive time requirements in civilian removal actions.
  Normally, the processing time period should be concluded within 15 days; measured from
  the date of initiation request, to the date of approval; or denial by the OPR. Voluntary
  separations of airmen, officers, and civilian resignations will not be handled under these
  procedures unless they are in lieu of adverse action. For voluntary separations that are in lieu
  of adverse action, do not allow the separation authority to approve the separation until the
  appropriate action office grants authority to proceed.
  8.9.8. If a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing of the
  case may proceed through preferral of charges and completion of the investigation
56                AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


     required by Article 32, UCMJ together with collateral actions required under Article 32.
     Under no circumstances may the charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action
     office grants authority to proceed. Actions required by this paragraph do not apply to
     summary court-martials.
     8.9.9. If a commander contemplates discharging an enlisted member, processing of a
     "notification" case or a board hearing entitlement may proceed through giving the member
     notice of the proposed discharge, obtaining the member's response, scheduling necessary
     appointments, and conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the
     discharge be "approved" by the separation authority until the appropriate action office
     grants authority to proceed. For board hearing cases, the processing may proceed through
     initiation of the case, obtaining the member’s response, scheduling necessary appointments,
     and conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the convening authority
     order the board to be convened to hear the case until the appropriate action office grants
     authority to proceed.
     8.9.10. If a commander or staff agency chief contemplates discharging an officer, the
     show cause authority may not initiate the discharge, issue the show cause memorandum,
     or otherwise require officers to show cause for retention until the appropriate action office
     grants authority to proceed.
     8.9.11. If a supervisor contemplates removal action against a civilian employee who holds
     special access, the supervisor must first coordinate with the servicing CPF. The
     commander of the unit to which the civilian is assigned will then forward a message to the
     appropriate Air Force OPR. Under no circumstances may a "notice of proposed removal"
     be issued until the Air Force OPR grants authority to proceed.
     8.9.12. Periodic reporting by the unit commanders should advise the parent MAJCOM and
     decision authority of any changes to the proposed action every 90 days until the action has
     been completed. If the nature of the case changes significantly (for example, from discharge
     to court martial or from voluntary to involuntary discharge), the unit commander should
     notify the decision authority and seek further instruction. Unit commanders should transmit
     a final report when the adverse action has been completed. In the final report, include date

 NOTES:
 1. A NACLC is a prerequisite for military members upon entry. DOD civilians receive a
 NACIC as a prerequisite for federal employment. These investigations exceed the required
 investigations and can be used for unescorted entry.
 2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current ENTNAC or NAC on file may have unescorted
 entry to restricted areas while in civilian status, pending completion of the required NACIC.
80              AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


 3. Prior ENTNAC/NAC/NACI/NACIC investigations meet the requirements for prior military
 members who have been separated. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the
 investigative requirements for unescorted entry to restricted areas containing Protection Level
 (PL) 2 and or 3 resources pending completion of a favorable NACLC, NAC, or NACIC after
 favorable review of the completed personnel security questionnaire for the investigation.
 4. Installation records checks on employees in child care services include a check of the state
 criminal history repository. The state criminal history repository checks are for suitability
 affecting the consolidated civilian personnel office and morale, welfare, and recreation
 programs. The sponsoring activity sends out and receives the state criminal history repository.
 5. The NAC must consist of: (a) host-government law enforcement and security agency
 records check at the city, state, province, and national level, (b) DCII check, and (c) FBI check
 where information exists indicating residence by the foreign national in the United States for
 one year or more since the age 18.

NOTES:
1. Send a request letter through channels to the approving authority when non-US nationals or
immigrant alien personnel require limited access to Secret or Confidential defense information or
unescorted entry to PL 1, 2, or 3 restricted areas.
2. Complete items 10 through 14 when an investigation or a security clearance is required. The
LFC is not required when recording special access program authorizations, unless specified in the
governing directive. This guidance also applies to sections IV and V.
3. If the individual records derogatory information in Section VII, promptly notify the requester and
security information file custodians. This action determines if re-adjudication of the person’s
security clearance is necessary by the CAF. This guidance also applies to Section V.
4. Ensure the request process includes a review of SK for evidence of an UIF concerning the
member. Also, review personnel records to determine if derogatory information exists from a
personnel security standpoint. Check personnel records to confirm other data, such as employment
or military service as listed on SF Form 86, when necessary. Persons designated to sign Item 14 of
the form must take or confirm these actions. Enter results of these reviews in Section VII.
5. Note that this authority may be delegated to other medical staff personnel who may review
medical records and form professional opinions based on the information being evaluated. If no
medical records are on file (as for many civil service employees) annotate the form to that effect.
The DD Form 1879 then shows no local medical records were checked and DSS agents check the
records.
6. Review the records of the security clearance function and reports and analysis section. If a SIF
exists, deny the requested personnel security action pending completion of adjudication actions. In
these cases, also enter in Section VII that a SIF exists. Also, review the remarks section for any
other derogatory information reported and evaluate the need to establish a SIF for further
adjudication. Enter results of this evaluation in Section VII.
7. Annotate Section VII to reflect what document was used to verify citizenship status.

                                          Attachment 24
                                    SMITH AMENDMENT

A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a
new section that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the DoD
under four specific circumstances as outlined below.
   A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts,
   including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the
   amount of time actually served.
   A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline
   relative to current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or
   addicted to, a controlled substance.
   A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for
   emotional, mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent
   (incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health
   professional approved by DoD.
   A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the
   Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.
A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions
(1) & (4). Waiver authority is not delegable.
A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and
may not be waived.
A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due
process and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this
instruction.
A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance
in cases where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the
waiver provision, provided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond.
The subject must include in the response to the statement of reasons if they want to be
considered for a waiver, if applicable.
A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious
waiver:
A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants a
meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded with the
proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security Appeal
Board (PSAB) for review.
   A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is
   returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
       A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with
       recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                        117


A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month following
the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides report
to USD/I by the 15th.
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
   A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and
   determinations to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;
   A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation
   reveals a previous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory
   provisions, regardless of the presence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
   A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated
   for other reasons; such as:
       A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending
       cases in which a final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.
A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
   A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances,
   including transfers of clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who
   fall under the National Industrial Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of
   employees coming from other Federal agencies.

2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. The scope of each type of
personnel security investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See Attachment 2 for
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                         121


procedures on requesting personnel security investigations (PSI). See Attachment 3 for guidance
on the types of required personnel security investigations and appropriate questionnaire forms
and or Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this instruction are the
only PSIs authorized. The Secretary of the Air Force and/or the Under Secretary of Defense,
Intelligence must approve raising or lowering the scope of the authorized investigation.

2.5 Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel
Management
(OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.
2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the overseas
portion of personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and State Department
counterparts.
3.11. Interim Security Clearances. Commanders may grant interim security clearances for
access to Top Secret and Secret information when the requirements of DoD 5200.2-R, paragraph
3.401 have been met. Use of local information and the following requirements provide
Commanders with the necessary tools to exercise their authority to grant interim security
clearances. Also see Attachment 25, Table A25.1 for guidance on the authority level to grant
interim security clearance/access to specific programs.
3.11.1. Interim Top Secret security clearances:
3.11.1.1 Favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI completed.
3.11.1.2. Consult the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to determine the existence of a
favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI. The investigation is acceptable
if there is no break in service over two years.
3.11.1.3. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.1.4. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security force records, medical
records, and other security records, as appropriate.
3.11.1.5. SSBI package has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to the investigative
agency provider.
3.11.2. Commanders can grant interim Top Secret security clearance if the above provisions have
been met.
3.11.3. If there is no record of a completed investigation (NAC portion) in JPAS, contact Air
Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) Customer Support through JPAS to determine if
there is a favorable NAC. (Note Optional: Authorized requesters can request ―Advanced NAC
Results‖ from OPM on the OPM Agency Use Sheet.)
3.11.4. Interim Secret security clearances:
3.11.4.1. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.4.2. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security forces records,
medical records, and other security records, as appropriate.
122              AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


3.11.4.3. NACLC or ANACI has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to an investigative
agency provider.
3.11.5. Interim security clearances must be documented in JPAS or in writing if JPAS is
unavailable, until the final security clearance eligibility is granted by the AFCAF.
3.11.6. For Civilians:
3.11.6.1. Consult JPAS on a newly hired civilian for a previous security clearance/personnel
security investigation to determine if a previous security clearance was held as a former military
member (without a break in service of two years) or if a security clearance as either an Air
Reserve Technician or as a traditional reservist was held.
3.11.6.2. Pending completion of ANACIs or SSBIs, as appropriate, civilians may occupy non-
critical sensitive or critical sensitive positions. Commanders prepare a waiver of pre-employment
investigation requirements when such action is necessary and in the national interest. Interim
security clearance may not be granted until after the commander signs the waiver memorandum.
3.11.7. JPAS is the source for determining investigative status on pending investigations. Also
see para 7.9.


3.28. Periodic Reinvestigations (PR). PRs are required every 5 years for Top Secret and 10
years for Secret. Authorized requesters submit requests for reinvestigations to the DoD
Authorized Investigation Provider as outlined in A2.2.2.1. See AFI 31-406, Applying North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Protection Standards, for submission of PRs for NATO
investigations.


3.29. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Although such personnel normally only require a
Secret clearance, an SSBI is initially required due to training and assignments involving nuclear
weapons. Persons occupying an EOD position shall undergo a Secret PR on a five year recurring
basis.


5.2. Authorized Requesters.
5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs designate
authorized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general rule, the number of
authorized requesters will be kept to the minimum number required to meet mission
requirements. See Attachment 2 for request procedures.
5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number, and office
symbol of individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or investigative data on
individuals within their organization and provide copy to respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1 for
AFCAF address.
5.2.3. Authorized requesters may query the JCAVS or call the CAF Customer Support Section at
DSN 754-1242/43 to determine investigative and/or adjudicative status.
5.2.4. Authorized requesters approve and submit personnel security questionnaires to the DoD
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                           123


Authorized Personnel Investigation Provider according to Attachment 2.

5.5. Priority Requests. The following sensitive programs are authorized priority processing
service by OPM:
5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP ―C‖ coded case warrants ―Priority‖ service by OPM, the
authorized requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each
authorized requester will maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this purpose.
The spreadsheet will include all previously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all new
requirements the authorized requester is coordinating under this authority. When coordinating
new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to afx-ofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.
AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for monitoring the completion of the
investigation.
5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A, para
5), the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the completed
SF 86 for each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at the same time
the request for SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters
will expedite the processing of the SSBI off the installation to OPM and request priority level of
service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.
5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian,
contractor, or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual
citizen and/or possess/ use a foreign passport.
5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for
security clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the
exercise of dual citizenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a
disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that could
mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I, Foreign
Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual citizenship is one of the
conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in
preference to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is
paramount and could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security clearance
will be denied or revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official
approval for its use from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded through respective
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for processing to
SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the AF will gain from a person holding a foreign
passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the remarks field of the JPAS.
5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in item
15 of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form 86,
―Questionnaire for National Security Positions,‖ will be required to surrender the passport via
one of the following methods:
5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified receipt
mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return receipt will be
forwarded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1 for AFCAF address. If the name of adjudicator assigned
124              AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


to the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of the address.

5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the passport and
place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the destruction of the
passport in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to the AFCAF and a copy
provided to the subject.
5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and dual
citizenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the following must
be completed:
5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign citizenship
claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual renouncement is not required.
5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be
provided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine security
clearance eligibility.
5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance
determination is made.


6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) is
the Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave, Bolling AFB
20032.
6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102 and
Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security clearance or
assignment to sensitive duties.
6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see
Chapter 8).
6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility determination.
6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers on
pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often resolved
through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature dissemination
of unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could result in discriminatory practices with respect
to such areas as employments or assignments.
6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS
replaced Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.

7.1. General.
7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel
security clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                          125


7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military and
civilian position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to
determine suitability and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to
positions of trust/access to certain programs; and for security clearance. Each position is coded
with the appropriate position code reflecting the required investigation level in the unit manning
document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). These will also be
reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data System (HAF-MDS).
7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
7.2.1. l.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
7.2.2.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
7.2.2.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
7.2.2.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI).
7.2.2.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table A22.1.
7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last AF-wide
directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each May. Retain results
for review during self inspections, etc.
7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential needs.
7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.
7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). HQ USAF/XOS-FI
approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC prerequisites.
Requests are staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification and
AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement for entry, award, and
retention for the respective mandatory AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2, A22.3.
7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive programs
that have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential Support, Personnel
Reliability Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.
7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual
Exigencies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as a
minimum, be assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat
briefing. SSBIs are not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility ―just in case of‖
deployment. In these situations, commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up
to 180 days. This can be renewed for extended deployment purposes and for redeployment.
Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose of deployment based on the existing
NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will not be required for this
purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more than 24
months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available,
documented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a
joint or theater deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept
interims, i.e., JCS contingencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded
126             AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


IAW para 7.2 of this instruction.

7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent
authority is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the servicing
Manpower Office codes the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized cannot be delegated.
Approval authorities are as follows:
7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC.
7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the appropriate
grade level.
7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
7.6.4. HQ USAF:
7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA.
7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation will
be retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review by HQ
AFIA or their designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for personnel security
investigations through the FYDP.
7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents
assigned against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.
7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and
enters the determination into JPAS.
7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense
(DoD) personnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security
management for the DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers
both non-SCI and SCI functions. It interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel
systems within the Department thus eliminating manual transactions and expediting the flow of
personnel security information to warfighters.
7.9.1 JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations on
individuals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its customers. All
information in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the requirements for
privacy/sensitive information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in accordance with AFI 33-
332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of
Information Act Program.
7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and Joint
Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS).
7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case
management/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due process,
and future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative reports from the
investigative providers.
7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used throughout this
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                         127


instruction.

7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized requesters and
provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history, incident/issue file
reporting, history and management of unit personnel security functions.
7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as used
throughout this instruction.
7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance data
elements in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status
of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data elements are
incomplete.
7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more than one
entry appears for an individual.
7.9.3.2. The term ―DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)‖ means the person has been the subject of a
SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible for SCI access if
required for mission essential purposes and may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
7.9.4.1. An individual’s security clearance eligibility level and access level.
7.9.4.2. Visit notification.
7.9.4.3. Suspension notification.
7.9.4.4. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
7.9.4.5. Establishment of a SIF.
7.9.6. JCAVS User Levels are as follows:
7.9.6.1. Level 2 - SCI security personnel at unified command, DoD agency, military installation
or major command/equivalent headquarters. Personnel Security Management (PSM) - Net is
determined by the responsible SOIC or designee. (Read and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with
current SCI Access.)
7.9.6.2. Level 3 - SCI security personnel at echelons subordinate to Level 2 at a particular
geographic location (installation, base, post, naval vessel). PSM - Net is determined by the
responsible SOIC or designee. (Read and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with current SCI
Access.)

                            military and contractor personnel.          It is also the
                            reinvestigation requirement for federal employees at the
                            same access levels. Also, all military or Mandatory

                            determinations. A NAC is also an integral part of all
                            initial and periodic reinvestigations and is the baseline for
                            trustworthiness determinations.             Trustworthiness

 A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants a
 meritorious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded with the
 proposed request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security Appeal
 Board (PSAB) for review.
 A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is
 returned to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
 A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with
 recommendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
 A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month
 following the end of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA
 provides report to USD/I by the 15th.

                               Attachment 27 (Added-USAFE)
   LOCAL NATIONAL (LN) PERSONNEL SECURITY INVESTIGATION (PSI)
REQUIREMENTS FOR USAFE UNITS EXCEPT THOSE IN THE UK AND GERMANY

A27.1. (Added-USAFE) Overview. Non-US citizens or LNs employed by DOD Components
overseas, whose duties do not require access to classified information, require a National
Agency Check (NAC) equivalent PSI. The NAC equivalent PSI or NACLN will be completed
on all LN appropriated and non- appropriated employees, contractors, sub-contractors, to
include AAFES employees before employment or on-base volunteer work. As a minimum, a
NACLN must consist of:
   A27.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Host government law enforcement and security agency checks
   (HAC) at the city, state (province), and national level.
   A27.1.2. (Added-USAFE) A DCII check.
   A27.1.3. (Added-USAFE) An FBI check where information exists that indicates
   residence by the non-US citizen in the US for twelve or more consecutive months since age
   18; and:
   A27.1.4. (Added-USAFE) A Local Files Check (Security Forces Management Information
   System (SFMIS), Medical records, etc., as appropriate).
A27.2. (Added-USAFE) Position Sensitivity. All positions, to include contractor positions,
must be assigned a position sensitivity based on the duties and responsibilities of the position.
Most positions are considered non-sensitive unless their duties and responsibilities dictate
otherwise. For examples of sensitive positions, refer to Attachment 36 (Added).
   A27.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The sponsoring agency or unit (hiring agency) and a designated
   representative from the SFS will jointly determine if a position is sensitive based upon the
   nature, scope and sensitivity of the work being performed. Before the hiring process
   begins, all on-base job descriptions, contracts, or other position descriptions must clearly
   state that the duty position is non-sensitive or sensitive before any hiring or legally binding
   contract begins.
       A27.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the position cannot be jointly determined as sensitive or
       non-sensitive, the installation commander is the final determining authority. The
       installation commander may delegate this authority no lower than the mission support
       group deputy commander (MSG/ CD).
A27.3. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Investigative Requirements for Employment:
   A27.3.1. (Added-USAFE) LNs may be employed and allowed to perform the non-
   sensitive portion of appropriated and nonappropriated fund sensitive positions, to include
   certain contractors, subcontractors, and employees performing or being considered for
   contracts, only after favorable completion of the DCII and LFC and the HAC and FBI check
   (when applicable) have been initiated and are pending. Additionally, individuals may
   perform the sensitive portion of employment if under constant supervision by an
   individual whose background checks have been completed, with no derogatory reports,
   once the LFC is favorable and the HAC and FBI check (where applicable) have been initiated
   and are pending.
146            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


   A27.3.2. (Added-USAFE) LNs may not be employed in any capacity if a LFC identifies
   derogatory and or unfavorable information, until a suitability determination on the
   information and or the case is favorably completed.
   A27.3.3. (Added-USAFE) All LNs requiring unclassified Local Area Network (LAN) IT
   level 3 access or unescorted entry into Protection Level (PL) 3 restricted areas must have a
   fully completed favorable NACLN before access is granted. Interim access is prohibited.
A27.4. (Added-USAFE) Child-care or Youth Activity Workers. For child-care or youth
activity workers, expand the HAC, whenever permissible by the laws of the host government to
include agencies which maintain data banks on child abusers and molesters, as required in AFI
34-276, Family Child Care Programs and AFMAN 34-310, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel
Program Management and Administration.
A27.5. (Added-USAFE) Third Country Nationals (TCN):
   A27.5.1. (Added-USAFE) TCN Dependents of US Personnel. TCN dependents of US
   personnel employed by DoD Components overseas, whose duties do not require access to
   classified information, must meet the investigative requirements outlined in AFI 31-501,
   paragraph A24.1.1 except that the appropriate US PSI commensurate with the position will
   be completed instead of the host country HAC. Normally, the NAC PSI will be submitted;
   however, the type of PSI may vary depending on the sensitivity of the position. It is the
   responsibility of the OPR to ensure the appropriate US PSI is submitted.
   A27.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Other TCNs.              The employment of TCNs other than
   dependents of US personnel is largely dependent on the individual’s permission to be ―in‖
   and ―work in‖ the host nation and the host nation response to the HAC.
       A27.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Before employment, employer needs verification that the
       TCN has received permission and or authority to be in and work in the host country.
       A27.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Host Nation HAC Responses:
              A27.5.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) If the host nation responds that a HAC cannot be
              or will not be performed because the TCN hasn’t resided in the host country for
              the required period of time, there is insufficient data on file, etc., then that is a
              decision provided by the ―host government‖, the HAC was ―not‖ completed, and
              the individual cannot be employed. LNs or TCNs denied a HAC for residency
              cannot resubmit until sufficient residency is obtained.
              A27.5.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) If the host nation responds that they have
              performed the HAC and there is no information on file because the TCN hasn’t
              resided in the host country for the required period of time, or that they have
              ―performed‖ the HAC and no data is available on the TCN, then that is a decision
              provided by the ―host government‖, the HAC ―was‖ completed, and the
              individual ―could‖ be hired. In this case, an employment suitability decision
              should be made.
       A27.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) It is not uncommon for the TCN to be ineligible for
       the Host Agency Check because they have not resided in the requesting country for the
       required length of time for the HAC to be conducted. In these situations, the TCN
       may provide their country’s equivalent of the HAC. The equivalent document must:
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                      147


              A27.5.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Be the original copy and translated into English
              and notarized.
              A27.5.2.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Reflect a favorable background investigation
              result. If not, a suitability determination must be completed.
              A27.5.2.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Be dated within 90 days of entry on duty.
              A27.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Since other country HACs are limited in scope,
              additional measures and considerations must be taken; specifically:
              A27.5.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Closely scrutinizes unescorted installation
              access requirements and limits the number of days and times when access is
              allowed.
              A27.5.2.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Deny unescorted installation access sign-in
              privileges.
              A27.5.2.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Limit employment or contract performance only
              to non-sensitive duties.
A27.6. (Added-USAFE) Program Management. The local CPF is the program manager or
OPR for LN appropriated and nonappropriated fund employee PSIs; however, this may vary

   CIVILIAN PERSONNEL FLIGHTS (CPF) AND HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICES
                               (HRO)

A28.1. (Added-USAFE) General. As prescribed throughout this instruction, CPF and HRO
have specific responsibilities and requirements in support of the Personnel Security program.
This attachment further clarifies those responsibilities and outlines additional responsibilities and
requirements that apply to CPF and HRO within USAFE.
A28.2. (Added-USAFE) CPFs:
       A28.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Initial PSIs. The CPF is responsible for the submission
       of all NAC/ NACIC PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to
       non-sensitive position and initial ANACI PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian
       employees assigned to noncritical sensitive positions. The CPF is not responsible for
       the submission of initial PSIs for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to
       any critical sensitive position. The appropriate USM will submit all initial PSIs for
       appropriated fund DoD civilian employees assigned to a critical sensitive position to the
       Air Force (AF) authorized requester.
       A28.2.2. (Added-USAFE) PRs. The CPF is not responsible for the submission of any
       PRs for appropriated fund DoD civilian employees, regardless of the position sensitivity.
       The appropriate USM will submit all PRs for appropriated fund DoD civilians to the SF
       authorized requester.
       A28.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Verification of Prior Federal Employment and PSIs. The
       CPF will verify all prior federal employment and PSIs for appropriated fund DoD
       civilian employees to determine whether a PSI must be submitted. JPAS will be utilized
       to verify prior PSIs. If verification confirms continuous prior federal employment with
       no break in service longer than 24 months and the prior completion of the appropriate
       PSI for the sensitivity of the position, no further action is required; otherwise, a new PSI
       is required. Recertification of previous PSIs is no longer required.
       A28.2.4. (Added-USAFE) LFC. Although AFI 31-501, paragraph A2.6.3 states the
       AF Form 2583 is not needed for civilian applicants for federal employment when local
       files are unavailable, this exemption has been overcome by events and technology. An
       SF and medical records LFC is required. If a medical record is not available, the medical
       facility will annotate same on the AF Form 2583. The CPF will complete an AF Form
       2583 for all new DoD civilian employees prior to the submission of any PSI. The CPF
       will retain the original copy of the completed AF Form 2583 on file until the investigation
       is closed and favorably adjudicated as verified in JPAS.
       A28.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Submitting PSIs:
       A28.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Documenting Submitted PSIs in JPAS. The CPF or the SF

  A28.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Verification of Prior Federal Employment and PSIs. The
  HRO will verify all prior federal employment and PSIs for US nonappropriated fund DoD
  civilian employees before submitting any initial PSIs. JPAS will be utilized to verify prior
  PSIs. If verification confirms continuous prior federal employment with no break in service
  longer than 24 months and the prior completion of the appropriate PSI for the sensitivity of
  the position, no further action is required; otherwise, a new PSI is required. Recertification of
  previous PSIs is no longer required.

  are unavailable, this exemption has been overcome by events and technology. An SF and
  medical records LFC is required. If a medical record is not available, the medical facility will
  annotate same on the AF Form 2583. The HRO will complete and coordinate an AF Form
  2583 for all new US nonappropriated DoD civilian employees prior to the submission of any
  PSI.

   (NAC) equivalent investigation. The NAC equivalent investigation will be completed on all
   employees and some contractors to include subcontractors as stated in paragraph A34.2
   (Added). As a minimum, the NAC must consist of:
        A34.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Host government law enforcement and security agency
        checks at the city, state (province), and national level, whenever permissible by the laws
        of the host government. In the UK, this Host Agency Check (HAC) is conducted by the
        Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Vetting Agency (DVA).
        A34.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) A Defense Clearance and Investigation Index (DCII)
        check. Installation security forces (SF) will conduct the DCII check for all employees.
        A34.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) check. All
        potential employees will complete a USAFE Form 19, Residency Check for
        Employment with US Air Forces in Europe. When determined that a prospective
        employee resided in the US for 12 or more consecutive months since age 18, the hiring
        agency will forward the USAFE Form 19 to SFS who in-turn will forward to AFOSI,
        which will request an FBI name check. The FBI check consists of a review of files for
        information of a security nature. AFOSI will provide the results to the installation
        Security Forces Administration and Reports (SFA) Flight.
        A34.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Local Files Check (LFC). The LFC is a check of local
        SF files to uncover the existence of unfavorable information. The LFC will consist of a
        SF records check in the Security Forces Management Information System and a check of
        the installation barment roster.
        A34.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) When these investigations are completed, they will be
        recorded on AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action, in the remarks
        section, section VII. The note should include, at a minimum, type of investigation, date
        completed and whether the results were favorable or not.
A34.3. (Added-USAFE) Background Investigations. There are three levels of background
investigations that meet the standards set down by this and higher-level instructions in reference
to para A34.2.1.1 (Added) of this attachment. The level of background check required will
depend on whether the position is considered sensitive or non-sensitive. Attachment 36 (Added)
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                         161


identifies sensitive positions. Employment is dependent upon the employee having updated
clearance checks.
   A34.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The Counter Terrorist Check (CTC). The CTC is a national-
   level security and police background investigation conducted by the DVA. This is the
   minimum check required for all employees in non-sensitive positions and for
   contractors/subcontractors in non-sensitive positions requiring unescorted installation access.
   The CTC expires three years from the issue date. The expiration date on USAFE Form 77,
   Base Entry Identification, based on a CTC will not exceed 3 years from the issue date of
   the CTC. If an employee's employment exceeds this 3 years, they must have the CTC
   investigation renewed.
   A34.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The Security Check (SC). The SC includes all of the
   elements of the CTC but is a more comprehensive investigation and includes such actions as a
   credit check, interviewing relatives, determining and evaluating the individual’s involvement
   in various organizations, verifying any past military experience, etc. This is the
   minimum check required for employees and contractor personnel in sensitive positions.
   Most SCs expire 5 years from the issue date. The expiration date on the USAFE Form 77
   based on the SC will not exceed 5 years from the issue date of the USAFE Form 77,
   expiration of the contract or the expiration date of the SC whichever is less. If an
   employee's employment exceeds the expiration date on their SC, they must have the SC
   investigation renewed. If DVA has determined the SC is good for longer than 5 years, an
   investigation renewal will not be required until the expiration date of the SC as determined by
   DVA, but a USAFE Form 77 cannot be issued for longer than 5 years at one time.
   A34.3.3. (Added-USAFE) The Developed Vetting (DV). This higher level of security
   background investigation is needed for the most sensitive jobs and tasks. DVs are normally
   not required for Air Force needs; however if Air Force civilian employees support another
   mission which requires the DV, then the supported mission will be responsible for funding
   the DVs.
   A34.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Investigation renewal. All employees renewing their
   background investigation will complete an MOD Form 1109, Security Questionnaire. On
   the front cover of the form, under General Details, the employee will mark the appropriate
   block indicating a security questionnaire has been completed before and will complete the
   form with current information. Refer to para A34.13 (Added) for the submittal process.
   This renewal process must be validated and submitted by the hiring or sponsoring
   organization 6 months prior to the current background expiration date to avoid a possible
   lapse in employment and installation access.
A34.4. (Added-USAFE) Position Sensitivity. All positions, to include contractor positions,
must be assigned a position sensitivity based on the duties and responsibilities of the position.
Most positions are considered non-sensitive unless their duties and responsibilities dictate
otherwise. For examples of sensitive positions, refer to Attachment 36 (Added). The minimum
check required for sensitive positions is the SC.
   A34.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The sponsoring agency or unit (hiring agency) and a designated
   representative from the SFS will jointly determine if a position is sensitive based upon the
   nature, scope and sensitivity of the work being performed. Before the hiring process
   begins, all on-base job descriptions, contracts, or other position descriptions must clearly
162             AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


   state that the duty position is non-sensitive or sensitive before any hiring or legally binding
   contract begins.
       A34.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the position cannot be jointly determined as sensitive or
       non-sensitive, the installation commander is the final determining authority. The
       installation commander may delegate this authority no lower than the mission support
       group deputy commander (MSG/ CD).
       A34.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) GSU commanders will not delegate this authority.
   A34.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Multi-base Non-US Employees and Contractors. Where
   positions exist that require an employee to have access to multiple US occupied installations,
   those installations must jointly determine position sensitivity. If differences cannot be
   resolved at the installation commander level, HQ USAFE/A7S is the final decision authority.
   This authority can be delegated to HQ USAFE/ A7SX.
   A34.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Once the LFC and DCII checks have been favorably completed
   and the MOD Form 1109 submitted to SF, personnel hired in non-sensitive positions can
   begin to work. With the same checks completed, a person hired in a sensitive position can
   work in the non-sensitive portions of their job. They can also be permitted to work in the
   sensitive portions under constant supervision. This does not include having LAN access or
   unescorted access to restricted areas. Personnel will not be granted installation unescorted
   access until the LFC, DCII, FBI and HAC checks are favorably completed. Positive control
   is required at all times for personnel escorted on the installation. Individuals escorting will
   keep all escorted individuals in line of sight at all times while on the installation.
A34.5. (Added-USAFE) Minimum Investigative Requirements for Non US National
Employment.
   A34.5.1. (Added-USAFE) (Added-USAFE) For prospective employees, the LFC d DCII
   checks must be completed and the CTC/SC/DV and FBI (if required) checks submitted prior
   to employment. Until all required checks are completed, personnel will not be granted
   unescorted access to installations and will require continuous supervision by a qualified and
   authorized escort. The hiring or sponsoring organization must plan for and provide
   authorizes escort officials for their personnel.
   A34.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The hiring agency must receive official notice from the MOD
   Liaison Office (MODLO) that the DVA has granted the prospective employee the appropriate
   DVA clearance. This notice will be given via the installation SFA. The Basic Check (BC)
   must be favorably completed prior to the CTC/SC/DV being authorized.
   A34.5.3. (Added-USAFE) All employees requiring unclassified LAN IT level 3
   access or unescorted entry into PL 3 restricted areas must have a fully completed favorable
   NAC before access is granted. Interim access is prohibited.
A34.6. (Added-USAFE) MOD Personnel. MOD indirect-hire employees have sufficient
clearance and are not required to go through additional checks.
A34.7. (Added-USAFE) Defence Estates and the RAF Station Warden. Once position
sensitivity is jointly determined with the Security Forces, the local Defence Estates and Royal
Air Force (RAF) Station Warden must function as their own authorized requestor and deal
directly with DVA for MOD Form 1109 submissions, tracking, and security clearance actions
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                         163


on their prospective employees, contractors, subcontractors, sponsored or supervised persons.
Defence Estates or RAF Station Warden must submit a valid MOD Form 1109 to DVA to
initiate the HAC process and consequently must administer all coordination with DVA
background investigations. Upon receipt of a favorable DVA clearance notification, Defence
Estates or RAF Station Warden must provide the security forces a signed verification letter with
the employees completed DVA clearance type, certificate number, issue date, and expiration
date. If the position meets local criteria and duties require an escort capability, the sponsoring
unit authorized pass requestor annotates the USAFE Form 79, Request for Base Entry
Identification, block 16B as yes and enters Escort Official as the sign-in privilege explanation
on the pass request.
A34.8. (Added-USAFE) Third Country Nationals (TCN).
   A34.8.1. (Added-USAFE) TCN Dependents of US Personnel. TCN dependents of US
   personnel require the appropriate US background investigation, NAC Personnel Security
   Investigation, commensurate with the position instead of the UK DVA investigation. If a
   TCN dependent has a current DVA CTC/SC/DV, this is sufficient to meet the requirements of
   this instruction. It is the responsibility of the hiring agency to ensure the appropriate
   investigation is submitted for TCN employees.
   A34.8.1. (SPANGDAHLEMAB) Third Country Nationals who are dependents of United
   States (US) personnel will have a US NAC or NACI submitted by the Office of Primary
   Responsibility (OPR). These individuals also require an Federal Bureau of Investigation
   (FBI) files check (when applicable) and a LFC. Suitability determinations, if required, are
   made by the OPR in the same way that local suitability determinations are made for US
   citizens.
   A34.8.2. (Added-USAFE) Other TCNs. The employment of TCNs other than dependents
   of US personnel is largely dependent on the individual’s permission to be ―in‖ and ―work in‖
   the UK and the DVA's response to the investigation request. If the DVA responds to the
   request that they are unable to complete the required investigation, the individual cannot be
   employed. Before employment, the hiring agency/unit will verify in writing that the TCN
   has received permission and, or authority to be in and work in the UK by the Host Nation.
A34.9. (Added-USAFE) US Citizens in Local National (LN) Positions. US citizens
selected for LN funded positions or billets, to include applicable contractor positions, must
complete the appropriate US background investigation requirements, unless they have a current
DVA CTC, SC, or DV check commensurate with the position. The hiring agencies' unit security
manager (USM) will submit such personnel through the US personnel security investigation
system.
A34.10. (Added-USAFE) Suitability            Determinations. An      employment      suitability
determination is required when derogatory or unfavorable information is identified on an
LFC, DCII and, or FBI check. Local procedures must allow for termination of employment
when an employee's information is deemed "unfavorable," providing such information is
sufficient to support termination action in accordance with host country laws and, or labor
agreements. Personnel who have unfavorable information identified during an LFC, DCII or
FBI check may not be hired in any capacity until a suitability determination is "favorably"
completed. Installation commanders are the final authority to determine employment
suitability if derogatory information is identified on the LFC, DCII or FBI check. Commanders
164             AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


may delegate this authority to, but not lower than, the MSG/CD. All suitability determination
results must be documented in a formal memorandum. Personnel who are denied a DVA
clearance must appeal the decision to DVA. If DVA again denies the clearance it may be
appealed to the Secretary Security Vetting Appeals Panel after which, if denied again, this is
sufficient mitigation and the individual will be denied access to the installation and cannot
resume employment. During the appeals process or after initial notification of the denied
clearance, the individual cannot be employed, until a favorable DVA clearance is obtained.
   A34.10.1. (Added-USAFE) Suitability determinations for information received from the
   LFC, DCII or FBI checks will be accomplished using the following procedures.
       A34.10.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The local SF commander will assess the information and
       provide a written opinion as to whether the information demonstrates an actual or
       potential security risk.
       A34.10.1.2. (Added-USAFE) If, in the opinion of the local SF commander, the
       information does not represent a security risk, the opinion shall be passed directly to the
       hiring agency commander.
       A34.10.1.3. (Added-USAFE) If, in the opinion of the local SF commander, the
       information poses an actual or potential security risk; this adverse opinion will be
       forwarded to the servicing base legal office for a legal review.
          A34.10.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Following the legal review, the adverse opinion
          will be forwarded either to (a) the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) or
          appropriate personnel office (AAFES, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) or
          Department of Defense Dependent School (DoDDS)) for directly hired personnel or
          (b) the commander of the hiring agency for contractor or subcontractor personnel.
          A34.10.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) For prospective directly hired applicants, the
          appropriate personnel office will provide an opinion to the applicable
          commander as to whether the adverse opinion provides a basis upon which to refuse
          employment.
          A34.10.1.3.3. (Added-USAFE) For directly hired employees or prospective directly
          hired applicants, the appropriate personnel office will forward the adverse opinion,
          the legal review and personnel office opinion to the hiring agency commander. If
          the commander wishes to continue the individual’s employment or accept a
          prospective applicant for employment, he or she must forward a written request,
          through the appropriate SFS, to the appropriate installation commander or designated
          representative for final determination. This determination authority cannot be
          delegated below the MSG/CD or GSU commander.
          A34.10.1.3.4. (Added-USAFE) For contractor or subcontractor personnel, the
          hiring agency’s commander determines whether the adverse opinion provides a basis
          upon which to refuse access to the installation. If the commander wishes to allow the
          individual installation access to perform contracted work, he or she must forward
          a written request, through the appropriate SFS, to the appropriate installation
          commander (or designated representative) for final determination.                This
          determination authority cannot be delegated below the MSG/CD or GSU commander.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                       165


   A34.10.2. (Added-USAFE) If the individual has been issued a USAFE Form 77 the hiring
   agency/ unit will recover the identification (ID) media.
      A34.10.2.1. (Added-USAFE) For contractor or subcontractor personnel, SF will
      notify the hiring agency upon notification by MODLO that a contractor employee has
      been denied a DVA clearance for cause. The hiring agency will notify the appropriate
      Contracting Officer who will inform the contractor. If the contractor employee already
      possesses a USAFE Form 77, SF will notify the hiring agency that the card must be
      taken from the individual until a final determination is made. SF will also notify the
      installation commander of the situation immediately. Defence Estates and RAF Station
      Warden will notify Security Forces (SF) of DVA clearances that are denied for cause,
      residency or no determination made. Appeals or suitability determinations must follow
      procedures in paragraph A34.10 (Added).
A34.11. (Added-USAFE) Procedures to follow when DVA will not grant a clearance and
in marginal cases.
   A34.11.1. (Added-USAFE) If DVA cannot grant a clearance because it is unable to
   conduct the background check for any reason, the person being checked cannot be
   employed. For TCN dependents of US personnel, the guidance provided in para A34.8.1
   (Added) must be followed.
   A34.11.2. (Added-USAFE) "Marginal Cases" are cases in which DVA requires more
   information about the position an individual is being hired for before it can make a
   determination. The Security Forces SFA Flight Chief will act as the DVA single point of
   contact to receive DVA Marginal Cases.
A34.12. (Added-USAFE) Financing DVA Investigations.
   A34.12.1. (Added-USAFE) Directorate of Logistics (HQ USAFE/A4) will enter into and
   maintain currency of an Acquisition and Cross-Service Agreement (ACSC) with the British
   MOD to conduct investigations as listed in this instruction. As required, HQ USAFE/A7S is
   responsible for providing HQ USAFE/A4 amplifying instructions to be included as an
   attachment to the ACSC.
   A34.12.2. (Added-USAFE) Installations will develop procedures to transfer the appropriate
   amount of funds to MODLO in order to pay for the DVA investigations in accordance with the
   US-UK Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement. Each month, MODLO will forward a
   billing invoice listing completed background checks to the installation SFS. SF will
   validate that the invoice is accurate and forward it to the installation comptroller squadron
   which will charge the appropriate organizations and pay the bill to MODLO.
A34.13. (Added-USAFE) Procedures for Obtaining a DVA Background Investigation.
   A34.13.1. (Added-USAFE) Applicant, proposed employee will:
      A34.13.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Complete MOD Form 1109 and provide to the employer.
      A34.13.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Along with the completed MOD Form 1109, provide the
      employer with identification credentials and references in accordance with MOD
      procedures clarified in Table A34.1 (Added) and Paragraph A34.15 (Added).
   A34.13.2. (Added-USAFE) Hiring Agency will:
166            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009


      A34.13.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Coordinate MOD Forms 1109 submissions with SFS.
      A34.13.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Verify completion of the Basic Check (BCVR) by
      confirming the employee’s identification using credentials as listed in Table A34.1
      (Added) and ensuring the appropriate references as defined in paragraph A34.15
      (Added) are in order. When the BCVR is completed in conjunction with a SC/CTC, only
      one reference is required. The employing agency representative that completed the check
      must sign the BCVR.
      A34.13.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Have the employee complete the USAFE Form
      19. When information identifies residence by the potential employee in the US for
      12 or more consecutive months since age 18, the hiring agency will forward the USAFE
      Form 19 to SFS who will forward to AFOSI, which will request a FBI name check.
      A34.13.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Verify that the MOD Form 1109 turned in by the
      employee is completed properly with all of the necessary information.
      A34.13.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Forward the completed MOD Form 1109 and other
      security forms to the installation SFA flight.
      A34.13.2.6. (Added-USAFE) When informed by SFA that all investigations, checks
      are complete with favorable results, complete a USAFE Form 79 and have employee
      hand-carry the form to SFA with identification credentials.
      A34.13.2.7. (Added-USAFE) Once this process is completed, maintain the BCVR,
      USAFE Form 19, AF Form 2583, USAFE Form 79 and any DVA clearance
      information as long as the employee remains with the employing agency. All documents
      must be readily available for Security Forces or Higher Headquarters inspections and
      verification.
      A34.13.2.8. (Added-USAFE) Retrieve the USAFE Form 77 from the employee if the
      employment is terminated prior to the USAFE Form 77’s expiration date.
      A34.13.2.9. (Added-USAFE) Report any negative information received on an
      employee during the time of employment to the installation SF so it can be determined by
      DVA if such information will affect the clearance held.
      A34.13.2.10. (Added-USAFE) Contact SF in all cases when employment is terminated.
   A34.13.3. (Added-USAFE) The hiring or sponsoring organization USMs should track
   investigations and notify employees of the need for reinvestigation requirements prior to the
   expiration of the current check (refer to para A34.3.4 (Added)). If an employee’s
   investigation expires prior to their employment being terminated, they will not maintain
   unescorted access to the installation.
   A34.13.4. Installation SF will:
      A34.13.4.1. Ensure accessibility of MOD form 1109 for agencies/units.
      A34.13.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Receive and review the MOD Form 1109 (or signed
      verification letters from Defence Estates or RAF Station Warden) from the hiring
      agency for completeness. Return to requesting agency/unit for any corrections needed.
      A34.13.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Forward the correct MOD Form 1109 to MODLO.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                 167


     A34.13.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Review the BCVR to ensure the proper BC was
     conducted on the employee.
     A34.13.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Notify MODLO anytime information is received from
     the hiring agency requiring a DVA background investigation on a proposed employee to
     be terminated.
     A34.13.4.6. (Added-USAFE) Ensure completion of LFC and DCII check and as
     appropriate, request AFOSI coordinate FBI check on personnel who indicate residence
     in the US for one year or more since age 18. Annotate as stated in para A34.2.1.5

     A34.13.4.10. (Added-USAFE) Upon notification from the hiring agency, up-channel
     any negative information received on an employee to MODLO for consideration by DVA.
     DVA may determine that the information has a negative impact on the clearance held by
     that employee.
     A34.13.4.11. (Added-USAFE) Contact MODLO in all cases where employment is
     terminated.
  A34.13.5. (Added-USAFE) GSU SFAs will complete all of the actions listed under para
  A34.13.4 (Added) except they will forward documents and information to 100 SFS/SFA
  for submission to MODLO and receive the DVA results from the submitting SFA.
  A34.13.6. (Added-USAFE) MODLO will:
     A34.13.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Receive completed MOD Form 1109 from SFS.

A34.15. (Added-USAFE) DVA Reference Restrictions for the BC (from MOD JSP 440,
Manual of Protective Security).
   A34.15.1. (Added-USAFE) Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the reference
   and referees are genuine, especially where the reference is less than convincing, for
   example, it is written on poor quality paper or contains spelling or grammatical errors.
   A34.15.2. (Added-USAFE) Where a BC is being carried out as the groundwork for a SC or
   DV, or in conjunction with a CTC, only one reference is needed. This should be from the
   individual’s most recent employer and should cover a period of one year or from a
   previous employer for the same period. If an employer’s reference is not available, a
   personal or academic reference should be obtained.
   A34.15.3. (Added-USAFE) Depending on the individual’s circumstances, the following
   references may also be required:
      A34.15.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Where an individual has been overseas for more than 6
      months during the previous 3 years, every effort should be made to get a reference
      from the overseas employer.
      A34.15.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Where, for any reason, an employer’s reference is not
      available, a second personal reference should be obtained from a referee nominated by the
      individual. (This is not necessary if the period of coverage is less than 6 months).

A34.15.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Where an individual has been in full time education during the
period, a reference should also be obtained from the relevant academic institution.
      A34.15.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Where the individual has served in the armed forces or
      civil service during the period, employer’s references should be obtained from
      previous line managers named by the individual and not from the service or department.
   A34.15.4. (Added-USAFE) Personal referees nominated by the individual should be of
   some standing in the community, for example, a Justice of Peace (JP), medical practitioner,
   officer of the armed forces, clergyman, teacher, lecturer, lawyer, bank manager, or civil
   servant.
   A34.15.5. (Added-USAFE) Where personal referees have insufficient knowledge of the
   individual for them to give an appropriate reference, references should be obtained from
   personal acquaintances that are not related to, or involved in any financial arrangement with,
   the individual.

      EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS FOR NON-US NATIONAL
                      PERSONNEL IN GERMANY

A35.1. (Added-USAFE) Program Overview. Local National (LN) personnel require a
favorably completed NAC equivalent background investigation prior to employment with the
Department of Defense (DOD) in Germany. Based on agreements between USAFE and
United States Army in Europe (USAREUR), the primary background investigation
requirement for LNs in Germany, with the exception of those LNs hired before 3 October
1985, is the German Police Good Conduct Certificate (PGCC/ Polizeiliches
Führungszeugnis), a USAREUR Local National Screening (LNS), Local Files Check
(LFC), Defense Central Index of Investigations (DCII) check, and an FBI check when
information exists that indicates residence by the non-U.S. citizen in the United States for 12 or
more consecutive months since the age of 18; hereafter referred to as the LNS program. Local
national employees hired prior to 3 October 1985 were the subject of an appropriate
investigation and will not be investigated under LNS.
   A35.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Applicability. The Local National Screening background
   investigation requirement applies to the following personnel.
        A35.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) LN appropriated and nonappropriated fund employees, to
        include permanent, temporary, and or seasonal employees (hereafter referred to as
        employees), who were hired after 3 October 1985 and have resided in Germany for the
        past twelve or more consecutive months.
        A35.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) LN contractors, subcontractors, and employees (here after
        referred to as contractors) who were hired after 3 October 1985, have resided in
        Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months and are under contract for
        performance on USAFE installations within Germany, and:
           A35.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Are in a sensitive position (Attachment 36
           (Added)) or require unescorted entry into USAFE installations within Germany.
        A35.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) LN vendors, commercial solicitors, delivery personnel,
        etc. (hereafter referred to as vendors), who were hired after 3 October 1985, have resided
        in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months, and require unescorted
        entry into USAFE installations within Germany.
   A35.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Non-Applicability. The LNS investigation requirements do
   not apply to the following personnel.
        A35.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) LNs with an approved Limited Access Authorization
        (LAA) and a completed and adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)
        and or SSBI Periodic Reinvestigation (SBPR).
        A35.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) LNs with a completed and adjudicated SSBI and or
        SBPR for unescorted entry into Protection Level (PL) 1 and 2, and or unclassified
        Information Technology (IT) (formerly Automated Information Systems (AIS)) level 1 or
        2 access.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                    171


     A35.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) LNs hired before 3 October 1985. (Note: LNs hired before
     3 October 1985 have met/comply with all investigative requirements for employment
     with the DOD in Germany. Therefore, it is prohibited to require and or request these
     LNs to submit further/additional background investigation under LNS.)
     A35.1.2.4. LNs who are:
         A35.1.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Ineligible to have a FNS completed or obtain the
         PGCC because their country of residence is other than Germany or they have not
         resided in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months. Local Nationals
         in this situation will comply with the requirements listed in paragraph A35.15
         (Added), appendix 1 and will have a Local Files and DCII check. Additionally, an
         FBI check will be conducted if the individual has resided in the US for 12 or more

  requirement to have a favorably completed NAC equivalent background investigation prior to
  employment; specifically:

     October 1985, and have resided in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive
     months, will comply with the LNS background investigation requirements prescribed in
     this instruction. However, if these personnel have a previously completed and
     favorable US personnel security investigation commensurate with the requirements of
     the position, it will satisfy the LNS requirement. The US equivalent investigation can
     only be accepted if the individual previously worked for the DOD and the break in
     employment is less than 24 months.
     A35.1.3.2. (Added-USAFE) LN dependents of US personnel, to include third country
     national (TCN) dependents, who have not resided in Germany for the past twelve or
     more consecutive months are not required to comply with the LNS background
     investigation requirements. Instead, these personnel will:
         A35.1.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Provide their country's equivalent of the PGCC (refer
         to paragraph A35.15 (Added)); and or:
         A35.1.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Submit the appropriate US personnel security
         investigation commensurate with the requirements for the position of employment.
         Normally, the US NAC will be submitted; however, the type of background
         investigation may vary depending on the sensitivity of the position.
  A35.1.4. (Added-USAFE) US Citizens (Non-DoD Affiliated). Non-DoD affiliated U S
  c i t i z e n s must comply with the LNS background investigation requirements if they were
  hired after 3 October 1985 and have resided in Germany for the past twelve or more
172            AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009

A35.11. (Added-USAFE) Suitability Determinations. Suitability determinations must be
completed on any adverse FNS results since the information may identify derogatory,
unfavorable or potentially disqualifying information.
   A35.11.1. (Added-USAFE) Adverse FNS Results. Adverse FNS information does not
   automatically disqualify a LN from employment and or unescorted installation entry.
   Careful consideration must be given to:
      A35.11.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The date and importance of the information. For
      example, a misdemeanor offense committed as a youth may not necessarily be grounds
      for denial or termination of employment and or unescorted installation access.
      A35.11.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Other related information. For example, has the LN
      maintained a clean record since an offense occurred?
      A35.11.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The type and severity of the information.
      A35.11.1.4. (Added-USAFE) The sensitivity and or duties of the position.

      to force protection and other installation and personnel protection issues.
      A35.11.1.6. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) The local CPF will utilize the 90-day
      probation period clause of the ―Collective Tariff Agreement‖ for the termination of a
      Local National (LN) employee when a National Agency Check- Local National
      (NACLN) is deemed unfavorable.
   A35.11.2. (Added-USAFE) Suitability Determination OPR. The CSF is the OPR for all
   suitability determinations; however, all determinations must involve and or include, as a
   minimum:
      A35.11.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The commander or equivalent of the LN employee; or, for
      LN contractors and or vendors, the commander or equivalent of the responsible program,
      project or activity.
      A35.11.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The CPF Chief for LN employees, HRO Chief for certain
      US citizens hired by Services, or the Contracting Officer for LN contractors.
      A35.11.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The wing Staff Judge Advocate (JA).
      A35.11.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Other appropriate offices and agencies, within the
      limitations of the requirements prescribed in DoDD 5200.2, DoD Personnel Security
      Program, Chapter 10 and the USAREUR adverse FNS memorandum.
   A35.11.3. (Added-USAFE) Documenting Suitability Determinations. All suitability
   determination results must be documented in two formal memorandums; specifically, a
   suitability determination decision and notification.
      A35.11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The first memorandum, suitability determination decision
      must be very detailed and contain all required information as outlined in Figure A35.3
      (Added), marked For Official Use Only, and signed by the CSF. This memorandum will
      be retained on file by the SFA and may not be copied and or released to unauthorized
      personnel.
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                        177


      A35.11.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The second memorandum, suitability determination
      notification may only contain general information, is completed and signed by the
      SFA, and is intended to inform the hiring agency or responsible installation or unit
      program, project or activity whether the suitability determination was favorable or
      unfavorable, Figure A35.3 (Added).
   A35.11.4. (Added-USAFE) Notifying USAREUR. If the suitability determination
   decision results in not granting employment, termination of an LN employee or contractor,
   and or not granting installation access, the CSF will formally notify USAREUR as outlined
   in paragraph A35.12 (Added).
   A35.11.5. (Added-USAFE) Unresolved Disputes. Unresolved disputes arising from
   suitability determinations must be elevated to the installation commander for resolution;

   background investigation results either in the individual’s Official Personnel File (OPF) or
   in a separate security file or folder. It is strongly recommended CPF and HRO establish a

addresses the program.
A35.15. (Added-USAFE) Background Investigation Requirements for Other Local
Nationals.
   A35.15.1. (Added-USAFE) It is not uncommon for a LN to be ineligible for a FNS
   because their country of residence is other than Germany or because they have not resided in
   Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months. Examples include a LN who
   resides in a country other than Germany and is seeking employment and or unescorted
   installation access on a USAFE installation within Germany, a LN vendor from a country
AFI31-501_USAFESUP_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 24 SEPTEMBER 2009                                      179


   other than Germany who requires unescorted installation access to sell their merchandise
   during a sponsored event, etc. In cases such as these, the following requirements apply.
      A35.15.1.1. (Added-USAFE) If the LN is not a German resident and or has not
      resided in Germany for the past twelve or more consecutive months, the LN must provide
      their country's equivalent of the PGCC. The PGCC equivalent document must:
          A35.15.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Be the original (copies are prohibited) copy in or
          translated into English, and notarized.
          A35.15.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Reflect a favorable background investigation
          result. If the PGCC equivalent document is not favorable and or other information is
          identified, a suitability determination must be completed.
          A35.15.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Be dated within 90 days of the entry on duty
          date. If the PGCC equivalent document is 91 days old or older at the entry on
          duty date, a new PGCC equivalent document must be obtained.
      A35.15.1.2. (Added-USAFE) All other additional LN security related processes,
      procedures, and requirements apply. These include the additional mandatory security
      checks for LN employees, contractors, and or vendors; specifically, FBI check where
      information exists that indicates residence by the non-US citizen in the US for twelve or
      more consecutive months since age 18, DCII, and a Local Files Check.
   A35.15.2. (Added-USAFE) As with the PGCC conducted in Germany, the PGCC
   equivalent conducted in most other countries is limited only to a criminal courts records
   check over the previous 5-7 years, depending on the criminal offense. Since these host
   country PGCCs do not provide the same level and scope of background investigation
   check as the FNS, additional measures and considerations must be taken; specifically:
      A35.15.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Closely scrutinize unescorted installation              access
      requirements and limit the number of days and times when access is allowed.
      A35.15.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Deny unescorted installation access sign-in privileges.
      A35.15.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Limit employment and or contract performance only to
      non-sensitive positions.
   A35.15.3. (Added-USAFE) Within the USAFE Theater of operations, LN background
   investigation requirements and processes vary from country to country. While most countries
   only conduct a criminal courts records check similar to the German PGCC, within the
   United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence conducts a full background investigation similar
   to the USAREUR LNS. When utilizing the background investigation results from a country
   within the USAFE Theater of operation, it is important to ensure the results are not only
   valid, but also the correct type for that particular country. CPF, HRO, and or SF should
   contact their USAFE counterpart in the appropriate country to determine the specific LN
   background investigation requirements and processes.

   A35.16.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) If the last investigation is older than 10 years, a
   new investigation is required.
