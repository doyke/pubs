 2                                                             307BWI34-601 27 AUGUST 2013


1. General. This version updates the reservation process using the Automated Lodging
Reservation System (ALRS) and abuse policies. Lodging for reserve members is a privilege
offered by the command to lessen the monetary burden on unit members performing approved
inactive duty for training (IDT) periods. Lodging is provided for the military member, and the
307 BW in no way proposes to pay lodging costs for personnel who accompany the military
member on IDT. These individuals are considered unauthorized guests when they accompany the
military member and use lodging provided for the 307 BW. The unit member accepts complete
responsibility for any unauthorized guests they choose to share their lodging with.
     1.1. Lodging for Readiness Management Periods (RMPs) will be authorized on a case by
     case basis with 307th Mission Support Group Commander (MSG/CC) having final approval
     authority. All AF Form 40A’s must be accompanied by an approving email from the
     MSG/CC.
     1.2. Individual members must contact the Barksdale Air Force Base (BAFB) lodging office,
     Monday prior to the UTA first, then their Squadron Lodging Representative (SLR) for
     lodging needs that are in conjunction with an established Unit Training Assembly (UTA)
     weekend to prevent having to move rooms upon duty status change (i.e., Annual Tour (AT)
     to UTA).
     1.3. Unit members changing duty status but remain a lodging guest must notify the Lodging
     Desk before 1100 hours on the last day of that duty status. This includes paying all applicable
     charges and, if necessary, turning in room keys and vacating the room. To avoid vacating
     their room, members should verify length of stay, notify clerk of dual status and pay
     applicable charges at check-in. The most common duty status changes are those from UTA to
     active duty status, or vice-versa.
     1.4. Lodging reservations will be made via the ALRS. The ALRS is designed to allow
     reservations to be made in advance for the entire Fiscal Year (FY). If a member makes
     reservations and forgets their lodging assignment, they should call the ALRS to review their
     assignment.
     1.5. To make reservations, members must call the ALRS no later than (NLT) noon
     Wednesday prior to the UTA. A member may make reservations after that time using the
     ALRS but will be identified as a walk-in.
     1.6. In the event a member calls the ALRS after the Wednesday noon cut off and require
     lodging for Friday and Saturday evenings and there is "no inventory" available for Saturday
     evening, the member will be required to call the ALRS on Saturday after 1300 hours to make
     a reservation for Saturday evening. This will require the member to check out of their
     assigned lodging Saturday morning and will cause the member to be listed as a walk-in.
     1.7. To change or cancel reservations, members must call the ALRS NLT noon Wednesday
     prior to the UTA, to avoid being a no-show.
     1.8. If a member arrives without a reservation, they will be required to use the phone in the
     lobby area of the BAFB lodging office to make a reservation through the ALRS. Do not
     contact 2d Force Support Squadron (2 FSS) lodging directly to attempt to procure
     accommodations prior to check-in. The ALRS is the only source utilized to make (main and
     alternate) UTA lodging reservations. Any deviation to that requirement, (i.e. contacting the 2
     FSS lodging office to circumvent the system) will result in the member being responsible for
307BWI34-601 27 AUGUST 2013                                                                    3


   payment for their lodging accommodations.         (EXCEPTIONS: New recruits, members
   returning from long deployments, etc.)
   1.9. In the event a member has a reservation for both nights (Friday and Saturday) and does
   not check in or contact their SLR before 0800 hours on Saturday morning, the remainder of
   the reservation will be cancelled and the member will be treated as a walk-in when/if they
   check-in later that day (Saturday). If a member loses his Saturday reservation due to a Friday
   no-show, he or she will be listed as non-compliant on the Commander’s report.
   1.10. The Barksdale Inn will lodge all 307 BW members in IDT status from least expensive
   to most expensive hotel at all times.
