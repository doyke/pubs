                                           PURPOSE

1.1. Purpose. The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Outage Reporting System is
used to report lost or degraded AFSCN capabilities. Reported systems, subsystems, and
equipment include those resources scheduled by 22 SOPS IAW 50 SWI 10217, Air Force
Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Users’ Operations, and any other system which would
impact AFSCN operations.
     1.1.1. The information is disseminated to key operations personnel: Satellite Operations
     Centers (SOCs), Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS), 22 SOPS Network Crew
     Commander/Network Crew Chief (NCMDR/NCCH), 22 SOPS Network Scheduling,
     AFSCN External Users, Remote Tracking Stations (RTSs), and other Remote Ground
     Facilities (RGFs).
     1.1.2. The information is used to ensure all problems impacting current or future operations
     can be effectively managed through the immediate rescheduling of resources, program
     support (future operations), and/or the implementation of contingency plans.
     1.1.3. Timely reporting is essential. All work centers will immediately report problems IAW
     50 SWI 10217 and this instruction, and provide information necessary to fully convey an
     operational impact.
50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013                                                                        5


                                           Chapter 2

                                       DESCRIPTION

2.1. Outage Condition. An outage condition is any loss or degradation of mission capability.
2.2. Outage Report. An outage report is the information about an outage condition collected
and disseminated to the rest of the AFSCN. Note: The term outage is commonly used to refer
interchangeably to either an outage condition or an outage report.
2.3. Communications Outage. A communications outage is an outage condition, or the report
for an outage condition, on those systems, subsystems, and equipment identified as part of the
AFSCN communications network and voice systems.
   2.3.1. A list of reportable communications assets and guidance on reporting communications
   outages is provided in Attachment 2.
   2.3.2. A communications outage is not required for those assets impacted by a facility
   outage, described below.
2.4. Range Outage. A range outage is an outage condition, or the report for an outage
condition, on those systems, subsystems, and equipment at an RGF supporting AFSCN
operations not already identified as a communications asset.
   2.4.1. A list of reportable range assets and guidance on reporting range outages is provided
   in the 22 SOPS ESD Mnemonic Listing which is generated by the 22 SOPS Database
   Manager.
   2.4.2. A range outage is not required for those assets impacted by a facility outage, described
   below.
2.5. System Outage. A system outage is an outage condition, or the report for an outage
condition, on an AFSCN mission capability that cannot be identified as a communications or
range asset, or attributed to a facility failure.
   2.5.1. A system outage is opened anytime the area of a problem or failure cannot be
   determined, but a definite AFSCN impact has been identified.
   2.5.2. A system outage report does not become a communications or range outage report
   when an exact cause is determined; instead, a new outage report is initiated with the newly
   identified information.
   2.5.3. A list of possible systems and guidance on reporting system outages is provided in
   Attachment 4.
2.6. Facility Outage. A facility outage is an outage condition, or the report for an outage
condition, caused by a facility-level failure or degradation, such as loss of power, HVAC, and so
on.
   2.6.1. A list of possible facility outages and guidance on reporting facility outages is
   provided in Attachment 4.
2.7. Reporting Work Centers. Those work centers responsible for reporting outage conditions.
 6                                                                 50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013


     2.7.1. 21 SOPS Network Operations Center, referred to using their call-sign Comm Control,
     located at the Ellison Onizuka Satellite Operations Center (EOSOF) on Vandenberg AFB,
     California, is responsible for reporting communications outages.
     2.7.2. 21 SOPS Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), call-sign COOK, on Vandenberg AFB,
     California, is responsible for reporting range outages at VTS.
     2.7.3. 21 SOPS Det 1, Diego Garcia Tracking Station (DGS), call-sign REEF, located on
     Diego Garcia, Indian Ocean, is responsible for reporting range outages at DGS.
     2.7.4. 21 SOPS Det 2, Guam Tracking Station (GTS), call-sign GUAM, located at Northwest
     Field on Andersen AFB, Guam, is responsible for reporting range outages at GTS.
     2.7.5. 21 SOPS Det 3, Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), call-sign HULA, located at Kaena
     Point on Oahu, Hawaii, is responsible for reporting range outages at HTS.
     2.7.6. 22 SOPS Colorado Tracking Station (CTS), call-sign PIKE, on Schriever AFB,
     Colorado, is responsible for reporting range outages at CTS. CTS has been removed as an
     operational RTS and has future potential as a testing location for transportable/hybridization
     operations.
     2.7.7. 22 SOPS Network Crew Commander/Network Crew Chief (NCMDR/NCCH), located
     at Schriever AFB, Colorado, is responsible for reporting system outages.
     2.7.8. 23 SOPS New Hampshire Tracking Station (NHS), call-sign BOSS, located on New
     Boston AFS, New Hampshire, is responsible for reporting range outages at NHS.
     2.7.9. 23 SOPS Det 1, Thule Tracking Station (TTS), call-sign POGO, located on Thule AB,
     Greenland, is responsible for reporting range outages at TTS.
     2.7.10. 23 OL-AE, Telemetry and Command Station (TCS), call-sign LION, located at
     Oakhanger, England, is responsible for reporting range outages at TCS.
     2.7.11. 23 SOPS Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF), call-sign BEACH, located at
     Cape Canaveral, Florida, is responsible for reporting range outages at EVCF.
2.8. Electronic Scheduling/Status Dissemination (ESD). The ESD system is used for
disseminating outage reports. Refer to ESD operator manuals for specifics on using ESD for
reporting outage conditions. Section 4 describes the contents entered into an ESD outage report
form. Section 5 describes the different outage reporting activities.
     2.8.1. Outages reports entered into ESD by the reporting work center are pending until
     reviewed and broadcast by the 22 SOPS NCMDR/NCCH.
        2.8.1.1. Once broadcast, an outage report immediately becomes visible to all AFSCN
        operators/users with access to ESD.
        2.8.1.2. Should an outage report include proper ASTRO names and site-sides (see
        Section 4), outage information will appear on ASTRO, the AFSCN Network Scheduling
        system, so 22 SOPS Network Scheduling can implement contingencies as described in
        50 SWI 10-217.
     2.8.1.3. ESD is the official reporting database of the AFSCN. Any supplementary outage
     reports will be considered subordinate to ESD. All ancillary AFSCN outage report data must
     be accurate and comparable to the information reported in ESD.
50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013                                                                       7


  2.8.1.4. ESD is a transient reporting system. The latest status in ESD should include all
  relevant information and not assume knowledge of previous entries. Any corrections entered
  into ESD should include all the same information provided in the last update.
  2.8.1.5. When an outage report has been closed in ESD, the last entry should provide all the
  latest information known at the time of closure. Any new information discovered after an
  outage has been closed cannot be captured in ESD, given its nature, but the new information
  should still be forwarded to the reporting work center for capture in any peripheral archive or
  record.
  2.8.2. If ESD is not available, contingency procedures are detailed in Attachment 5.
 8                                                                  50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013

                                    OUTAGE REPORT

4.1. Distribution. AFSCN outage information is distributed using ESD.           The following
paragraphs detail the content of an outage report.
4.2. Date Time Grouping (DTG). DTG format is used for all times in an outage report. The
format is YJJJHHMM, detailed as follows:
   4.2.1. Y—last digit of the year. For example, 9 is used for 2009, 0 is used for 2010, and so
   on.
   4.2.2. JJJ—day of the year, also known as the Julian day. For example, 015 represents
   January 15, 035 represents February 4, and so on. Dates after February 28 vary between leap
   and non-leap years.
   4.2.3. HHMM—24-hour time of day using no punctuation and excluding seconds.
4.3. Outage Control Number (OCN). The OCN is the time an outage report is open and the
tracking number used to reference the outage. Note: The OCN described here is not the same as
the OCN described in 50 SWI 10-217 for an Operational Control Node.
   4.3.1. The OCN is entered using the DTG format described above.
   4.3.2. The open time can be when the outage condition actually begins, when the outage
   condition is first detected, or when the outage condition is determined to be reportable.
4.4. Outage Categories. Outage conditions are categorized at either Amber or Red. Note:
Green may be used informally as a category referring to a non-outage condition.
   4.4.1. Category Amber (CAT A)—An outage condition limiting or putting at risk AFSCN
   operational capability.
   4.4.2. Category Red (CAT R)—An outage condition preventing, or severely degrading
   AFSCN operational capability.
   4.4.3. Reporting work centers should develop local procedures detailing when a reportable
   system, subsystem, or equipment is CAT A or CAT R. Essentially, if a schedulable asset is
   unavailable for operations, it should be reported as CAT R.
4.5. Safety Outage. An outage can also be categorized as a safety outage.
   4.5.1. An outage will be categorized as a safety outage whenever the outage condition
   involves risk to either personnel or equipment.
   4.5.2. A safety outage is reported by prefacing the OCN with an “S”.
   4.5.3. The category of a safety outage is referenced by adding “/S”, as CAT A/S or CAT
   R/S.
   4.5.4. Reporting work centers should develop local procedures detailing when an outage
   condition should be reported as a safety outage.
4.6. Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC). An estimated time when the outage condition is
expected to be resolved, or when the next change in status is expected.
 10                                                              50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013


   4.6.1. An ETIC is entered using the DTG format described above, or using one of the delay
   codes described below.
   4.6.2. When it is not possible to estimate when an outage will be resolved, and no other
   specific time for a status update is available, enter the current time plus two hours as the
   ETIC. There may be a reason to delay further than the default two hours. The following
   paragraphs provide some guidance.
      4.6.2.1. When troubleshooting is slowed for some reason, an ETIC of the current time
      plus four hours may be entered instead. This is common for outages being troubleshot by
      outside agencies.
      4.6.2.2. When mission capability is impacted only intermittently, an ETIC of the current
      time plus eight hours may be entered instead. This is a common for CAT A outages that
      are still being troubleshot.
      4.6.2.3. When mission capability has been restored and the restoration dictates a monitor
      period for possible recurrence, an ETIC of the current time plus 24 hours may be entered
      instead.
   4.6.3. When parts are on order, and no delivery or installation date is available, enter AWP
   (Awaiting Parts) as the ETIC. If a delivery or installation date is available, an ETIC
   reflecting the end of that date should be entered instead.
   4.6.4. When awaiting depot-level support, and no arrival date available, enter AWDLM
   (Awaiting Depot Level Maintenance) as the ETIC. If an arrival date is available, an ETIC
   reflecting the end of that date should be entered instead.
   4.6.5. When awaiting a release of mission resources (or downtime), requested for the
   purpose of troubleshooting, and no time has been scheduled, enter AWDT (Awaiting
   Downtime) as the ETIC. If a downtime has been scheduled, an ETIC reflecting the end of
   the downtime plus one hour should be entered instead.
   4.6.6. Enter OTHER as the ETIC when there is an extended delay with no impending
   resolution, no other reasonable date or time is available for when there may be a new status,
   and no other applicable delay code applies. An ETIC of OTHER should be justified in the
   outage remarks.
4.7. System Name (SYSTEM). A system name reflects the culpable system, subsystem, or
equipment. Refer to the appropriate reporting attachment for guidance.
   4.7.1. Communications outages use system names describing the location and/or usage of
   the communications system impacted. Guidance is found in Attachment 2.
   4.7.2. Range outages use system names identifying the subsystem or equipment impacted.
   This information is contained within the 22 SOPS ESD Mnemonic Listing which is
   generated by the 22 SOPS Database Manager.
   4.7.3. System outages use system names that indicate the mission system, mission capability,
   or user impacted. Guidance is found in Attachment 3.
   4.7.4. Facility outages use the system name FAC. Guidance is found in Attachment 4.
50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013                                                                       11


4.8. Equipment Name (EQUIP). An equipment name further delineates the subsystem or
equipment to which the outage condition has been isolated.
   4.8.1. Outage conditions not isolated to a specific subsystem or equipment are reported using
   the equipment name SYSTEM. This does not make the outage a system outage as described
   above; it just indicates the cause of the outage condition has not been identified beyond the
   reported system. Range and facility outages do not use the equipment name SYSTEM.
4.9. ASTRO Names. ASTRO names are based on the outage category entered into ESD by the
reporting work center and are used in combination with the reported site-sides to help 22 SOPS
identify the impact an outage condition has on scheduled activities. Refer to the appropriate
reporting attachment for guidance.
   4.9.1. Reporting work centers should develop local procedures with assistance from
   22 SOPS detailing when an ASTRO name should be included in an outage report. An outage
   report must include ASTRO names and site-sides that match the scheduled resources
   impacted.
4.10. Site-Sides. Site-sides are based on the outage category entered into ESD and are used in
combination with the reported ASTRO names to help identify the impact an outage condition has
on scheduled activities. Refer to the appropriate reporting attachment for guidance.
   4.10.1. Reporting work centers should develop local procedures with assistance from
   22 SOPS detailing when a site-side should be included in an outage report. An outage report
   must include ASTRO names and site-sides which match the resources impacted.
   4.10.2. The ESD outage report form has two locations for site-sides. The primary site-side
   at the top of the form, and further fields for affected site-sides. All entered site-sides have
   the same effect in ESD and ASTRO.
4.11. Work Center (WC). The work center responsible for reporting and resolving the outage
condition. Refer to the appropriate reporting attachment for assigned work center codes.
4.12. Symptom. The symptom should include all relevant details of the outage condition, even
where other fields of the report may provide the same or similar information.
   4.12.1. A complete symptom description helps provide a readable display of information on
   ESD. A symptom description should identify the culpable asset (specific system, subsystem,
   and/or equipment), the frequency of the failure or degradation (constant, excessively,
   intermittently, etc.), the type of failure or degradation (in-op, unpowered, alarmed, dropping,
   errored, etc.), and the locations where the failure or degradation has been detected.
   4.12.2. The symptom may be changed when there are any changes in an outage condition.
4.13. Impact. The impact should include a comprehensive description of the impact to AFSCN
operations.
   4.13.1. A complete impact description helps provide a readable display of information on
   ESD. An impact description should include the severity of the impact (unable to, possibly
   unable to, possible loss of, etc.) and the specific mission capability impacted (voice, primary
   communications, command capability, telemetry, etc.).
   4.13.2. The impact may use ASTRO names and commonly recognized abbreviations. The
   impact must be understandable to all operational areas impacted by the outage condition.
 12                                                                50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013


   4.13.3. The impact may be changed when there are any changes to the impact from an
   outage condition.
4.14. Remarks. The remarks portion of an outage report should include the following:
   4.14.1. The reporting action as described in section 5, and the time of the reporting action.
   4.14.2. The reason for the current reporting action.
   4.14.3. The current action being taken to resolve the outage condition and by whom. If
   awaiting an action, detail the reasons for the delay. For outage conditions where the cause
   has not yet been isolated, it is acceptable to report troubleshooting in progress (TSIP) as the
   action.
   4.14.4. When closing an outage report, the reason for the outage (RFO). If the RFO was
   never identified, enter an RFO of UNKNOWN. Note: An outage report should not include
   speculation.
   4.14.5. When closing an outage report, the action or actions taken to resolve the outage
   (FIX). If no fix action is identified, enter that the problem cleared before isolation (CBI).
   Note: An outage report should not detail actions taken to isolate the problem unless the
   action is deemed that which resolved the outage condition.
   4.14.6. Reporting work centers may develop local procedures detailing additional
   requirements for outage report remarks.
4.15. Affected IRONs / WANIU. ESD includes a field for reporting affected IRONs and/or
WANIUs.
   4.15.1. Enter ALL as the Affected IRONs/WANIU for an outage condition that impacts all
   or most users. This is common for most communications and facility outages.
   4.15.2. Enter =WANxx=, where xx is the absolute index for that WANIU, when an outage
   condition impacts traffic on a single WANIU. When used, ESD can bring up a description of
   the traffic on that WANIU. 22 SOPS provides the traffic descriptions in ESD for each
   WANIU.
   4.15.3. Enter an IRON or mission name when the outage condition exclusively impacts that
   vehicle or mission.
4.16. OPSCAP. ESD includes a field for OPSCAP color. Please refer to the appropriate
AFI10206 supplements and local procedures for direction on OPSCAP reporting.
50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013                                                                   13

                                       PROCEDURES

5.1. Outage Entry. AFSCN outage information is entered using ESD.              The following
paragraphs detail the specific activities for reporting an outage condition.
   5.1.1. Open an outage—when first reporting an outage condition.
   5.1.2. Upgrade an outage—when changing an outage condition from a CAT A status to a
   CAT R status.
   5.1.3. Downgrade an outage—when changing an outage condition from a CAT R status to a
   CAT A status.
   5.1.4. Update an outage—when adding new remarks and changing the ETIC of an outage
   report.
   5.1.5. Close an outage—when reporting the resolution of an outage condition.
5.2. Outage Reporting Requirements. Timely reporting of outage conditions is required to
ensure impact to operations is minimized using contingency procedures as described in
50 SWI 10-217. The reporting work center will:
   5.2.1. Open an outage no more than 15 minutes after determining an outage condition meets
   reporting requirements.
   5.2.2. Upgrade (U/G) an outage to CAT R no later than 15 minutes after determining the
   outage condition meets CAT R reporting requirements.
   5.2.3. Downgrade (D/G) an outage to CAT A no later than 15 minutes after determining the
   outage condition meets CAT A reporting requirements.
   5.2.4. Update an outage whenever the action being taken to resolve the outage condition
   changes, whenever there is new information available for dissemination, or 30 minutes prior
   to the expiration of the latest ETIC.
   5.2.5. Close an outage no later than 15 minutes after determining the outage condition has
   been resolved or no longer exists.
5.3. Opening an Outage. The reporting work center will:
   5.3.1. Determine if a viable outage condition exists.
   5.3.2. Determine the appropriate system name, equipment name, category, symptom, impact,
   affected site-sides, ASTRO names, and affected IRONs/WANIU for the outage condition.
   5.3.3. Determine an appropriate open time for the outage report. This will provide an OCN
   for the outage report. The open time may be based on:
       5.3.3.1. When the actual symptom began, from investigated equipment logs or other
       sources,
       5.3.3.2. When the outage condition was first detected based on personal observation or
       work center notification, or
 14                                                              50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013


      5.3.3.3. When the work center determines an outage condition meets reporting
      requirements.
   5.3.4. If two outage conditions are determined to have the same open time, it is acceptable to
   increment the open time of one of the outages by a minute to provide each outage report with
   a unique OCN.
   5.3.5. Determine the appropriate action for resolving the outage condition and an appropriate
   ETIC. NOTE: Reporting the outage takes precedence over initiating any action to resolve
   the outage condition. Timely reporting is essential therefore telephonic notification to
   22SOPS/NCMDR of the outage should take precedence to entering into ESD if it has an
   immediate impact to scheduled operations.
   5.3.6. Create and submit a new outage report in ESD with all the gathered information.
   Include remarks with the open time and detailing the action being taken to resolve the outage
   condition.
5.4. Upgrading an Outage. The reporting work center will:
   5.4.1. Determine if an outage condition has degraded enough for an outage report to change
   from CAT A to CAT R.
   5.4.2. Determine the more severe symptom and impact. The system name, equipment name,
   affected site-sides, ASTRO names, and affected IRONs/WANIU typically remain
   unchanged.
   5.4.3. Determine the appropriate action for resolving the upgraded outage condition and an
   appropriate ETIC. NOTE: Reporting the upgraded outage takes precedence over initiating
   any new action to resolve the outage condition. Timely reporting is essential.
   5.4.4. Determine the upgrade time for the outage. The upgrade time may be based on:
      5.4.4.1. When the actual symptom changed, from investigated equipment logs,
      5.4.4.2. When the change in outage condition was first detected, from personal
      observation or work center notification,
      5.4.4.3. When the work center determines a change in the outage condition meets CAT R
      reporting requirements.
   5.4.5. Update the outage report in ESD with all the gathered information. Include remarks
   with the upgrade time and detailing the action being taken to resolve the outage condition.
5.5. Downgrading an Outage. The reporting work center will:
   5.5.1. Determine if an outage condition has improved enough for an outage report to change
   from CAT R to CAT A.
   5.5.2. Determine the less severe symptom and impact. The system name, equipment name,
   affected site-sides, ASTRO names, and affected IRONs/WANIU typically remain
   unchanged.
   5.5.3. Determine the appropriate action for resolving the downgraded outage condition and
   an appropriate ETIC. NOTE: Reporting the downgraded outage takes precedence over
   initiating any new action to resolve the outage condition. Timely reporting is essential.
50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013                                                                     15


   5.5.4. Determine the downgrade time for the outage. The downgrade time may be based on:
       5.5.4.1. When the actual symptom changed, from investigated equipment logs,
       5.5.4.2. When the change in outage condition was first detected, from personal
       observation or work center notification, or
       5.5.4.3. When the work center determines a change in the outage condition meets
       CAT A reporting requirements.
   5.5.5. Update the outage report in ESD with all the gathered information. Include remarks
   with the downgrade time and detailing the action being taken to resolve the outage condition.
5.6. Updating an Outage. The reporting work center will:
   5.6.1. Determine the appropriate action for continuing to resolve the outage condition, the
   new ETIC, and the update time for the outage. The system name, equipment name, category,
   symptom, impact, affected site-sides, ASTRO names, and affected IRONs/WANIU typically
   remain unchanged.
   5.6.2. Update the outage report in ESD with all the gathered information. Include remarks
   with the update time and detailing the action being taken to continue resolving the outage
   condition.
5.7. Closing an Outage. The reporting work center will:
   5.7.1. Determine if the outage condition has cleared.
   5.7.2. Determine an appropriate RFO and FIX. Note: The reporting work center may instead
   downgrade, if a CAT R, or update, if a CAT A, an outage with a cleared outage condition,
   and add a period to monitor for a recurrence of the outage condition, if deemed appropriate.
   5.7.3. Determine the close time for the outage report.
   5.7.4. Close the outage report in ESD. Include remarks with the close time and detailing the
   RFO and FIX.
5.8. Outage Reporting Process. The following paragraphs detail the steps involved in
processing an outage report.
   5.8.1. The reporting work center will enter and submit outage information in ESD. The
   outage report will enter a pending state. If ESD is not available, refer to Attachment 5 for
   contingency procedures.
   5.8.2. The NCMDR/NCCH will review the pending outage information. If ESD is not
   available, refer to Attachment 5 for contingency procedures.
       5.8.2.1. If the NCMDR/NCCH discovers any errors or inconsistencies, the
       NCMDR/NCCH will contact the reporting work center and describe the errors or
       inconsistencies. The NCMDR/NCCH can:
          5.8.2.1.1. Reject the outage report submission so the reporting work center can
          resubmit, or
          5.8.2.1.2. Make any corrections as provided by the reporting work center.
16                                                         50SWI10-224 24 JUNE 2013


     5.8.2.2. If the NCMDR/NCCH discovers no errors or inconsistencies,              the
     NCMDR/NCCH will broadcast the outage report to the rest of the AFSCN.
  5.8.3. AFSCN work centers will acknowledge reception of the outage information. If ESD
  is not available, refer to Attachment 5 for contingency procedures.

               COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGE REPORTING GUIDANCE

A2.1. Comm Control reports communications outages.
A2.2. Tables A2.1 thru A2.13 describe the reportable system names. The table entries include a
selection of acceptable equipment names that go with a system. The tables also include the
ASTRO names and site-sides normally reported with the system, with optional entries, which
should be included as applicable, and are shown in brackets.
   A2.2.1. Should none of the system names apply to the current outage condition, then the
   issue should be passed to the NCMDR/NCCH for consideration as a possible system outage.
A2.3. Equipment names are described in more detail in Table A2.14.
   A2.3.1. Problems affecting DCC workstations, even though an integral part of
   communications being used to operate WANIUs and as the end-equipment of the C&M
   layer, are not reported under a communications outage. If a DCC problem is limited to one
   or a few DCCs, the impacted work center should open a maintenance job. If a DCC problem
   affects a majority of DCCs AFSCN-wide, the NCMDR/NCCH should open a system outage.
A2.4. ASTRO names and site-sides match the outage category in ESD and assist 22 SOPS
Network Schedulers in quickly assessing the impact of an outage condition. Should a
combination of ASTRO names and site-sides conflict or introduce a misleading impact, submit
multiple outage reports for the same outage condition, so as to ensure the Network Schedulers
have the best representation of the impact.
A2.5. RTS sides included on a communications outage report are typically –X for all sides, as
communications usually impact all sides of an RTS. Outage conditions that could impact only
one side of an RTS are those that involve specific WANIU ports. Specific RTS sides should
only appear on outage reports where the equipment code is WANIU.
A2.6. Comm Control enters the work center (WC) code SCF.

can include outage conditions that impact C&M for the entire AFSCN, AOS for all or many of
the users, or circuits and equipment for both SAFB OCN and VAFB OCN. If there is no
identifiable communications symptom, it may be more appropriate for the NCMDR/NCCH to
open a system outage.
INC—an outage condition impacting communications between SAFB OCN and VAFB OCN.
Report such outages with only DICE-A and HAWK-A since any impacts to range locations will
be captured by any outage conditions reported for primary or additional communications. Open
a separate outage for any impact to secure voice between CTS and VAFB, since this resource is
reported with a different site-side and ASTRO name combination.
SAFB OSR—an outage condition impacting communications with SAFB OCN or users at
SAFB. This can include outage conditions that impact SAFB C&M, AOS with SAFB users, or
SAFB OCN circuits or equipment. If there is a failure that impacts one or more primary or
additional comm systems, the outage should include PRI-S or ADD-S and the sites impacted.
All other SAFB OSR outages should include only HAWK-A as the site, and separate outages
open for impact to other resources. Include PSVS only when the impact includes the
corresponding PRI-S. Reference TO A1-31R2-26548AG-1, AFSCN Operational Switch
Replacement (OSR).
PSVS—outage conditions impacting operational secure voice with SAFB, users at SAFB, or
multiple remote locations through SAFB. This system can be incorporated into an outage open
on SAFB OSR. If the latter, add the PSVS equipment code to the outage report. If there is a
failure that impacts one or more remote location, include all the sites impacted, otherwise include
only HAWK-A as the site. If there is an impact to a specific RGF, open another outage for the
affected site.
VAFB OSR—outage conditions impacting communications with VAFB OCN or users at
VAFB. This can include outage conditions that impact VAFB C&M, AOS with VAFB users, or
VAFB OCN circuits and equipment. If there is a failure that impacts one or more primary or
additional comm systems, the outage should include PRI-V or ADDV and the sites impacted.
All other VAFB OSR outages should include only DICE-A as the site, and separate outages open
for any impact to other resources. Include PSVV only when the impact includes the
corresponding PRI-V. Reference TO A1-31R2-26548AG-1, AFSCN Operational Switch
Replacement (OSR).
PSVV—outage conditions impacting operational secure voice with VAFB, users at VAFB, or
multiple remote locations through VAFB. This system can be incorporated into an outage open
on VAFB OSR. If the latter, add the PSVV equipment code to the outage report. If there is a
failure that impacts one or more remote locations, include all the sites impacted, otherwise
include only DICE-A as the site.

CTS OSR—outage conditions impacting all communications with CTS. This can include C&M,
timing, or other problems impacting both primary and additional communications at CTS. This
does not include facility outages impacting more than just communications. If the latter, CTS
should report a facility outage. Include PSVV and PSVS as appropriate.
CTS PRI—outage conditions impacting primary communications with CTS not isolated to the
fiber path at SAFB. These outages should be limited to either unknown SYSTEM problems or
WANIU problems. Include PSVV and PSVS as appropriate.
CTS PRIS—outage conditions impacting the fiber-optic trunk between SAFB OCN and CTS
primary equipment. There is no corresponding CTS PRI-V; VAFB connects to CTS primary
equipment via INC. Both VAFB and SAFB secure voice with CTS are dependent on CTS PRIS.
If a problem is not isolated to the fiber path, open a CTS PRI SYSTEM outage instead.
CTS PSV—outage conditions impacting operational secure voice at CTS. This system can be
incorporated into an outage open on CTS PRI or CTS PRIS. If the latter, add the PSVS and
PSVV equipment codes to the outage report.
CTS PSVS—outage conditions impacting operational secure voice between CTS and SAFB.
This system can be incorporated into an outage open on CTS PRI or CTS PRIS. If the latter, add
the PSVS equipment code to the CTS PRI or CTS PRIS outage report.
CTS PSVV—outage conditions impacting operational secure voice between CTS and VAFB.
This system can be incorporated into an outage open on CTS PRI or CTS PRIS. If the latter, add
the PSVV equipment code to the CTS PRI or CTS PRIS outage report. Do not incorporate CTS
PSVV outage conditions into an INC outage; open a separate CTS PSVV outage.
CTS ADD—outage conditions impacting additional communications with CTS not isolated to
the fiber path at SAFB. These outages should be limited to either unknown SYSTEM problems
or WANIU problems.
CTS ADDS—outage conditions impacting the fiber-optic trunk between SAFB OCN and CTS
additional equipment. There is no corresponding CTS ADDV; VAFB connects to CTS
additional equipment via INC. If a problem is not isolated to the fiber path, open a CTS ADD
SYSTEM outage instead.

                      SYSTEM OUTAGE REPORTING GUIDANCE

A3.1. The NCMDR/NCCH reports system outages. A system outage should capture non-
communications and non-range problems that impact AFSCN operations and require
community-wide notification. If an outage condition is limited to a single SOC or external user,
it may not be necessary to report it.
A3.2. All possible reportable systems cannot be represented because system outages may
capture unusual or unexpected outage conditions. System outages can include outage conditions
on:
   A3.2.1. Software/firmware releases—problems affecting the same subsystem or equipment
   at a majority of AFSCN locations. The system name should match the affected support
   system, e.g. ARS, ARTS, CCS, DCC, RBC, etc.
   A3.2.2. MUE equipment—problems affecting a specific mission. The system name should
   match the impacted mission, e.g., DMSP, DSCS, GPS, etc.
   A3.2.3. User interfaces—problems affecting access to the AFSCN or operational capability
   of a specific user. The system name should match the impacted user, e.g. KING, MESA,
   NOPS, etc.
A3.3. The equipment name for system outages is typically SYSTEM. A specific equipment
name can be used for outage conditions that apply to specific equipment, such as
software/firmware issues.
   A3.3.1. A system-level outage condition, such as a software/firmware issue, specifically
   affecting communications equipment, as appear in Table A2.14, should be reported as a
   communications outage.
A3.4. The site-sides HAWKA and DICEA should be included on all system outages, as well as
any other sites impacted. Using the site-side ALL, which is available in ESD, should be limited
to problems that definitively impact all reportable locations.
A3.5. NCMDR/NCCH enters the work center (WC) code 22SOPS.

                              FACILITY OUTAGE REPORTING

A4.1. NCMDR/NCCH, Comm Control, and RGF will report facility outages for their respective
locations.
A4.2. The system name for a facility outage is always FAC.
A4.3. Table A5.1 describes the equipment names used when reporting facility outages.
A4.4. The site-side for a facility outage should match the location.
A4.5. The work center code for a facility outage should match the reporting work center.

ECU             Environmental heating and cooling units. (EVCF)
EVAC            Evacuation of site personnel. (Should be a safety outage.)
GND             Site grounding.
HVAC            Air conditioning, air handling, humidity, and environmental controls.
PWR-A           Primary utility power (site feed equipment, AC switching equipment,
                circuit breaker panels, and power monitor panels).
PWR-B           Back-up utility power (generator and AC switching equipment).
SURGE           Equipment for arresting lightning or power surges.
TECHPWR         Technical power (UPS, batteries, bypass equipment, circuit breaker
                panels, and power monitor panels).

                         OUTAGE REPORTING WITHOUT ESD

A5.1. The 50 SCS Comm Focal Point (CFP) at SAFB manages maintenance jobs, collects
mission impact reports, and archives AFSCN outage information. The 50 SCS CFP maintains an
up-to-date view of AFSCN problems at all levels. The 50 SCS CFP also have access to ESD
similar to the NCMDR/NCCH, where they can review and broadcast pending outage reports.
This places the 50 SCS in the unique position of providing the perfect focal point for ESD-out
contingency procedures.
A5.2. The following paragraphs detail procedures for a work center that has lost access to ESD.
   A5.2.1. AFSCN User-if an AFSCN user has lost all access to outage information in ESD,
   they may:
       A5.2.1.1. Query an RGF, with whom they are in support at the time of the outage, for
       information about outages impacting their site.
       A5.2.1.2. Contact the 50 SCS CFP for outage information that may impact them or for
       any specific site.
   A5.2.2. Reporting Work Center-if a reporting work center has lost all access to ESD, they
   may:
       A5.2.2.1. Contact the 50 SCS CFP for the latest outage information.
       A5.2.2.2. Contact the 50 SCS CFP and verbally provide outage information for opening
       a new, updating an existing, or closing an existing outage report. The 50 SCS CFP will
       collect the verbally provided outage information and enter it into ESD as would the
       reporting work center.
       A5.2.2.3. Contact the NCMDR/NCCH and verbally provide outage information for
       opening a new, updating an existing, or closing an existing outage report. The
       NCMDR/NCCH will collect the verbally provided outage information and enter it into
       ESD as would the reporting work center.
   A5.2.2.4. NCMDR/NCCH—if the NCMDR/NCCH has lost the ability to review and
   broadcast outage reports in ESD, they may:
       A5.2.2.5. Contact the 50 SCS CFP to manage that portion of the NCMDR/NCCH
       responsibilities.
A5.3. Should ESD degrade or fail such that a majority of the ESD users and the 50 SCS CFP
itself have lost access ESD:
   A5.3.1. The 50 SCS CFP will maintain outage information in an independent database, and
   use this database for verbal inquiries and verbally provided outage information.
   A5.3.2. When ESD has recovered sufficiently for normal use, the reporting work centers or
   the 50 SCS CFP, as worked out between them, will update ESD with the outage information
   that had not been entered into ESD during the loss.
