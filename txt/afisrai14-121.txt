This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-1, Air Force Intelligence
Planning and Operations, 1 June 1999. This instruction establishes oversight responsibilities for
the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency’s (AF ISR Agency) national
and tactical GEOINT exploitation and dissemination. It establishes AF ISR Agency compliance
with the Director of National Intelligence’s analytical and intelligence publication standards as
articulated in Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 203 Analytic Standards and ICD 206
Sourcing Requirements for Disseminated Analytic Products. Aligns national production with the
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) best
GEOINT production practices program, and establishes requirements and standards for tactical
GEOINT exploitation and dissemination. It applies to NASIC and the 480 ISRW. Since this
instruction provides only general guidance, supplemental operating procedures are required to be
published and maintained by units having a GEOINT production, exploitation and dissemination
mission to meet the requirements and conditions of this instruction. When written, you must
forward one copy of each supplement or operating instruction (OI) to HQ AF ISR Agency/
A3OO. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
command.” Maintain records created as a result of prescribed processes IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
as found on the AF Portal at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims. Contact
supporting records managers as required.

1. GEOINT Production: For the purpose of this instruction, the term production refers to all
processes, to include the exploitation and dissemination of GEOINT products. GEOINT
collection activities encompass all aspects of: literal, infrared (IR), synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) imagery, and Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) capabilities. The terms imagery
intelligence and advanced geospatial intelligence are encompassed within this definition of
GEOINT regardless of the source. GEOINT includes the exploitation and analysis of electro-
optical, infrared, radar imagery, spectral, laser, IR, radiometric, SAR phase history, and Polari
metric data. It employs all ancillary data, signature information, and fused data products as
necessary. An effective exploitation and dissemination management program should facilitate
prompt recognition, rapid analysis and timely dissemination of intelligence that consistently and
accurately supports customer needs. Products issued must meet the highest standards in all
aspects—timeliness, format, and content. While post-release quality control will continue to be
an important part of exploitation and dissemination programs, each program will emphasize a
stringent, multilayered, pre-release quality control process.
2. Program Oversight Responsibilities:
    2.1. HQ AF ISR Agency/A3 will:
       2.1.1. Designate the Current Operations Branch, A3OO, as the Office of Primary

       2.6.1. Checklists must be coordinated with the Wing/Center Quality Control Program
       Manager to ensure standardization across the organization.
       2.6.2. Checklists must be designed to identify major and minor product errors. A major
       error is one that causes the product to be reissued. Major errors may include erroneous
       classification, inadequate and erroneous information, inaccurate geo location data, or
       improper distribution.
       2.6.3. Checklists will be designed with a numeric point system for each item evaluated.
       Checklists will be weighted so that any one major error will result in that product failing
       the quality control check, and an accumulation of minor errors may also result in an
       overall failure.
    2.7. Quality Control Requirements.
       2.7.1. A pre-release quality control of all products will be performed by a certified
       Quality Control Official prior to dissemination. This requirement cannot be waived.
       Focus on the accuracy and presentation of the information, but externals, especially
       distribution-related items, should also receive careful examination.
       2.7.2. The Wing/Center Operations Officer will establish a percentage of all products
       issued for post-release quality control. This percentage must ensure the effectiveness of
       the unit’s pre-release quality control program and the overall quality of unit production.
       The percentage of products receiving post-release quality control will be reported in the
       quarterly status report.
       2.7.3. In order to receive a satisfactory rating on any individual product, that product
       must obtain a quality control rating of 98% error free.
          2.7.3.1. The quality control should evaluate the timeliness, accuracy and presentation
          of the information.
          2.7.3.2. The Quality Control Official should ensure the appropriate tools were
          utilized and all capabilities maximized to satisfy the tasking.
          2.7.3.3. Product externals, especially distribution-related items, should receive
          careful examination.
          2.7.3.4. Correct meta data tagging will be evaluated.
       2.7.4. The quality control program will include a feedback mechanism to identify and
       correct poor performance. This mechanism must be outlined in the Wing/Center
       instruction.
    2.8. Adopted Form. AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
