                                               Chapter 1

                                  ACQUIRING REAL PROPERTY

1.1. Real Property Acquisition. Consider the following methods before acquiring real property by lease
or purchase:
   •   Using other real property under Air Force control.
   •   Obtaining real property excess to requirements of other military departments or other Govern-
       ment agencies.
   •   Withdrawing public land.
   •   Using real property with reuse or "recapture" rights.
   •   Acquiring real property from state or municipal governments through donations.
   •   Using real property under long-term, nominal, or low-cost lease.
   •   Exchanging Air Force real property for privately owned property of the same value.
   •   Acquiring title to real property by gift. (See AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Air Force.)

1.2. Methods of Acquisition. Installation commanders and MAJCOMs acquire real property by any
method that meets the Air Force requirement the most economical way. (See AFI 65-501, Economic
Analysis and Program Evaluation for Resource Management.) If possible, use a method that does not
have a significant impact on local economy.
   1.2.1. Fee Simple Title. Fee simple title means absolute ownership and is the most extensive owner-
   ship interest. When there is a requirement for permanent construction, acquire fee simple title to real
   property. This is in the best interest of the Government.
   1.2.2. Lesser Interests . Consider the following methods if the requirement is for a limited time and
   fee acquisition is too expensive:
       •   Easement (perpetual or specified period)
       •   Lease
       •   License
       •   Permit
   1.2.3. Leasehold Condemnations. Use this method of acquisition only to meet critical mission
   objectives. MAJCOMs must send requests to HQ AFREA/MI for SAF/MII approval.

1.3. Acquisition Standards. Installation commanders and MAJCOMs must ensure that acquisitions:
   •   Comply with AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements.
   •   Support the Air Force Comprehensive Plan. (See AFI 32-7062, Base Comprehensive Planning.)
   •   Protect historic and cultural properties. (See Title 25 U.S.C. Section 3001.)
6                                                                            AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


    •   Include environmental analysis documentation and provide an environmental baseline survey
        (EBS). (See AFIs 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis, and 32-7066, Cultural Resources
        Management).
    •   Consider flood plain hazards. (See EO 11988 and AFI 32-7060, Interagency Intergovern-
        mental Cooperation.)
    •   Minimize destruction or degradation of wetlands. (See EO 11990.)

1.4. Renewal of Leases . Request to renew leases as soon as you consider using a property beyond the
date its current lease expires. On 50- and 25-year leases, you may request renewals 3 years before leases
expire--and even earlier if circumstances warrant.
    1.4.1. MAJCOMs must send lease renewals with annual rentals of more than $200,000 and all lease
    condemnations to HQ AFREA/MI for approval. Do this at least 12 months before the lease expires.
    Send an environmental analysis document with each lease renewal request, as outlined in AFI
    32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis Process. Do not apply these requirements to real property
    used for industrial production and related purposes or to foreign real property cited in Chapter 7.
    1.4.2. The MAJCOM Director, Civil Engineering, or equivalent, approves lease renewals with an
    annual rental of $200,000 or less. This does not include GSA space.

1.5. Construction on Land Not Owned by the United States. MAJCOMs must send requests for con-
struction on land not owned by the United States to HQ AFREA/MI for SAF/MII approval. Include the
following data:
    •   Summary of the lease or easement terms.
    •   Map showing location of construction.
    •   Rental value of the property.
    •   How long the real property is needed.
    •   Estimated cost of existing Government facilities and proposed new Government construction.
    •   Estimated cost to restore the real property to the condition that existed when it was leased or to a
        condition stated in the lease document.
    •   Special circumstances that SAF/MII needs to approve.
    •   Justification for special terms or conditions.

1.6. Constructing, Improving, or Modifying Facilities. Do not construct, improve, or modify facilities
unless the Air Force has exclusive use of the real property.

1.7. Intergovernmental and Interagency Coordination for Environmental Planning (IICEP)
Reporting Requirements. MAJCOMs must submit each real property acquisition project that requires
congressional notification ($200,000 or more) through the IICEP process as outlined in AFI 32-7005,
Environmental Protection Committee.
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                    7


1.8. Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ). The Air Force may need to acquire land to
ensure the operational integrity of military airfields in the United States and in territorial areas adminis-
tered by the United States. (See AFI 32-7063, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone.)

1.9. Legislative Jurisdiction. Legislative jurisdiction is the power to pass and enforce United States
laws on matters that are ordinarily reserved for the states. Examples are crime and family laws. The two
statutes that concern acquiring and relinquishing legislative jurisdiction are 40 U.S.C 255 and 10 U.S.C
2683. See Attachment 2 for an explanation of the four types of legislative jurisdiction.
   1.9.1. After consulting with the local US attorney, installation commanders send requests to acquire
   or retrocede any degree of Federal legislative jurisdiction through MAJCOMs to HQ AFREA/MI for
   approval by SAF/MII.
   1.9.2. After SAF/MII approval, HQ AFREA/MI sends the request to the appropriate District Engineer
   for necessary action.
   1.9.3. The Air Force operates under a proprietorial interest in land unless it needs another interest to
   carry out the assigned mission. SAF/MII grants requests to retrocede unnecessary legislative jurisdic-
   tion to the state, particularly jurisdiction over public roads that cross or border an Air Force base or
   installation.
   1.9.4. In requests to acquire legislative jurisdiction, include:

     2.8.3. MAJCOMs, with advance knowledge that another Government agency is to report real prop-
     erty as excess, may ask for a transfer according to paragraph 2.8. They may do this before the other
     agency reports the "excess" to GSA's federal property resources service.

2.9. Transfers From Another Military Department. MAJCOMs may make such transfers without
compensation. (See Title 10 U.S.C. 2571.) They must provide HQ AFREA/MI with data in paragraph

                              ACQUIRING LEASEHOLD INTERESTS

3.1. Leases . The Air Force may enter into 12-month, renewable leases. It must pay rentals when due,
subject to available funds. When proposing to lease a property, an Air Force activity must:
   •   Provide an economic analysis (see AFI 65-501), if the rental fee will exceed $200,000 annually.
   •   Ensure that the buildings and facilities are accessible to the handicapped.
   •   Give preference to leasing buildings that use solar heating and cooling equipment or other renew-
       able energy sources.
   •   Evaluate the building's occupational safety, fire, and health hazards.
   •   Prepare an EBS in accordance with AFI 32-7006, Cultural Resources Management.
NOTE: As an exception to the normal policy of 1-year renewable leases, the Air Force may enter into a
firm term lease for more than 1 year if the cost does not exceed $200,000. This cost includes rent, utili-
ties, repairs, alterations and other expenses. SAF/MII must approve such leases.

3.2. Lease Acquisitions Within Command Approval Authority . MAJCOM Director, Civil Engi-
neering may approve leases and lease renewals if the rental, estimated rental, or rental value of all space
or facilities at one CONUS location is not more than $200,000 a year or the lease term is not more than 1
year, with four options to renew.
   3.2.1. MAJCOMs may not delegate this approval authority to intermediate or installation command-
   ers. However, execution authority may be delegated. Requests for US Air Force recruiting space
   must be sent by the MAJCOM to HQ AETC/CEPE for action.
   3.2.2. MAJCOMs may negotiate, approve, and execute leases to the United States for military family
   housing (MFH) facilities as stated in Title 10 U.S.C. 2828. For leases of family housing:
       •   MAJCOMs must survey existing family housing to validate the need or have HQ USAF/CEH
           justify the need.
       •   HQ USAF/CEH must have approved "lease points" (i.e. unit authorizations) and enough
           funds, unit authorizations, to cover the lease requirement.
       •   MAJCOMs must notify Congress in advance, if lease exceeds $500,000.
       •   HQ USAF/CEH must notify HQ AFREA/MI when requirement has been met.
   3.2.3. MAJCOMs must determine whether a lease or service contract can meet the requirement:
       •   Do not use service contracts to acquire quarters for base permanent-party, unaccompanied
           personnel, unless the need is short-term or fluctuating (see AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied
           Housing).
       •   When there is a shortage of on-base transient quarters, you may use service contracts for
           non-exclusive space (nonspecific quarters) to provide accommodations for transient person-
           nel.
16                                                                              AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


3.3. Lease Acquisitions Above Command-Level Authority. If the project changes in scope or cost,
MAJCOMs must request new leases and renewals. Send requests through HQ AFREA/MI to SAF/MII
for:
     •   Space or facilities at one location whose estimated annual cost or value exceeds $200,000
     •   Change in cost or scope
     •   Leasehold condemnations
     •   Real property requiring a certificate of necessity
     •   Land you intend to build on
     •   Commercial (industrial-type) property
     •   Real property on which you want a purchase option (see Title 10 U.S.C. 2677)
     •   Real property within the limits of a civil airport
     •   Real property that is subject to "recapture" or reverter clause
     •   Port storage facilities (land or water) affecting the transfer or interchange of cargo
     •   Real property within the National Capital Region
     •   Real property planned for flying activities
     •   GSA space
     •   Firm term leases longer than 1 year

NOTES:
MAJCOMs must use the following procedures for lease acquisitions and renewals.
     •   To renew condemnations leases and leaseholds with an estimated annual cost exceeding
         $200,000, submit requests at least 10 months before the lease expires.
     •   To renew or acquire leases whose estimated annual costs exceed $200,000, include a lease plan-
         ning report (LEPR) with your submission.
     •   To renew or acquire leases whose estimated annual costs are less than $200,000, get HQ AFREA/
         MI approval (by letter or telephone) to direct the Corps of Engineers (COE) to prepare a brief
         lease planning report (BLEPR).

3.4. Acquiring and Renewing Other Leases:
     3.4.1. After HQ AFREA/MI approval, submit requests for LEPRs to the appropriate district engineer
     at least 16 months before the lease expires. For 50-year leases, submit LEPR requests 2 years before
     the term expires regardless of current rental cost.
     3.4.2. After approval, send the lease acquisition request to HQ AFREA/MI with four copies of the
     LEPR and supporting data:
         •   Description and location of the real property showing gross and net usable square feet
         •   Vicinity map showing location in relation to the parent installation
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                    17


       •   Proposed use of the real property and justification, based on appropriate criteria
       •   A description of any real property currently used to meet the requirement
       •   Date you need possession and the estimated period of occupancy
       •   Estimated annual cost of the lease (distinguish between reimbursable and nonreimbursable
           costs)
       •   Citation of funds, if known, or a request that the finance officer make funds available
       •   Services and utilities to be provided under the lease and any associated costs
       •   Statement that screening has been completed
       •   Information to support a certificate of necessity as described in paragraph 3.9. if required.
       •   Condition assessment of all facilities
       •   Assessment of maintenance requirements.
       •   Technical survey of occupational safety, fire, and health hazards for buildings that contain
           more than 20,000 square feet (SF) of usable floor space or that accommodate at least 50 peo-
           ple
       •   Description and cost estimates of rehabilitation or alteration requirements
       •   Statement as to whether the facilities are in place of new construction previously requested
       •   Environmental impact as outlined in AFI 32-7006, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
       •   Economic analysis, as prescribed by AFI 65-501 (for leases over $200,000 annually)

3.5. Leasing Private Family and Unaccompanied Personnel Housing. Lease family housing units in
the private sector according to the procedures in AFI 32-6001, Housing Management. MAJCOMs may
acquire housing for unaccompanied personnel by lease if:
   •   Government-owned or -controlled quarters are not available.
   •   Adequate private rental housing is not available at rents of less than 150 percent authorized basic
       allowance for quarters (BAQ).
   •   Unaccompanied personnel quarters being considered meet standards established in AFI 32-6005.
   •   Local commander has sufficient base support funds to cover lease costs.

3.6. Limitations on Rents:
   3.6.1. If the court sets the rental fee, this amount may not exceed the fair market rental value (as deter-
   mined by an appraisal). This requirement does not apply to leaseholds acquired in condemnation pro-
   ceedings.
   3.6.2. In addition, if the annual rental exceeds $2,000, this amount may not be more than 20 percent
   of the fair market value of the leased premises as of the lease date.
   3.6.3. If you are renewing a lease, redetermine the fair market value as of the new lease date.

3.7. Limitations on Alteration, Improvement, and Repair of Leased Premises:
18                                                                              AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


     3.7.1. Fair Rental Consideration Leases. This limitation applies to leases that include land and
     improvements. It does not apply if the lease is for unimproved land. Cost for altering, improving, and
     repairing a leased facility must not be more than:
         •   30 percent of the rent for the first year of the rental term
         •   30 percent of the total rent, if the term is less than 1 year
         •   30 percent of the term of the lease and options to renew
     3.7.2. Nominal Consideration and Rent-Free Leases. The cost for altering, improving, or repairing is
     considered "rent" under nominal consideration leases. Spend no more than $2,000 or 20 percent of
     the fair market value of the leased premises, whichever is greater, each year of the rental term. Use the
     fair market value of all the buildings included in the lease rather than the value of one building when
     determining the maximum amount to spend on one building. Do not split alteration or construction
     projects into segments that do not provide a complete and usable facility. (See AFI 32-8001, Planning
     and Programming of Facility Construction Projects.)

3.8. Exceptions to Limitations. Spending limitations for altering, improving, or repairing leased build-
ings do not apply to the cost of:
     •   Installed equipment and other detachable items
     •   Restoration at the end of a lease
     •   Repairs needed because of malicious mischief by Government employees or damages not covered
         by the lease
     •   Alterations and improvements that come under the Military Construction Authorization Act.

3.9. Certificates of Necessity. MAJCOM must send requests for a certificate of necessity to HQ
AFREA/MI for SAF/MII approval. Do this before obligating funds that exceed the 20 and 30 percent
limitations for modification of nominal- and fair-rental leased buildings. With your request, include:
     •   Completed DD Form 1391, FY 19XX Military Construction Program
     •   Single-line drawing
     •   Statement of cost, scope, and type of work already done
     •   Identification of work not classified as leasehold improvements, such as movable partitions and
         shelving
     3.9.1. A base or installation must keep records on an AF Form 1430, Real Property Accountable
     Records-Buildings, of alterations, improvements, or repairs for each leased building, portion of a
     building, or other real property improvements. These records serve as a basis for determining the
     need for a certificate of necessity when the cumulative total of expenditures has reached the allowable
     limit.
     3.9.2. Once the Certificate of Necessity is issued, stay within its limitations in terms of work and cost.
     Get a new certification to do additional unspecified work.

3.10. Payment for Leases. MAJCOMs must designate a finance office to make payment for leases exe-
cuted by or for the Air Force. Finance offices make payments as follows.
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                 19


   3.10.1. Use negotiated leases to obtain the use of real property subject to "recapture."
   3.10.2. Do not pay for rental of such property during a national emergency (National Emergencies
   Act of 1976).
   3.10.3. Pay for rental of such property if the owner constructed, added to, and paid for the property
   with non-Federal funds.
   3.10.4. For airport property rentals, pay the Air Force share of maintenance costs.
   3.10.5. Do not pay leasehold rents in advance except in foreign countries (see Chapter 7).
   3.10.6. You may pay rent in advance to states and state agencies (Comp GenDecision B-191300, 31
   March 1978).

3.11. Restoration of Leased Real Property. The Army COE must restore leased property, when neces-
sary. Air Force pays for restoration.

3.12. Recording Leases. Air Force does not always record its leases in public land records. Recording
them may be beneficial, however, in cases where the MAJCOM determines that a failure to record them
might prejudice Air Force rights under the lease.

3.13. AAFES Leases :
   3.13.1. Do not use appropriated funds to lease property for activities of AAFES facilities in the
   United States and in territorial areas administered by the United States. (See Title 10 U.S.C. 9779(c).)
   3.13.2. In foreign countries, use appropriated funds to lease structures and related real property for
   AAFES facilities for 5 years or less. This requirement does not preclude assignment of space in Air
   Force leased buildings to AAFES, even though nonappropriated funds are used for AAFES leases in
   the United States. For more information on AAFES leases, see AFI 34-105.

PREDESIGNATING NONINDUSTRIAL FACILITIES FOR EMERGENCY REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Emergency Requirements. Installation commanders must have access to the housing, training, and
nonindustrial facilities needed to respond effectively to mobilization surges and other major national
emergencies, and meet requirements of Executive Order 11490. Ensure this access by:
     •   Identifying supplemental nonindustrial facility requirements, conditions, and proposed extent of
         use.
     •   Requesting facility assignments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
         regional director.
     •   Arranging for formal agreement with a facility owner or operator, after FEMA approval.
     •   Maintaining records on the assignment and planned use of predesignated facilities to evaluate pre-
         paredness capabilities.

                                 ACQUIRING LESSER INTERESTS

5.1. Special Licenses. MAJCOMs may obtain temporary rights of entry, licenses, or permits for uses
such as surveys, field training exercises, testing sites for communications adaptability, and testing water
wells.
   5.1.1. MAJCOMs may use the services of the district engineer for technical services, such as property
   negotiations, appraisals, and lease preparation..
   5.1.2. Licenses for environmental monitoring may be for longer periods, but no more than 5 years.
   5.1.3. Give the COE district office a copy of all executed licenses that convey real property interest.
   5.1.4. Use licenses:
       •   In place of clearance easements, to remove or stop natural growth protruding into aircraft
           glide paths.
       •   When the interest fulfills the requirement and a lease or greater estate is not necessary.

5.2. Delegation of Authority. MAJCOMs may delegate any or all of their special license authority to
intermediate or installation commanders.

5.3. Permits and Licenses From Other Government Agencies. MAJCOMs may go to other Govern-
ment agencies for permits or licenses granting the Air Force exclusive or non-exclusive use of real prop-
erty under the agencies' control. MAJCOMs may use the district engineer for all or part of the acquisition.
Send a copy of the executed document to HQ AFREA/MI.
   5.3.1. Obtain a permit or license from another Government agency when:
       •   The permit or license term is not more than 5 years.
       •   The acquisition is not more than 100 acres or does not have an annual fair market rental value
           of over $200,000, if leased to a private party. (See Title 10 U.S.C. 2662.)
       •   Air Force will not alter the facilities (for exceptions, contact HQ AFREA/MI).
   5.3.2. To obtain permits or licenses for Government-owned property with an annual fair market rental
   value (if leased to a private party) exceeding $200,000, send requests through the MAJCOM and HQ

                              ACQUIRING GSA CONTROLLED SPACE

6.1. GSA Controlled Space:
     6.1.1. Send requests for GSA general purpose space (GSA-owned or -leased) outside the National
     Capital Region (ONCR) to HQ AFREA/MI. Use SF Forms 81, Request for Space, and 81-A, Space
     Requirements Worksheet, to request approval.
     6.1.2. Send requests for space within the National Capital Region to 1100th National Capital Region
     Support Group, Engineering and Services Division (1100 SPTG/DOL). Use SF Forms 81 and 81-A
     and DD Forms 1450, DoD Space Requirements Data, and 1450-1, DoD Space Requirements, Part
     II.

6.2. Approval Authorities. Based upon the annual cost of GSA rent, Air Force activities must secure the
following approval prior to acquisition of GSA space:
     •   Up to $100,000, request approval from HQ AFREA/MI or 1100 NCR SPTG/DOL.
     •   More than $100,000 but less than $200,000, request approval from SAF/MII.
     •   More than $200,000, report requests to the House Armed Services Committee.

6.3. Obtaining GSA Space in Urban Centers. GSA is the only leasing agency for general purpose
space in urban centers.
     6.3.1. Send requests for GSA space in:
         •   ONCR - HQ AFREA/MI sends approved requests through COE to the appropriate GSA
             regional office.
         •   NCR - 1100 NCR SPTG/DOL sends approved requests through Washington Headquarters
             Services (OSD), Space Plans and Acquisition Division, Pentagon to GSA's National Capital
             Region Office.
     6.3.2. The COE may obtain the space, provided that:
         •   Lease is for no rental or nominal consideration, or
         •   GSA grants authority to the COE, or
         •   GSA designates the space as "special purpose" suitable only for Air Force or DoD use.

6.4. Obtaining GSA Space Outside Urban Centers. The COE obtains space outside urban centers on
the direction of the Air Force..

6.5. Space Alterations. GSA works with the Air Force during design development to ensure that the
design meets Air Force needs. GSA pays for the initial space alteration.

6.6. Relocating From GSA Space. If GSA directs an ONCR Air Force activity to relocate to another
GSA space, HQ AFREA/MI approval is not necessary, unless annual GSA rent for the new space
exceeds:
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                23


   •   The rent of the old space
   •   $200,000 per year

6.7. GSA Reimbursable Work. GSA reimburses for work such as alterations, guard service, and special
cleaning services.
   6.7.1. Submit work requests for GSA space outside the NCR to the GSA building manager on GSA
   Form 2957, Reimbursable Work Authorization. This form is available from the GSA building
   manager responsible for the space the Air Force is using.
   6.7.2. Submit work requests for the NCR to 1100 NCR SPTG/DOL on AFHQ Form 73.

6.8. Payment for GSA-Controlled Space and Services. Air Force activities using GSA-controlled
space must pay GSA for all space and services (40 U.S.C. 490(a)(6)).
   6.8.1. GSA sends quarterly rent bills as well as a "reconciliation" bill to:
       •   HQ AFREA/MI, for ONCR space.
       •   Washington Headquarters Service (OSD, Space Plans and Acquisition Division), Pentagon,
           for NCR space.
   6.8.2. Air Force Headquarters or DoD, as appropriate, pays the GSA rent. However, GSA sends bills
   for both recurring and nonrecurring reimbursables directly to the paying office of the Air Force activ-
   ity occupying the GSA-controlled space, as cited on GSA Form 2957, Reimbursable Work Autho-
   rization.

6.9. Termination of Assignment of GSA Space. Submit all notifications of intent to terminate ONCR

                                                  Chapter 7

ACQUIRING REAL PROPERTY IN TERRITORIAL AREAS AND THE COMMONWEALTH
                OF PUERTO RICO AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES

7.1. Acquiring Property in Territorial Areas and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Procedures
for acquiring property in these areas are similar to those for acquiring property in the United States. There
are exceptions, however.
     7.1.1. MAJCOMs must coordinate all requests for government-owned real property with the US
     agency's local representative from one of the following agencies: (After coordination, send requests
     to HQ AFREA/MI.)
        •   Bureau of Land Management
        •   Department of Interior
        •   Department of the Navy
        •   Another applicable agency
     7.1.2. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional office approves requests for real property
     under FAA control.

7.2. Acquiring Property in Foreign Countries. Acquire real property in foreign countries through an
international agreement or foreign operating right clearance, in accordance with DoD 4500.54G (DoD
Foreign Clearance Guide, General Information Booklet, chapter 7).
     7.2.1. There are three methods of acquisition:
        •   No cost, including follow-on construction
        •   Joint use with a host nation whose construction criteria may not match US standards
        •   Lease of privately owned property
     7.2.2. MAJCOMs may lease property in the private sector, if the foreign military agreement allows it.
     They may lease directly from private or corporate owners or indirectly through a government agency
     of the host nation. The lease instrument must:
        •   Fit the local situation in each country.
        •   Include clauses required by US law.
        •   Be written in English and the language of the host nation.
     7.2.3. MAJCOMs must avoid leasing directly from a foreign government.

7.3. Acquiring Interest in Foreign Property. Acquire interest in real property according to the foreign
military rights agreement (see DoD 4500.54G and AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding and Reporting).
     7.3.1. The preferred method is right of use for a specified period as provided under a military rights
     agreement.
     7.3.2. MAJCOMs may consider lesser interest, such as a license or easement, if the Air Force does
     not require exclusive use of the real property.
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                   25


7.4. Department of State Responsibility. The Department of State conducts foreign affairs. The US
ambassador or a diplomatic representative to the foreign country concerned usually, with the advice and
assistance of the US military authorities, conducts or monitors negotiations for military rights for the US
Forces stationed in that country.
   7.4.1. Air Force activities with missions in foreign countries must understand that real estate activities
   are sensitive. Any unauthorized actions to acquire land could prejudice the broad interests of the
   United States in those countries.
       7.4.1.1. The overseas points of contact for all Air Force real estate actions in foreign countries are
       headquarters:
           •   USAFE
           •   ACC
           •   AFMC
           •   AFSPC
           •   PACAF
           •   AMC
NOTE: The director, civil engineering, at each MAJCOM is responsible for real property actions.
       7.4.1.2. For Eastern (Atlantic Missile Range) and Western (Pacific Missile Range) Ranges,
       AFSPC may elect to follow procedures set forth in paragraph 7.11.
       7.4.1.3. For real estate projects outside these agencies' areas of jurisdiction, contact HQ AFREA/
       MI.
   7.4.2. Installation commanders and MAJCOM directors, civil engineering, must avoid piecemeal
   acquisitions.
   7.4.3. MAJCOM Directors, Civil Engineering and installation commanders must request acquisitions
   through proper channels and in time to meet land-need dates.
   7.4.4. Overseas points of contact (see paragraph 7.4.1.1.) must:
       •   Closely monitor developments to help resolve problems without delay.
       •   Keep HQ AFREA/MI and participating commands informed of the approval status.
       •   Assist in the acquisition.

7.5. Acquisition Procedures. Acquire property within the framework of existing government-to-gov-
ernment and subsidiary agreements.
   7.5.1. Some real property requirements arise in countries not covered by any agreement or fall outside
   the scope of existing agreements. For these requirements, send an acquisition request to HQ AFREA/
   MI (see DoD 4500.54G), with an information copy to HQ USAF/XOXI.
   7.5.2. Send requests for foreign operating right clearance directly to HQ USAF/XOXI if you deter-
   mine that an upcoming requirement is not covered by an agreement. Send an information copy of the
   request to HQ AFREA/MI and the overseas point of contact (paragraph 7.4.1.1.).
26                                                                              AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


     7.5.3. MAJCOMs may use a certificate of fair market value in place of a formal appraisal for leases
     whose annual rental is less than $200,000.

7.6. Approval "In Principle" for Leases in Foreign Countries. HQ AFREA/MI gives approval "in
principle" to leases in foreign countries when the lease best meets the Air Force requirement.
     7.6.1. To request approval "in principle," the overseas point of contact writes to HQ AFREA/MI. It
     does this before finding a facility or starting lease negotiations.
     7.6.2. HQ AFREA/MI reviews the requests and obtains the necessary clearances from the DoD. At
     the same time, the MAJCOM may try to find suitable real property according to the foreign rights
     agreements. These efforts are exploratory; do not commit the United States to a lease for any real
     property.
     7.6.3. HQ AFREA/MI tells the overseas point of contact whether it has approved or disapproved the
     request and directs further action.
     7.6.4. To lease real property in foreign countries that have no overseas points of contact, MAJCOMs
     send requests to HQ AFREA/MI.

7.7. One-Year Leases. In foreign countries, overseas points of contact may lease structures and related
real property for 1 year. Leases must be renewable from year to year, by notice, and carry an annual rental
of $250,000 or less (Title 10 U.S.C. 2675). This category does not include "build or lease" projects and
family housing units.
     •   Only the USAFE, PACAF, AFSPC, ACC, AFMC, and AMC directors, civil engineering, have
         this foreign leasing approval. They may delegate it to:
     •   Their deputy director, civil engineering.
     •   An official performing the same functions as the deputy director, civil engineering.

7.8. Firm-Term Leases. In foreign countries, the director, civil engineering, of those MAJCOMs listed
in paragraph 7.7.1 may approve the leasing of structures and related real property for a firm term of up to
5 years.
     7.8.1. MAJCOMs may extend these leases in 5-year increments, following SAF/MII approval.
     7.8.2. Send requests for leases and renewals to SAF/MII through HQ AFREA/MI, for:
         •   Leases with terms exceeding 1 year
         •   Annual rentals exceeding $250,000
         •   Rentals exceeding $150,000 for 12 consecutive months
         •   Family housing
         •   Build or lease projects
     7.8.3. Use the 5-year leasing authority if:
         •   A firm requirement for the real property exists for the full term of the lease.
         •   The cost of renting for the firm term is substantially less than the total cost of renewing a lease
             each year.
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                  27


       •   Negotiations confirm that the real property cannot be acquired under an annually renewable
           lease.

7.9. Advance Rental Payments. In foreign countries, MAJCOMs may pay rental fees in advance if that
is the local custom (Title 10 U.S.C. 2396) and HQ AFREA/MI approves.
   •   To make advance rental payments for real property in foreign countries, send a justification certif-
       icate to HQ AFREA/MI for approval. The commander or a designated representative signs the
       certificate. In the certificate:
   •   Describe the local custom of paying rental fees in advance.
   •   Specify the customary time period for such advance payments.
   •   Include a support statement with written confirmation from local government officials or the
       American Embassy.

7.10. Responsibilities of Overseas Points of Contact. Overseas points of contact ensure that rentals
paid for leased property are fair and that leases and other instruments are legal. Acquisitions must comply
with the terms of the foreign military rights agreement.

7.11. Construction on Leased Property in Foreign Countries. If the lease proposal involves construc-
tion, alteration, or improvement of facilities, lease the property for a long enough term to meet the Air
Force use requirement.
   •   You do not need Certificates of Necessity for lease acquisitions or for alterations, improvements,
       or repairs. If alterations, improvements, or repairs cost more than 30 percent of the first-year
       rental term, however, you must get advance approval from HQ AFREA/MI. In this case send
       enough information to justify the Certificate of Necessity (see paragraph 3.9.).

7.12. Acquiring Overseas Property. Send all acquisition requests, except as prescribed in paragraph
1.4.1., through overseas points of contact, according to the following guidelines.
   7.12.1. The requester states the real property requirement, gives the supporting documentation listed
   in paragraph 1.13., and requests permission to make a site selection survey.
   7.12.2. The MAJCOM decides whether existing government-to-government agreements or other
   arrangements with the host country allow the requirement.

7.13. Acquiring Property Within Overseas Commands' Jurisdiction. If the requirement falls under
existing agreements, process the real property acquisition as follows.
   7.13.1. The overseas point of contact obtains host country approval for the site selection survey and
   notifies HQ AFREA/MI of the ongoing action. On approval of the site selection survey, the overseas
   point of contact notifies the requester.
   7.13.2. After completing the survey, the requester notifies the overseas point of contact of the results:
       •   State the locations of the most satisfactory site and alternate sites.
       •   Include a first choice and at least one alternate choice.
28                                                                           AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


     7.13.3. The overseas point of contact informally discusses the site selections with the proper United
     States authorities in the country concerned to determine the impact of the proposed acquisition. MAJ-
     COMs must report to HQ AFREA/MI immediately if any unusual or unfavorable problems surface
     during the informal discussions or site surveys.
     7.13.4. When all parties reach agreement on the site selection, the MAJCOM must send a formal
     acquisition request through established channels (see paragraph 7.4.) to the host country. Send a copy
     of the request to HQ AFREA/MI.
     7.13.5. Missile range (HQ AFSPC) actions under this are limited to range and range-user require-
     ments in the up-range area (north of Brazil).

7.14. Acquiring Property Outside Overseas Commands' Jurisdiction. If the proposed land require-
ment falls outside the overseas command's jurisdiction or cannot be met within existing agreements, the
overseas point of contact sends the proposal to HQ USAF/XOXI, with a copy to HQ AFREA/MI. HQ
USAF/XOXI processes the requirements through the DoD and Department of State.
     7.14.1. With all requests for real property, include complete information and justification as required
     by DOD 4500.54G, AFI 51-701, and this instruction.
     7.14.2. MAJCOMs must not take any independent action that might jeopardize procedures set by HQ
     AFREA/MI.

7.15. Distribution of Real Estate Instruments. Send one copy of all executed instruments for acquisi-
tion of real property in foreign countries to HQ AFREA/MI.

                                         GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Terms
Acquired Land—Land obtained from any private or public source other than land withdrawn from the
public domain.
Annexation—Procedure by which a municipality--a city, town, or village--incorporates Air Force land
within its corporate limits. Procedures vary depending on state law.
Certificate of Necessity—Written statement, signed by SAF/MII, certifying that the Air Force must
exceed the cost limits established in this instruction, relative to annual rent or alterations, improvements,
and repairs to leased buildings.
Cession—Ceding or yielding by a state of its legislativejurisdiction over government-controlled real
property to the Federal Government.
Clearance Easement—Right to remove or prevent obstructions rising into the airspace.
Clear Zone Easement—Right to prohibit all uses of clear zone land that are incompatible with or could
impede aircraft operations. (See AFI 32-7063.) The clear zone is land within 3,000 feet of the runway
threshold and extending 1,000 to 1,500 feet on each side of the runway center line.
Commercial Facilities (Industrial-Type)—Air Force owned and operated facilities housing a function
that private industry could perform. Examples are motor repair shops, laundries, bakeries, and ice cream
manufacturing plants. (Exceptions are base exchanges, commissaries, and other nonappropriated fund
activities.)
Condemnation—Judicial proceeding that the Government starts through the Department of Justice to
exercise its right of "eminent domain." Condemnation results in passage of title and land to the
government, with or without the consent of the landowner but with "just compensation."
Consideration—Compensation (such as money, material, or services) that is given for something
acquired or promised. This may be:
   •    Appraised fair market value of the real property, or
   •    Protection of the real property against loss by fire, water, or other causes, or
   •    Any mutually agreeable arrangement that does not conflict with governing statutory limitations.
Declaration of Excess (DE)—Narrative description of real property that is no longer required for
foreseeable Air Force missions. The declaration lists the land, type of Governmental real estate interest,
facility inventory information, recommended disposal dates, reuse rights, and services, obligations, and
outgrants outstanding. (See AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property.)
Declaration of Taking—Pleading filed with a Federal court of law in a real property condemnation
proceeding whereby the Government , upon filing, deposits estimated "just compensation" in the court
and acquires vested interest in the real estate.
Division Engineer—One of several staff members of the US Army Corps of Engineers who supervises
certain District Engineers and reports to the Chief of Engineers.
30                                                                             AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


Easement—Right to use the land of another for specific purpose. Usually, owners of the land continue in
possession and can use it so long as such use does not interfere with the purpose for which easement was
granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
license in that:
     •   The privilege granted usually cannot be withdrawn during its term.
     •   It is considered to be a "permanent" interest in the property if the term exceeds 1 year.
Eminent Domain—Right of the Government to take private property for public use upon payment of
"just compensation."
Environmental Assessment (EA)—Document, created early in the planning process, for evaluating the
potential environmental impact of a proposed action. Assessment covers the same topical areas as an
environmental impact statement (EIS), but with less detail. Assessment leads either to an EIS or to a
finding of no significant impact (FONZI). (See AFI 32-7061.)
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)—Detailed full-disclosure report required by the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347). The EIS identifies the anticipated
environmental impact of a proposed Air Force action and recommends ways to mitigate any adverse
effects. It consists of:
     •   Draft statement that the preparer files with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
         makes available to the public for comment.
     •   Final statement that incorporates feedback on the draft statement (AFI 32-7061) and goes on file
         with EPA.
Fee Ownership—Title to real property belonging to a person or the Government for which full and
unconditional ownership exists. Such ownership does not necessarily include mineral rights.
Flood Plain—"100-year" flood plain is the lowland area adjoining inland and coastal waters; it includes
flood-prone areas of offshore islands that would be inundated by the "base flood." The "critical actions"
(or "500-year") flood plain is the area that would be inundated by a 500-year flood. (See AFI 32-7003,
Environmental Research and Development.)
General Purpose Space—Space in buildings and associated land under the assignment authority of the
General Services Administration (GSA). It is space that GSA considers suitable for use by Federal
agencies, generally. It excludes:
     •   Space in any building in a foreign country.
     •   Space in any building on the grounds of a military or Coast Guard installation.
     •   Space in airports.
Grantee—Person receiving a grant.
Grantor—Person making the grant. A transferor of property.
Government Services Administration (GSA) Reimbursables—Nonstandard services for which the
Air Force must reimburse GSA.
GSA Rent—Rate that GSA charges for Government-owned or leased space under GSA assignment. The
user charge approximates commercial charges for comparable space and services. GSA rent is the new
term for standard-level user charge (SLUC).
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                  31


GSA Space—Space in GSA-owned or -leased buildings that is assigned to an Air Force or other
Government activity. This space includes land incidental to the use of the space.
Industrial Facility—Any Air Force-owned,- leased, or -controlled real property facility that a contractor
uses to perform Government research, development, test, evaluation, production, maintenance, or
modification or to store production machinery and equipment in support of such activity.
Ingrants—Documents (such as licenses, leases, permits, easements, foreign base rights agreements, and
treaties) that give the Air Force an interest in or control of real property in less-than-fee ownership.
Interest—Right, claim, title, or legal share in something.
Lease—Cconveyance of exclusive possessory interest in real property for a specified term in return for
payment of rent or other consideration to the owner.
Legislative Jurisdiction—Power and authority of the Federal government to legislate and to exercise
executive and judicial powers within the area.
Lessee—One who possesses the right to occupy real property under a lease.
Lessor—One who holds title to, and conveys the right to use and occupy, a property under a lease.
License—Privilege to use or pass over a licenser's real property for a specific purpose (such as
right-of-entry for survey and exploration, construction, or tree topping).. Licenses granted to other
Federal agencies are called "permits."
Mobilization—Augmentation of existing military forces by the Federalization of National Guard units,
activation of Reserve units, call-up of individual Reservists, or increased Selective Service induction to
meet force levels approved by the Secretary of Defense.
National Capital Region (NCR)—Region encompassing the District of Columbia; Montgomery and
Prince George's counties in Maryland; Arlington and Fairfax counties in Virginia; and the cities of
Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church in Virginia.
Nominal Rent—Token rental consideration in money or services. Generally, it involves a rental payment
of $1.00 per year or per term. Nominal rental also means a consideration completely unrelated to the
actual or fair market value of the leased property.
Nonindustrial Facility—Unit of real property (other than DoD real property), including improvements,
not used or suitable for:
   •   Production or maintenance of materials, munitions, equipment, and other products for military or
       civilian use.
   •   Research.
   •   Ocean terminals.
Nonindustrial facilities include hotels, motels, resort facilities, educational institutions, and other real
property used for military purposes.
Offer of Gift (Donation)—Voluntary offer to transfer or convey to the Government an interest in real
property without payment or consideration of any kind by the Government (AFI 51-601).
Option to Purchase—Contract whereby the owner of the real property gives the Government the right to
acquire an interest in the property at a stated price during a specified period of time. An offer to buy
32                                                                            AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994


property, unsupported by any consideration (i.e. no consideration), is not considered an option, and it may
be withdrawn at any time (Title 10 U.S.C. 2677).
Outgrants—Documents such as leases, licenses, easements, and joint-use agreements that transfer
interest in or control of a real property from the Air Force to another Government agency, a non-Federal
entity, or a private party. (See AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Real Property.)
Permit—This term has two definitions; do not confuse the two uses of the term:
     1. A nonpossessory right of exclusive or non-exclusive use of real property. When granted to a
        non-Federal party, it generally covers a one-time use and is called a "license."
     2. An authorization to use property under the jurisdiction of one Government agency by another for
        a definite period.
Project—Real property acquisition at an Air Force installation to fulfill a known requirement.
Acquisition involves related real property actions; together they constitute a complete project. (For
example, the acquisition of land for an ammunition storage project usually involves the acquisition of fee
ownership for the land area used to construct storage facilities and restrictive easements over an adjacent
safety area.)
Public Domain—Land that the United States originally acquired from foreign governments and still
owns. The Department of the Interior administers this land.
Public Lands—Any land and interest in land that the United States owns and that the Secretary of the
Interior administers through the Bureau of Land Management. The term excludes:
     •   Lands located on the outer Continental Shelf.
     •   Lands held for the benefit of Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos (43 U.S.C. 1702[e]). (See "withdrawn
         land.")
Real Estate Directive—Request to another Federal agency (such as the Office of the Chief of Engineers,
the Army Corps of Engineers, or Department of the Interior) to act on a real estate matter on behalf of the
Air Force.
Real Property—Lands, buildings, structures, utilities systems, improvements, and appurtenances. Real
property includes equipment attached to and made part of buildings and structures (such as heating
systems); it does not include movable equipment (such as plant equipment).
Restrictive Safety Easement—Right to restrict the erection of habitable buildings, the congregation of
people, or other activities within a specified safety clearance distance of munitions storage areas, armed
aircraft, and explosives related facilities. (See AFI 91-409, Explosive Safety Standards.)
Retrocession—Act of giving back to a state all or some Federal legislative jurisdiction.
Right of Entry—Temporary right to enter on real property for a specified purpose without acquiring any
estate or interest in it.
Right-of-Way Easement—Right to pass over the land of another for a specific purpose. Such use could
be for constructing a road or for installing pipelines, pole lines, or telephone cables. An easement is for a
longer period than a "license," which is momentary.
Service Contract—Contract between the Air Force and a contractor for nonpersonal services, executed
under the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947. The contracting party agrees to perform some
AFI32-9001 27 JULY 1994                                                                                   33


service for the Air Force and the Air Force agrees to pay for it. In performing the service, the contractor
may use real property in which he or she has an interest, even to the extent of permitting the Air Force to
go on the property in a non-exclusive manner.
"Special Purpose" Space—Space in buildings not under GSA assignment, and incidental land, that one
agency uses for its special purposes. Examples of such space are computer centers, hospitals,
laboratories, mints, and penal institutions.
Subordination Agreement—Agreement whereby the owner of a real estate interest (including
subsurface oil, gas, and mineral rights) agrees to suspend or limit the exercise of all or part of his or her
ownership rights under specified terms and conditions (usually to avoid interference with Governmental
use of the surface or operations).
Suspension Agreement—Suspension by lease of individual's grazing or mineral rights in public or
state-owned land.
Urban Centers—Cities and standard metropolitan statistical areas as defined in Federal Property
Management Regulation (41 CFR 101), subpart 101-18.102. GSA is the sole leasing authority for
obtaining "general purpose" space in these areas.
Value (Current, Fair, and Estimated)—Current fair market value or rental value:
   •   Fair market value is the amount in cash, or in terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
       property would be sold by an owner, willing but not obliged to sell, to a purchaser, who desires,
       but is not obligated to buy.
   •   Fair market rental value of a property is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
       well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a well-informed lessor would accept for the
       use and occupancy of the property for a particular term.
Wetlands—Areas that surface or ground water inundates often enough to support, and under normal
circumstances does or would support, a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or
seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include swamps,
marshes, bogs, mud flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs, and wet meadows. Wetlands
may be located in flood plains (AFI 32-7005).
Withdrawn Land—Public land that has been set aside or designated for a specific public purpose, such
as a national park, wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of public lands generally
segregates such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other dispositions under the public land laws.

                                              Attachment 2

                            TYPES OF LEGISLATIVE JURISDICTION

A2.1. Exclusive. The Government has acquired, by state statute, all of the state's authority in an area, and
the state concerned has not reserved the right to exercise any of that authority except the right to serve
state civil or criminal process.

A2.2. Concurrent. The state, in granting the Government exclusive legislative jurisdiction over an area,
has reserved to itself the right to exercise the same authority at the same time. This rare case currently
exists in Alaska because of the special provisions in the Alaska Statehood Act.

A2.3. Partial. The state has granted the Government some of its authority to legislate but has reserved
the right to exercise, alone or with the Government, some authority beyond the right to serve criminal pro-
cess in the area (for example, the right to tax private property).

A2.4. Proprietorial (or Proprietary). The Government has acquired some right or title to an area in a
state but has not obtained any of the state's authority to legislate over the area. Because of its functions
and authority under various provisions of the Constitution, the Government has many powers and immu-
nities in acquired land area that ordinary landowners do not have. Further, it holds its properties and per-
forms its functions in a Governmental rather than proprietary, or business, capacity.
