                                           GENERAL

1.1. Large Maintenance Vehicle Operations. A Large Maintenance Vehicle (LMV) operation
is defined as a payload-transporter (PT) operating off-base (to/from site at Vandenberg AFB) in
any condition (loaded with any Aerospace V Equipment (AVE) component or unloaded) or on-
base loaded with any AVE component or any transporter-erector (TE) operation. LMVs will not
be operated on roadways without a safety observer in the vehicle. A PT or TE tractor operating
in a bobtail (bobtail is the tractor only) configuration is not an LMV operation.
     1.1.1. LMVs travelling off-base (to/from site at Vandenberg AFB), in any condition (loaded
     or unloaded), will travel with a lead vehicle IAW Chapter 6 of this instruction with the
     following exceptions:
        1.1.1.1. Re-entry systems (RS) will be transported IAW DoD S-5210.41-M-V1, Nuclear
        Weapon Security Manual: The DoD Nuclear Weapon Security Program (U), and DoD S-
        5210.41_AFMAN31-108V3, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual; Nuclear Weapon
        Specific Requirements (U). Provisions in RS movement procedures meet or exceed all
        requirements levied by this instruction for the lead vehicle program.
        1.1.1.2. Downstage movements will be conducted under the direction of a maintenance
        officer/SNCO certified by the MXG or 576 FLTS CC. The officer/SNCO must be lead
        vehicle qualified.
1.2. Mission Planning Factors. LMV operators and all levels of supervision must consider, as
a minimum, the following factors when planning LMV movements:
     1.2.1. Characteristics of the specific vehicle must be considered in relation to other mission
     factors.
     1.2.2. Team composition. The pairing of LMV operator and safety observer must be
     evaluated to ensure the appropriate operator is designated in relation to travel/weather
     conditions and experience levels.
     1.2.3. Intended route of travel. Routes must be reviewed for known hazards.
     1.2.4. Risk management indicators for the designated LMV operator and safety observer.
     1.2.5. Travel/weather conditions must be reviewed for the entire route.
     1.2.6. LMV operators will complete the AFGSC Form 66, AFGSC Large Maintenance
     Vehicle Pre-Release Briefing, to ensure all required planning factors have been considered.
