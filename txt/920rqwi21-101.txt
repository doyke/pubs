    flown on the AUR. If a disparity exists, the debriefer/Aviation Resource Management
    annotates the difference on the AUR with the debriefer correcting the MIS. Aviation
    Resource Management will either sign the AUR or verify over e-mail that the information on
    the MSAT product/ AUR is correct.
       2.3.1. All corrections to flying times must be updated by the debrief section by the 4 th
       calendar day of the following month.
    2.4. The AVUM and AVDO will compare the flying hours in the MIS (REMIS or GCSS Air

    database monthly to ensure the data in the MIS represents hours flown
