   5.13. The team chief must remain within the pilot's sight or be connected to the aircraft
   communication system during arming and de-arming operations. If the team chief is required
   to move out of sight of the pilot, an alternate will be posted to keep in contact with the pilot
   in his absence.
   5.14. Floodlight(s) will be placed to the rear of aircraft parking locations only on the grassy
   area across taxiway Alpha or Echo respectively. The floodlight table will be fully extended
   with the lights directed to cover the whole EOR ramp. Additional floodlights may be needed
   during heavy fog, mist or rain conditions.
   5.15. If hung ordinance is declared, De-arm supervisor will direct "safing" of hung

   aircraft is towed back or returns to flight line parking areas.
6. Sequence of Arming Operations:
   6.1. The EOR team chief will brief personnel on safety/emergency procedures, check
   firefighting equipment for serviceability and perform a FOD walk prior to performing EOR
   procedures.
   6.2. APG Team Chief will marshal aircraft into arming location, hand signal the pilot to hold
   the brakes and ensure hands visible and perform tire inspection/roll over check. Once APG
   personnel have completed their EOR inspection, the aircraft will be turned over to the
   weapons arming crew to perform munitions arming procedures.
   6.3. The team chief will signal the Weapons and/or APG personnel to perform EOR
   inspections and arming procedures.
   6.4. After the munitions are armed and aircraft inspected, the weapons or APG person will

   REMOVAL signal will be given to the APG or weapons person to remove chocks. The team
   chief will signal the pilot that arming and EOR inspection are complete with a THUMB UP
   signal and the crew will proceed to the next aircraft. All aircraft will be armed in sequential
   order (i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 4.)
7. Sequence of De-arming Operations.
   7.1. The EOR team chief will brief personnel on safety/emergency procedures, check
   firefighting equipment for serviceability and perform a FOD walk prior to performing EOR
   procedures.

     7.2. Aircraft will be marshaled in by the team chief and directed to stop at the designated
     parking spot. Once the aircraft has come to a complete stop, the team chief will hand signal
     the pilot to hold the brakes and ensure hands visible. After the pilot has acknowledged a safe
     condition, the team chief will signal crew member(s) to approach aircraft and install chocks.
     7.3. After chock installation, personnel will inspect aircraft for possible hot brakes, hung
     ordnance, and aircraft damage. If hot brakes or hung ordnance are detected, perform

     7.6. After the de-arming procedures have been completed, the team chief will hand signal
     the pilot to HOLD BRAKES. All personnel except the person removing chocks will clear
     area around aircraft. When the pilot acknowledges brakes held, the CHOCK REMOVAL
     signal will be given to the APG or weapons person to remove chocks. The team chief will
     signal the pilot that the aircraft is de-armed with a THUMB UP and the crew will proceed to
     the next aircraft. All aircraft will be de-armed in sequential order (i.e., 1, 2, 3, and 4).

     8.2.6. After gun is made safe and no rounds are in a hazardous or unknown condition,
     the aircraft with suspected gun jam will be parked on the 482 parking ramp, Charlie Row,
     Spot 1, with the aircraft turned forty five degrees to the left of the taxi line, pointing at the
     wooded area.
     8.2.7. If rounds are detected to be in a hazardous or unknown condition, the aircraft will
     remain at the jammed gun area, personnel will evacuate to a minimum of three hundred
     feet. Only EOD and the on-scene fire chief can reduce the minimum evacuation
     distances.
  8.3. Hung Rockets.
     8.3.1. When incoming aircraft are suspected of having hung rockets, the MOC will
     notify the Production Superintendent, Weapons Expediter and the EOR de-arm team with

     received from the pilot that may be pertinent to the safety of personnel performing EOR
     procedures.
     8.3.3. For an unexpended rocket with aircrew attempt (misfire condition), de-arm
     personnel will safe the aircraft IAW applicable technical data and visually check the
     rocket. If rocket is safe, recovery personnel will safe the aircraft IAW applicable
     technical data and direct the aircraft back to the aircraft parking spot.
     8.3.4. If a Rocket is in an unsafe or unknown condition, the following procedures will
     apply:
         8.3.4.1. The aircraft will be directed to the hung ordnance/jammed gun area at

           retainers, contact arms are closed and position the intervalometer to safe.
           8.3.4.5. After rockets have been made safe, maintenance crews may approach the
           aircraft for towing procedures. Aircraft will be towed back to the Live Ordinance
           Loading Area (LOLA) for downloading.
    8.4. Hot brakes: If hot brakes are detected at EOR, the EOR team chief will evacuate
    personnel from under the aircraft to a safe distance and signal pilot that a hot brake condition
    exists. Team chief will then notify the MOC with aircraft tail number and location. The
    MOC will notify fire department, flightline expediter and production superintendent.
       8.4.1. The fire department will take over control of any aircraft considered to have hot
       brakes at EOR.

       minimum distance of one hundred feet upwind and notify the MOC. The hydrazine
       response team will determine whether a hydrazine leak has occurred and give the EOR
       crew clearance to proceed with de-arm procedures.
    8.6. Hung Flare(s):
       8.6.1. If any evidence of exposed, initiated, or partially ejected flare exists, a ground

       and remove aircrew. No attempt will be made to safe the rest of the aircraft or install
       chaff and flare pin. Evacuate the area to 300 feet.
       8.6.3. The incident aircraft will not be moved from its present location to reduce the
       possibility of jarring the flare (s) loose and inadvertent ignition.
       8.6.4. All remaining aircraft will be de-armed at the backup arm/de-arm areas. Refer to
       section 4 of this OI for backup EOR areas.
       8.6.5. If the flare(s) ignites on the ground, allow the flare to burn itself out. Do not look
