*When dropping CRS/CDS (1-4 bundles), it is recommended that the
aircraft gross weight be no less than 104,000 pounds at the time of
release. If the drop must be made, use 0 flaps and expect a longer than
normal exit time.

NOTE: If aircraft gross weight exceeds 120,000 pounds, use 140
KCAS CDS/CRS flap setting chart. EXCEPTION: For combination
drops above 120,000 pounds use 130 KCAS and 130 KCAS flap
setting chart.

*When dropping CRS/CDS (1-4 bundles), it is recommended that the
aircraft gross weight be no less than 104,000 pounds at the time of
release. If the drop must be made, use 0 flaps and expect a longer than
normal exit time.

NOTE: If aircraft gross weight exceeds 120,000 pounds, use 140
KCAS CDS/CRS flap setting chart. EXCEPTION: For combination
drops above 120,000 pounds use 130 KCAS and 130 KCAS flap
setting chart.
