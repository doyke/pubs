    2.2. Use government-owned vehicles (GOV) to the maximum extent possible.
    2.3. For local travel to be approved, it must meet the criteria of “more advantageous to the govern-
    ment” and not simply the convenience of the traveler.
    2.4. Travel must be within the local area of FEW. The local area is defined in paragraph 5.
    2.5. If official travel by POV is to points outside the area as defined in paragraph 5. and/or travel is
    for more than 24 hours; official travel orders are required.

3. Approval Authority . Approval authority for local area travel is the traveler’s commander or his or
her designated orders Approving Official (AO).

4. Procedures:
    4.1. Reimbursement for local travel at personal expense will be claimed on a trip-by-trip basis or, if
    repeated travel is involved, on a monthly basis. Claims will be submitted on a Standard Form (SF)
    1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business.
    4.2. On trip-by-trip basis, prior to using their own POV, individuals will contact their Unit Vehicle
    Control Officer or call Transportation Vehicle Dispatch (as applicable) to determine the availability of
    government transportation. Claimant will place the following statement on the SF Form 1164: “Spe-
    cial authorization for POV is required for mission accomplishment. The cost of special authorization
    has been reviewed and is justified as more advantageous to the government or necessary for mission
    accomplishment”. NOTE: For detailed guidance on the preparation of SF Form 1164, see
    DFAS-DER 177-103, Travel Transactions at Base Level.
    4.3. Claimant will complete SF Form 1164 by entering all information required by line and column
