                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS), 618th Air & Space
Operations Center, Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and 22nd Operations Support Squadron
Weather Flight (22 OSS/OSW), commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (WF), are the
official weather information agencies for McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas. These agencies
provide weather information in support of the 22nd Air Refueling Wing (22 ARW), the 931st Air
Refueling Group (931 ARG, Reserve), the 184th Intelligence Wing (KS ANG), subordinate units
and units assigned, attached, or supported by McConnell AFB. The WF is the focal point for all
weather-related issues. This instruction will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially
or IAW with host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially. Additionally, the WF
will initiate an out-of-cycle formal review to accurately reflect operational changes resulting
from supported unit mission changes, equipment upgrades or significant changes in overarching
guidance.
   1.1.1. OPSEC Concerns: Information gathered during the execution of this plan may be
   sensitive or “For Official Use Only” and must be protected accordingly.
1.2. Concept of Operations (Characterization Unit (CU) & Exploitation Unit (EU)
Interactions).
   1.2.1. The OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses the
   “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on Air
   Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
       1.2.1.1. The 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana will provide regional and
       operational-level weather products and information to Air Force units in the Midwest-SE
       region of the Continental United States (CONUS) and for Air Force and Army forces
       operating in US Northern Command’s Area of Responsibility (AOR).
   1.2.2. The WF and TACC are considered exploitation units. Exploitation is the ability to
   minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while simultaneously
   capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational advantage over
   enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the characterization
   unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission profile from the
   overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not mean changing
   the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will use the
   characterized data provided to them.
       1.2.2.1. The WF and TACC are the primary source of tailored weather services in
       support of the 22 ARW, 931 ARG, 184 KSANG, and visiting aircrews. The WF and
       TACC will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather is anticipated and
       exploited, and that safety and resource protection are maintained.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the OWSs and WFs are outlined in AFI 15-
128, Air and Space Weather Operations – Roles and Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of
 6                                                 MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


the 26 OWS and McConnell’s WF are defined in the McConnell AFB Installation Data Sheet
and in this instruction.
     1.3.1. McConnell AFB Installation Data Sheet. The 26 OWS and McConnell WF will
     coordinate and maintain a McConnell AFB Installation Data Sheet detailing TAF
     specification and amendment criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts,
     unit information, Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) back-up contacts and local outage back-
     up information.
     1.3.2. The 26 OWS issues McConnell’s Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), forecast
     weather warnings and watches and may provide flight weather briefings (FWBs) to transient
     aircrews passing through McConnell AFB. The OWS will issue observed warnings and
     advisories when the WF is closed.
     1.3.3. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
     1.3.4. The WF creates Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale products
     with local mission requirements to produce tailored products focused on local missions.
     1.3.5. The WF will support the base in thoroughly educating agencies on the purpose,
     applicability and operating procedures of weather products and operations.
     1.3.6. The WF will provide FWBs for transient aircrews IAW the WF duty priorities listed
     in Table 1.1.
     1.3.7. TACC will provide all FWB support, via GDSS, for all missions from McConnell
     AFB except TURBO 85/86 and others by rare operational exception.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 22 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities. WF duty priorities are listed in Table 1.1.
and exist to balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Flight personnel will use good
judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when there is imminent danger to
life and/or property.

1.5. Hours of Operation & Contact Information.
      1.5.1. WF. Normal Airfield and Mission Services hours of operations are Monday-Friday
      from 0300L-2100L and on weekends, holidays, and down-days as required. WF personnel
      will be on duty when the airfield is open and no automated observing system capability
      exists, when SWAP has been implemented, when required for Operational Risk Management
      (ORM), or when required for mission support, as outlined in Chapters 2 (Airfield Services)
      and 3 (Mission Services). Staff services are available during normal duty hours or as
      required (exercises, contingencies, etc.).
         1.5.1.1. Contact Information
             1.5.1.1.1. WF (316) 759-3707/4311 DSN 743-3707/4311
             1.5.1.1.2. PMSV 374.2 MHz
             1.5.1.1.3. AOL (316) 759-1697/1698/ DSN 743-1697/1698
      1.5.2. OWS and TACC. Hours of operation are 24/7, 365 days a year.
         1.5.2.1. Contact Information
             1.5.2.1.1. 26 OWS (318) 529-2614/ DSN 331-2614
             1.5.2.1.2. TACC (618) 229-0353/ DSN 779-0353
1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan(s) (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages, evacuations, etc., at the WF, 26 OWS, and/or TACC.
      1.6.1. WF COOP/Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building
      evacuation, Airfield and Mission Services will move to the Air Traffic Simulator Facility
      (Building 72) to continue operational support and the WF’s “eyes forward” responsibilities to
      the 26 OWS. WF members will follow duty specific SOPs and Weather Flight Evacuation
      Checklists (including a list of required backup equipment) and resume services at the
      alternate location as soon as possible. Most WF services/support will be provided, but will
      require a case-by-case assessment depending on communication line status, equipment status,
      etc. Expect services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to
      limited facilities and potential loss of dedicated data services, including sensors and various
      data types (radar imagery, etc.). Staff services will also move to building 72. See Chapter
      2.13 and Chapter 5 for details on dissemination back-up procedures.
 8                                                   MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


        1.6.1.1. Official Observing Site. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-
        19 sensors. However, if access to observing sensing equipment readouts is lost, back-up
        equipment will be used to augment observations. During augmentation, the official
        observing site becomes the physical location from which the duty technician visually
        determines sky condition, present weather and prevailing visibility. If augmentation is
        required at the AOL, the official observation point is in the grass, east of Bldg. 72. WF
        personnel may have to move around to obtain accurate visibility, as buildings and aircraft
        hangars on the West side of the runway impede the view of the horizon. If augmentation
        is required, weather technicians will complete and transmit an observation within 15
        minutes of arrival at the AOL. The WF contact numbers for the AOL are (316) 759-
        1697/1698/DSN: 743-1697/1698.
        1.6.1.2. For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate for exercises.
     1.6.2. 26 OWS COOP.
        1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF and
        weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
        1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 26 OWS’ plan is to resume all
        support from an alternate location.
        1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, the 26 OWS conducts monthly COOP
        exercises.
     1.6.3. TACC COOP.
        1.6.3.1. IAW AMCI 15-101, if TACC loses the capability to provide flight weather
        briefing (FWB) services, the WF will assume responsibility for all McConnell AFB
        Integrated Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM weather packages. If the WF is unable
        to provide the required support, briefing responsibility will be transferred to the servicing
        OWS.
        1.6.3.2. Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Outages. In the event of a GDSS
        outage, the WF provides FWBs via DD Form 175-1 or verbal briefing. Servicing OWSs
        provide DD Form 175-1s via email or verbal briefing,
        1.6.3.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, TACC conducts monthly COOP
        exercises, for a period of two consecutive days, during which the WF provides all non-
        IFM FWBs through GDSS or alternate means, if a GDSS outage is simulated or
        occurring. The WF will coordinate with supported units as required.
1.7. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Most general
weather parameters are available to be given to the general public, such as temperature, winds,
humidity, and sky condition. However, specific weather information will not be released to non-
DoD agencies/non-base agencies without approval from the 22 ARW Public Affairs (22
ARW/PA) and Legal offices, such as total number of days with precipitation during a specific
month.

                                    AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the McConnell aerodrome
(defined within 5NM of the airfield) or the base as a whole. Examples include weather
observations, terminal aerodrome forecasts (TAF), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), resource
protection and emergency action responses.
2.2. Operational Hours. Airfield Services are provided Monday-Friday and from 0300L-
2100L and as required on weekends, holidays, and down days. Services will be provided 24-
hours a day during exercises, real-world contingencies and when directed by 22 ARW/CC.
During periods of closure, the FMQ-19 automated observing system will record and disseminate
weather observations automatically.
       2.2.1. Weather personnel will open/remain on shift for ORM, as outlined in para 2.3.7.
       2.2.2. Weather personnel will open/remain on shift to fulfill SWAP requirements as
       outlined in para 2.12.2.
2.3. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the FMQ-19 AMOS. Most observations are taken
automatically by the FMQ-19 with no human intervention. Observations typically contain the
following elements: observation type; date/time; winds; visibility; present weather; cloud groups;
temperature/dew-point; altimeter setting; and additional remarks. At times, it is necessary for a
weather forecaster to augment the system. Automated and augmentation processes are outlined
in paragraphs 2.3.5 and 2.3.6. There are three types of observations (described below) that are
seen by customers on McConnell AFB. Attachment 4.1 contains an example of an observation
and interpretation.
   2.3.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are created
   between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour. METARs are disseminated both locally and
   long-line between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. A METAR observation could also
   indicate that special weather criteria were met during the observing period (see Attachment 2
   for special observing criteria). METAR observations are disseminated both locally and
   longline.
   2.3.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted whenever certain weather events, defined in AFMAN
   15-111 or identified as special criteria (see Attachment 2), have been observed or sensed at
   McConnell AFB. SPECI will contain all data elements found in a METAR plus additional
   remarks that elaborate on data in the body of the report. All SPECI reports will be prepared
   and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are observed. These
   observations are disseminated both locally and longline. Attachment 4 contains an example
   SPECI weather observation.
   2.3.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes.
   2.3.4. Official Observing Site. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-19
   sensors. However, during periods of augmentation, when outdoor elements require
 10                                                MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


   evaluation, the official observing site becomes the physical location from which the duty
   technician visually determines sky condition, present weather and prevailing visibility.
   McConnell’s official observation site, during augmentation from the weather station, is
   located approximately 150 feet away from the flight line side of building 1112 at the edge of
   the DV “Red Carpet.”
       2.3.4.1. Observing Point Limitations.
          2.3.4.1.1. The FMQ-19 is properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
          2.3.4.1.2. The following physical limitations may impact the representation of
          McConnell AFB weather observations, taken at the primary site (Bldg. 1112), when
          augmentation is required.
              2.3.4.1.2.1. Buildings, hangars, parked aircraft and trees block portions of the sky
              as well as ground visibility reference markers, especially clockwise from north to
              south.
              2.3.4.1.2.2. There are few adequate ground visibility reference markers beyond 1
              mile. This especially degrades determination of nighttime visibility.
              2.3.4.1.2.3. Nearby lighting contaminates and complicates observing nighttime
              sky condition.
              2.3.4.1.2.4. The south end of the runway is not visible from the observation point.
              When fog and (or) low clouds are present over the approach end of Runway 01
              (south of the field), conditions reported from the observation point may not be
              representative.
              2.3.4.1.2.5. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or
              poor visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. The
              lightning detection system only detects cloud to ground lightning.
NOTE: The Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW), section 2.9., exists to help alleviate the
deficiencies identified in 2.3.4.1.2.1 – 2.3.4.1.2.5.
   2.3.5. Automated Observation. An automated observation is any observation having been
   evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human intervention. In
   automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate weather
   observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated observation,
   sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute period
   ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based on
   sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation. Automated
   stations are always considered automated, even when a weather technician augments an
   observation.
   2.3.6. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having a certified weather forecaster
   manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the FMQ-19.            The two
   augmentation processes used are supplement and backup.
       2.3.6.1. Supplement (definition). The method of manually adding meteorological
       information to an observation, generated by the FMQ-19, that is beyond the system’s
       capability to measure and report. For example, the sensor cannot sense a tornado or hail.
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                                11


            2.3.6.1.1. Supplementation procedures during duty hours. WF personnel will be
            ready to supplement observations when the weather station is open and any of the
            weather conditions in Table 2.1 are occurring or forecast to occur within 1 hour.

Table 2.1. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Body of Report

Snow Depth (Only reported during airfield operating hours AND if heavy snow warning has been
issued AND snowfall is occurring)

       2.3.6.2. Backup (definition). The process of manually providing meteorological data
       and/or dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated
       method is not operational or is unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
            2.3.6.2.1. Backup procedures. In the event of FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, or
            communications failure, back-up procedures will be implemented. WF personnel will
            use back-up equipment to take, encode and/or disseminate METAR and SPECI
            observations IAW AFMAN 15-111. When utilizing back-up equipment for
            wind/pressure, all wind and pressure values are estimated. Due to a known system
            limitation, the WF will always back-up the precipitation sensor when freezing rain is
            observed or forecast to occur.
   2.3.7. ORM for back-up/supplementation during station closure hours. WF personnel
   will remain on shift/fulfill stand-by requirements, whether or not any 22 ARW missions are
   flying, to augment the FMQ-19 if any of the following criteria are met.
       2.3.7.1. Backup procedures will be implemented for the following sensor/system
       malfunction when the following criteria are met.
            2.3.7.1.1. Lightning Sensor: If thunderstorms observed or forecast during closure
            2.3.7.1.2. Ceiling/Vis Sensor: If Visibility/Ceilings observed or forecast <
            1000’/3SM during closure
               2.3.7.1.3. Wind Sensor: If winds are observed or forecast to be > 35 Knots during
               closure

              2.3.7.1.4. Precipitation Sensor: Anytime freezing precipitation is observed or
              forecast
              2.3.7.1.5. Communication Outage (FMQ-19, JET or LAN)
       2.3.7.2. Supplementation will be implemented for the following criteria.
           2.3.7.2.1. Tornadic Activity observed or forecast during closure
           2.3.7.2.2. Hail > ¾” observed or forecast during closure
           2.3.7.2.3. Anytime Ice Pellets are observed or forecast
           2.3.7.2.4. Snow Depth: If heavy snow is observed or forecast and the airfield is open
   2.3.8. WF Forecaster Recall Requirements. The WF forecaster will be notified/recalled
   under the following circumstances:
       2.3.8.1. The 26 OWS notifies the standby forecaster prior to issuing any watch or
       warning for McConnell AFB.
       2.3.8.2. ATC or the 26 OWS notifies the standby forecaster when automated weather
       sensor display data is unavailable.
       2.3.8.3. ATC or the 26 OWS notifies the standby forecaster when observations are not
       being transmitted or are not representative of current conditions.
2.4. TAF Support. McConnell AFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 26 OWS
IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the McConnell AFB Installation
Data Sheet. The TAF for McConnell AFB is required 24 hours a day, every day, unless there is a
scheduled airfield closure. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are listed in
Attachment 3. TAFs are valid for 30 hours, apply to the area within a 5-nautical mile (NM)
radius of the McConnell AFB airfield complex, and will be issued at 0400L, 1200L and 2000L
during Local Standard Time and 0500L, 1300L and 2100L during Daylight Savings Time.
Attachment 4.2 contains an example of a McConnell AFB TAF and an explanation of TAF
elements. The 26 OWS disseminates TAFs via JET. If JET is nonoperational, the WF will
disseminate TAFs to ATC and 22 ARW/CP via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
2.5. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The term METWATCH is used to describe an
organized approach for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of the current/future
meteorological situation within a designated area(s). It is a deliberate, continuous process. The
purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly
deviate from forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast
product or group of products, and notify designated agencies. The 26 OWS will perform a
continuous Terminal METWATCH for McConnell AFB, via monitoring the FMQ-19. WF
personnel will act as the “eyes forward”‖ for the 26 OWS by providing immediate feedback on
current or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions.
2.6. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. This is the WF’s role in allowing for the integration of
weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection readouts and non-standard
weather data systems to create an integrated weather picture and near-term forecast for the OWS.
The WF relays significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not contained in the coded
observations to the 26 OWS as an integral part of the METWATCH process. Additionally, the
WF integrates the current state of the atmosphere into an understanding of future impacts on
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                                 13


forecast conditions and communicates the impacts/information to the 26 OWS to assist in
forecast operations.
2.7. Continuous Weather Watch. A continuous weather watch is the process by which
weather personnel or an automated observing system continuously monitor weather conditions
without performing any other duties. The FMQ-19 performs an automatic continuous weather
watch for McConnell AFB.
2.8. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). When augmentation is required WF personnel will
perform a BWW during operating hours. WF personnel will also perform a BWW when SWAP
is activated. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at intervals
not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI
observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to
occur within 1 hour:
   2.8.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   2.8.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   2.8.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
   2.8.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
   2.8.5. Precipitation (any form).
   2.8.6. Thunderstorms
   2.8.7. Fog or Mist.
   2.8.8. All mandatory supplemental criteria specified in Table 2.1.
   2.8.9. During mandatory back-up (IAW AFMAN 15-111 and this document).
   2.8.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will remain
   alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI observation.
   Weather technicians will also monitor local area observations and forecast products as often
   as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
   Forecasters will augment the FMQ-19 as required by AFMAN 15-111.
2.9. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). CWW is the process of ATC personnel, flying
units, and Security Forces personnel reporting observed weather conditions to a weather
forecaster. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility differing from the prevailing
surface visibility, local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions
that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations
and resources. IAW AFI 13-204V3 and AFMAN 15-111, the WF and ATC have established a
CWW. The agreement outlines each unit’s responsibilities when specific meteorological
phenomena are observed.
   2.9.1. McConnell AFB Tower personnel will notify weather personnel when any of the
   following are seen or occur:
       2.9.1.1. Tornadoes or funnel clouds.
       2.9.1.2. Thunder is heard and/or lightning is seen.
 14                                                 MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


       2.9.1.3. ATC personnel task certified to evaluate tower visibility will report changes in
       tower prevailing visibility when tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters)
       and different from the surface prevailing visibility. They will also notify the weather
       technician when the observed tower prevailing visibility decreases to less than or
       increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles (6000 meters). NOTE: This information is
       not included in observations produced by the FMQ-19.
       2.9.1.4. Any weather information received from pilots for inclusion into a PIREP will be
       relayed within 30 minutes of receipt.
       2.9.1.5. Any other meteorological condition that could have significant impact to the
       airfield (hail, wind damage, etc).
   2.9.2. McConnell AFB weather technicians will:
       2.9.2.1. If augmenting the FMQ-19 visibility sensor, notify the tower, as soon as
       possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at the official weather observation point
       decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute miles.
       2.9.2.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon initial
       receipt of a differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable
       changes at the control tower level. Note: automated stations do not include tower
       visibility in observation remarks however; the information may lead to the WF
       performing backup of the visibility sensors.
       2.9.2.3. If augmenting the FMQ-19 visibility sensor, use control tower values of
       prevailing visibility as a guide in determining the surface visibility when the view of
       portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings, aircraft, etc.
2.10. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during duty hours on
frequency 374.2 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV traffic for all aircraft contacts.
For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, the McConnell WF or 26 OWS can provide
PMSV support through a phone patch to the 22 ARW/CP (DSN 743-1850/Commercial (316)
759-1850). PMSV outages are discussed in para 5.3.2.
2.11. Resource Protection (RP). Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort
between the 26 OWS and the McConnell WF. The 26 OWS conducts a continuous
meteorological watch to identify and assess emerging and imminent threats to McConnell AFB
and is responsible for issuing all forecast weather watches, warnings and advisories. The WF acts
as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS and is responsible for issuing all observed warnings and
advisories during WF duty hours, after WF duty hours the 26 OWS assumes control of observed
warnings and advisories. The WF can issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat
to life and/or property. In these cases, the WF will back brief the OWS when time permits and
will also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the WF will
act as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the best
possible resource protection to McConnell AFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS)/Significant
Weather Alerts, Watches, Warnings, and Advisories (WWAs) are special notices resulting from
both the forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military decision makers with resource
protection decisions. Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to
life or property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                              15


phenomena with the potential to impact operations. Customer responses to WWAs are listed in
Attachment 5.
   2.11.1. Special Weather Statements (SWS). SWSs are special notices issued by the 26
   OWS to assist military decision makers with resource protection decisions.
   2.11.2. Significant Weather Alert, Email Updates: WF leadership, as able, provides a
   weather summary, timeline, and expected impacts/anticipated WWAs for the following
   criteria which may threaten McConnell AFB:
       2.11.2.1. Tornadic Activity
       2.11.2.2. Significant Winter Storms (significant snowfall, freezing precipitation, or
       blizzard conditions)
       2.11.2.3. Significant Convective Storms (large hail, winds > 50 knots, flooding potential)
   2.11.3. Weather Watches. A special notice to notify installation personnel/supported units
   of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or
   property. Weather Watches indicate a potential for environmental threats and are used by
   installation personnel/supported units to make force protection and risk management
   decisions. Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of the center-point of the McConnell runway
   complex (10 NM for lightning). They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Table 2.2 contains all of the weather
   watches and desired lead-times issued for McConnell AFB.

   2.11.4. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
   established weather condition, which will pose a threat to life or property, is occurring or is
   expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining environmental
   threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and take protective
   action. Warnings are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the McConnell runway
   complex. Forecast warnings, with their desired lead-times, are contained in Table 2.3.

Lightning within 5NM                        Observed
* Denotes deviation from standard criteria as defined in AMCI 15-101.

   2.11.5. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for McConnell AFB. They extend 5NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning
   warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the FMQ-19 sensor.
   The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no longer observed within 5NM for
   at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will not be cancelled if a thunderstorm
   is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
   2.11.6. Forecast and Observed Weather Advisories. A forecast weather advisory is a
   special notice sent to customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which
   may impact operations, is occurring or expected to occur on McConnell AFB. An observed
   weather advisory is a special notice sent to customers alerting them that a predefined weather
   phenomenon, which may impact operations, is occurring on McConnell AFB.
   Forecast/observed weather advisories can be found in Table 2.4.
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                              17




Table 2.4. McConnell AFB Weather Advisory Criteria.
Criteria                                     Desired Lead-Time
Frost                                        12 Hours
Surface Winds > 35 but < 50 Knots            30 minutes
Lightning within 10NM                        Observed
Crosswinds > 15 Knots                        Observed
Crosswinds > 25 Knots                        Observed
Surface Winds > 25 Knots                     Observed
Wind Chill < -20F (-29C) [DANGER]            Observed
Observed Surface Visibility < ¼ SM           Observed

   2.11.7. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 4.3.
   2.11.8. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
   35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
   times specified in Table 2.3. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time (and will
   include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast and/or observed lightning
   warnings. Lightning warnings will be separate from all other warnings. If a warning is
   issued for one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning
   and new number will be issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be
   specified for each criterion if necessary.
   2.11.9. WWA Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be
   issued to change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning
   expires. New warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
   2.11.10. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior
   to the expiration of the original notice.
   2.11.11. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
   will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
   when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. See
   para 2.11.5 for cancellation of observed lightning warnings.

2.12. Emergency Action(s) Response.
   2.12.1. Aircraft Mishap. When notified on an emergency or aircraft mishap, the WF will
   initiate a save of applicable data used in the development of any weather products provided and
   provide this data to investigating agencies upon request. The WF will coordinate with the
   applicable OWS and, if necessary, the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) to save all applicable
   data and products that may have been used in support of the mission or mishap. Enough data
   before and after the mishap will be archived to fully reconstruct the environmental conditions.
   The WF will follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures IAW AFMAN 15-129V2.
      2.12.1.1. If the WF provided the FWB, the WF will coordinate with 26 OWS to save all
      applicable data and products. If products from other OWSs were used, the WF will
      coordinate with all applicable OWSs to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering
      weather conditions before and after the mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct
      environmental conditions.
      2.12.1.2. If an OWS, TACC, or another WF provided the FWB, they will conduct the
      data save in coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved.
   2.12.2. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). SWAPs are in place to ensure sufficient
   personnel are available during potential or actual severe weather events to meet the increased
   demand for timely weather information from its supported unit(s). The WF and 26 OWS will
   cooperatively initiate and maintain a heightened meteorological watch (METWATCH/Eyes
   Forward), an enhanced MISSIONWATCH, and augmentation of observing equipment.
   SWAP will be implemented IAW AFMAN 15-129V2 and this document for the criterion
   listed in Table 2.5. By having additional personnel provide an increased focus on weather,
   forecasters at the WF and the 26 OWS can ensure quality support before and during rapidly
   changing conditions.
      2.12.2.1. Activating SWAP.
          2.12.2.1.1. The WF will implement SWAP for tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind,
          heavy snow and/or freezing precipitation. During SWAP activation, WF personnel
          will augment the automated observations IAW AFMAN 15-111 and this document.
          Safety of flight and resource protection are the highest priorities. Augmentation and
          “eyes forward” support to the 26 OWS ensure all aspects of severe weather are fully
          identified, reported, and recorded.

Table 2.5. SWAP Activation Criteria
       SWAP Activation Criteria
       1. One of the following is issued by the 26 OWS:
       Tornado Watch/Warning
       Severe Thunderstorm (wind > 50 kts and/or Hail > 3/4 inch) Watch/Warning
       Winds > 50 kts (not associated w/Thunderstorms) Warning
       Heavy Snow Warning
       Freezing Precipitation Warning
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                                19


         2.12.2.1.2. When the WF is open, the 26 OWS will call both the WF and their
         respective Command Post (CP) when any watch or warning is issued. The WF
         forecaster will notify the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) Leader (flight
         leadership) of any watch or warning that meets the criteria identified in Table 2.5.
         The SWAT Leader will determine if additional WF personnel need to be recalled to
         ensure implementation of applicable SWAP. The WF will remain open and SWAP
         will remain in effect until the expiration or cancellation of watches and/or warnings.
         2.12.2.1.3. When the WF is closed, 26 OWS will notify the WF standby forecaster
         via the WF provided Standby Roster when a severe weather watch or warning
         (identified in Table 2.5) is issued for the installation, no later than 2 hours before the
         expected occurrence of severe weather. The WF will also provide their respective CP
         with up-to-date standby contact lists. Upon notification of a severe watch or warning,
         the WF standby forecaster will contact the 26 OWS and discuss the current weather
         situation. The WF standby person will then contact the SWAT Leader and relay the
         details of the watch or warning. If warranted, both the SWAT Leader and the WF
         standby person will report to the WF work center. After a thorough assessment of the
         situation, the SWAT Leader will determine if additional SWAT members are
         necessary and recall additional personnel if necessary.
     2.12.2.2. Post event procedures will include a verbal review of the actions taken by the
     WF and OWS. If deemed necessary by the WF or OWS, or if damage occurs requiring an
     OPREP-3 report, a full forecast review will be accomplished IAW WF and OWS SOPs.
  2.12.3. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPS. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-
  229 and AFI 10-206, the WF will provide the 22 ARW/CP any pertinent weather information
  for OPREP-3 inclusion. The CP, in turn, will provide the WF with a copy of any weather
  related OPREPs. The WF will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to the 26 OWS and
  HQ AMC/A3AW headquarters as soon as possible. Note: The 22 ARW/CC is the releasing
  authority for OPREP-3s. A courtesy copy to higher headquarters is acceptable, but not an
  “official” OPREP.
  2.12.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE)
  Response.
     2.12.4.1. The WF will serve as the weather SME to CBRN operations, IAW AFI 10-
     2501 and AFI 15-128.
     2.12.4.2. The WF will routinely meet with Readiness, Fire Emergency Services, and
     Bioenvironmental Engineering Flights to achieve appropriate mission immersion.
     2.12.4.3. The WF will recommend and provide the appropriate weather data type for EM
     and other ESFs to use to run their chosen CBRN plume model.
     2.12.4.4. The WF will work closely with Emergency Management and other ESF
     functions to ensure the supported commander gets a consistent picture.
     2.12.4.5. The WF will provide meteorological parameters, data, and subject matter
     expertise to all Disaster Response Force elements, EOC Emergency Support Functions
     (ESF), and any/all Installation Emergency Management Plans.
 20                                              MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


       2.12.4.6. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, WF personnel
       will make sure that observations and forecasts provided are representative of the
       location/time of the CBRN event.
       2.12.4.7. The WF is the primary unit for providing Chemical Downwind Messages
       (CDM) and Effective Downwind Message (EDM) support. Upon request, the WF will
       obtain/provide CDMs from the servicing CU. CDMs are used to determine the spread of
       chemical and biological agents that are released.
       2.12.4.8. The WF is the primary unit for providing Effective Downwind Message (EDM)
       support. Upon request, the WF will obtain/provide EDMs from AFWA. The EDM is
       used for forecasting threat areas for fallout from a nuclear detonation.
2.13. Dissemination Process.
   2.13.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing
   system or the weather technician are disseminated via the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET).
   When the JET is out of service, observations will be disseminated longline, via the LAN, on
   Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS). If all longline transmission resources are
   out of service, the WF will call via telephone (voice relay) another weather station or
   supporting hub (26 OWS) for longline transmission. Locally, when JET is nonoperational,
   the WF will relay observations to the following local organizations in the order of priority
   listed in Table 2.6.

Table 2.6. Notification Priority.
 1. Tower (Hotline or x-6046; commercial (316) 759-2106)
 2. 22 ARW/CP (Hotline or x-3251; commercial (316) 759-3251)
 3. AMOPS (Hand Carried or x-3701; commercial (316) 759-3701)
 4. 26 OWS DSN 331-2615; commercial (318) 529-2614

   2.13.2. TAFs. The 26 OWS disseminates TAFs via JET. If JET is nonoperational, the WF
   will disseminate the information locally via standard telephone lines or email to the
   command post and tower.
   2.13.3. Special Weather Statement (SWS). 26 OWS transmits SWSs to WF leadership via
   email and through Threat Assessment Discussions. WF leadership tailors SWS information
   and provides information to 22 ARW leadership via email (as able), as Significant Weather
   Alerts.
   2.13.4. Significant Weather Alerts: The WF transmits Significant Weather Alerts and
   updates via email (as able) to 22 ARW CCs/Superintendents Group, 22 AMOPS, 931 ARG
   CCs and Chiefs, KSANG/CP, TACC, and the NWS (for info only). The email cc’s 26 OWS
   REGION 1 and 22 OSS/OSW (to maintain continuity and consistency).
   2.13.5. WWAs. The 26 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into JET which will disseminate the
   information to Tower, 22 ARW/CP, AM Ops and TACC weather. If JET is out-of-service,
   the WF (26 OWS if the WF is closed) will call each agency in Table 2.6 to pass information.
   Tower disseminates all weather watches, warnings and advisories to airborne and taxiing
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                          21


   aircraft. Command Post and AM Ops will further disseminate all WWAs using the pyramid
   notification scheme shown in Figure 2.1.
   2.13.6. Tornado Warnings/Siren. The WF has the primary responsibility for alerting the
   base population in the event of a tornado warning. The siren will be tested each Friday at
   1200L (March-November) as long as the weather conditions and mission permits it. If the
   WF is closed or the WF siren malfunctions, 22 ARW/CP assumes responsibility for the
   tornado siren (or notification via the Giant Voice System).

                                           Chapter 3

                                    MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF, TACC, and the 26 OWS support the McConnell AFB flying and non-
flying missions. The Mission Weather Product (MWP) is the primary tool used to accomplish
these tasks. MWPs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be anything from a
web-based flight weather briefing (FWB) to a change-of-command weather forecast. Any event,
both flying and non-flying, that will be affected by weather normally requires some sort of
MWP.
3.2. Operational Hours. WF Mission Services are provided Monday-Friday from 0300L-
2100L and as required on weekends, holidays, and down days. TACC and 26 OWS provide 24-
hour support as indicated in 1.5.2. The WF’s Mission Services personnel will be available 24-
hours a day during exercises, real-world contingencies and when directed by 22 ARW/CC.
Missions Services will also open to support flying missions for the following criteria.
   3.2.1. The WF will open to provide brief/PMSV services, regardless of weather conditions,
   for all scheduled 22 ARW missions, if the mission is/was not briefed by TACC.
   3.2.2. Flight Mission ORM. WF personnel will be available from 2 hours prior to 30
   minutes after mission departure and/or open 30 minutes prior to arrival to provide TACC
   liaison/ service/PMSV support for all scheduled aircraft arrivals/departures outside normal
   duty hours when any of the criteria below are met.
       3.2.2.1. Ceilings/Visibility observed or forecast to be < 1000’/3SM
       3.2.2.2. Winds observed or forecast > 35 Knots
       3.2.2.3. Crosswinds observed or forecast > 25 Knots
3.3. Supported Organizations/Missions/Requirements. The WF provides weather support to
the 22 ARW and the 931st ARG (and their associated units). See Attachment 6 for
airframe/mission requirements and limitations. See Chapter 2 and Attachment 5 for all watches,
warnings and advisories.
   3.3.1. The 22 ARW operates/maintains KC-135 Stratotankers supporting worldwide aerial
   refueling and airlift operations, provides Global Reach for troops, equipment and supplies
   with mobility requirements and, supports global contingency and conventional operations
   and USSTRATCOM OPLAN 8010.
   3.3.2. The 931ARG flies McConnell AFB KC-135R aircraft providing mission ready
   reservists to maintain and support Global Reach for America.
3.4. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). MWPs are mission-specific forecasts that tailor and
fuse strategic and theater scale products with information supplied by local units (e.g., flying
schedule, wing calendar) and agencies enabling the direct inject of weather impacts into planning
and/or execution. The end result is a product/information designed to provide timely, accurate
and relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever means proves most effective
(Web-Based, verbally, person-to-person, 175-1, etc.). MWPs will be horizontally consistent with
 26                                                 MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


(but not necessarily mirror) products issued by any OWS and the Air Force Weather Agency
(AFWA).
3.5. Flying Missions. The WF and TACC provide mission-tailored weather support to the 22
ARW and 931st ARG flying units.
   3.5.1. Geographic Area of Responsibility. Mission-tailored weather support is provided for
   flying areas used by McConnell AFB’s assigned and attached units. Most McConnell
   missions are served by TACC Weather who assumes the same AOR for FWBs via GDDS2.
   3.5.2. Training Missions, Operating Areas and Weather Sensitivities. Due to the size of the
   training areas there are very few instances when weather will make an operating area
   completely unusable. Pilot discretion is used to determine mission go/no-go regardless of the
   weather phenomena listed in the MWP.
   3.5.3. Flight Planning MWPs. The WF produces two flight planning MWPs (2-Day
   Planning and AR Planning) to provide aviators with a first look at anticipated weather and
   associated impacts (see attachment 8). Planning MWPs do not take the place of an official
   flight forecast; they are not updated or amended. They are available through the One-Stop
   share-point page at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/22oss/OneStop/default.aspx under KIAB
   WX Forecast Products. Both products are also available directly through the WF share-
   point page at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/22oss/Weather/default.aspx.
      3.5.3.1. 2-Day Planning MWP. The 2-Day Planning MWP provides a planning forecast
      for the airfield. It details criteria such as; ceilings, visibility, cross winds, thunderstorms,
      icing and turbulence. It is designed to provide critical go/no-go planning information for
      the following two days to the flying squadrons. The 2-Day Planning MWP will be issued
      once a day NLT 1430L Monday-Friday.
      3.5.3.2. AR Planning MWP. The AR Planning MWP is a first glance at anticipated
      weather for the next day’s scheduled AR tracks. Monday’s AR track data will be
      available Friday afternoon, provided route information is updated in GDSS. The AR
      Planning MWP is designed to provide aviators a first glance at criteria such as
      clouds/visibility, thunderstorms, icing and turbulence for each 22 ARW scheduled AR
      track. The AR Planning MWP will be issued once a day NLT 1500L Monday–Friday.
   3.5.4. Flight Weather Briefs (FWBs). GDSS is the primary command and control (C2)
   system used to request and receive weather briefings to AMC owned/gained flying units. It is
   designed to provide critical go/no-go weather information, for all phases of each mission, to
   the flying squadrons. GDSS provides a unique product that incorporates the requirements of
   all McConnell-based flying units into a common format (see Attachment 7). Updates can be
   obtained by calling TACC at DSN 779-0353, Commercial (618) 229-0353, or by contacting
   the WF at DSN 743-3707/4311, Commercial (316) 759-3707/4311.
      3.5.4.1. For most 22 ARW and Total Force missions departing McConnell AFB, TACC
      Weather provides FWBs via GDSS. The WF provides FWBs via GDSS during TACC
      COOPs IAW para 1.6.3.
      3.5.4.2. For TURBO 85/86 missions and 8010 missions, WF personnel will provide a
      FWB to aircrews at the alert facility, via E-mail, or at the weather flight prior to launch.
MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014                                                              27


   3.5.5. MISSIONWATCH. This is a deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather
   and/or the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors identified
   in attachment 6. Transient missions (cross country, etc.) are not considered “local” though
   the mission’s origins may have started/ended at McConnell AFB. It is through this method
   that FWB amendments/updates are accomplished.
       3.5.5.1. WF Briefed Sorties. FWBs will be monitored continuously and updated as
       required. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will inform the OWS when weather
       products issued by the OWS do not accurately reflect observed conditions and impact
       flight safety. Updates to the FWB, provided by the WF, may precede the issuance of the
       OWS’s TAF but must be verbally coordinated between the WF and the OWS prior to any
       FWB changes. The WF will amend/update the FWB as necessary. In addition, when
       previously un-forecast weather conditions develop that place a mission at risk, the WF
       will contact the 22 ARW/CP with updates. The CP will pass this information to the
       aircrew. MISSIONWATCH will be conducted and logged.
       3.5.5.2. TACC Briefed Sorties. TACC weather will perform MISSIONWATCH for all
       sorties they support. If significant changes to weather occur, TACC will update the
       Weather Threat Assessment (WTA). IAW AMCI15-101, the 22 ARW/CP subscribes to
       WTAs to receive MISSIONWATCH alerts. The CP will pass Weather Threat
       Assessments (WTA) information to the aircrew. The WF will:
          3.5.5.2.1. Maintain situational awareness of the weather impacting all non-IFM
          McConnell AFB sorties.
          3.5.5.2.2. Coordinate with TACC weather if weather deviates from the published
          WTA.
          3.5.5.2.3. Backup TACC weather IAW para 1.6.3.
   3.5.6. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide or arrange
   for weather support for transient aircrews IAW the duty priorities listed in Table 1.1. The WF
   will provide verbal briefings, full FWBs (175-1), or updates to transient aircrew as requested
   following the flight’s duty priorities. These missions are not provided MISSIONWATCH.
   Transient aircrew briefs are low on the priority list and may have to be referred to the
   26OWS briefing cell. Additionally, a web-based aircrew-briefing terminal is located in the
   Flight Planning Room. This briefing terminal allows aircrews to self-brief or schedule a
   flight weather briefing from the 26 OWS. The 26 OWS briefing cell can be reached at DSN
   331-2651 or via web access from the aircrew briefing terminal. Contact information is
   provided at the aircrew briefing terminal.
3.6. Non-Flying Missions. The WF and 26 OWS support various non-flying missions (e.g., Wg
picnic, change of command ceremonies, Morale Welfare and Recreation) through WWAs.
Primary organizational weather limitations and customer actions are identified in Attachment 5
Additionally, the WF produces a four-day forecast to support non-flying missions and events
(see Attachment 8). Specific support to McConnell’s non-flying missions is identified in
Chapter 4. Specialized weather information can be provided to support any non-flying mission
upon request. Non-governmental agencies should request weather information and support
through 22 Public Affairs (PA).

   3.6.1. Four-Day Forecast. The Four-Day Forecast provides McConnell AFB personnel with an
   outlook of sensible weather expected on base for the next 96 hours. It is designed to provide
   general weather conditions such as max/min temps; wind chill/heat index, precipitation,
   sunrise/sunset/lunar illumination and ORM for operations, maintenance, and Airman (see
   Attachment 8). It is produced and issued daily NLT 0530L Monday-Friday. It is available on the
   WF share-point page at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/22oss/Weather/default.aspx.
3.7. Space Weather. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio
waves (High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and
Satellite Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation
from the sun. McConnell’s missions have a wide-variety of parameters possibly affected by various
space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication, radar, Global Positioning System
communications, etc.). Space weather products are available from the 26 OWS at
https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/by_type/space/index.cfm?fuseaction=space_weather&id=
SPWXSUM2&brief_type=SPACE&UID=&BW=H&UF=O&AOR=1&USEHF=1.
   3.7.1. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space weather. One
   of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a lack of
   sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide lead-
   times for significant space events is extremely limited. Note that GPS products are primarily
   “now-casts”‖and/or <1 hour forecasts. Due to frequent refresh required to monitor these
   products, weather technicians will only monitor these products when specifically requested
   by the customer.
   3.7.2. The WF and TACC weather provide space impacts on their FWBs.
   3.7.3. An example of space weather situational awareness and more detailed list of potential
   space weather impacts are provided in Attachment 9.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment & Software Systems. The WF uses a wide range of
equipment and software systems to determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical
systems are used continuously to provide customers the most timely, accurate and relevant
weather intelligence possible.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 is an integrated automated weather system consisting of
   multiple weather sensors and information technology components that continually measure
   the environment near the surface of the earth. It automatically generates surface aviation
   weather observations based on user-defined events, either by time or occurrence of a
   particular weather element or category. The FMQ-19 is the primary source for recording
   elements in the official observation. Backup systems include the Kestrel 4500 and TMQ-53.
   5.2.2. Kestrel 4500. The Kestrel is a hand-held weather observing device that measures
   wind speed, temperature, and pressure. It does not have the precision of other equipment and
   will be used as a short-term backup device only.
   5.2.3. TMQ-53 (TMOS). The TMQ-53 TMOS is a tactical weather observing instrument
   suite able to measure everything the FMQ-19 can measure. During long-term FMQ-19
   outages, the TMQ-53 can be used as backup.
   5.2.4. Gibson Ridge Radar (GR). The WF utilizes the web-based GR software application
   system as its primary source of radar data. This system allows weather technicians to analyze
   complex radar signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity, movement,
   internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate
   the latest radar information into all mission weather products and Resource Protection
   products. The WF utilizes the 26 OWS web-page (or another OWS) and AFW-WEBS as
   back-up sources for radar products. Without internet connectivity (LAN), the WF does not
   have the capability to access radar data.
   5.2.5. Mark IV-B. The WF utilizes the web-based Mark IV-B software application system
   as its primary source of satellite data. This system allows weather technicians to view
   weather systems as they develop and progress. It provides weather technicians the ability to
   determine cloud patterns locations, and movements critical to the forecast and eye’s forward
   processes. The WF utilizes the 26 OWS web-page (or another OWS) and AFW-WEBS as
   back-up sources for satellite imagery. Without internet connectivity (LAN), the WF does not
   have the capability to access satellite data.
5.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment, communications
equipment allows the WF to get the right information to the right customer. The following
systems are the backbone of the WF communications network.
   5.3.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). The WF uses JET as its primary method of
   disseminating observations, forecasts, warnings, watches and advisories. The JET consists of
 36                                                 MCCONNELLAFBI15-101 1 APRIL 2014


   a series of dedicated computer terminals in the tower and the WF connected through the base
   LAN to the JET server. Other agencies requiring direct access to JET have a JET connection
   installed on a self-provided computer. Agencies without JET access will receive critical
   weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system. JET is installed in the
   following locations: 22 ARW/CP, Tower, AMOPS, 26 OWS, 184 IW/CP, MOC, and Base
   Weather Station. In the event that JET terminals are inoperative, the WF utilizes AFW-
   WEBS to disseminate observations and forecasts (if required) longline. Telephones are used
   as a backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (374.2 MHz) allows the WF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the
   PMSV is out of service aircrews can contact the WF, TACC or 26 OWS via phone patch
   (where possible) to get weather data. WF personnel will ensure information on outages is
   included in local Airfield Advisories and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs).
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to backup systems. Hotlines are installed
   between the WF and the command post and tower. Normal phone lines will be used in the
   event of a hotline outage.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN for receipt of weather
   data and to improve the timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. The
   LAN is the primary method used for receiving all weather information and disseminating web-
   based MWPs (located on SharePoint, see Chapter 3). Additionally, it is the conduit between the
   JET server and JET computer terminals (see 5.3.1). Internet connectivity is integral to the WF’s
   ability to disseminate observations (longline only) and access back-up web-sites used in the event
   of a JET outage. In the event of an internet outage, the WF will relay observations via phone to
   ATC personnel and request the 26 OWS or another WF send the information longline. FWBs
   will be coordinated/faxed to requestors or verbally updated with current airfield information.
   Forecast/Observed WWAs will be relayed via telephone IAW Table 2.6. The 26 OWS will fax
   or verbally relay meteorological information, as able. Without internet connectivity, the WF
   does not have JET, satellite, or radar capability and, lighting detection is limited to cloud to
   ground strikes within 30nm of the FMQ-19 sensors.
5.4. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time to time. The
following organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair weather and communications
equipment:

   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in
   the event natural disasters, or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact systems base-wide.
   The priorities for weather equipment are listed in Table 5.2. (priorities may be adjusted based
   on forecast weather). The response time is broken down into the following codes:
       5.4.1.1. Code A--Within 30 minutes during duty hours; however, a 1-hour response time
       is permitted during non-duty hours. Deferment of maintenance may occur only with the
       concurrence of both the Superintendent of Maintenance and the user.
       5.4.1.2. Code C--A response time of 30 minutes during duty hours only--single shift
       maintenance unless otherwise requested.

Sky Condition                A4.1.9.       State of the sky in terms of sky cover, layers and
                                           heights, ceilings and obscurations.
Temperature and Dew Point    A4.1.10.      Measure of hotness/coldness of ambient air. Dew
                                           point measures saturation point temperature.
Altimeter                    A4.1.11.      Indicates altitude above MSL of an aircraft on the
                                           ground.
Remarks                      A4.1.12.      Remarks generally elaborate on parameters
                                           reported in the body of the report, and will be
                                           included in all METAR and SPECI observations.

  A4.1.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
  A4.1.2. Station identifier, also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
  observation (in this case McConnell AFB).
  A4.1.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the
  observation.
  A4.1.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
     A4.1.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or
     SPECI is transmitted.
     A4.1.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human
     intervention.
         A4.1.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician
         signs off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
         A4.1.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term
         COR is used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather
         technician is manually correcting the observation.
  A4.1.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees
  using three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind
  speed is entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
     A4.1.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following
     the wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits
     and, if required, the hundreds digit.
     A4.1.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction
     with wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
     A4.1.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction
     varying 60 degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The
     variable wind direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional
     variability will be encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable
     from 180 degrees to 240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
     A4.1.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
  A4.1.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance seen from the airfield sensors (during
  augmentation of the visibility sensors, it is the predominant distance covering 50% of the
  aerodrome), reported in statute miles.
  A4.1.7. Runway Visual Range.
  A4.1.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is
  mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A4.2. lists the present weather
  codes:

    A4.1.9. Sky Condition and Cloud Height. Describes the amount of clouds present at the
    airfield and the base of each cloud deck. They fall into the following categories:
          A4.1.9.1. Sky Condition. The amount of cloud coverage is as follows:
               A4.1.9.1.1. SKC – Sky Clear.
               A4.1.9.1.2. FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage.
               A4.1.9.1.3. SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage.
               A4.1.9.1.4. BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage.
               A4.1.9.1.5. OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage.
               A4.1.9.1.6. VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how
               far up into the fog can be seen.
               A4.1.9.1.7. FEW000 – Surface-based obscuration.
          A4.1.9.2. Cloud Height. Three-digit number provides the height of the base of the
          cloud in hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1,500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may
          be appended to the cloud height to indicate the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering
          cumulus.
    A4.1.10. Temperature and Dew Point (can be in degrees, either Fahrenheit or Celsius).

Induction Icing Thresholds: Engine anti-icing must be used in ice fog or when the
temperature is below 50°F (10°C) and standing water is visible on the ramp or taxiways or visible
moisture is present.
Icing: May operate up to 10 min in MDT, must avoid observed or forecast SVR. Avoid any
flight through freezing rain (clear). Avoid clouds within the ± 5,000 ft of freezing level.
Turbulence: Avoid areas of moderate or greater, observed or forecast CAT or mountain
wave.
Lightning/TSTMS: Avoid by 10NM below FL230 and 20 NM at and above FL230.
In-Flight Refueling: VSBY > 1 NM.
Remarks: Cannot take off with > .5 inches of slush or water on the runway. Pilots may
need height/temperature of tropopause and temperature at flight level. Crew may need air
refueling (AR) route forecast. KC-135 aircraft may take off and land when airfield is
below published weather minimums.

                                1000, the crew may take off if mission priority dictates,
                                provided the runway has dual RVR readouts and displays
                                (minimum RVR 1000 on both) and runway centerline lighting
                                is operational. If the previous conditions cannot be satisfied but
                                visibility is at or above 1000 RVR, the agency responsible for
                                mission execution may authorize takeoff when mission priority
                                dictates. For any takeoff below 1600 RVR, the crew must be
                                fully qualified.
All Others      RVR 1600        For runways with more than one operating RVR readout, RVR
                                must read 1600 minimum on all.

A8.2.1. The AR Planning MWP highlights scheduled AR routes for the following day. Color
codes are used to highlight the AR tracks where the potential for mission limiting conditions
exist the following day. The MWP indicates worst case conditions during the scheduled track
times. If the AR track is used multiple times during the day, and conditions are expected to
change, the route will be divided by timeframe (i.e., Early/Late or AM/PM).
A8.3. 4-Day Forecast




   A8.3.1. The 4-Day forecast provides worst case conditions and distinguishes between AM
   (0000L-1200L) and PM (1201L-2359L) for cloud cover and associated weather. In the event
   wind direction (from) and/or speed (including gusts) is expected to change during the day,
   the data will be divided and an annotation to identify when it will occur (i.e., AM, PM,
   Storms) will be included. Ceiling and visibility data are the forecast worst case condition for
   the 24-hour period. ORM is based on worst case conditions for the AM (0000L-2359L) and
   PM (1201L -2359L). It is tailored to Operations, maintenance and Airmen based on the ORM
   criteria listed in Table A8.1.
