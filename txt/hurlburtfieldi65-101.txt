SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change expands the definition of “local area” for reservist travel in paragraph 5.1.1
to include the cities of Milton, FL and Crestview, FL. It also exchanges the term “local area” for
“corporate area” to be aligned with the verbiage of the JFTR governing regulation. It also
delineates and defines “commuting area” as required by the JFTR. Minor changes were made to
 2                                                   HURLBURTFIELDI65-101 14 JUNE 2012


paragraph 5.1.4 to reflect the aforementioned changes. A margin bar indicates newly revised
material.
1. POLICY FOR POC USAGE.
     1.1. The Hurlburt Field POD consists of the Northwest Florida counties of Bay, Escambia,
     Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton only. Official travel outside of the Hurlburt Field POD
     will normally require temporary duty orders.
     1.2. When available, US government transportation will be used for travel within the POD.
     Travelers will request US government transportation from the Transportation Vehicle
     Operations Section (1 SOLRS/LGRD). When US government transportation is not available
     and when it is otherwise more advantageous to the US government, the use of POCs may be
     authorized on a reimbursable basis. 1 SOLRS/LGRD will issue a certificate of non-
     availability prior to authorization for use of privately owned vehicle. This certificate will be
     submitted as an attachment to SF 1164 to support any payments for vicinity travel.
     1.3. POC reimbursement rates are contained in the JFTR.
     1.4. When two or more persons travel together on the same trip and in the same POC,
     reimbursement will be made only to the owner of the vehicle
2. VICINITY TRAVEL STATUS. A person is in vicinity travel status when directed to
perform duty necessary to conduct US government business within the POD of Hurlburt Field
for which official travel orders are usually not written. Official travel performed to any
organization, auxiliary field, range, or site within the POD is accomplished in a vicinity travel
status. Travelers will request US government transportation from the 1 SOLRS/LGRD. 823 Red
Horse Squadron (RHS) personnel will coordinate requests with their Vehicle Operation Section
(823 RHS/DOPV).
3. RESTRICTIONS.
     3.1. Payment is not normally authorized for travel between home and place of duty.
     However, reimbursement of official travel originating and ending at the claimant’s home is
     authorized when it is not necessary for them to begin or end travel at their duty station.
     Reimbursement will not exceed the cost had travel begun or ended at the traveler’s place of
     normal duty.
     3.2. Personnel proceeding to locations within the POD will not normally be placed on
     orders.
     3.3. All claims for vicinity travel will have the following statement typed on the claim:
        3.3.1. “I certify that official travel was performed by POC of which I was in fact the
        owner/operator, and my claim does not include mileage between place of duty and place
        where meals were taken.”
4. APPROVING AUTHORITIES. Approving authorities will be the same as those listed in
AFI 65-103, AFSOC Supplement 1, paragraph 1.2.5.
5. RESERVISTS.
     5.1. Enumerates additional roles (MPA, RPA and Annual Tour Support) reservists perform
     to Hurlburt Field. It now reads “The following definitions are provided for clarification of
