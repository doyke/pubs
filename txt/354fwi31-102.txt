DoD civilians) assigned or attached to 354th Fighter Wing. Failure to observe prohibitions and mandatory
provisions of this directive in paragraphs 1.1., 1.1.4.3., 1.1.4.4., 5., 5.2., 6.1., 6.1.3., 7.3., 8.1., and 8.2. by
military personnel is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Violations by
civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable
criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.


1. General. . The purpose of this instruction is to provide a basis for unit personnel to anchor to and take
appropriate actions in safeguarding procurement sensitive materials, while performing day-to-day duties,
especially in the Commercial Activity Program area of responsibilities. For procedures or instructions not
covered in this instruction contact the unit commander (or staff agency chief).
    1.1. Responsibilities. All personnel have the obligation to protect procurement sensitive material/
    information, to ensure compliance with these procedures, and to report any deviations.
        1.1.1. During periods when A-76, Commercial Activity studies are being conducted, the unit
        commander (or staff agency chief) will appoint (in writing) one primary and one alternate Com-
        mercial Activities Security Manager (CASM).
2                                                                 354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001


    1.1.2. The CASM will incorporate Commercial Activity Information Security into the unit's exist-
    ing information security program as outlined in DoD 5200.1-R, AFI 31-401, AFI 61-204, FAR
    clause 52.215-12, entitled “Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data” and supplemental guid-
    ance thereto, to include overseeing and/or performing all associated duties and/or functions.
       1.1.2.1. The CASM will develop and publish an Annual Security Education Training Plan for
       the unit. Once published the CASM, unit commander (or staff agency chief) or their designee
       will be responsible for conducting or ensuring all personnel receive Commercial Activity
       security training as outlined in the annual training plan. The CASM will be responsible for
       gathering educational material, audiovisual aids and monitoring training accomplishment. The
       annual training plan will be developed in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R and AFIs 31-401
       and 61-204.
       1.1.2.2. Personnel designated to administer or conduct Commercial Activity security training
       may modify the training material to meet the specific audience training needs. As a minimum,
       the unit’s annual Commercial Activity security education training plan must meet the follow-
       ing requirements:
           1.1.2.2.1. Schedule semi-annual training.
           1.1.2.2.2. Identify specific Procurement Integrity Act (PIA) subjects and topics to be pre-
           sented.
           1.1.2.2.3. Identify personnel to make presentations.
           1.1.2.2.4. Monitor training accomplishment.
           1.1.2.2.5. Document training as required.
    1.1.3. The Wing Commander will appoint members to a Competitive Sourcing Management
    Steering Group (CSMSG). It will include representatives from Military Personnel, Civilian Per-
    sonnel, Finance, Contracting, Civil Engineering, Judge Advocate, local Union, Public Affairs,
    Manpower, and the Commander of any function under study. The Manpower & Organization
    Chief or their designated representative will chair the CSMSG.
       1.1.3.1. The steering group will provide complete oversight to all wing level A-76, Commer-
       cial Activity Cost-Comparison studies, to include the safeguarding of all related procurement
       sensitive information. The steering group's mission includes three primary objectives: 1) Com-
       plete cost-comparison studies which are fair and equitable to the government and public sec-
       tor; 2) Complete studies within the prescribed time constraints, normally 18 months for a
       single function; and 3) Facilitate a fully mission capable cost-comparison decision, contractor
       or a government bid, which provides a net savings in operating costs.
       1.1.3.2. The CSMSG will oversee all requests for information related to any Wing A-76,
       Commercial Activity Cost-Comparison studies.
    1.1.4. For each A-76 study a Business Requirement and Advisory Group (BRAG) is established.
    If the study is a full cost-comparison, the CSMSG will designate and assemble a Most-Effi-
    cient-Organization (MEO) team.
       1.1.4.1. BRAG. The BRAG is a customer-focused multifunctional team instituted under the
       authority of the installation commander. The Contracting Squadron Commander establishes a
       BRAG to plan and manage any service contract throughout the life of the requirement. The
354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001                                                                                3


           requirement may be for single function or may include multiple functions. Specific duties are
           spelled out in AFI 63-124, Performance-Based Service Contracts (PBSC).
               1.1.4.1.1. The BRAG is charged with developing a statement of work (SOW), a contract-
               ing document which captures all performance requirements and other constraints a poten-
               tial contractor or an MEO must satisfy and/or perform under.
               1.1.4.1.2. All BRAG members, including the Manpower & Organization representative,
               are considered to be participating personally & substantially in study's A-76 process.
           1.1.4.2. MEO Team. The MEO team is also comprised of a management analyst(s) from Man-
           power and Organization, and however many technicians deemed appropriate or necessary
           from the functional area(s) under study.
               1.1.4.2.1. The MEO team is charged with examining the current operations of the function
               under study, identifying improvement opportunities, and developing a new set of business
               strategies, methodologies and technologies, and assembling the government's bid for the
               service area under study.
               1.1.4.2.2. All MEO team members, including the Manpower & Organization representa-
               tive, are considered to be participating personally & substantially in a study's A-76 pro-
               cess..
           1.1.4.3. The BRAG and MEO team will work completely independent of each other. Under no
           circumstances should any personnel participate in both the BRAG and the MEO Team.
           Beyond what the Contracting Squadron releases to other parties in the competition, the BRAG
           will not share any information, documents and/or materials with the MEO team.
           1.1.4.4. The MEO team will be treated the same as other competing contractors from the pub-
           lic sector. No procurement sensitive information will be released to the MEO unless it is either
           first released from the Contracting Squadron to all bidders, or it is generated from the MEO
           team's internal discovery efforts.
       1.1.5. The CSMSG will conduct itself in such a manner that it does not compromise the indepen-
       dence of the BRAG and MEO team efforts. In lieu of the MEO team participating in the CSMSG,
       commanders of the units constructing a MEO will conduct periodic meeting with their MEO team
       and their advisors to review their progress. The MEO team's concerns will be represented at the
       CSMSG by the affected unit commanders.

2. Procurement Sensitive Information. The following defines pools of information which may directly
or indirectly affect an A-76 Commercial Activity study. The examples of information in these pools are
not intended to be all inclusive, nor all restrictive. They are intended to help government employees to
identify information which is potentially sensitive, and to initiate an appropriate query as to the precise
disclosure restrictions. The burden for making such a query is placed on the individual coming in contact
with the information described below.
   2.1. Definition. Procurement Sensitive Information is any information generated by the federal gov-
   ernment and/or its employees which relates to a federal government commercial activity. If this infor-
   mation is released or disclosed, a potential bidder would gain an unfair advantage over other
   competitors, and potentially compromise the government's bid. This includes, but is not limited to,
   information which describes past, present, and/or future operations or strategies thereof, solicitation
4                                                                       354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001


    packages, government bids, government tools and their respective protocols (software, spreadsheets,
    instructions, audits, unit manning documents, working documents, etc.)
    2.2. Solicitation Related Information. Solicitation Related Information is any information, in whole
    or part, which is under consideration to be part of a package, published by the Contracting Squadron,
    for the purposes of soliciting contract services. These packages include documents such as the State-
    ment of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS), Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
    (QASP), etc.
    2.3. Government's Bid. Government bid information is comprised of either a price-out of current
    operations, or a Most Efficient Organization (MEO). Either package may be derived from working
    documents such as, Unit Manning Document (UMD), an operational audit, Customer-Output-Pro-
    cess-Input-Supplier (COPIS) assessment, etc. A MEO bid package is comprised of a Management
    Plan (Proposed MEO, Transition Plan, OMB Circular A-76, Cost Comparison Software Program
    (COMPARE) document, and supporting documents) and a Technical Performance Plan. Current oper-
    ations bid packages, normally are comprised of a COMPARE document and supporting documents.
    2.4. Information Classification. A premature release or disclosure of any procurement sensitive infor-
    mation described above can potentially compromise an A-76 cost-comparison. Such a compromise
    will give one party an unfair advantage over others in the competition for the service (contract) under
    study. Therefore, all procurement sensitive information will be marked as "Procurement Sensi-
    tive--For Official Use Only" at the point of generation.

3. Procurement Integrity Act (PIA). The Procurement Integrity Act referenced in DoD 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics, is a standard of conduct for which the government expects its officials (government and contrac-
tor, alike) to uphold while executing their role in a fair and open competition between the federal govern-
ment and the public sector.
    3.1. Applicability. Procurement Integrity applies to all parties directly affected by and/or directly
    involved with an A-76, Competitive Sourcing & Privatization study.
    3.2. Violation. Release or disclosure of any procurement sensitive information not specifically autho-
    rized or inherent to releasing, developing, and/or responding to a contract solicitation or government
    bid for such, can be construed as a violation of the Procurement Integrity Act, and can be criminally
    punishable under the UCMJ or United States Code (U.S.C.)
    3.3. Procurement Integrity briefings.
       3.3.1. Personnel directly involved in a A-76, Competitive Sourcing & Privatization study are
       identified in paragraph 4.1. and its subparts. All personnel directly involved in a study will receive
       a PIA briefing from the local Judge Advocate's office, Unit Commander (or staff agency chief),
       and/or their supervisor. This briefing will be conducted within 5 days of the A-76 study announce-
       ment or within 5 days of appointment to either the BRAG or MEO Team. At the conclusion of the
       briefing, the member will read and sign a briefing certificate (Attachment 1 and Attachment 2).
       Personnel uncertain about signing the certificate will be afforded council from the Judge Advocate
       office. The briefing certificate will then be signed by the briefer, and a copy placed in the mem-
       ber's personal information file, or another suitable personnel record, until the study has been com-
       pleted. Copies of all PIA briefing certificates described herein, will also be maintained by the
       Manpower & Organization Office in the master study record file. Personnel without a signed
354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001                                                                                   5


       briefing certificate will be denied access to study information and/or activities. Personnel involved
       in studies will renew their PIA briefing semi-annually.
       3.3.2. All unit personnel directly affected by an A-76, Competitive Sourcing & Privatization
       study, will receive a PIA briefing from the local Judge Advocate's office and/or Unit Commander
       (or staff agency chief), or their designee. This target group includes as a minimum, personnel
       holding positions identified under study. In order to maximize the safeguarding of procurement
       sensitive information, this group would ideally include all personnel assigned to the unit under
       study. The briefing will be conducted within 30 days of the announcement for each A-76 study. At
       the conclusion of the briefing, the unit commander (or staff agency chief) will publish a briefing
       certificate, attaching a list of all personnel in attendance. Personnel absent from the unit's briefing
       will be briefed within 15 days of their return. The briefing certificate (Attachment 3) will be
       signed by the briefer, and stored in the unit's files until the study's final award decision has been
       issued.
       3.3.3. Debrief. Upon Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA), Permanent Change of Station
       (PCS), separation or retirement, all personnel affected by or involved in an ongoing A-76 study
       will receive a debriefing by their unit commander (or staff agency chief). During the debriefing the
       commander (or staff agency chief) will remind the member of the constraints placed on them by
       the PIA. For any questions the member might have which are not clearly addressed in the re-stated
       PIA, the member will be scheduled for an appointment with the Judge Advocate office. At the
       conclusion of the debrief, the member will sign the Debrief certificate at the bottom of their origi-
       nal briefing certificate. This document will be maintained by the unit until the study is completed.
       3.3.4. The Manpower & Organization office will maintain a record copy of all study documents,
       in their final version as a minimum, to include as a minimum; Announcement letter, SOW, Man-
       agement Plan (MEO, COMPARE, Transition Plan, Supporting Documents, and Technical Perfor-
       mance Plan), HAF 8001 letter, Authorization Change Requests, PIA Briefing Certificates. These
       records should be used in the commercial activity review conducted during the fifth and tenth year
       anniversaries for the MEO or contract. Consequently, these records will be maintained for a mini-
       mum period of 10 years, unless superseded by a subsequent study encompassing the same func-
       tional area(s).

4. Access: Procurement sensitive information will only be released to individuals (government) who pos-
sess a valid need-to-know, require the information in the performance of official A-76 duties, and have
signed a Procurement Integrity Act briefing certificate on file.
   4.1. During the onset of each A-76 study the CSMSG will develop a single document which identifies
   the assignment of personnel to the various working groups or positions which coordinate or influence
   actions affecting each study. At a minimum this document will include personnel or teams performing
   in the following capacities:
       4.1.1. Manpower & Organization certifying official. (Chief, Manpower & Organization)*
       4.1.2. Contracting Personnel.*
       4.1.3. Unit Representative certifying the plausibility/acceptability of the MEO.*
       4.1.4. Business Requirements Acquisition Group (BRAG)
       4.1.5. Source Selection team.
6                                                                      354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001


       4.1.6. Independent Review Officer (IRO, 354 CPTF).*
       4.1.7. MAJCOM/XPM Project Manager.*
       4.1.8. CSMSG.*
    4.2. This list described above will be used to identify the personnel who may be included in the vari-
    ous A-76 study discussion forums. Groups or individuals from the list above coded with "*" are the
    only persons or groups the MEO team can discuss their procurement sensitive information with. MEO
    discussions with the IRO before the independent review begins are not authorized. Contracting per-
    sonnel are not authorized access to MEO data prior to bid opening. For contacts not addressed here,
    ask the unit commander (or staff agency chief) for clarification.

5. Safekeeping and Storage:
    5.1. Procurement sensitive information and/or materials will be safeguarded at all times.
       5.1.1. All procurement sensitive documents will be labeled "For Official Use Only--Procurement
       Sensitive." Computer removable storage devices will be marked with the same label.
       5.1.2. Cover sheets labeled "For Official Use Only--Procurement Sensitive" will be attached to
       any procurement sensitive document or folder with multiple documents, to include when the doc-
       uments are hand carried outside the designated work area.
       5.1.3. All personnel having custody of procurement sensitive information must take every action
       necessary to ensure it is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized personnel. As a minimum:
       (Contract files shall be be maintained in accordance with the FAR and its supplements)
           5.1.3.1. Electronic files will be stored on removable storage disks or hard drives with
           restricted access. Electronic files will use password protection protocols where practical.
           5.1.3.2. Documents and other materials being left unattended will be stored in a desk drawer
           or file cabinet.
           5.1.3.3. E-mail traffic with attached documents will be minimized. E-mails will be encrypted
           where practical. When e-mails are sent, "FOUO" will be included in the message subject line.
       5.1.4. End-of-Day Security Checks: At the end of each duty day a complete check of all areas
       where procurement sensitive information is stored, handled, or processed will be accomplished.
           5.1.4.1. During the end-of-day security check the designated individual will inspect all equip-
           ment and areas, such as, desk tops, copier, computers and peripheral, etc., where procurement
           sensitive information is handled, stored, processed, or destroyed.
           5.1.4.2. The clean desk policy will be in effect in these areas. This requires personnel storing,
           handling, and/or processing procurement sensitive information to ensure there desk tops are
           neat, without clutter. This standard enables personnel performing end-of-day security checks
           to quickly assess whether or not procurement sensitive information has been secured or not.
    5.2. Continuous File Purging. To minimize procurement sensitive information on-hand, all personnel
    storing procurement sensitive information will oversee the continuous purging of administrative file
    systems.
354FWI31-102 5 MARCH 2001                                                                                 7


   5.3. Document destruction: Documents (published or working) which contain procurement sensitive
   information will be destroyed when superseded or deemed no longer needed. As a minimum, paper
   documents will be shredded and electronic files will be completely deleted and/or erased.
   5.4. Reproduction. The number of copies of procurement sensitive information should be minimized.
   Reproduction of procurement sensitive information is restricted to personnel performing activities in
   support of the 354th Fighter Wing's Commercial Activity program. No procurement sensitive informa-
   tion will be copied for personal use or for purposes other than completing the assigned A-76 study.
   5.5. Archived Files. At the conclusion of each study all relative documents will be converted to elec-
   tronic form, and archived on a Compact Disk (CD) or similar storage device. Contract files shall
   include original copies of all documentation pertaining to the A-76 study.

6. Requests for information.
   6.1. Potential Contractors should coordinate all queries on on-going or future solicitations through the
   Contracting Squadron. Contractors may request supplemental information regarding current or future
   wing operations through established Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) channels.
   6.2. The CSMSG will coordinate on all FOIA requests involving current or future A-76 Competitive
   Sourcing & Privatization studies. Information requested which is deemed procurement sensitive (and/
   or proprietary) by the steering group will be denied. Criteria for issuing a denial will be based on: the
   information requested will give a party an unfair advantage over other parties participating in the com-
   petition for the service (contract area) under study, and/or has the potential to compromise the govern-
   ment's bid for said service.
   6.3. Routinely, the CSMSG receives information regarding future A-76 studies. This information is
   generally published in the form of a Strategic Sourcing Plan, however, new initiatives may be dis-
   cussed in documents, not yet included in the plan. This information is For Official Use Only, and is
   restricted to personnel performing activities in support of the 354th Fighter Wing's Commercial Activ-
   ity program, and safeguarded accordingly. Other than the information inherent to executing assigned
   A-76 duties, no information involving or affecting current or future A-76 studies will be released to
   any other party, without the expressed consent or direction of the CSMSG.

7. Security Incidents and Violations:
   7.1. Any person having knowledge of an actual or suspected compromise of procurement sensitive
   information shall immediately report the incident to the Judge Advocate and Contracting Squadron
   Commander.
   7.2. Members provided offers of employment by a contractor or requested to provide source selection
   sensitive information to a contractor shall:
       7.2.1. Immediately terminate any further conversations and/or discussions with the contractor.
