     9.1. Reception and parking. The APG Flight will ensure that a B-4/5 stand (flare only),
     chocks and two personnel are available on the appropriate hammerhead/taxiway prior to
     aircraft landing if necessary for hung/retained/unconfirmed hung munitions/flares. APG
     Flight personnel will stop the aircraft on the hammerhead/taxiway. After APG Crew Chief
     establishes communications with the aircrew, weapons EOR crew will inspect the aircraft to
     determine the status of munitions/flares.
     9.2. Flares.
        9.2.1. If no attempt was made to expend flares and flares are retained and it is
        determined that the aircraft has no damage, no unsafe condition exists and that electrical
        power is or can be isolated from the flares, the aircraft will be released for normal taxi to
        its assigned spot and normal download procedures will apply.
NOTE: External power and post flight inspections may proceed if flares are not to be down
loaded immediately.

        9.2.2. If an attempt was made to expend flares and all flares have not expended and it is
        determined that the aircraft has no damage, no unsafe condition exists and that electrical
        power is or can be isolated from the flares, the aircraft will be released for normal taxi to
        its assigned spot and normal download procedures will apply. DO NOT apply external
        power until the flares are downloaded.
        9.2.3. If an attempt was made to expend flares and all flares have not expended and
        power cannot be isolated from the flares or any abnormalities exist contact MOC. MOC
        notifies Command Post, who will notify the EOD team for response to the aircraft. The
        APG Crew Chief will instruct the aircrew to shut down engines and will call for a tow
        crew. After engine shutdown, EOD/weapons EOR crew will remove the affected flare
        dispensing canister(s) and ensure the aircraft is safe to tow. The APG Flight will then tow
        the aircraft to its assigned spot. EOD will take possession of the affected canister(s).
        9.2.4. Subject matter experts will coordinate with QA and the investigating authority
        (307 WG/SE and Safety Investigation Board) to identify malfunctions and determine the
        cause.
     9.3. Hung/Retained Bombs Procedures.
        9.3.1. Definitions:
            9.3.1.1. HUNG ordnance (LIVE or INERT) is a weapon that does not separate from
            the aircraft after an attempted release and is considered an Unsafe Weapons
            Condition. An attempted release occurs when the aircraft issues a release pulse in
            either automatic or manual mode with all switches positioned correctly.
            9.3.1.2. RETAINED ordnance (LIVE or INERT) is a weapon(s) where the aircrew
            did not attempt to release and is considered a Safe Weapons Condition.
            9.3.1.3. Unconfirmed Hung Weapon: A weapon without visual confirmation of
            release by external spot or crew visual inspection.
307BWI21-105 9 MAY 2014                                                                          5


       9.3.2. The MOC will initiate notification checklist when a B-52 with hung bombs will be
       recovered at Barksdale. The Weapons Flight will dispatch an EOR crew to meet the
       aircraft.
       9.3.3. Landing with Hung Ordnance: Aircraft landing with hung ordnance and/or
       unconfirmed hung ordnance will back taxi on the runway, exit and stop at the center of
       the Bravo Taxiway to conduct a Ground Weapons Check (GWC) by weapons EOR crew.
       Following visual confirmation that all ordnance is safe by GWC personnel, the aircraft
       will taxi to parking. In the event multiple aircraft return with hung ordnance, the priority
       locations for GWCs are: 1. Bravo Taxiway, 2. North Hammerhead, and 3. South
       Hammerhead. The South Hammerhead will only be used if aircraft conducting GWC
       have not cleared Bravo Taxiway or the North Hammerhead.
       9.3.4. Landing with retained ordnance: Aircraft equipped with bomb bay cameras,
       aircrew can visually confirm condition of internally loaded weapons. Retained ordnance
       on the front three stations of Heavy Stores Adapter Beam (HSAB) can be visually
       verified by pilot or co-pilot. All other aircraft landing with retained ordnance will enter
       the rollout hammerhead to conduct a GWC by weapons EOR crew. Following visual
       confirmation that all ordnance is safe by GWC personnel, the aircraft will taxi to parking.
       9.3.5. Unsafe Ordnance:
           9.3.5.1. If the GWC reveals a potential unsafe weapons condition, the following
           conditions apply.
               9.3.5.1.1. Live Internal Weapons: MOC will be notified of unsafe condition.
               Aircrew will be directed to shut down engines and egress the aircraft. Bomb Bay
               doors will not be opened until weapons are safe/secured. If bomb fuzing
               wires/lanyards have not pulled through fuzing vanes, GWC will safe weapons and
               insure weapons are secured to prevent weapons from falling from aircraft. If
               bomb fuzing wires/lanyards have pulled through fuzing vanes EOD will be
               notified for weapons safe assessment, GWC will follow EOD direction to
               safe/secure weapons. Once weapons are safe/secure the aircraft will be towed to
               parking for weapons down load as required.
                  9.3.5.1.1.1. Inert Internal Weapons: MOC will be notified of unsafe
                  condition. Bomb Bay doors will not be opened until weapons are safe/secured.
                  GWC will safe/secure weapon. Once weapons are safe/secure the aircraft can
                  taxi to parking for weapon down load as required.
               9.3.5.1.2. 3 External weapons: MOC will be notified of unsafe condition.
               Aircrew will leave engines running and GWC will safe/secure the weapons. After
               weapons are rendered safe by GWC personnel, the aircraft will taxi to parking for
               weapon down load as required.
10. EOR Emergency/Abnormal Procedures. In case of fire, one individual will notify the
MOC by radio who in turn, will notify the Fire Department. All fires starting in the vicinity of
ammunition or explosives shall be reported and fought immediately with all available means to
prevent spreading of fire and munitions involvement. However, when flame is in direct contact
with the munition, or if the fire is so large that it cannot be extinguished with the equipment at
hand, the personnel involved shall immediately evacuate and seek safety.
