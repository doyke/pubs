    RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND
                     FOREIGN MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all
personnel who fly onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides
guidance on the Jump Record Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight
authorization (FA) codes in Table A2.3 for Air Force parachutists. Further guidance on
parachutist policies and requirements can be found in AFI 11-410,Personnel Parachute
Operations.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O-A):
   1.2.1. Establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in this instruction to
   ensure effective use of resources.
   1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this
   instruction.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM
flying programs. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this
instruction and to meet training and operational needs of the Air Force.
   1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or
   maintaining an aircraft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver
   authority is MAJCOM/A3; coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured
   through non-DoD resources will not be flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM
   approval.
   1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within
   their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft
   responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an
   MDS-specific fleet. MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand-down of aircrew
   personnel when warranted by operational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft
   grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down has no immediate impact on the operational
   status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational unit commander directing unit
   aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the commander time to
   assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations. Notification
   will be provided IAW AFI 10-206,Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101,Aircraft and
   Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal operations
   will be initiated by the MAJCOM Commander directing the original grounding/stand-down.
   Authority for grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by MAJCOMs in supplements
   to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than MAJCOM/A3/A4.
   1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in
   aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional
   interfly guidance in MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. Interfly agreements must be
 8                                                  AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


     approved prior to flight. Ensure unit coordination. Ensure required information is provided to
     members‘ Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices.
     1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) ―S‖ ( Table 2.6)
     (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or ASC ―04‖ ( Table 2.5) beyond 180
     days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying, or reassigned to non-
     flying status/duty. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent is the waiver authority for the 180-day limit.
     MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority to extend members in this status beyond 365 days.
     Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all cases waived beyond 365 days.
     1.3.5. Ensure FSC ―K‖ (Table 2.6) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active
     Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft,
     flying hours, etc.). To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position
     occupied by a member assigned FSC ―K‖ must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the
     end of each fiscal year. Upon completion of the revalidation, send notification to the
     member‘s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office authorizing the continuance
     of FSC ―K.‖ Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See Paragraph 1.4.1.9for additional
     guidance.
        1.3.5.1. FSC ―K‖ is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to
        permanent change of station PCS or permanent change of assignment PCA actions.
     1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
     assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviatio n service
     and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension,
     disqualification, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should be
     disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned to
     flying.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
     1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
     Commanders will:
        1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command
        for flying duties.
        1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
        Commanders may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by
        maintenance, operational, or safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10-206.
        1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation
        for safe conduct of flight.
        1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew members‘ qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
        1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations
        that may affect an aircrew member‘s aviation service.
        1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer
        than 18 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with
        longer than 20 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not
        flown for 180 days and is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status.

     1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have
     the appropriate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member
     may have already separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be
     made to accomplish the disqualification action before the aircrew member is separated or
     dismissed.
     1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ do not exceed 180 days
     in this status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is
     required, the member‘s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver
     prior to the 180-day limit. If a waiver of the 180- limit was previously approved IAW
     Paragraph1.3.4, the member‘s unit commander must again obtain waiver approval prior
     to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ status. AFI 11-402,Aviation
     and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable guidance
     for suspensions/disqualifications. See Paragraph 3.1.6.4for additional guidance.
     1.4.1.9. The OG/CC or equivalent will notify the servicing HARM office when to assign
     FSC ―K.‖ Include justification and provide an information copy to the MAJCOM/A3.
     (EXCEPTION:MAJCOM/A3 notification not required for members returned to flying
     status as a result of an FEB proceeding and not flying due to a lack of support capability.
     Assign FSC ―K ‖ to these members.) The HARM office will publish the AO, with
     explanation remarks, and file the notification memo permanently on the left side of the
     FRF. If required, the OG/CC will submit a revalidation request to the MAJCOM/A3 no
     later than 30 October. Upon receipt, the HARM office will permanently file on the left
     side of the member‘s FRF all letters assigning FSC ―K‖ and all MAJCOM/A3
     revalidation approvals.
  1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned aircrew and
  parachutist members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members‘ flying status and
  parachutist members" jump status with the HARM office. NOTE: This includes all Air
  Force Reserve Command Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to
  active duty units at gaining MAJCOMs.
     1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-
     412,Aircrew Management.
        1.4.2.1.1. Commanders must notify the HARM office when staff or flight surgeon
        flying positions (API 5, 6, 8, B, or D) are double billeted and identify which aircrew

        position, IAW Table 2.1, Note 3. When excess aircrew members are identified,
        HARM offices will contact the applicable commander if notification is not provided.
        Unless AF/A3O-A approves authorization of excess crewmembers, the HARM office
        will inactivate aeronautical orders for those flyers in excess of the unit authorization.
     1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW AFI
     11-402.
     1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms
     notify the base HARM office of all non- flying/non-parachuting TDYs, projected PCS,
     retirement, or separation actions. This requirement can be met by forwarding copies of all

  on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to attend jump
  school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior to
  TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that
  the record was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes
  flying TDY). The FRF/JRF must be reviewed by the member within 30 days after arrival at a
  new permanent duty station. Inactive aircrew members must also turn in the FRF and FEF
  within 10 duty days. If a member does not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, the
  HARM office will suspend aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer
  incentive pay (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP) (via a Military Pay Order
  [MPO]) until receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification. HARM offices will consider
  mailed records as ―turned in‖ and will not suspend incentive pay for these members. HARM
  offices will make every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARM
  offices will ensure FRFs/JRFs are inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 calendar days

          flood) MEGP may be flown on non-passenger carrying aircraft if their duties are
          essential to the maintenance of the aircraft at the recovery base. All steps should be
          taken to pre-deploy these personnel via other means of transportation, if adequate
          time permits.
       1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members to travel in Additional
       Crewmember (ACM) status. ACMs will be defined by MAJCOMs in MAJCOM
       supplements to this instruction. See Paragraph 1.12.2.2for additional guidance.
          1.6.2.6.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
          flown grants ACM status. (EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the
          system, the TACC Senior Controller may approve ACM status. The AMC
          Standardization/Evaluation Chief [AMC/A3V] may approve ACM status for AMC or
          AMC-gained missions for evaluators assigned to HQ AMC.) ACM may only fly on
          aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                           15


  1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders)
  issue written authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform inflight duties on
  the mission. Units will use AF Form 4327,ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form
  4327a,Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander‘s
  (including unit commanders) verbal authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time
  constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authorization. Written confirmation
  of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has
  been signed, changes must be validated by a designated approving authority by placing the
  approving authority"s initials by the line changed. The OG/CC or equivalent commander
  with      operational     control     of    the     mission    is   responsible     for   the
  publication/maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission flown by the aircraft.
  Only commissioned officers and officer equivalent government civilians in active flying
  positions are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight Authorizations. FA
  authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or equivalent
  commander. EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and ANG
  Senior Scout unit commanders with aircrew members but no assigned aircraft, may
  accomplish a FA for assigned aircrew members required to perform aircrew d uties on the
  mission. Commanders must ensure all members listed meet go- no-go criteria prior to
  authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand-alone document and must be attached to the
  aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were required to perform in- flight
  duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew duties on more than one mission,
  a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a minimum, the information in
  blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight authorization. In the Remarks section
  of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA number, date, and unit designation. The
  FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew member‘s duties/flight time logged on the
  AFTO Form 781. EXCEPTION 2:UAS units will complete a preflight authorization signed
  by the aircraft commander to confirm go- no-go checks were completed. The authenticating
  official will issue a verbal order for the mission. The FA will be published upon termination
  of the mission and include crew members who flew on the mission, verbal order
  acknowledged in the remark section, and AC block initialed by the duty scheduler.
     1.8.1.1. Units will validate go- no-go qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in
     aircrew or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in
     command, or FA authenticating official if the pilot in command is not available, will
     validate go-no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
     authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the FA. Validation may include
     ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship
     programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or designated
     representative), or a letter from the member‘s unit validating the individual"s
     qualification to fly on required missions. Note: When preparing flight authorizations for
     missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation resource management specialist or
     designated representative responsible for go-no-go validation will confirm the members‘
     aeronautical order status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and physiological
     training) and qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA
     is an official document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original,
     printed, signed forms with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction
 16                                                AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


      and disposal of the original forms to remove pen/ink changes after the flight
      authenticating official has signed the form and sorties/missions have occurred is not
      authorized.
   1.8.2. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
      1.8.2.1. A designated pilot- in-command, and formation flight leader of each flight or
      flight element.
      1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code ( Table A2.3) of each
      crewmember, operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position
      designation established by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
      1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, mission symbol, and call sign of aircraft or formation.
      1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
      1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
      1.8.2.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103,Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty
      performed incidental to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight
      authorization.
   1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew
   personnel on a memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in- flight duties
   for that mission according to Paragraphs1.10and 3.3of this instruction. Except for ACMs
   and non- interference members, individuals on the flight authorization should match those
   authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
      1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an
      orientation/familiarization flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing
      aircrew duties for that mission) will be listed on the passenger manifest. Passenger
      manifesting is required on all DoD owned and controlled aircraft, IAW DoD 4500.9-
      R,Defense Transportation Regulation, Part 1.
      1.8.3.2. If ACMs are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on
      the flight authorization in the Remarks section only. ACMs will not be listed on the
      AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA credit.
   1.8.4. If a mission is cancelled after the FA is signed, line through the canceled portion(s) of
   the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or maintenance
   cancel).
   1.8.5. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance in this
   section for alert sorties.
1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support
   command operations.
   1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) will ensure each flight is in the direct
   interest of government business and does not exceed flying hour allocations without specific
   approval. Commanders (including unit commanders) will not authorize flights for personal
   convenience or recreation.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                            17


  1.9.3. The transportation of passengers and cargo will be in accordance with DoD 4515.13-
  R. The Deputy Chief of Staff/ Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, Logistics
  Readiness, Headquarters U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF/A4R), develops and publishes passenger
  policy to oversee passenger movement. AFI 24-101,Passenger Movement, provides guidance
  and procedures for arranging official transportation of Air Force personnel. Orientation
  flights may be approved as provided in DoD 4515.13-R and this instruction.

 22   Point-to-point        Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized (Ref, AF/CV (Note 13);
      flights               DoD 4515.13-R, Chapters 3, 4) (Note 1); an exception to SECAF for Line
                            policy must be approved to permit point-to-point flights. 1

 23   Exceptions to       Not listed above                                               AF/CV (Note 13)
      policy/All other
      orientation flights

                1. ―Orientation flights‖ are defined as continuous flights performed within the
                local flying area and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R,
                Chapter 4). ―Note 1 N/A,‖ means the category of flight is not considered an
                orientation flight; however, it is included in the table as a consolidated
                reference source.
                2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and
                approved by SECAF. Retiring members of Congress and retiring
                congressional staff members may be flown on orientation flights only upon
                the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative
                Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.)
                3. When aircraft are ―chopped‖ or assigned to a gaining Combatant
                Commander, approval authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces
                (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations Command (SOC) commander.
                4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.
                5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure
                requirements and political concerns. Foreign government officials are
                equivalent to U.S. Federal government officials and do not include local
                government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other local officials
                who do not represent a foreign government at the national level. Foreign
                military "civilian equivalents" are comparable to DoD "civilian equivalents"
                       a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are
                       satisfied according to AFI 16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and
                       Technology Transfer Program.
                       b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional
                       division (four- letter level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns
                       exist that would prevent the flight. Contact SAF/IAR(_) on the Global
                       address list at saf.iar_@pentagon.af.mil (blank space is for regional
                       division: Europe, Middle East, Pacific, etc.).
                6. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise
                area or supporting flights utilized for logistics purposes only.
                7. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal
                officials, or members of Congress and their staffs.
 22                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


                  8. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs,
                  ensure foreign disclosure requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit
                  authorizations and disclosure of USAF information are satisfied.
                  9. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly.
                  The contractors must be performing work in direct support of the approving
                  command (aircrew training system and aircraft maintenance contractors are
                  the most frequent participants). Normally, the requirement for familiarization
                  flights should be specified in the government contract.
                  10. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible
                  for orientation flights.
                  11. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs,
                  program participants may take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref
                  DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). Parental and/or guardian permission is required
                  and the flight must be approved by SAF/PA. Specific Public Law guidance
                  applies, including Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section 2012, and Title
                  32 USC, Section 508.
                  12. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental
                  approval in writing.
                  13. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command
                  channels according to DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. NOTE:
                  Exception to policy authority delegated from AF/CC to AF/CV IAW AFI 24-
                  101. Send exception to policy requests to AF/A3/5 with an info copy to
                  AF/A3O-AT.
                  14. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave
                  status.
                  15. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not
                  authorized familiarization/orientation or incentive flights without an approved
                  waiver from AF/A3O-AT.
1.10. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Air Force Aircraft.
   1.10.1. To perform inflight or parachutist duties, members must be specifically authorized
   and required for the mission, physically qualified, and current in physiological training when
   required IAW AFI 11-403,Aerospace Physiological Training Program. (Note : See AFI 11-
   202V1 for guidance regarding physiological training requirements if member will be
   removed from flying status within four months following the expiration date of physiological
   training currency.) An aircrew member or parachutist in DNIF status will not perform
   inflight aircrew or parachutist duties. Unit commanders will restrict individuals from
   performing inflight duties in the unit assigned aircraft when such performance may adversely
   impact safety, morale, or mission accomplishment. Commanders (including unit
   commanders) may authorize the following personnel to perform aircrew duties (as part of the
   authorized crew complement IAW AFI 65-503,U.S. Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
   required for the mission according to Paragraph 3.3of this instruction) and operational
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                             23


  support duties (IAW AFI 11-402) on board Air Force aircraft: (NOTE: For guidance
  applicable to parachutist members performing duties in Air Force aircraft, see AFI 11-410.)
     1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical
     rating or aviation badge, are on active AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights,
     and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required
     for the mission. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current
     aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying
     for incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services on
     AOs, are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis, and are
     within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the
     mission. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew
     specialty and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for
     incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers on AOs and required to perform specific inflight
     duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew
     members, and other non-rated members on non- interference AOs ( Paragraphs2.12.3and
     2.12.4) who fly occasionally to perform specific official inflight tasks. Flying solely for
     the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay is not authorized.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew
     duties at Air Force schools.
     1.10.1.5. Professionally qualified civilian employees of the US Government. MAJCOM

     aviation related activities, and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadets are authorized to participate
     in flying duties as observers, in a special training status, on missions as determined by the
     MAJCOM. HARM offices will publish AOs for such cadets or students. Neither flying
     incentive pay nor flying duty credit is authorized, nor will aviation service dates be
     established.
     1.10.1.9. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC cadets
     enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively
     participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on an AF Form 1887,Aeronautical
     Order, authorizing flying status while participating in approved USAFA flying programs.
     Cadets will not be entered into an operational ARMS database, an Aviation Service Code
     (ASC) will not be assigned, and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established.

   1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a
   given mission. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child.
   MAJCOMs are authorized to waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis, only when
   unusual conditions dictate.
1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and
   authorized operational support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that
   controls the aircraft, the members are qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to
   qualification and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these
   missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to
   operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational
   support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel
   of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such duties.
   Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
   be approved.
   1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel
   from line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or
   API G coded positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member‘s HARM office with a letter of
   justification authorizing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force
   aircraft and log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3HARM offices will use this letter as the
   source document to assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1.
   1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize
   orientation flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are
   otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not
   lower than wing commander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving
   authorities will ensure a valid requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate
   authority that controls the non-USAF aircraft. The approving office will clearly indicate to
   the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign government (as applicable) that
   acceptance of an orientation flight does not infer that the USAF/US Government will extend
   a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable) personnel.
   Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
   OFDA requirements.
   1.11.4. USAF Exchange Personnel. See AFI 16-107,International Personnel Exchange
   Program,for additional guidance regarding USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign air
   forces.
1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
   1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification
   in the aircraft. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mission-design-series
   (MDS) occupies a pilot‘s seat with a set of controls, a current and qualified instructor pilot
   will occupy the other seat. EXCEPTIONS:
       1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions
       dictate that these requirements are not practical.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                               25


       1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.

       system officer).
       1.12.1.4. To accommodate established programs (for example, indoctrination and
       orientation programs).
       1.12.1.5. Flight surgeons and MAJCOM-designated Flight Test Engineers who take part
       in flights in dual-controlled aircraft.
   1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified in the specific type aircraft
   being flown occupy any pilot‘s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board the
   aircraft. For general officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC, IAW AF/CV
   msg 091724Z Apr 04. (NOTE: This message specifically precludes unqualified general
   officers from flying in the seat on aircraft deliveries when passengers are on board the
   aircraft.)EXCEPTIONS:
       1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This
       exception allows passengers, who are an integral part of the mission (e.g., Pararescue,
       Rangers, CCT, SEALs, etc.) and when their presence is required by the training syllabus,
       to be on board the aircraft. During such times, a current and qualified instructor pilot will
       occupy the other pilot‘s seat.
       1.12.2.2. In order to accommodate training objectives or mission requirements, pilots
       (including non-current or unqualified pilots) authorized to obtain and maintain
       qualification in a particular MDS aircraft may occupy a pilot‘s seat for purposes of
       conducting training or accomplishing mission requirements when ACMs or MEGP are on
       board the aircraft.
           1.12.2.2.1. During such times, if the pilot is non-current or unqualified, a current and
           qualified instructor pilot will occupy the other pilot‘s seat.
           1.12.2.2.2. Pilots not authorized to obtain or maintain aircraft qualification will not
           occupy a seat with a set of controls with passengers, ACMs, or MEGP on board.
       1.12.2.3. UH-1 helicopters may be operated with a single pilot on passenger-carrying
       missions when operational or command mission requirements dictate that two pilots are
       not practical, and according to the aircraft Dash 1 technical order manual for IMC/VMC
       flight. In addition, the copilot seat may be used for passengers and/or MEGP as defined
       and directed by the MAJCOM. Under no circumstances will a passenger or MEGP be
       given control of the aircraft.

                  AVIATION RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES

Section 2A—Flying Program

2.1. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. The rated officer
and CEA inventory requires close management at all levels to ensure a high state of readiness is
maintained with available resources. The authorized rated inventory includes pilots,
navigators/combat systems operators (CSO) and air battle managers in the grade of lieutenant
colonel and below. To manage these as well as other rated/CEA aircrew positions, API codes are
assigned to identify these positions. NOTE:API codes 1-0 apply to all rated officers, and codes
A-Z apply to CEA personnel (Table 2.1).
   2.1.1. Until the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is modified to maintain API
   effective dates and interface this data to the ARMS database, HARM offices will enter the
   API effective date in ARMS. Upon receipt and validation of MilPDS interface API change,
   enter the effective date of the API change.

2.3. Aviation Service Codes (ASC ). ASCs are two-character codes that indicate incentive pay
entitlement and flying status. The first character of the ASC is the entitlement status code (ESC)
(Table 2.3and Table 2.4) and identifies Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted
Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) entitlement status. The
second character is the Flying Status Code (FSC) and identifies the current flying status. The
second character is numeric when the flier is disqualified or suspended (see Table 2.5) or an
alpha character for qualified individuals (see Table 2.6). Figure 2.1and Figure 2.2indicate ACIP
and CEFIP entitlement status, respectively.

 Z Active-Remote Pilot. Pilot, navigator, or ABM assigned to UAS approved by AF/CC for OFDA
   credit and performing operational UAS duties
      NOTES:
      1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and
      the reason for inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must
      fly in an active status if otherwise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no
      flying support capability exists for these officers, assign an inactive FSC. All rated
      aircrew members assigned to non-flying duties or non-rated flying are restricted from
      active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign support-flying priorities according to paragraph
      2.9. when adequate resources are lacking.
      2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
      3. Do not process non-performance AOs for rated officers after 18 years of aviation
      service or CEAs after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-
      402 flying evaluation board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active
      flying positions who do not fly for extended periods for reasons within their control.
      4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the
      separation or retirement orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable).
      ARC members entering a PAS Code starting with S7 will be assigned FSC P or FSC R
      upon effective date of orders.
      5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position,
      assign FSC D. When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change
      the member's FSC from D to J. When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded
      position to a jump DAFSC (or J prefixed position) only, change the member's FSC to E.
2.4. Aviation Service Code (ASC), and Flying Activity Code (FAC) EffectiveDates.
   2.4.1. Flying or parachuting duties, OFDA credit, and incentive pay start on the ASC
   effective date. Incentive pay terminates the day prior to a suspension, disqualification, or
   termination ASC effective date. Assign the ASC effective date as follows:
      2.4.1.1. Use 1 June 1974 for officers rated before 1 June 1974.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                             41


     2.4.1.2. Use the individual‘s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and
     CEAs entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) or approved local initial
     qualification training (IQT) flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This
     date cannot be prior to member meeting qualification requirements IAW AFI 11-402.
     2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that
     requires an ASC change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend
     formal flying training TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        2.4.1.3.1. Use the day a rated officer or CEA UFT graduate signs in to the
        operational unit at the permanent base following initial qualification training to
        change the FSC from "X" to "A."
        2.4.1.3.2. Use the day after departing the TDY location where initial qualification
        was completed to change FSC "X" to "A" when an officer/CEA UFT graduate
        changed base locations to his or her first operational duty assignment following
        completion of UFT, then later completed initial qualification training at another
        location.
        2.4.1.3.3. Officer/CEA UFT graduates assigned to operational duty after UFT and
        then entered into in- unit or formal training leading to initial qualification in the
        primary aircraft will retain FSC X until completion of training as documented by a
        flight evaluation, AF Form 8,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form
        8a,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). The unit will submit an
        AF Form 4324 or an AF Form 1522 (documenting the basic qualification) to the
        HARM office to publish the AO.
        2.4.1.3.4. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will
        maintain their current ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain
        Lopez, a rated navigator with a current ASC of 1A is selected to attend pilot UFT.
        Captain Lopez has a PCS assignment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT and departs
        Robins AFB on 5 Sep 05. The UFT class-start date is 15 Sep 05. The Laughlin
        HARM office changes Captain Lopez‘s ASC from 1A to 1U effective 15 Sep 05.
        2.4.1.3.5. Use the date an officer/CEA completes an in- unit or formal qualification
        training course (combined UFT/MQT) at the permanent duty station, as documented
        by an AF Form 8/8a evaluation, to publish an AO to change the member‘s FSC from
        ―U‖ to ―X.‖ Publish an AO to the change the member‘s FSC from ―X‖ to ―A‖
        effective one calendar day after the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.4. Use the latest UFT graduation date to publish the ASC change from 1U to 1X
     (rated) or AU to AX (CEA). The UFT HARM office will publish the AO. For CEA UFTs
     without a formal graduation, use the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.5. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating)
     class start date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for
     members initially assigned to an authorized jump ("J" prefix AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX,
     1T2XX, 13DXX, 1T0XX, and 1W0XXC) UMD position. HARM offices may use TDY
     orders or formal training notification to jump school to process initial AO prior to the
     member attending training.
42                                              AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


        2.4.1.5.1. HARM offices will publish AOs for parachutists to attend HALO (High
        Altitude Low Opening) school prior to the member attending school, effective the
        class start date. Member must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and
        AOs must specify the type of pay (HALO). HALO pay will not start until the member
        performs a HALO jump. Once the member performs a HALO jump, HALO pay is
        authorized from effective date of the AO forward (if otherwise qualified). If the
        member does not complete the course, HALO pay terminates on the day the member
        is disenrolled from class. A new AO must be published effective the day after
        disenrollment to reinstate Static Line HDIP (if member returns to previous jump duty)
        or previous ASC held (prior to the class).
        2.4.1.5.2. For members approved to attend a formal jump course prior to an approved
        assignment (PCS or PCA) to a "J" prefixed AFSC or jump inherent DAFSC, the
        HARM office will publish an AO authorizing jump status effective the class start
        date. HARM offices will process an AO assigning ASC 06 effective one day after the
        course completion date. Member"s gaining HARM office will publish an AO
        authorizing active jump status again, once the member is officially assigned to the
        billet.
     2.4.1.6. Use the duty effective date for a change in duty that does not involve PCS but
     requires an ASC change (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). For
     example: Member assigned to an inactive position approved for a Flying Activity Code
     (FAC) waiver to support a contingency or date a commander directs
     suspension/disqualification IAW AFI 11-402.
        2.4.1.6.1. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification or
        requalification course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM
        office will publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A effective on the class start
        date. For inactive aircrew deploying to positions requiring active flying, the HARM
        office will validate the requirement to fly utilizing the member‘s deployment order
        and publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A for the duration of the deployment,
        effective on the member‘s report date or the member‘s training/requalification start
        date, whichever is earlier. All other uses of FAC 6/E must be approved by AF/A3O-A
        (see Table 2.2).
     2.4.1.7. For rated officers/C EAs required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency
     actions officer, combat rescue officer, mission crew commander, RP, IIO, or other duties
     that do not fall under the operational support program, use the effective and termination
     dates of the duty orders to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates upon completion of flying
     duties. Rated or CEA personnel not already receiving ACIP or CEFIP are eligible to
     receive HDIP IAW AFI 11-421 for the duty period (if otherwise qualified); OFDA, ACIP
     and CEFIP are not authorized for these duties. Do not change the ASC for a rated officer
     or CEA. Assign ASC 9C for non-rated/non-CEA members who perform this duty.
     2.4.1.8. Use the effective date of the new API code for a change from inactive flying
     status to active flying status or vice versa.
     2.4.1.9. Rated officers. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 12, 18, 22
     (if applicable), and 25 years of aviation service when passing an OFDA milestone.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                         43


     2.4.1.10. CEAs. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 10, 15, 20, or 25
     years of aviation service, when passing an OFDA milestone.
     2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Publish AOs only for individuals assigned to authorized
     permanent (UMD "J" prefix or DAFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) positions,
     on temporary or permissive jump status, or for USAFA cadets enrolled in approved jump
     programs. Process commander requests to initiate jump status IAW AFI 11-410. Process
     disqualification requests IAW AFI 11-402.
        2.4.1.11.1. The AO effective date will be the date the member is assigned to a
        designated Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position that requires active jump
        status ("J" prefix DAFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI
        11-410 without a PCS change, or the date a member is authorized attachment to
        another US military unit requiring active parachute duty. The HARM office publishes
        AOs, assigning ASC 9E for jump duty only or 9D if the member is assigned to duty
        that requires both aircrew and parachutist qualificatio n IAW AFI 11-401. The AO
        must specify type of jump duty required and pay authorized.
        2.4.1.11.2. For an officer/enlisted member qualified for parachutist service who is
        authorized temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date
        established in the commander‘s request letter and with a termination date not to
        exceed 180 days. For example, a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a ―J‖
        coded UMD position is approved to provide manning assistance on a Joint Readiness
        Exercise from 19 Jul 05 through 23 Sep 05. The HARM office would publish an AO
        effective 19 July 05, with a termination date of 23 Sep 05. AO remarks will reference
        approval letter justification.
        2.4.1.11.3. For an officer/enlisted member authorized permissive jump status IAW
        AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date established in the commander‘s request
        letter; the termination date will not exceed 12 months. Do not change the ASC or
        authorize HDIP.
        2.4.1.11.4. If a parachutist reenlists without a break in service, publish a new AO to
        change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge
        creditable months continue through this period.
        2.4.1.11.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (static/HALO).
        Member must be required to perform HALO duty to be eligible for the HALO
        incentive pay rate. This includes attending HALO school (reference Paragraph
        2.4.1.5.1). If a member is in a HALO-authorized manning position and departs PCS
        to a position that does not require HALO jumping, publish a new AO authorizing
        static jumping/pay only.
        2.4.1.11.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD
        parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and
        1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump
        requirement terminated) at the same duty location.This includes members who retrain
        out of parachutist duties or members who are assigned to a unit that has no available
        jump authorizations (manning in excess of total UMD authorizations).
44                                              AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


        2.4.1.11.7. Use the day after departed last duty station or jump school for members
        who PCS to a base without an available UMD parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC
        or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the
        parachutist from parachute duty and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—
        Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
        2.4.1.11.8. HARM offices will publish AOs for USAFA cadets and other appro ved
        Air Force members participating in jump related duties as part of the USAFA
        Airmanship Program. Use the effective date of entry to the USAFA Airmanship
        Program. The effective period of the AO authorizing parachutist service is limited to
        the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign an aviation service code. Leave
        the ASC section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit nor jump incentive pay
        are authorized.
     2.4.1.12. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew me mbers. The effective
     period of an AO authorizing aviation service as a non-rated aircrew member is limited by
     the member‘s duty availability. The member must be assigned to an aircrew-prefixed
     manpower position on the UMD. For members initially beginning aviation status, the AO
     effective date is the date the member is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a
     formal school where in- flight duties (not observation) are part of the course curriculum.
     Example: On 1 Jun 05, a member reported to the base for aircrew duty. On 15 Jun 05, the
     commander certified eligibility and assigned the member to an aircrew-prefixed
     manpower position on the UMD. On 1 Jul 05, the member commenced TDY to begin
     formal flying training. The initial AO effective date is 1 July 05. For in-unit initial
     training, the AO is effective when formal in- flight flying training begins after being
     assigned to an authorized aircrew position within a unit. For example: On 1 May 05, a
     member reported to a base for aircrew duty. On 15 May 05, the commander certified
     eligibility, assigned the member to the appropriate UMD aircrew prefixed DAFSC, and
     notified the HARM office of in- flight training start date. On 20 May 05, the member
     began formal in-unit flying training. The AO effective date is 20 May 05; however, the
     initial training must lead toward initial qualification.
        2.4.1.12.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA inactive aircrew members assigned to
        an active flying position at the gaining unit, HARM offices will assign ASC 9D
        (Active Non-rated Aircrew Member) effective one day after member departed last
        duty station, providing the member is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an
        authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" UMD DAFSC position, not
        occupied by another active flyer. If there was no PCS involved, use the effective date
        of duty (if otherwise qualified). See AFI 11-402 for limitations on exceeding UMD
        manpower authorizations for non-rated/non-CEA aircrew positions.
        2.4.1.12.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer
        assigned to an authorized aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" prefixed UMD manpower position
        to terminate aviation service and assign ASC 9J (Inactive-Restricted). This paragraph
        also applies to members approved for retraining.
        2.4.1.12.3. If a non-rated aircrew member reenlists without a break in service,
        publish a new AO to change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified,
        incentive pay and badge creditable months continue through this period.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                               45


       2.4.1.13. Ope rational Support Membe rs. IAW AFI 11-402, use the effective date
       when man- months are authorized, not to exceed a one- month period.
2.5. Ope rational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under
competent orders while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the
performance of assigned duties. The Aviation CareerIncentive Act of 1974,theAviation Career
Improvement Act of 1989,and the FY 1996National Defense Authorization Actestablished
months of operational flying duty accumulation (OFDA) required for entitlement to continuous
monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation service. Current legal authority is established
in the US Code. Table 2.7 shows OFDA requirements for each of the establishing acts.

2.6. Transition Status Codes (TSC). Transition Status Codes were established to track the
OFDA requirements for rated officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the
Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,and the FY 1996National Defense Authorization Act.

       1. Aircrew members assigned TSC "D" or "E" are gra ndfathered under the ACIA of
       1974.
       2. Aircrew members assigned TSC "A" require 96 months OFDA at 12 years to receive
       continuous pay until 18 years, and 120 or 144 months OFDA at 18 years to receive
       continuous ACIP until 22 years or 25 years respectively.
       3. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
       accumulated at least 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC "C".
              Example A. If a member in this status accumulated 72-107 months OFDA as of 1
              Oct 1991, he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 18 years.

                Example B. If the member accumulated 108-131 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991,
                he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 22 years.
                Example C. If the member accumulated at least 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct
                1991, he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 25 years.
                Example D. Members assigned TSC "C" with less than 132 months OFDA as of 1
                Oct 1991, were reviewed again at 18 years to determine appropriate incentive pay
                action.
      4. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
      accumulated less than 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, were assigned TSC "B."
                Example A. Members assigned TSC "B," with an ASD of 2 Oct 1979 – 9 Feb
                1984 inclusive, require 108 months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive
                continuous ACIP until 18 years.
                Example B. Members assigned TSC ―B,‖ with an ASD of 10 Feb 1984 or after,
                require 96 months OFDA at the 12- year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18
                years.
                Example C. Members assigned TSC ―B‖ who did not meet the 12-year
                requirement, but accumulated at least 72 months OFDA at the 12- year point, were
                assigned ASC ―5Y‖ and were reviewed again at the 15-year point.

2.7. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the
award of operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active
operational fliers (FSC A) who fail to perform flying duties to a temporary status, FSC S
(Inactive-Nonperformance) effective the first day of the fourth month of inactivity. FSC S will
remain valid until: the member accomplishes an OFDA-creditable flight; is disqualified for
Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non- flying duty. Active rated officers and CEAs
recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical availability date and code. When
the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for 30 days, ARMS automatically
reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Management System
interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.) An AO change is not necessary.
Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S applies.
   2.7.1. As defined by public law, operational flying duty is flying performed under competent
   orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying
   skills are normally maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the
   Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of
   an aeronautical rating or designation. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as a
   minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the following
   indicates the need to fly:
         2.7.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
         2.7.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
         2.7.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances
         dictate.
   2.7.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members, other
   than flight surgeons and UFT students, is based upon the Aviation Career Incentive Act of
   1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, the FY 96 National Defense
   Authorization Act(NDAA), and the FY 99 NDAA. These acts established the criteria to
   determine eligibility for ACIP. The requirement to track flight activity of CEAs is based
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                           49


  upon the FY 00 NDAA. Title 37 US Code, Chapter 5, Article 301a provides current public
  law guidance on ACIP and OFDA requirements.
     2.7.2.1. The 1974 Act set standards of minimum experience necessary to receive ACIP:
     at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed p rior to the 12th year of
     aviation service and 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 18th year of
     aviation service. Individuals meeting these requirements were, if otherwise qualified
     (medically and physiologically [if applicable]), entitled to co ntinuous ACIP until the
     22nd year of officer service (using an individual‘s OSD), without meeting a specific
     flying performance standard. Members who completed at least 132 months (11 years) of
     operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service received, if otherwise qualified,
     continuous entitlement to ACIP until the 25th year of officer service. Those who failed to
     meet the standards were conditionally entitled to ACIP only through a minimum
     performance standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC
     members) while assigned to operational flying duties. In addition, rated officers with over
     25 years of officer service (grade O-6 and below) and assigned to operational flying
     positions were eligible to receive conditional ACIP.
     2.7.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve
     for ACIP entitlement. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 108
     months (9 years), 120 months (10 years), and 144 months (12 years) from the previous
     requirements of 72 months (6 years), 108 months (9 years), and 132 months (11 years).
     The effective date for the new criteria was 1 October 1991. On 1 October 1991, the
     USAF began transition to the new requirement structure and rated members were
     assigned Transition Status Codes (TSC) in order to determine OFDA requirements. Rated
     officers with ASDs of 1 October 1985 and later were required to meet the 9, 10, and 12-
     year OFDA requirements under the ACIA of 1989.
     2.7.2.3. The FY 96 NDAA modified the requirements rated officers must achieve for
     ACIP entitlement established by the 1989 Act. The new law established revised OFDA
     requirements for rated members who completed, or would complete, 12 years of aviation
     service on or after 10 Feb 1996. Rated members assigned TSC A must have accumulated
     8 years or more of OFDA months within their first 12 years of aviation service to qualify
     for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
     completed 12 or more years of aviation service prior to 10 Feb 1996 must have
     accumulated at least 9 years of OFDA within their first 12 years of aviation service to
     qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
     did not meet the applicable standard for entitlement to continuous ACIP remained
     entitled to conditional ACIP contingent upon meeting the monthly flying hour
     requirement.
     2.7.2.4. The FY 99 NDAA changed the way ACIP entitlement was computed for all
     rated officers. Previously, eligibility determination was based on the anniversary of the
     Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99 NDAA changed eligibility determination to the
     anniversary of the ASD. This change did not apply to those aviators who had passed 22
     or 25 years of OSD and had ACIP terminated under the ACIA of 1974.
     2.7.2.5. The FY 00 NDAA set minimum experience levels required for CEAs to receive
     continuous CEFIP: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to
50                                              AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


     the 10year of aviation service, 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 15year of
     aviation service, and 168 months (14 years) completed by the 20year of aviation service.
     CEAs who meet these requirements and are medically, professionally and, if required,
     physiologically qualified, are entitled to continuous CEFIP until their 25year of aviation
     service and without regard to a specific flying performance standard. Members who fail
     to meet standards for entitlement to continuous CEFIP are entitled to conditional CEFIP
     if they are assigned to active operational flying duties and perform aircrew duties an
     average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) until they reach their next
     aviation service requirement point.
  2.7.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
     2.7.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid
     flying duties which are authorized OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three
     months.
     2.7.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in- flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A,
     U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit from
     the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members assigned to
     an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should sign out from
     the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA credit for that
     month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three months of
     the departure month.
     2.7.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of
     aviation service for career enlisted aviators. NOTE: If required, members may
     accumulate badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18or
     20year of aviation service. See AFI 11-402.
     2.7.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or returning to such duty
     from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the
     date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of
     that date, the HARM office will retroactively change the active FSC to FSC S, effective
     the day following the date of initial assignment of the active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit
     which began accruing with assignment of the original active FSC and terminate
     entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying begins, effective two
     months before the date of the first flight. OFDA credit resumes from that date.
     EXAMPLE: Captain Wiggins is assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17
     April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to FSC S, effective 20 December.
     Captain Wiggins accumulated three months OFDA credit for January, February, and
     March. (Do not credit December because Capt Wiggins was assigned an active FSC for
     less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action deducts the three months credited
     and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17
     February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit. Do not award OFDA credit for
     February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit for March and April. Credit
     continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform for a period greater than
     three months.
     2.7.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated)
     and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                                51


       following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to "S"
       effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties
       were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to "A" again effective the
       date of the member‘s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit.
       EXAMPLE: Lt Ostrowski flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The
       HARM office assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and
       August. The HARM office changes the FSC back to "A" on 18 November. There is no
       OFDA credit for November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15
       days during that month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.
2.8. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are
established by public law: Title 37, U.S. Code, Chapter 5. IAW AFI 36-2110,Assignments, it is
Air Force policy that as many rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months)
of operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the
requirements to receive ACIP through 25 years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy
is to manage CEAs to complete at least 9 years (108 months) of operational flying by the 15year
of aviation service; not all CEAs will fulfill the requirements to receive CEFIP through 25 years
of aviation service. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 and FY 00 NDAA authorized
the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and
CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their control. Each
year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and
SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for CMSgts
(and selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the
following procedures apply:
   2.8.1. Rated officers assigned TSCs A, B, C, and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waivers.
   Because TSC D and E rated officers were grandfathered to the pre-ACIA of 1989 OFDA
   requirements, they are not eligible for waivers. Candidate rated officers must have at least 72
   months (6 years) of OFDA credit to apply for a waiver. CEAs must accomplish at least 60
   months (5 years) of operational flying during the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96
   months (8 years) of operational flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service to
   apply for a waiver. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the minimum number of
   months shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration. By direction of the SECAF,
   third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation
   service when OFDA requirements have not been met, will not be considered.
       2.8.1.1. When retroactive waivers are approved by SECAF for rated officers who obtain
       72 months of OFDA credit after the 12th of aviation service, members will be authorized
       continuous entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months
       credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting
       qualification requirements.)EXAMPLE: Major Farrell reached his 12th year of aviation
       service on 18 January 04 and had accumulated 60 months of OFDA credit, 36 months
       short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement
       status. Effective 17 January 05 he accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a
       waiver of his 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved a 24- month OFDA
       waiver on 15 June 05 and Major Farrell‘s HARM office was d irected to publish an AO
       changing Major Farrell‘s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17
       January 05.NOTE:CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.

     2.8.1.2. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if
     otherwise qualified).
     2.8.1.3. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to
     the first office in the member‘s MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise
     qualified). See also Paragraph 2.8.9.
  2.8.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the
  member failed to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Exa mples
  include, but are not limited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers
  assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who
  cannot be placed into another flying position prior to completion of 120 mont hs of OFDA
  credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to non- flying duties necessary to
  comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty schools/follow-on
  tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets to perform
  UAS sensor operator duties.
     2.8.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments
     merit OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible
     for rated officers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such
     assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate
     documentation in the member‘s personnel record. Documentation will include reasons
     why the member was assigned to a non- flying position (see Paragraph 2.8.7).
  2.8.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA
  waivers.
  2.8.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (inactive--lack of support) do
  not meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing
  draw down or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual‘s specialty was not required
  (i.e., an F-4 navigator assigned to a unit converting to single-place fighters), or when the unit
  aircraft was operationally grounded (Paragraph 1.3.2). Individuals must meet both K code
  and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be considered for a waiver.
  2.8.5. Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second OFDA waiver.
  2.8.6. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non-
  flying position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not
  eligible for OFDA waivers (except as provided for in paragraph 2.8.2.1). When an
  individual declines an opportunity to fly and is selected for a non-flying assignment,
  document this action in the member‘s personnel record, as specified in Paragraph 2.8.7.
  Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
  2.8.7. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document
  that the above situations existed at the time of assignment to establish an audit trail.
  (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K criteria.) This may then be used to verify why
  OFDA waiver candidates were unable to accomplish OFDA requirements.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                           53


  2.8.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant
  Colonels and below and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to
  HQ AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted,
  MAJCOM commanders may deny requests.
  2.8.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the year
  prior to loss of flight pay. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM. For members
  assigned to Headquarters, USAF, submit waivers through the individual‘s supervisory chain
  of command (A1, A3, A4, etc.), then to A3O-AT, DPO, or DPE; submit waivers for Colonels
  to AF/CVA prior to routing to AF/DPO. For members not assigned to an Air Force
  MAJCOM (i.e. members assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or
  USSTRATCOM), individuals will submit packages to their servicing Air Force HARM
  office, which will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM office‘s chain of
  command. As a minimum, the submission will include the member‘s dated request letter,
  Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military Personnel Data System
  duty history (SURF), and any other documents to support justification. MAJCOMs will
  coordinate with AFPC to ensure support for packages when waivers are based on assignment
  actions. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must also contain MAJCOM/CC
  (or equivalent) indorsement. It is the responsibility of the member submitting the OFDA
  waiver request to establish adequate justification for waiver consideration.
     2.8.9.1. HARM offices will review the package for accuracy and validate eligibility
     criteria IAW this instruction. Review ARMS data/member‘s FRF to validate TSC code.
     Do not forward OFDA waiver request packages for members with TSC D or E. See also
     Paragraph 2.8.1.
     2.8.9.2. Commanders ensure eligible members submit waiver packages within the year
     prior to the applicable aviation service point for which the member requests an OFDA
     waiver.
         2.8.9.2.1. If a rated officer requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the
         package during: (a) the 11th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 12- year
         requirement or (b) the 17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 18 year/120-
         month requirement.
         2.8.9.2.2. If a CEA requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the package
         during: (a) the 9th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 10-year requirement or
         (b) the 14th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 15 year/108- month
         requirement.
  2.8.10. Eligibility criteria for Air Battle Manager OFDA waive rs. In order to be
  considered, an ABM must meet all of the following criteria.
     2.8.10.1. In addition to using existing criteria in rated directives, an ABM must be
     eligible for Aviation Career Incentive Pay as specified in AF/A3/5 message dated 2 Oct
     99 (Subj: Rating Air Battle Managers), and have an established Aviation Service Date.
     2.8.10.2. Must comply with provisions of Paragraph2.8above.
     2.8.10.3. The following ABM duties that commenced after the establishment of the ASD
     may count toward an OFDA waiver on a month-to-month equivalent (not to exceed the
 54                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


       minimum OFDA requirement at the applicable aviation service point) if the member was
       assigned and performed primary duties as a combat mission ready/basic mission capable
       crewmember at a Ground Theater Air Control System or Air Defense unit with an
       assigned operational wartime mission (Designed Operational Capability), was formally
       attached to one of these line units and counted toward its SORTS rating, or performed
       formal course instructor duties at undergraduate air battle manager training. Crewmember
       positions include: Air Weapons Officer/Director, Senior Director, Air Surveillance
       Officer, Interface Control Officer, or Mission Crew Commander.
       2.8.10.4. After the ASD and prior to 1 Oct 99, an ABM on aviation orders and receiving
       Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay may credit the entire month toward OFDA requirements if
       the individual performed ABM primary operational flying duty at least one day within
       that same month (not to exceed the minimum OFDA requirement at the applicable
       aviation service point).
   2.8.11. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria.
   AF/A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all
   offices concur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to
   SECAF for consideration of an OFDA waiver. Packages that do not meet eligibility criteria
   will be returned to the MAJCOM. Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months
   required.
   2.8.12. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is
   considered for a waiver.
       2.8.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (A3) and
       Personnel Staff (A1) to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and laws.
       MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC/AFCMO to ensure support for packages when
       waivers are based on assignment actions. Each submission must include the items
       specified in Paragraph2.8.9, above.
       2.8.12.2. Prior to MAJCOM/CC approval, MAJCOMs may send OFDA waiver packages
       to AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for an informal review. MAJCOMs will provide
       the initial review function. If the package needs revision, MAJCOMs will accomplish this
       prior to submission to HAF agencies. If requested, AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE
       will provide a recommendation to the submitting MAJCOM staff with an assessment of
       the validity of each case.
   2.8.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA
   waiver packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to
   AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for processing and final action.
2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active
rated flying to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills. If certain
SECAF approved mission requirements are more than the number of such officers locally
assigned, a minimum number of other qualified members of the authorized rated inventory may
also be assigned rated aircrew duties.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.9.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              55


       2.9.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.9.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
       2.9.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3
       or 4, or non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the
       most recent aviation service date, if:
          2.9.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12
          months at short tour bases).
          2.9.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission
          specifically designated by HQ USAF.
       2.9.1.5. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties while on leave, permissive TDY,
       non- flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their
       official aircrew duties.
   2.9.2. Special Circumstances.
       2.9.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary (365 days or less) operational
       flying that is not IAW Paragraph2.9.1, AF/A3O-A may approve exceptions on an
       individual case basis (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2
       2.9.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in- flight
       non-rated or non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8.
       For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J,
       and include in the remarks section of AO: "Rated Officer assigned to perform in- flight
       non-rated (or non-crew) duties." Officers performing non-rated duties will log aircrew
       certification code "Z" on the AFTO Form 781; flight time does not count towards OFDA
       or ACIP entitlement.
   2.9.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction
   course of 180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members.
   2.9.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated
   positions (API 3 or API 4).
       2.9.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TS (with copies
       to AF/REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
       2.9.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a
       copy to AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
2.10. Flight Surgeon Flying Policy.
   2.10.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified,
   physiologically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive
   conditional ACIP, active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower
   document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C
   with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the
   aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14- R, Volume 7a,Military Pay Policy and Procedures - Active
   Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers and qualify for entitlement to
 56                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


   conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational flying hours per
   month.
      2.10.1.1. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API coded ―0‖ position, the HARM
      office will terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Inactive flight
      surgeons may be authorized to fly and log time without ACIP on a noninterference basis
      with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons not qualified in an aircraft, on
      inactive AOs, will log only ―Other‖ flight time and include remarks on the reverse side of
      AFTO Form 781 (for example, ―Inactive flight surgeon,‖ or ―Flight surgeon not qualified
      in aircraft‖).Paragraph 2.16.3through 2.16.5apply.
   2.10.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an
   API 5 flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a
   pilot-physician or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405. Pilot-physicians/navigator-
   physicians assigned to active flying positions (API 1/2) fly as line pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5
   authorizes exceptions upon request, based on justification provided by the Surgeon General
   (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot or navigator ratings are entitled to conditional
   ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when members are assigned to API 1/2
   positions.
   2.10.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405,The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes
   procedures for the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain
   conditional fliers for ACIP entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above,
   active flying pilot-physicians will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC
   48VX. Retain members in ASC 8 beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time
   logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings (only when member is
   assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
   2.10.4. Critical Care Air Trans port Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive
   flight surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
      2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are
      authorized to log crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions
      based on their aircraft qualification.
      2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to
      perform CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary
      time on these missions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are
      onboard. When authorized, the member"s HARM office will process the operational
      support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform
      CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized." The
      member"s ASC remains ASC 8J.
2.11. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
   2.11.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
      2.11.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying
      training instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales
      (FMS), etc.
      2.11.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              57


     2.11.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
     2.11.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or
     below coded API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the
     basis of the most recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall
     short of meeting OFDA credit.
  2.11.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic
  instruction course of 90 days or more.
  2.11.3. Crewmembers will not perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-
  flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perfo rm their official
  aircrew duties.
  2.11.4. If special circumstances require active temporary (365 days or less) flying that is not
  IAW Paragraph2.11.1, AF/A3O-A may approve exceptions on an individual case basis
  (FAC E waiver).
2.12. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircre w Members and Non-CEA
Enlisted Aircre w Membe rs.
  2.12.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified
  personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated aircrew members are included
  onboard aircraft when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary
  tasked mission. This is their full- time duty. When a full-time presence is not required,
  operational support flying may be applicable (see Paragraph 2.12.2). Non-rated aircrew
  members will maintain flying class III physicals.
     2.12.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic
     Aircrew), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
     2.12.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an
     AFSC prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F
     (Flight Test), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
         2.12.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned
         to an authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C
         prefix) or a Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not
         remove the authorization to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the
         individual‘s AO: ―Member occupies an X (or J) prefix UMD position.‖
         2.12.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement
         to incentive pay.
  2.12.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to
  perform essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-
  rated aircrew members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties
  on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full-time duties do not require them to be
  onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly
  terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Authorized man- months are required prior to
  issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational support flying IAW AFI 11-402.
 58                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


   2.12.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams
   (DAFSC 4M0X1), and non-aircrew aeromedical technicians (DAFSCs 42GX and 4N0XXs)
   are authorized to participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference basis.
   HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives.
   Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Personnel who provide high
   altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
   Paragraph 2.16.3through 2.16.5apply. Personnel who fly in support of high altitude airdrop
   missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
   2.12.4. Other non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g.,
   administrative duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for
   classified documents, crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination
   or points enroute and other duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11-402)
   may have AOs published according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Individuals
   in these categories will fly on a non- interference basis. Neither flying incentive pay nor
   OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraph2.16.3and 2.16.5apply.
       2.12.4.1. Members who fly on non- interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO
       Form 781 (see Paragraph 1.6.2.2), except for those members specified in Paragraph
       3.3.1.5.2
       2.12.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
       flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or
       irregular basis (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and
       supervisory personnel) may do so under the guidelines of Paragraph 1.6. Non-aircrew
       members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time IAW
       Paragraph 3.3.1.5.2.
   2.12.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly
   under orientation flight guidelines of Paragraph 1.9.4.7.
   2.12.6. Performance of flying duties is not authorized while on leave, permissive TDY, non-
   flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless individuals are required to
   perform their official aircrew duties.
   2.12.7. UAS sensor operators are authorized to participate in UAS aircraft flights as non-
   aircrew members. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and
   MAJCOM directives authorizing the performance of sensor operator duties. Neither HDIP
   entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor
   operator positions may log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3.1.5.3.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.13. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated
officers and CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively
fly.
2.14. Supervisory Flying.
   2.14.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate
   rated staff officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                             59


   operations of the organization. Although occasional indoctrination flights normally maintain
   inactive rated staff officers and career enlisted aviators at an acceptable level of experience
   for their jobs, it is Air Force policy that key supervisors must actively maintain their basic
   flying skills to provide them with expert awareness of the unit mission.
   2.14.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
   aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position. When PMAI resources are not
   available or not practical to use, and maintenance of flying skills is mandatory, perform
   supervisory flying in the most cost-effective aircraft available.
   2.14.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA
   supervisory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate API 6, 8, B, or
   D positions only when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating
   authorities are:
       2.14.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational
       flying positions. Revisions to general officer operational flying positions require the
       Chief of Staff"s approval. MAJCOMs are not authorized to make adjustments without the
       Chief of Staff‘s approval. MAJCOMs desiring to upgrade indoctrination fliers to
       operational status must submit a request for a change of status to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will
       coordinate changes with AF/DPG. All requests for general officer operational flying

1. Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes expeditionary flying
wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
2. Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained on file in
AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer operational
flying positions.
       2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by
       forwarding AF Form 480,Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for
       review and approval (see AFI 38-201,Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel
       flying positions will be limited to individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying
       operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness
       inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there may be
       justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.

       2.14.3.3. Lieute nant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below
       rated officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the
       position requires an AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally,
       API 8/D positions (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety, inspector
       general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a requirement
       associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an aircrew member
       to fly while in inactive status; see Paragraph 2.17.
2.15. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API
6, 8, B, and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of
support) and when adequate support will not be available within six months. Where practical,
convert such positions to API 3, 4, C or E.
2.16. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to
perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example,
to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effective ness, take part in a
flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system
and procedure) may be authorized indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
   2.16.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA
   positions for indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of
   mission equipment or procedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request
   to fly. Take a conservative approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or
   MAJCOM equivalents) will establish procedures for approval of indoctrination flying in
   accordance with Table 2.11. Limit incumbents to 24 flying days per fiscal year. MAJCOMs
   will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
   2.16.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to
   support indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be
   delegated, but not lower than MAJCOM level.
   2.16.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on
   emergency procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be
   physically and, where required, physiologically qualified.
   2.16.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or
   incentive pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T.
   MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact unit training, and will not
   increase command flying hour allocations.
   2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not
   authorized. Individuals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights
   in single-place aircraft are specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the
   AFTO Form 781,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Documentusing Other flight time, IAW
   Paragraph 3.4.5
   2.16.6. (Added) MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to
   active operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.

Section 2C—Flight Management Administration

2.17. Host Aviation Resource Management Office. The host command of the Air Force base
designates within the operations group a HARM office function to be the base OPR for ARMS
and for FRF/JRF management of all aircrew/parachutists on base or in the locale (regardless of
MAJCOM). (EXCEPTION: For ANG units not associated with active duty units, the ANG
Wing/GSU Commander will appoint an ANG HARM office for management of ANG flight
records.) The Wing/Group HARM Chief will be the senior or most qualified person, with a
primary AFSC of 1C072, 1C092, 1C000, or civilian equivalent. The individual appointed to this
position will have a minimum of three years experience in the Aviation Resource Management
career field, and obtained/maintained Special Experience Identifier (066). (Waiver requests to
these qualification requirements must be submitted to the MAJCOM functional manager with
documentation of member‘s qualification [copy of 1C0X2 training record documenting AO task
certification], and expected get well date.) HARM offices will be manned according to Air Force
Manpower Standard (AFMS) 13C1, OFPP Policy Letter 92-1, and the Defense Reform Initiative
Directive (DRID) 20. (EXCEPTION: Air National Guard Wing/Group HARM offices will be
manned IAW NGB/OL manpower standards for specific MDS or mission.) HARM positions are
inherently governmental and only qualified 1C0X2 personnel (and government equivalent) will
operate ARMS for the purpose of processing aviation/parachutist service entitlement actions, or
monitoring and validating entitlement to flight/parachutist incentive pay.
   2.17.1. Prepare AOs according to Attachment 3of this instruction and AFI 11-402.
64                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010

  Parachute Operations, AFI 11-421,Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 33-3,Information
  Management, and AFMAN 37-123,Management of Records, and dispose of records in
  accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located
  athttps://afrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs at the HARM office nearest to where
  the aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possible, medical records.
  (EXCEPTION: All inactive IMA FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by AFRC/RMG.) To
  ensure proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent interruptions in the
  MilPDS to ARMS interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods of less
  than 90 days. For formal courses where the member will accomplish flight/jump activity,
  provide to the TDY unit a TDY/Formal Flying Processing Checklist and ARMS training
  products IAW AFI 11-421. If the member‘s personnel and finance records are maintained at
  different locations, the HARM office located nearest to where the finance records are
  maintained will manage the member‘s FRF. With the concurrence of both HARM offices
  (and MAJCOMs if different), and with MOAs in place, FRFs of attached flyers may be kept
  at the attached HARM office. Request exceptions to this policy from AF/A3O-AT.
  2.17.3. Obtain medical information from the FME. The FME will provide the initial
  notification to the HARM office when required periodic physical examinations are
  completed, or when there are changes to an individual‘s medical status that affect flying duty.
  Suspense is one duty day.
     2.17.3.1. DELETED
     2.17.3.2. The FME will send completed medical examination results (AF Form
     1042,Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty) to the HARM
     office within 10 duty-days. If the medical examination is incomplete due to reasons
     beyond the member"s control, the appropriate medical waiver authority may extend
     certification to cover administrative processing. The FME will inform the HARM office
     via AF Form 1042 if the applicable waiver authority extends an aircrew member‘s
     medical certification. The official date of the AF Form 1042 will be the date of the flight
     surgeon‘s signature. See also AFI 11-402.
  2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member‘s finance office. The
  HARM office will ensure receipt of documentation required to validate accurate flight/jump
  pay entitlement, to include verification that the member is receiving the correct rate of
  incentive pay.
  2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member‘s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF
  to obtain a UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member‘s current assignment data. As a
  minimum, validate DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning position numbers, and
  active Guard/Reserve duty (AGR) or non- EAD status for ARC personnel.
  2.17.6. Monitor and ensure the proper FAC and ASC are assigned for all assigned and
  attached fliers.
  2.17.7. Ensure Special Category Codes are updated in ARMS according to Table 2.13when
  an aircrew member‘s status changes to one of the categories listed below.

Section 3A—Records Maintenance

3.1. Flight and Jump Records and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS)
Functional Responsibility. The individual flight or jump record folder is the official source for
determining incentive pay entitlement, current flying or jump status, and total experience.
HARM offices will enter aviation resource data into the ARMS database and maintain
FRFs/JRFs IAW Paragraph 2.17.2of this instruction. Dispose of Air Force records in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS),located
athttps://afrims.amc.af.mil, and this instruction.
   3.1.1. Use these records as the basis for USAF flying resource inventory reporting (RCS:
   HAF-A3O[M&AR]0701). This report provides essential individual flying information to HQ
   USAF and MAJCOMs. HARM offices ensure the report is transmitted not later than the 10th
   of each month (or as soon as possible for special reports). Continue to report during
   emergency conditions, precedence delayed (Emergency Status Code C-3). Continue
   reporting during MINIMIZE.
   3.1.2. The HARM office is the sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/A3OT) at each
   flying base for entitlement to and the initiation and termination of Aviation Career Incentive
   Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive
   Pay (HDIP) for flying and parachute duties. The HARM office interprets public law as it
   pertains to flying/jumping incentive pays; audits, reconciles, and processes associated waiver
   requests; is the single point of contact for ARMS; and is responsible for the following
   procedures:
       3.1.2.1. The HARM office, maintains FRFs/JRFs for all flying (active and inactive) and
       jump personnel with the assigned HARM code established for that base. The ARMS
       program manager will allocate one ARMS database code per base. (EXCEPTION : The
       ARMS program manager may allocate more than one ARMS database code for
       installations granted an exception IAW Paragraph 2.17of this instruction.) The HARM
       office must be located in a securable area to ensure integrity of Privacy Act material
       when office personnel are not present.
           3.1.2.1.1. Base HARM offices keep the FRFs/JRFs for all assigned tenant and
           attached personnel ordered to take part in regular and frequent flights as aircrew,
           operational support members, and parachutists. This includes all active duty and ARC
           active and inactive aircrew members, active operational support members, and
           parachutists.
           3.1.2.1.2. Base HARM offices will combine the FRF and JRF into one folder for dual
           qualified aircrew and parachutist members. File documents IAW AFI 11-421.
           3.1.2.1.3. Base HARM offices will maintain FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or
           parachutists (entitlement status 0) for eight years after such designation. After eight
           consecutive years, return the FRF/JRF to the member. (EXCEPTION:for UFT
           students disqualified from training and operational support fliers removed from flying

         for more than one year, release the FRF to the member and comply with out-
         processing guidance in AFI 11-421.)
  3.1.3. Initiate a Military Pay Order (MPO) (except for non-USAF members) NLT 5 work
  days when:
     3.1.3.1. An aircrew/parachutist member initially meets or fa ils to meet flight/jump
     entitlement requirements for pay.
     3.1.3.2. An aircrew/parachutist member satisfies flight/jump entitlement requirements
     for pay following a period of failure to meet minimum requirements (or a period of
     suspension disqualification has been removed), or a member otherwise regains
     entitlement to incentive pay.
     3.1.3.3. An individual in conditional entitlement status (ESC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, E, F, G, or H)
     departs PCS to a non- flying or non-jump position.
     3.1.3.4. A parachutist enters into a 12- month Rule 3 waiver period IAW DODFMR and
     AFI 11-421,Aviation Resource Management. The HARM office will terminate pay until
     jump requirements are met.
  3.1.4. Release the FRF to individual custody only after the HARM office receives:
     3.1.4.1. Official PCS orders or TDY orders indicating a TDY with another USAF
     activity for a period of 90 days or more (ref. Paragraph 1.5.4). (Units have the option to
     transfer records to the gaining HARM office for TDYs.)
     3.1.4.2. Official retirement or separation orders.

     3.1.5.1. Information maintained in the FRF/JRF is subject to the provisions of the
     Privacy Act of 1974. HARM offices have a legal obligation to safeguard these records
     from unlawful disclosure. Standard ARMS reports or ad hoc queries which contain
     personal data will have the symbol "(PA)" in the product title and contain the statement
     "Personal Data - Privacy Act of 1974."
     3.1.5.2. The disclosure of information, for any purpose, to other than those AF activities
     with an official need, is not authorized without the expressed written consent of the
     member concerned.
     3.1.5.3. Except where allowed by law, do not disclose data to agencies outside the
     Department of Defense. Reference AFI 33-332,Privacy Act Program.Maintain a record
     of each disclosure to include name and address of the person or agency receiving the
     data, date, nature and purpose of each disclosure.
         3.1.5.3.1. Retain a copy of the disclosure on file as part of the FRF/JRF. Prior to
         releasing the FRF/JRF, the HARM office will remove all records disclosures. Retain
         the disclosure accounting on file for five years or for the life of the record, whichever
         is longer.

       3.1.5.4. The Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 requires that before a civilian
       airline hires a pilot, the air carrier must request and receive certain records from "any
       carrier or other persons that have employed the individual at any time during the
       preceding five years." Before any information is released to an agency based on this Act,
       HARM offices must receive a written release of information statement signed by the
       applicant via the agency or applicant. This statement confirms the applicant agrees to the
       release of records to the air carrier. The HARM office will not release any information
       without receipt of this signed statement. HARM offices must release information within
       30 days of receipt of the request. Additionally, the releaser must provide notice to the
       applicant that a release request has been received and inform the applicant of his or her
       right to receive a copy of the records. The HARM office will provide the Individual
       Flight Record (IFR), Flying History Report (FHR), and documents contained in the
       member‘s Flying Evaluation Folder (FEF) for the preceding five years from the date of
       employment application of the member. If the member‘s FEF is maintained in another
       location, the HARM office must obtain and provide copies to the requesting agency.
   3.1.6. The FRFs/JRFs of personnel assigned or attached to other than USAF activities must
   be kept at a designated HARM office. The following guidance applies:
       3.1.6.1. The parent command will designate a HARM office to maintain FRFs/JRFs for
       individual aircrew members or parachutists on duty with other US military services.
       3.1.6.2. The MAJCOM with geographical cognizance over the area or country to which
       the individual is assigned or attached for duty with an allied service or on duty with non-
       US military agencies will designate a HARM office to maintain the FRF/JRF.
       3.1.6.3. If the individual‘s FRF/JRF is required at the crewmember‘s or parachutist‘s
       duty station, provide a duplicate copy. The master record will be kept at the HARM
       office designated by the MAJCOM.
       3.1.6.4. The designated HARM office will notify the member‘s parent MAJCOM if the
       member will exceed 180 days in FSC ―S‖ or FSC ―4‖ status. Notify the MAJCOM prior
       to the member exceeding the 180-day limit. See also Paragraph 1.4.1.8

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (ARMS)

3.2. Background Information. This section explains the conditions under which personnel are
authorized to log flight activity into ARMS. ARMS will be used for tracking and management of
all aircrew and operational support flight activity.
   3.2.1. The Air Force flying program is designed to ensure that each individual actively
   engaged in performing airborne duties maintains basic professional skills. This requires
   accurately logged flight and simulator activity to record and monitor flying experience.
   3.2.2. Flight data must be recorded and reported accurately to provide commanders with
   meaningful flight experience information to ensure resources are effectively used and only
   qualified personnel receive incentive pay. Units will follow AFI 33-360,Publications and
   Forms Management,to develop local training accomplishment forms for entering training
   data into ARMS.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                               73


   3.2.3. Responsibility of Pilot in Command. Enter and credit flight time on an individual"s
   flight record only when flown according to this instruction and properly logged on AFTO
   Form 781 or AF Form 3250. The pilot designated, as "in command" of the aircraft is
   responsible for making sure the appropriate form is dated and properly completed, to include
   specific remarks as required. These forms provide an accurate record of pertinent flight data
   for personnel authorized to take part in the flight and to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
   3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
       3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be

          flying time in assigned UAS aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non- interference basis
          (reference Paragraph 2.12.7), will use aircrew position (Second Character) "X" IAW
          TableA2.3, and will log AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate with
          qualification and duties performed for entry into ARMS.
   3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW Paragraph 1.9.4.7.1and
   logging flight time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure
   crewmembers and parachutists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY,
   or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Assignment Duty (TAD), regardless of duration,
 74                                                AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


   or while flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to
   perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not log flying time when the purpose for
   flying is to make a proficiency-sustaining jump or perform jumpmaster duties.
   EXCEPTION: Pararescue personnel in "X" coded billets may log flying time if aircrew
   duties are performed during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in
   the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781.
   3.3.3. For individuals authorized to perform inflight duties in non-US Air Force aircraft,
   reference Paragraph1.11, Paragraph3.3.1.4, above, does not apply. IAW

Attachme nt 2, Table A2.3.
   3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty
   station identified in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their
   aircrew specialty. Only qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining
   qualification in the aircraft will log primary time when performing in- flight duties. Non-rated
   aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have an established crew
   duty station will log primary time only when actually performing required in- flight duty. For
   example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
       3.4.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
          3.4.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of
          Paragraph 3.7.1will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
          3.4.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing
          instrument training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
          3.4.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy
          Test Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using
          FP, FN, or FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative
          or approved short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot
          School graduates to perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew
          members at the controls of the aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
          3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to
          authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are
          required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in- flight duties for
          mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when
          performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time
          is authorized only during the time required in- flight duties are performed. During
          periods when the PJ is not performing in- flight duties associated with the rescued
          members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, "Other" flight time will be logged.
          Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in additional to
          basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
          781.

         3.4.1.1.5. (Added) Operational support medical personnel may log primary time
         when tasked to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search
         and Rescue (CSAR), Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation
         (MEDEVAC) missions. If tasked to fly on sister service CSAR, CASEVAC, or
         MEDEVAC missions, ensure requests are coordinated though the member"s
         MAJCOM IAW Paragraph 1.11.1of this instruction.
         3.4.1.1.6. (Added) Aeromedical         Evacuation      Crewmembers         (AECM)      on
         Aeromedical Readiness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous
         (tandem) training on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to
         meet flight currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions will log
         primary time when performing in- flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews
         conducting separate in- flight training using separate in- flight kits, medical equipment,
         and mission documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew prior to
         take off for CRM purposes.
     3.4.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding
     hands-on-time flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or
     evaluator). It is not predicated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place
     aircraft), or on the duty position indicated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving
     instruction while controlling the aircraft will log primary time
     3.4.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their
     rated specialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space
     station duties may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space
     station duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) "A" from Attachment 2,
     Table A2.3.
     3.4.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing
     duties at a duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is
     established for the same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time
     while actually performing the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple
     Air Surveillance Operator positions on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which
     AFI 65-503,US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, authorized crew duty station(s)
     flight test engineers may occupy during test functions. During periods when the flight test
     engineer is not actively performing his or her evaluation/test duties, Other time will be
     logged.) Except under conditions in this paragraph, the total primary time for any specific
     aircrew specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.4.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific aircraft,
     but tasked to perform in- flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in an aircraft in
     which they are not current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew certification code (first
     character of crew position) "F" and primary time for that mission. See also Paragraph
     3.3.1.5.1
  3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing
  inflight duties related to the crewmember‘s specialty, but who is not controlling the function
  of that specialty. Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
  will not exceed the total flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew

  complement, annotate in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed
  by additional aircrew.
     3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log
     secondary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI
     65-503; and tasked to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft
     (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV
     missions) will log secondary time as long as they maintain currency in their primary
     aircraft. The member‘s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If
     not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log ―X‖ or ―O‖ as the aircrew qualification
     code first character IAW Table A2.3.
     3.4.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of
     flight controls and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or e valuating.
     3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing
     inflight duties of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that
     specialty (for example, second navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs
     on AOs required to perform "in- flight duties" assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a
     rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
         3.4.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight
         duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in
         additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission.
     3.4.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary
     time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties
     during aeromedical readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight
     time when performing simulated patient duties
     3.4.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each
     specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.4.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active
     flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew
     complement to perform in- flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel
     missions, may log secondary time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission
     Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions. Secondary time is
     authorized only during such time those in- flight duties are performed. During periods
     when the PJ is not performing "in- flight" duties associated with the rescued members or
     mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
  3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor
  while actively performing authorized instructional duties. Includes "hands on" time during
  demonstration activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to
  occupying a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually
  performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in this section, members must be
  qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor time. Except as provided for in AFI 65-
  503 and Paragraph3.4.3.1, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty will not
  exceed the total flight time.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              77


     3.4.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training
     instruction (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for the three-
     person crew or third pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a
     specific event may be logged as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like
     specialty are on the aircraft to provide simultaneous instruction for crewmembers of
     different specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two instructor
     navigators are on the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other is
     instructing a boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total
     flight time logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the
     rationale for logging excess instructor time.
     3.4.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and
     each log instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight
     time logged. (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more
     experienced FTU instructor flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur
     between the new FTU instructor and student or between the experienced FTU instructor
     and new instructor, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the total instructor time
     logged may not exceed total flight time.)
     3.4.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are
     current and qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log
     instructor time while flying in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew
     member in the first aircraft. This applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also
     qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not maintain instructor qualification in the chase
     aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while actively providing instruction. Enter a
     remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the rationale for logging instructor
     time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a reference).
     3.4.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their
     activity, when not performing instructor duties.
     3.4.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified
     as an instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be
     instructors in the simulator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time.
     MAJCOMs will determine which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g.,
     operational flight trainers, weapon system trainers, etc.
  3.4.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight
  evaluator while actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes "hands on"
  time if coincident with performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to
  occupy a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing
  evaluator duties. Evaluators will also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time,
  depending on their activity, when not performing evaluator duties.
  3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight
  authorization, but who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the
  requirements of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or
  extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the mission to augment the crew or
  perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in the aircraft).
78                                               AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


  Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew
  rest or sleep.
  3.4.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
     3.4.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks co nducted by aircraft against
     an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile
     fire. Aerial activity in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure
     to hostile fire. Combat includes both elements: activity against an enemy or opposing
     force (or activity supporting forces engaging an enemy or opposing force)andrisk of
     exposure to hostile fire.
         3.4.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air
         Force Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace.
         Hostile airspace is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically
         designated as hostile airspace by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to
         hostile fire. The combat zone may contain areas that are not designated as hostile
         airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
         accomplished in a designated combat zone within the designated hostile airspace.
         Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
         airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile
         fire. ( EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the
         COMAFFOR under extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log
         combat time outside of the hostile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat
         zone. If an exception is granted, include the exception in the guidance designating the
         combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAFFOR will publish guidelines
         specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat support flight time and
         will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for logging
         combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but the use
         of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish hostile
         airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time.
         NOTE:COMAFFOR will issue new guidance and procedures every two years to
         ensure all Air Force units are aware of the current policy.
     3.4.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft
     against an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the
     designated hostile airspace, where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes
     aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those
     who are actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated
     hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
     3.4.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
     individual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an
     AO that requires the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to
     perform in- flight aircrew duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW Paragraph
     3.3of this instruction. Do not combine mission symbols; use one symbol for the entire
     flight.
  3.4.7. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Time. UAS crews may be authorized to
  simultaneously control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time logged
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                             79


   by each individual will reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and is not
   dependent upon the number of aircraft actually controlled. Flight time logged will not exceed
   the time the individual was performing inflight duties.
3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in Paragraph 3.4are the basis for
accumulating flying experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a
mission in the appropriate category. Provisions have been made to record, for historical
purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight condition: night, instrument, and simulated
instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition simultaneously (for example, night
and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories on the form. The type of
time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or procedure
accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
   3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time
   logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight,
   as published in the AmericanAir Almanac. (EXCEPTION:An evaluator will log night time
   as a flight condition in conjunction with "other" flight time when performing evaluation
   duties onboard aircraft in which he or she does not maintain qualificatio n.) Crewmembers
   having night training requirements (includes wear of NVG) specified by Air Force or
   MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel assigned at latitudes above 60
   degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees south (November through
   February), night requirements are waived when removal from active flying or PCS occurs
   during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator when operating in simulated
   night conditions.
   3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight
   time logged when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained
   primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition.
   3.5.3. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, "hands-on"
   instructor, or "hands-on" evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft
   attitude primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
   3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member
   wearing night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
   morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing
   aircrew duties in a crew position with NVG training requirements will log this time while
   wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members
   instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where NVGs are
   required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged. NVG time may be
   logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training (simulator model
   and simulator software).
3.6. Non-rated Flight Time. Non-rated aircrew members will log flying time using the proper
flight authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and when actively
performing specific inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders ( Paragraph 3.9).
Aeromedical evacuation crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight authorization and
 80                                                AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


actively engaged in operational air evacuation or air rescue missions; aeromedical research and
development inflight; or air evacuation training missions that require AECMs in a crew position,
being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in Paragraph 3.4.2.4above.

Section 3C—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.7. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to Paragraph
3.3toward incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in "O" or "X" status does not entitle the
member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP. NOTE. See Attachment 2, Table
A2.3.EXCEPTION : Air Technicians (AT) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in
military status to log time for incentive pay. This Air Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define
the inflight duties that qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
   3.7.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One
   Aircraft and Not Othe r Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and
   equivalent organizations, and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders
   (including unit commanders) and key supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and
   maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, to fly in a
   primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be
   under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew position. The crewmember will
   log an "O" or "X" as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned
   second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3(As noted above, Flight time flown in
   "O" or "X" status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
   Paragraph 3.4.1.1.1
3.8. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive
Flying Status. Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US
Government aircraft except as provided in FAC waivers listed in Table2.2, paragraphs
2.9.2.2., 2.10.1.1., and 2.16In all such cases, inactive crewmembers must maintain physical and
physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation service.
3.9. Non-rated Crewme mbers and Ope rational Support Flight Time. Inflight duties
authorized by Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or position
symbol for logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished when
actively performing inflight duties as follows:
   3.9.1. Non-rated Crewme mber Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to an
   authorized non-rated aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew IAW AFIs 11-
   401, 11-402, and 65-503, and:
       3.9.1.1. The individual‘s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties o n a
       frequent and regular basis.
       3.9.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and
       associated equipment required for mission accomplishment.
   3.9.2. Ope rational Support (Non-cre wme mber) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a
   specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in
   AFI 65-503 and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for
   limited periods to perform essential and specific in- flight duties that cannot be accomplished
   by authorized aircrew personnel. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                             81


3.10. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight
duties authorized by Paragraph 1.11 may log flying time in non-Air Force aircraft for credit
towards OFDA requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only "Other" flight time will be
credited in an individual"s flight records.
3.11. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of
other US military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by
logbook or other official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the Other US Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not
included in this category if performed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air
Force order); such time is recorded as Air Force rated time.
3.12. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered
into ARMS in the student time hour block.
3.13. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other
governments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or
other official record certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the
Foreign Military hour block.
3.14. Logging Flight Time in Othe r Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to
Paragraph 3.3in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only
when directed by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty
assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781
or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in
aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.
3.15. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450
or more rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by
authorized persons. (These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation
activities; suitable agents of commercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from
which the reported flying was performed, if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of
recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered into ARMS in the civilian hour block.
3.16. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit
Quarterly GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ
USAF/A3OT by the 15of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is designated
emergency status code C-3. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to
allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Continue reporting during emergency
conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. The report will
include the following:
   3.16.1. Rank/Name/Position. Include general officer selectees.
   3.16.2. Aircraft qualification/aircrew status.
   3.16.3. Flight Authorization Duty Codes.
   3.16.4. Aircrew Position Indicator Code/Aviation Service Code.
   3.16.5. Total flight hours/sorties in all aircraft in which the member maintains qualification
   (AF Form 8) by aircraft and by flight time category.

Terms
A-Staff—DELETED
Additional Crew Member (ACM)—Aircrew members not required for a particular mission
being flown, but who are required for follow-on missions. MAJCOMs further define ACMs in
supplements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
mission being flown grants ACM status. ACMs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft
capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
Aircre w—The total complement of rated (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, and flight
surgeons), career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes), and nonrated aircrew
(K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and
flight operation of the aircraft and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to
accomplishment of the aircraft‘s mission. Includes members in initial formal training for
immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying position. Individuals must be on
aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air
Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft‘s basic crew complement,
but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and their
presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be
essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a
mission, or other duties essential to the aircraft‘s mission.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.

Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper
signature or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on
Department of the Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that awards a pilot
rating).
Authorized Aircre ws—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning
Factors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces), Attachment A37-

as authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flight
duties. For rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity
that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating
and is placed on aeronautical orders (for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H
class or Weapons Systems Training) or date of commission, whichever is later. For flight
surgeons, the ASD equals the date all requirements for the flight surgeon rating were met, which
is normally the date Course 50BY9351 or equivalent was completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD
for medical students who have completed Course 50BY9351 will be the date post graduate
medical training is completed, an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC 48XX is
awarded, and the flight surgeon rating is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for
award of the ASD.) For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal
ABM flying training (class start date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the
member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight
training leading to career enlisted aviator status and is placed on aeronautical orders. Rated
ASDs and CEA ASDs are established separately. See also AFI 11-402.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 8A000.
Career Enlisted Flie r Incentive Pay (CEFIP)—Incentive pay for career enlisted aviators in an

individual is assigned or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the
wing, authority may be delegated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP, conditional to meeting
minimum monthly flying time standards IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapters 22
and 24, and AFI 11-421.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              89


proficiency in the assigned qualification level. This training must be recorded in the ARMS
database.
Continuous Entitle ment—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational
support, and authorized non- interference members on AOs, who are qualified and authorized to
perform duties on specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. ACMs and MEGPs may be placed on
the flight authorization, only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA
for the mission(s) on which they performed duties.
Form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools).
IAW AFI 33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
Frequent And Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, sets the
minimum at four hours for active duty (DoDFMR, Part Two) and two hours for Air Reserve
Components (ARC) per calendar month, or a prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the
requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individual to aircrew
or operational support flier status. There must be a need to perform inflight duties.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to
perform flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.

pertains to entitlement to these incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these
incentive pays; and the single point of contact for ARMS. This position is inherently
governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude
be maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO is to validate
individual qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and
regular participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual
entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Inte rfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.

Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of
one or more sorties. Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie. See .
Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP)—Personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked
to perform unique ground support duties at an enroute location or the point of destination that are
directly related and essential to the particular aircraft or mission being flown, e.g., a maintenance
specialist required to perform routine ground maintenance or a security team required to guard
the aircraft at enroute or destination stops. MAJCOMs may further define MEGP in MAJCOM
supplements to this instruction. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the
mission being flown grants MEGP status. MEGPs are passengers and may only fly on aircraft
capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions o f DoD 4515.13-R. EXCEPTION: MEGPs
who are mission essential to aircraft launch/recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped
for carrying passengers. MEGPs who fly under the provisions of this exception must be
physically and physiologically (when required) qualified and must complete applicable egress
training prior to flight.
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivale nt to total federal
commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.
Ope rational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel
(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Ope rational Support Flie r—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying. The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a
specific, essential inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties
may include, but are not limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific
aircraft systems or installed equipment. To receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational
support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed flying hour
requirements. Authorized man- months are required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local
flying area and terminating at the point of origin. See also paragraph and .
Pilot In Command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in
command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
Point-To-Point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a
different location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency
training, on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                              91


original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew
sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and procedures for aircrew
continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
Supervisory Aircrew Or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8,
B, and D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but
individuals are not required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status
(basic aircraft qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they
are required to maintain.
Training Pe riod—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT
                         DATA DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service
configuration, and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form
781,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and
reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to take
part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated
officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781 must be maintained
in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned. This form is available
for downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device
time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force
Individual Flight Record.
A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. Maintenance
personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing AFTO Form
781 and other forms in that series is a joint responsibility of maintenance personnel and the pilot
in command.
   A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form
   781 are onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of
   copies to fulfill mission requirements.
   A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed
   to show all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel authorized to take part in
   the flight. The pilot in command:
       A2.3.2.1. Before flight, reviews the aircraft status as indicated on AFTO Forms in the
       781-series and then signs the exceptional release, if not previously signed by
       maintenance.
       A2.3.2.2. Documents all discrepancies observed before, during, and after flight on AFTO
       Form 781A,Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.
       A2.3.2.3. After the flight is completed, fills in the required entries in item 10, Flight
       Condition Data (AFTO Form 781H,Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance
       Document) and initials item 38 of AFTO Form 781.
   A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must be removed from the AFTO Form 781 binder
   after the information is entered at maintenance debriefing and delivered to either the SARM
   or maintenance plans and scheduling office (MAJCOM option) and after ARMS update is
   provided to the HARM office.
   A2.3.4. Each unit operations officer:
       A2.3.4.1. Gives to the maintenance organization that services the aircraft assigned to that
       unit the necessary organization and location information to be entered in items 4 and 5 of
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                                 93


        AFTO Form 781. This ensures completed forms are sent to the proper SARM or HARM
        office for entry into ARMS.
        A2.3.4.2. Ensures a responsible individual audits the unit"s AFTO Forms 781 for
        accuracy and legibility and initials in item 39 of the form before sending it to the HARM
        office. Where local procedures establish the HARM office as the auditing agency, the
        responsible individual from that office initials the form in item 39.
        A2.3.4.3. The original copy of the AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM
        office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the
        end of the month in which the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a
        flight flown in March must be turned in to the servicing HARM office NLT 5 April.
        EXCEPTION: ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP entitlement information
        may forward the AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM office not later than the first
        day following two months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the
        above example, the forms would not be required to be turned into the HARM office until
        1 June.
           A2.3.4.3.1. SARM offices will not maintain duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781
           (including extracts). If changes are required after the flight informatio n has been
           entered in ARMS and the form is at the HARM office, the pilot in command must
           contact the HARM office to make corrections.

     7     Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the same
           GMT date on a single AFTO Form 781.

     8     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where the
           aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL." Use
           ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier (i.e. a
           CV-22 landing in a field).

     9     Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is terminated
           without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL." Use ―XXXX‖ for
           classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.

     10    24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move forward
           on takeoff roll.

     11    24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after being
           airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are stopped and
           shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The aircraft has been on
           the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series of practice landings is
           considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where a crewmember enplanes or
           deplanes. NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT and ends after GMT midnight
           (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is
           not necessary.

     12    Subtract takeoff time from landing time, convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
           The conversion table for minutes to tenths of an hour is on the reverse of the form.

     13    Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.

     14    Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to landing as
           described in block 11; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the sortie will be
           recorded on the flight that lists final landing.

     15    Specified by MAJCOM.

     16    Unit designated to perform this mission (MAJCOM option).

TOTALS Total flight time, landings, and sorties at the end of the mission or day.

     17    Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying. Use
           leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.

     18    SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in time being lost or credited to
           another crewmember.

     19    Crewmember‘s last name (printed).

   20     Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
          mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual‘s current qualification, but will
          indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the mission.
          For example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP duties on a
          mission, the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight Authorization. Refer to Table
          A2.3. for a complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The only time the FA code will not
          match the scheduled duties on the FA is for extenuating circumstances. The AC must
          document the reason in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was
          scheduled to perform IP duties in conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot;
          however, the upgrading individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed
          primary duties. MP is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the
          remarks section. When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually
          performed and annotate in remarks if different from the FA.

  21-26   Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapte r 3 of this instruction.
          The total time in item 26 cannot exceed the grand total in item 12 and total of items 21
          through 25 cannot exceed item 26.

   27     Total number of sorties for this crewmember. Entry is normally the grand total (see item
          14, above).

  28-30   Hours and tenths of time performed in night, instrument, or simulated conditions, as

To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with the
following:
1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to credit
   time (a "yes" in column 3).
2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable when the
   evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew certification
   code O or X.
3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When not
   performing primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support medical technicians on
   AOs will only log primary time when performing in- flight medical assistance to actual patients.
   Only other time is authorized for periods of the mission when medical assistance is not being
   provided. EXCEPTIONS: AFSPC and AETC medics will log primary time for that portion of
   the mission when they perform required temporary CEA duties on aircraft equipment (hoists and
   litters). See also paragraph 3.4.1.1.5.
5. Non-interference flyers (other than flying unit commanders and UAS sensor operators) must
   receive AF/A3O-AT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into ARMS.
   See paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2. and 3.3.1.5.3.
6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position ―Z‖ when tasked to perform in-
   flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back side of the AFTO Form
   781 to explain the duty performed.
NOTE:
MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental guidance.

                         PREPARING AERONAUTICAL ORDERS

A3.1. AO Purpose. AOs are:
   A3.1.1. Published on AF Form 1887, or in an approved computer output format, AOs are
   used to validate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize and
   direct individual performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participation in
   aerial flight or parachute duties; to authorize and direct individuals (non-aircrew) to perform
   non- interference flying duties; and to establish or terminate individual entitlement to aviation
   career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), and hazardous duty
   incentive pay (HDIP). HDIP for parachutists must specify static or HALO jump requirement
   and type of HDIP authorized. AOs initiating and authorizing aviation/parachutist service will
   not be effective before the member is medically qualified. This form is available for
   downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A3.1.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of
   each individual‘s aviation/parachutist career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM
   office file system until moved to staging area.
   A3.1.3. Distributed according to Table A3.2.
   A3.1.4. Completed according to Table A3.1through Table A3.4.
   A3.1.5. Signed by the wing Host Aviation Resource Manager (HARM). The wing HARM
   must be an Aviation Resource Management SNCO (E-7 or above/civilian equivalent [GS-6]
   or E-7/GS-7 or above for ANG) with a seven (7) skill level, with at least three years
   experience in the 1C0 career field, a current CHARM qualification, and SEI Code
   066.NOTE:The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager may waive this requirement. All waiver
   requests will include full justification, proof of member‘s qualification (copy of 1C0 training
   record AO task certification), and expected get well date. Send an information copy to
   AF/A3O-ATF for waivers approved for longer than 180 days.
       A3.1.5.1. With approval of the MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager and subject to the
       qualification requirements listed in ParagraphA3.1.5, the assistant CHARM may sign
       aeronautical orders on behalf of the CHARM. Additionally, the statement "Signed for"
       must be written or typed above the signature block and the assistant CHARM will sign
       his or her name above the CHARM‘s signature block. The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional
       Manager will document this approval.
A3.2. AO Publication. Publish AOs for:
   A3.2.1. Officers and CEAs qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers,
   officers in flying training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, or enlisted members in
   flying training leading to the CEA designation) to:
       A3.2.1.1. Start or stop the requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty.
       A3.2.1.2. Direct and record changes to ASC and incentive pay entitlement. When the
       AO initiates or terminates flight/jump pay at the same time as the ASC change, complete
       the bottom portion of the AO. This serves as a Military Pay Order (MPO) to start and
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                               107


      stop flight/jump incentive pay. HARM offices will use a DD Form 114 to start and stop
      past or future entitlements based on qualifications or actions not applicable to the current
      AO. MPOs may be cut as separate documents to control privacy act information
      contained in aeronautical order remarks section.
   A3.2.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to:
      A3.2.2.1. Initiate or terminate member‘s requirement to perform regular and frequent
      flight as a crewmember.
      A3.2.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC, FAC 4, 5, 6, 8, and E duties and incentive
      pay entitlement.
      A3.2.2.3. Establish or terminate member‘s requirement to perform frequent and regular
      parachute jump duties as a parachutist member.
      A3.2.2.4. Initiate operational support and non- interference flying. Once AO terminates,
      it is no longer in effect. Do not publish an AO to terminate aviation service for these
      members.
      A3.2.2.5. Track members required to perform UAV sensor operator duties. Termination
      date will be three years from the AO effective date or member‘s DOS, whichever occurs
      first. The AO will read as follows: ―Initiate Sensor Operator Duties.‖
   A3.2.3. Award authorized basic and advanced ratings and badges. AOs that award
   aeronautical ratings, aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders.
A3.3. General Instructions.
   A3.3.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit HARM
   offices, commanders (including unit commanders) and AF/A3O-AT.
      A3.3.1.1. Number AOs in sequential order, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
      Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order published
      the previous year. For example: "FY06. Last AO was #2140."
          A3.3.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to
          include regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number must be
          accounted for (log required), from the first order through the last order published for
          that fiscal year. Multiple logs and numbers (with letters added) are not authorized.
          A3.3.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources) which
          supports each order‘s publication must be maintained for each fiscal year IAW
          AFMAN 37-123. Annotate (in ink) the background material in the lower right-hand
          corner (bottom margin of page) to show the order number to which it pertains. For
          example: ―Supporting document (or background material) for AO # 0469, dated 15
          Dec 2005.‖
              A3.3.1.1.2.1. Source documents include information from personnel database
              interfaces, military identification cards, finance system documents, re-enlistment
              papers, etc. Do not use documents that transferred dates or information from one
              source document to another—use the source. If using information logged on a
              member‘s in-processing or out-processing checklist, for example DDLDS or
              Effective Date of Duty to process AOs, the HARM office will request a MILPDS
108                                              AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


             interface and validate the data for processing the AO.
         A3.3.1.1.3. Post each amendment AO to the HARM office record set and FRF/JRF.
         Post revocation AOs to the HARM office record set only. Enter an explanation in ink
         on the left margin of the original order. For example: "Revoked by AO #2424, dated
         18 Sep 05."
      A3.3.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in the
      written order the date and by whom the verbal order was issued and, if flying/jump status
      or aeronautical ratings/badges were affected, a statement why writte n orders were not
      issued earlier. For example, "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are
      confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance."
  A3.3.2. Unit commanders will notify the HARM office to request aviation or parachutist
  service actions that originate at the unit level. For example: Initiating aviation/parachutist
  service, non- interference flying, or operational support requests.
  A3.3.3. The host base Information Management (IM) office will provide reproduction
  facilities for publishing AOs when facilities are not available within the HARM office.
  A3.3.4. HARM offices may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members
  providing the action is exactly the same for each member. For group orders, mask
  information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized
  disclosure.
  A3.3.5. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual,
  provided all actions have the same effective and termination dates. EXCEPTION: AOs
  awarding basic or advanced aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions.
  A3.3.6. Use AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO.
      A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper
      grade, termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is
      unaffected by the correction. The amendment order should contain the original effective
      date and only other required identifying data (name, grade, SSN, and organization) and
      the amended data. If other personal data is the same as the AO being amended (ASD,
      ASC, FAC, etc..), it may also be included on the AO. Underline amended items and
      reference the amended item(s) in the AO re ma rks.(An amendment makes the
      amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF Form 1887 is the recommended
      medium for amending AO because, as an automated system, ARMS automatically
      includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective period of the AO
      being amended. This information may be included if it mirrors the AO being amended.
      Use of AF Form 1887 avoids HARM system "work-arounds" that entail entering false
      date into ARMS. False data may interface with other Air Force systems and corrupt
      promotion or assignment processes.
         A3.3.6.1.1. HARM offices may use a single amendment AO to correct erroneous
         data on more than one AO if the data to be changed is the same on each incorrect
         AO.EXAMPLE:A HARM office does not amend the ASD and termination date on
         AOs following an ASD adjustment. This may be corrected by publishing one AO to
AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010                                                         109


          correct the ASD and termination date and listing each AO number that required
          correction in the remarks section of the amendment AO.
          A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke
          the incorrect amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
          A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to
          change a termination date. In this case, the AO‘s intent was incorrect from the
          beginning. When amending an AO, document in ink the AO number and request date
          of the amendment AO on the lower left-hand margin of the original AO in the record
          set and FRF being amended. For example: ―Amended by AO #13, dated 13 Oct 05.‖
          A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an effective date. Since
          the intent of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective
          date), an incorrect AO effective date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM
          offices must revoke the AO and publish a new AO with the correct effective date and
          the required aviation service change.
          A3.3.6.1.5. (Added) . HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an erroneous
          OFDA total or FAC unless the AO was published to mark an aviation service point,
          e.g. 12 years of aviation service, or to assign FAC 6/E, respectively.
          A3.3.6.1.6. (Added) . HARM offices will not amend a past AO solely to correct an
          erroneous authority paragraph reference. The authority paragraph reference must be
          correct on the member‘s current AO.
       A3.3.6.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same item
       on previous orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same effective
       date. Example: MSgt Jones", (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will terminate 27
       December 2005. However, MSgt Jones reenlists on 15 Dec 2005, and will remain on
       active flying status. An AO must be printed to reflect the new termination date based on
       the new DOS; the effective date of the new AO will remain the same as the original AO
       that placed MSgt Jones on flying status.
       A3.3.6.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A
       revocation deletes the order from the chronological history in the member‘s FRF or JRF.)
       However, the revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs
       to support the AO being published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as a n
       official document. Do not revoke a revocation; instead, publish a new order. For
       Example: When the HARM office publishes AO #2424 to revoke AO #444. Remove AO
       #444 from the FRF and file AO #2424 in the HARM office record set. Document
       revoked information on the lower left-hand side margin of revoked AO. For example:
       Revoked by AO #167, dated 18 Jan 03. HARM offices must send a copy of both AOs to
       the member and AFPC/DPAOY. AFPC/DPAOY maintains a permanent file in member‘s
       historical file to show all aviation service actions processed.
A3.4. Restrictions on Publication.
   A3.4.1. Do not publish an AO to authorize Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air
   National Guard (ANG) personnel to take part in flight activity during short periods of
 110                                                AFI11-401_482FWSUP_I 9 AUGUST 2010


   EAD.EXCEPTION:AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while attending
   the Flight Screening Program.
   A3.4.2. The AO effective date will not precede the date the member met all eligibility
   requirements.
   A3.4.3. Prior to publication of an AO that will involuntarily terminate aviation service for
   non-CEA enlisted aircrew members, the HARM office must ensure the member was given a
   120-day notification before removal from aviation service (IAW AFI 11-402). Receipt of
   assignment notification documentation from the MPF, as directed by AFI 36-2102,Base-
   Level Relocation Procedures, verbal orders of the member‘s unit commander (written
   confirmation must be received within three duty-days), or any official documentation
   received from AF/A3O-AT constitutes certification and will be noted in remarks of the
   published order. Place MPFs on distribution for all such AOs.
   A3.4.4. AOs should not be published later than the effective date if the action changes,
   initiates, or terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless:
         A3.4.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the effective
         date is the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as provided by
         the MPF. A retroactive statement is not necessary for this action. HARM offices will
         verify DDLDS documented on the member‘s in-processing sheet with MILPDS data.
         A3.4.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an effective date
         of AO. Cite the governing directive that applies as authority.

                 ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A4.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight
training and space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in
missions. This form is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or
aircrew logging space time. Aircrew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an
exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the
form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating in ARMS. This is an official record to
validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members
required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving combat/combat
support operations. The original AF Form 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
A4.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated,
CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while
attending training to attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized
flights in non-USAF aircraft (includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer
flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.
A4.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and
collecting these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT
AUTHORIZATION, AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use
of USAF aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to
perform in- flight duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of utility, fighter, and trainer
aircraft for missions that originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to
authorize all other aircraft missions and for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical
documents used during mission review to validate duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form
781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses. Forms are available for downloading on
the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew
   duties (except for noninterference fliers, and ACMs when specifically authorized [see
   Paragraph A5.1.3]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
   A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in- flight
   aircrew duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the
   aircraft, but not performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. ACMs and non-
   interference fliers not on AOs may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not listed
   on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger
   manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
   A5.1.3. Units may use computer- generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in
   lieu of the actual form program. If used, computer-generated forms must duplicate AF forms
   located at the AFDPO e-publishing web site.
A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of
USAF aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and
AE, pararescue unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform
aircrew duties on the mission.
A5.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing
Go/No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member‘s AOs) during pre- mission
review.
   A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the
   authenticating official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No-Go
   requirements are accomplished by validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to
   flight.
   A5.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review
   to ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to
   perform duties. The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on
   the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.

   A5.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with other mission paperwork. The Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)lists the minimum disposition requirements of this form.
   MAJCOM supplements may require longer retention times for the form.
