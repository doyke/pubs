This instruction establishes the Hazardous Materials Safety Program for McChord AFB in accordance
with the requirements of AFI 91-202, AFMAN 91-201, AFJMAN 24-204 and Title 49, Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR). This instruction applies to all personnel and units assigned or attached to McChord
AFB.



1. Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety Program. This program involves all hazardous mate-
rials regulated for transportation by public law and by the Department of Defense (DOD) which include,
but are not limited to, general hazard classification of Class Divisions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 explosives,
flammable and nonflammable compressed gases; flammable liquids; flammable solids; oxidizing materi-
als; Class A poisonous gases or liquids; Class B poisonous liquids or solids; irritating materials; etiologic
agents; radioactive materials; corrosive materials; other regulated material (ORM); and any other cate-
gory or type of materials that may from time to time be classified as hazardous by the Department of
Transportation (DOT). Implementation of an effective Hazardous Materials Safety Program must be
equally shared by host and tenant units and supported by all levels of management and supervision. A
comprehensive and integrated program at this installation will be accomplished through:
   1.1. Coordination between 62 AW/SE, 62 CES/CC, 62 AW/OG and all base organizations, including
   tenant units involved in hazardous materials transportation to ensure compliance with Air Force, Air
   Mobility Command, and 15th Air Force directives and supplements.
   1.2. Recurring facilities and equipment inspections and an annual safety management inspection to
   observe adequacy of program elements and identify deficiencies to units and activities.
   1.3. Use of technically qualified and certified personnel transporting hazardous materials and use of
   proper and serviceable equipment.

    in place until all hazardous materials have been unloaded from the aircraft or until engine start if haz-
    ardous materials remain on board. Placards identifying aircraft to be loaded with hazardous materials
    will be displayed prior to loading and will remain in place until just prior to engine start.
