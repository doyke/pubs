 2                                                             45SWI51-101 19 AUGUST 2010

unchanged.
1. Authority: The 45th Space Wing Commander is charged with the responsibility for
maintaining law and order on the base (AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security
Program). To carry out this responsibility, the commander may demand that any juvenile
military dependent charged with misconduct explain why his/her privileges should not be limited
or revoked. These privileges include: exchange privileges (AFI 34-211, Army and Air Force
Exchange Service General Policies); commissary privileges (DODI 1330.17, Armed Services
Commissary Operations); family housing privileges (AFI 32-6001, Family Housing
Management); the privilege of entering the base (AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
Security Program); and base driving privileges (AFI 31204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic
Supervision).
2. Purpose: The JIC will conduct hearings concerning cases of misconduct by juveniles arising
on Patrick AFB or Cape Canaveral AFS and involving the minor children of military members.
Remedial actions resulting from hearings before the JIC will be designed to preserve good order
and discipline on Patrick AFB and Cape Canaveral AFS, protect persons and property on the
installation, and, if possible, correct the behavior of the juvenile.
3. Jurisdiction: The JIC shall have jurisdiction over all juvenile misconduct that occurs on
Patrick AFB or Cape Canaveral AFS involving the minor children of active duty, reserve, or
retired military personnel. Because the remedies for misconduct set forth in this instruction are
administrative, actions taken in accordance with this instruction shall not prevent concurrent
criminal prosecution of the juvenile.
4. Composition of the JIC:
     4.1. The JIC will consist of the following members or their designated representatives:
        4.1.1. Chairperson – 45th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (45 MSG/CD).
        4.1.2. The 45th Security Forces Squadron Commander (45 SFS/CC).
        4.1.3. The 45th Mission Support Group Chief Master Sergeant (45 MSG/CCC).
        4.1.4. Family Member Programs Flight Chief (45 SVS/SVY).
        4.1.5. Family Advocacy (45 MDOS/SGOHS).
        4.1.6. Family Support Center Director (45 FSS/FSFR).
     4.2. If the juvenile’s sponsor is an active duty member, the sponsor’s Squadron Commander
     or equivalent (at least an E-7 or above) sits as a non-voting member of the Council.
45SWI51-101 19 AUGUST 2010                                                                       3


   4.3. At least three (3) voting members of the Council must be present in order to convene the
   JIC.
   4.4. Legal Advisor. An Assistant Staff Judge Advocate shall serve as Legal Advisor to the
   JIC. An enlisted member in the paralegal career field can assist with all duties of the Legal
   Advisor, except those in paragraph 6.2.10 of this instruction.
   4.5. Should the minor child of any JIC member be involved in a case of juvenile misconduct
   before the JIC, the JIC member shall be disqualified from participating as a Council member
   in the hearing of that case.
5. Processing Juvenile Misconduct Cases:
   5.1. The 45th Security Forces Squadron personnel will:
      5.1.1. Prepare an AF form 3545, Incident Report, or a DD Form 1805, Violation Notice
      U.S. District Court, for each case of juvenile misconduct occurring on Patrick AFB that
      involves a juvenile military dependent. Cases of misconduct by non-military dependent
      juveniles will be handled as appropriate (including, but not limited to, civilian
      prosecution, revocation of base driving privileges, or barment from base), but will not be
      referred to the JIC.
      5.1.2. Maintain a separate log recording, at a minimum, the names of the juvenile(s)
      involved in the misconduct, the date of the misconduct, and the status of the juvenile (i.e.,
      whether he/she is a military dependent). The incident shall be documented in the
      Security Forces daily blotter.
      5.1.3. Forward copies of the AF Form 3545 or DD Form 1805 to the JIC Legal Advisor
      and, upon request, to the sponsor’s unit commander.
   5.2. The Legal Advisor will:
      5.2.1. Obtain additional case information, if required.
      5.2.2. Issue a Notification of Hearing Letter (attachments 2 and 3) to the sponsor of the
      juvenile military dependent suspected of misconduct no later than fourteen (14) days
      prior to the date of the JIC. If the juvenile’s sponsor is an active duty member, a copy of
      the notification letter shall be forwarded to the sponsor’s unit commander.
      5.2.3. Prepare a brief legal review of the case for presentation to the JIC.
      5.2.4. Provide a copy of the case file to the JIC members at least five (5) days prior to the

      5.2.7. Assist the Chairperson in drafting all JIC correspondence with regard to
      recommendation and/or notification of remedial action.
      5.2.8. Maintain JIC program records.
      5.2.9. Act as the JIC focal point for juveniles, parents, and base agencies.

        5.2.10. Advise the Chairperson and members of the JIC on all legal matters relating to
        the JIC.

NOTE: Only the Staff Judge Advocate or designee can provide advice on legal matters
concerning the JIC.

     meeting will be held in the Patrick AFB legal office courtroom (642 O’Malley Road, Bldg
     562), or at such other place as is designated by the Chairperson.
     5.4. Sponsors and juveniles will appear before the JIC according to the instructions
     contained in the Notification of Hearing Letter (attachments 2 and 3).
6. General Procedures:
     6.1. Rules of Evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply in JIC proceedings. The
     general rule is that all matters that are relevant and material to the matter before the JIC are
     admissible.
     6.2. Standard of Proof. Any determinations made at the hearing will be based on the
     preponderance of the evidence presented.
     6.3. Witnesses.
        6.3.1. Witnesses appearing before the JIC need not be sworn.
        6.3.2. Members of the JIC may make relevant inquiries of any witnesses.

     6.4. Presentation of the Case.
        6.4.1. The Legal Advisor shall make a brief statement of the case and present evidence

        based solely on the facts set forth in the notification letter, the AF Form 3545, DD Form
        1805, and any witnesses present at the hearing. However, in cases of serious juvenile
        misconduct, the Legal Advisor may call witnesses who have relevant testimony or
        introduce relevant exhibits.
        6.4.2. The juvenile may be represented by civilian counsel before the JIC at the expense
        of the juvenile or his/her sponsor. The juvenile, his/her sponsor(s), and/or his/her civilian
        counsel may make a brief statement, cross-examine any witnesses called by the Legal
        Advisor, and present any relevant evidence for consideration by way of witness
        testimony or exhibits. Any witnesses called to testify on behalf of the juvenile may be
        cross-examined by the Legal Advisor and/or the members of the JIC.
NOTE: While the JIC has discretion to question witnesses concerning facts or other matters
raised by the juvenile, the juvenile’s sponsor(s), and/or his/her civilian counsel at the hearing, the
JIC may also choose to rely solely upon the case file and/or other official documentation of the
circumstances of the juvenile’s misconduct in arriving at its determination.

   6.5. Discussions. Prior to or following the presentation of the case and any testimony from
   the juvenile and/or witnesses, the juvenile may be directed to leave the hearing room so that
