1. NWRM Handling Procedures
   1.1. In addition to the guidance found in AFI 20-110, the 705 MUNS Nuclear Weapons
   Related Materiel Responsible Officer (NWRMRO), including appointed alternates, will:
       1.1.1. Maintain a master NWRM listing as required by AFI 20-110, paragraph 2.18.4.
       The master listing will include all NWRM items in the possession of the work center that
       are not accounted for on a certified build-up sheet. The master listing will identify the
       appropriate detail number with associated serial number if an item is also contained on an
2                                                        5BWI 20-1 10 FEBRUARY 2014


    R-14, Custodian Authorized/Custodian Receipt Listing, or D-23, Repair Cycle Asset
    Management List.
    1.1.2. Adjust master listings to account for removal of NWRM items from reentry
    systems, receipt/turn-in of items from supply, etc. 705 MUNS NWRMRO will personally
    view NWRM items before making adjustments of any kind to the master NWRM listing.
    This includes viewing data plates, final signed build sheets or, when certified by
    appropriate personnel, serviceability tags on containers.
    1.1.3. Ensure only authorized personnel have access to combinations and keys for the
    NWRM storage location (Bay 5 airlock). Only the 705 MUNS NWRMRO and appointed
    alternates will close and inventory NWRM storage locations using the Discoverer script
    data pull provided by Decentralized Materiel Support (DMS) or LRS Flight Service
    Center (FSC).
    1.1.4. Ensure that all unit personnel with unescorted access to NWRM processing areas
    (maintenance bays) have completed NWRM familiarization training.
    1.1.5. Ensure NWRM items not intended to be reassembled or installed during the same
    maintenance action are picked up on the supply accountable record by serial number.
    Immediately contact 705 MUNS/MXWSS DMS to inform them of impending
    transactions. Meeting required time lines is the responsibility of the 705 MUNS
    NWRMRO.
    1.1.6. Items requiring no further disposition will be picked up on the supply accountable
    record by serial number within 24 hours, regardless of Found on Base (FOB) action or
    Due-In From Maintenance (DIFM) exchange. Items will be packaged and scheduled for
    turn-in to base supply within 72 hours. If the item is a documented overage resulting
    from scheduled weapon system deactivation or modification (i.e. FOB/drawdown, etc.),
    immediately contact the NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) to determine proper
    accountability and/or disposition actions. See AFMAN 23-122 AFGM1, 25 Nov 13
    (Added) 6.2.2.5.3. If documentation is not provided, see AFI 20-110, Chap 11 for
    discrepancy reporting requirements.
    1.1.7. Items awaiting further disposition, maintenance, or proper packaging materials
    will be picked up on the supply accountable record by serial number within 24 hours,
    regardless of FOB action or DIFM exchange. However, items will remain in the physical
    possession of the 705 MUNS NWRMRO. If the item is a documented overage resulting
    from scheduled weapon system deactivation or modification (i.e. FOB/drawdown),
    immediately contact the NTCC to determine proper accountability and/or disposition
    actions. See AFMAN 23-122 AFGM1, 25 Nov 13 (Added) section 6.2.2.5.3 for
    guidance. If documentation is not provided, see AFI 20-110, Chap 11 for discrepancy
    reporting requirements.
    1.1.8. Complete all required FOB memorandums in support of NWRM turn-ins or
    paperwork only transactions (C-Deck).
    1.1.9. Once disposition is received or maintenance actions occur, physical turn-in to
    supply will be scheduled within 72 hours.
5BWI 20-1 10 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   3


      1.1.10. Immediately notify 705 MUNS leadership, 5 LRS NWRMRO, and the 5 BW
      Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel Accountable Officer (NWRMAO) (i.e. 5 LRS/CC) of
      any potential NWRM discrepancies.
2. 705 MUNS Technician Responsibilities:
   2.1. All technicians working with or in areas containing NWRM are responsible for assisting
   705 MUNS NWRMRO in ensuring continuous accountability.
   2.2. Immediately notify the 705 MUNS NWRMRO when a NWRM item is removed from a
   higher assembly but is not expected to be reassembled or installed during the same
   maintenance action. (This includes configuration changes, rejection of components, awaiting
   disposition actions, etc.)
   2.3. No later than shift change (on the same day), notify the 705 MUNS NWRMRO of
   maintenance actions that result in the assembly or disassembly of individual NWRM items to
   or from higher assemblies in processing areas. INTENT: When a system is disassembled, the
   Build Sheet is used to maintain 100% accountability of multiple NWRM accountable assets.
   However, it will cease to be a viable mechanism for configuration control and/or
   accountability for components that are removed. The NWRMRO will update the NWRM
   Master Inventory Listing in order to account for these individual items until reassembly and
   completion of a new Build Sheet.
   2.4. Immediately notify the 705 MUNS NWRMRO when a NWRM item is received from
   base supply.
   2.5. Immediately notify the 705 MUNS NWRMRO of any potential NWRM discrepancies
   to include NWRM items located, but not listed on the NWRM Master Inventory Listing.
3. 705 MUNS/MXWSS DMS Responsibilities:
   3.1. Ensure adequate priority is provided for processing NWRM transactions to meet
   required timelines.
   3.2. Ensure the 705 MUNS NWRMRO is notified before removing any NWRM item from a
   work center, and when NWRM items are received from base supply.
   3.3. Assist the 705 MUNS NWRMRO in processing of FOB supply transactions and
   resulting turn-ins, or paperwork only transactions as necessary.
      3.3.1. Contact the 5 LRS NWRMRO and/or 5 LRS FSC immediately when a
      determination is made that an NWRM being removed from a larger component with
      multiple NWRM serial numbered assets were not being reassembled or reinstalled during
      the same maintenance action to ensure the asset is picked up on the supply accountable
      record by serial number.
      3.3.2. If an NWRM asset is not on a supply accountable record (i.e. D23, Repair Cycle
      Asset Management List, or a R14, Custodian Authorized/Custodian Receipt Listing, etc.)
      as a result of a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) maintenance action, the
      705 MUNS DMS must contact the 5 LRS NWRMRO and/or 5 LRS FSC to initiate FOB
      turn in action.
      3.3.3. For NWRM support, contact 5 LRS NWRMRO and/or the 5 LRS FSC Monday
      through Friday, 0730-1630. After 1630 Monday through Friday, call Central Storage
 4                                                           5BWI 20-1 10 FEBRUARY 2014


        section at 723-6103. On weekends, holidays, and command designated down days,
        utilize the 5 LRS Materiel Management Flight stand-by roster to contact supply personnel
        needed for support.
     3.4. Validate the current D-23 against the Discoverer Data Pull script to ensure all NWRM
     that have been C-Decked to RS/RV Maintenance for storage, or received from supply but
     awaiting installation (tracked as ICBM Maintenance Awaiting Installation (MWI) under a
     DIFM detail), are accounted for by serial number and are assigned to the correct
     corresponding DIFM detail.
     3.5. Immediately notify the 705 MUNS NWRMRO of any potential NWRM discrepancy.
4. 5 LRS Flight Service Center Responsibilities (FSC):
     4.1. If an item is FOB/drawdown, immediately contact the NTCC to determine proper
     accountability/disposition actions.
     4.2. Process turn-in/XHB actions to account for assets on the supply accountable record
     IAW
AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch10.
     4.3. Process C-Deck actions to 705 MUNS if the asset cannot be physically turned-in to
     5 LRS IAW paragraph 1.1.7 of this instruction.
