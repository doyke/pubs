                  IG POLICY WHEN ANOTHER APPEAL OR GRIEVANCE CHANNEL EXISTS


       1. When a member has a complaint or appeal regarding adverse actions for which law and/or regulation
          provide a specific means of redress or remedy, IGs must refer the complainant to those other redress or
          appeal channels as provided by the specific law or regulation. Mere dissatisfaction with the outcome of an
          appeal is not sufficient basis for an IG investigation.

       2. If the member alleges the appeal process was improperly or prejudicially handled and has no other means
          of redress, the complainant may enter a complaint of mishandling under this instruction for IG complaint
          analysis.
