This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-2, Law Enforcement, and AFPD 16-8,
Arming of Aircrew, Mobility, and Overseas Personnel. It gives war and peacetime requirements for arm-
ing USAF personnel and the use of deadly force. It applies to military, civilian, Air National Guard, and
contract personnel as well as military personnel from other US military branches assigned or attached to
Air Force units. Air Force personnel assigned to other US military services may follow the weapons qual-
ification and use of force policies of that branch of service. Persons subject to the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice (UCMJ) who violate the procedures in paragraphs 1.2.1., 2.9., and 2.12. are subject to
punishment under Article 92, UCMJ. The Air Force may take administrative disciplinary action against
civilian employees who violate these regulations. This instruction frequently refers to ‘officer’ or ‘rea-
sonable officer’ which are defined as: Any officer, non-commissioned officer, airman, civilian or con-
tract employee performing security, law enforcement, military police, or guard duties under Air Force
control. Paragraphs 1.2. through 1.3., as well as Attachment 7 of this instruction include copyrighted

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
                 THIS PUBLICATION CONTAINS COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL.
This interim change (IC) 99-1 corrects administrative errors in the document.
This instruction supersedes previous directive guidance on arming and use of force by Air Force Person-
nel. This revision identifies contingencies when this instruction does not apply; identifies Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01, Standing Rules for Engagement for US Forces, as
providing use of force guidance during contingency operations (paragraph 1.1.1.); establishes fourth
amendment ‘objective reasonableness’ standard as criteria for use of force and deletes reference to
“intent, opportunity, and capability” criteria (paragraph 1.2.1.1. - 1.2.1.2. and Attachment 2); aligns use
of deadly force situations with DoDD 5210.56, Use of Deadly Force and the Carrying of Firearms by
DoD Personnel in Law Enforcement and Security Duties, (paragraphs 1.4.1. - 1.4.6.); deletes the kneeling
search; permits security forces commanders to authorize the wear and use of concealed weapons (para-
graph 2.1.2.3.); clarifies the role of the “armed driver” (paragraphs 2.3. and 2.9.4.); requires withdrawal of
authority to bear firearms for persons convicted of domestic violence (paragraph 2.6.); deletes the require-
ment for commanders to provide immediate written notification for temporary withdrawal of firearms
authority (paragraph 2.6.5.), recognizes the AFOSI credentials as written authorization to bear firearms
(paragraph 2.7.1.); establishes guidance for firearms qualification extensions (paragraph 2.11.); requires
child safety locks for weapons stored at a residence or non-government location (paragraph 2.12.8.); pro-
vides information on arming suitability factors (Attachment 3 and Attachment 4); clarifies response
procedures (Attachment 5); changes the Peacetime Government Firearms Discharge Report to a les-
sons learned format (Attachment 6); and moves all USAF standardized weapons handling and issuing
procedures to AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual. A bar (|) indicates revisions from the
previous edition.
(USAFE) The interim change 2006-1 to the USAFE Supplement deletes paragraph 1.3.5. and adds the
corrected text in paragraph 1.3.5.4. (Added).

                                      PROGRAM PHILOSOPHY

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes the professional philosophy and practices of the USAF relative
to proper force utilization in maintaining order in the community and in securing vital national defense
resources.
   1.1.1. This instruction does not apply to USAF personnel engaged in military operations and subject
   to authorized rules of engagement, or assigned to duty in the following areas or situations, as defined
   by an executive order or a DoD directive:
       1.1.1.1. In a combat zone in time of war.
       1.1.1.2. In a designated hostile fire area when rules of engagement apply, or when the combatant
       commander issues operations orders setting forth different criteria.
       1.1.1.3. Under the operational control of another service or federal agency carrying firearms in
       support of the mission, subject to the approval and requirements of both the federal agency and the
       DoD component.
       1.1.1.4. Civil disturbance mission area. See Appendix 1 to Annex C, DoD Civil Disturbance Plan
       “Garden Plot."
       1.1.1.5. Military services personnel performing training missions.
       1.1.1.6. During certain contingency operations.
Note: Refer to Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3121.01, Standing Rules of Engage-
ment for US Forces, and the rules of engagement for the applicable unified command for additional guid-
ance on use of force rules.

1.2. USAF Use of Force Policy. Air Force personnel engaged in force protection duties will use only
that force which is reasonably necessary in conformity with the statutes and constitution of the United
States. They must avoid the use of force where it's not essential to carrying out assigned responsibilities
   1.2.1. In cases warranting the use of force, you must use only that force reasonably necessary to reach
   your objective. You must tailor the type and level of force to its necessity. You must base your use
   of force option on the actions of the individual(s) with whom you are in contact. Once a particular
   level of force is no longer required, you must discontinue its use despite the fact a suspect’s efforts to
   thwart or evade a seizure may arouse normal passions of anger, fear, or frustration. You shall not use
   excessive force in discharging your assigned responsibilities. Use of excessive force may result in
   administrative or disciplinary proceedings and for military members constitutes a violation of Article
   92, Uniformed Code of Military Justice. Use of excessive force by civilian employees may result in
   administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions
   for violations of related laws.
       1.2.1.1. The fourth amendment to the US Constitution sets the limits for the use of force by per-
       sonnel engaged in effecting arrests or other seizures of persons. In Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S.
       386 (1989), the US Supreme Court established the fourth amendment standard of “objective rea-
       sonableness” as the appropriate standard for assessing the use of force in the context of making an
       arrest or other seizure of a person. It explained its application in these terms:
6                                                         AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006


       [T]he question is whether the officers’ actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and
       circumstances confronting them..... The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be
       judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision
       of hindsight. ...the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry...is an objective one....”
       1.2.1.2. The Supreme Court recognized in Graham v. Connor that law enforcement and security
       personnel have to make “split-second judgments” concerning the use of force under “circum-
       stances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving...” The US Supreme Court has held that rea-
       sonableness under the fourth amendment does not require you to choose the least intrusive
       alternative, only a reasonable one. In effecting a seizure, individuals performing law enforcement
       or security duties draw from a reservoir of options, ranging from simple displays of authority, to
       the application of various levels of non-deadly force, to the use of deadly force itself. Facts dictate
       the appropriate response, and those facts--as well as the choice of response--are subject to close
       scrutiny.
    1.2.2. The criteria supporting “objective reasonableness” is provided from three essential areas
    within the confrontational environment: the subject(s) action(s), the risk perception, and the officer
    response initiated in order to gain compliance and control.
       1.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The term “Objective Reasonableness” cannot be used to determine
       level of force. It is applied after an incident in reviewing use of force. Use the Use of Force Model
       (AFI 31-207, paragraph 1.3.) to determine force utilization.

1.3. Use of Force Introduction. Force, and its proper utilization is perhaps the most critical concern of
those engaged in the protection of personnel and resources. Air Force personnel performing these duties
must have a thorough understanding of the philosophy and process of force utilization. This AFI dis-
cusses the elements of the Use of Force Model (UFM), and the tools and tactics available within the
USAF. *The UFM (Figure 1.1.) is adopted from the “Integrated Force Management – Use of Force
Model” first developed in 1991, by the Professor Gregory J. Connor, University of Illinois Police Training
Institute and staff of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Material presented in this instruction
was copyrighted by Professor Conner in 1997 and is used with his permission.1

Figure 1.1. Use of Force Model.1




    1.3.1. The UFM is a three-sided, five-tiered structure. It is the basis by which discussions and ques-
    tions will be addressed as to how much force is appropriate for a variety of situations with which you
    may be faced during training exercises and real world situations.1
    1.3.2. The UFM describes the progression or de-escalation of force based upon the demonstrated
    level of compliance or resistance. Ideally, each encounter flows in a logical and legal sequence of
    cause and effect based upon reasonable perception of risk, causing you to escalate, de-escalate, or
    maintain a level of appropriate force to gain or maintain control of the subject.1
    1.3.3. The elements involved in the use of force are integrated in the Use of Force Model. Each com-
    ponent; “subject’s action”, “risk perception”, and “officer’s response” is essential for a balanced use
    of force.1
       1.3.3.1. Subject Action - the action (s) perceived by the “reasonable officer” that place the subject
       in one or more of the Model’s compliant/non-compliant categories.1
       1.3.3.2. Risk Perception - the situations that are perceived by the “reasonable officer” within a
       confrontational environment which present a risk or potential risk to officer safety. Issues includ-
       ing the nature and severity of the crime, degree of subject non-compliance, knowledge of the sub-
       ject’s previous actions, etc., can act as a test for reasonableness and a criteria for placement in one
       or more of the perception categories on the UFM.1

          1.3.3.3. “Officer Response” - the “balanced” response the reasonable officer could and/or would
          select from the UFM’s identified categories, in order to maintain or re-gain subject compliance
          and control.1

AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                        9


        1.3.3.5. The double-headed assessment/selection arrows indicate the dynamic and fluid nature of
        the processing of information toward proper decision-making during a confrontation. The princi-
        ple incorporated into proper compliance and control is that of tactical transition, which includes
        escalation, stabilization, and/or de-escalation in force applications. The properly trained member
        will be conditioned to flow with the circumstances of the specific situation to properly control the
        confrontation.1
        1.3.3.6. Each arrow is bordered with the survival shadow in red. This color enhancement is pro-
        vided to indicate and maintain the constant retention of lethal risk perception, inherent in any
        officer/subject confrontation.1
        1.3.3.7. The UFM supports the widely accepted premise and practice of progressive application
        of force. This simply implies the process of appropriate selection of force options in response to
        reasonable assessment of risks presented in the confrontation; the level of compliance or degrees
        of non-compliance from the individual to be controlled; and proper selection of an objectively rea-
        sonable response. Each officer/citizen confrontation should flow in a logical and legal sequence
        of cause and effect. The member's tactical transition must be capable of escalation or engagement,
        stabilization of the situation, or de-escalation or disengagement within the context of the confron-
        tation toward the eventual goal of compliance and control.1
        1.3.3.8. Progressive Application of Force encompasses three main elements of action and assess-
        ment: tools, tactics, and timing.1
           1.3.3.8.1. Tools include the two broad forms of subject control; mental manipulation (verbal
           skills, body language, officer presence, etc.) and physical manipulation (weaponless controls,
           weapons, restraints, etc.). 1
           1.3.3.8.2. The tactics encompass the actual application of these tools into actual strategies
           deemed necessary and viable in the confrontational setting.1
           1.3.3.8.3. Timing is demonstrated by the degree of actual force deemed necessary; based
           upon the “reasonable officer's” ongoing assessment of risks, the “reasonable officer's” per-
           ceived actions of the subject, and the available options of control; measured in terms of rea-
           sonableness.1
   1.3.4. Apply force with the appropriate tool.1
        1.3.4.1. Tools available at the first level (Cooperative Controls) would include:1
           1.3.4.1.1. Mental Preparation: Perception skills, risk assessment, and survival orientation.1
           1.3.4.1.2. Spatial Positioning: Stance, body language, and relative positioning.1

           1.3.4.1.3. Verbal Controls: Communication skills, interviewing, and behavioral assessment.1
           1.3.4.1.4. Individual searching techniques: Frisk techniques, opposite sex searches, position
           (standing, prone).1
               1.3.4.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The standing search is used for suspects who do not appear
               dangerous, violent, or so drugged or drunk they cannot stand under their own power.
               1.3.4.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Use the prone search when there is a considerable size dif-
               ference between the searcher and suspect, or when there is a chance the suspect will
               become aggressive or violent, or when the suspect is so physically or mentally impaired
               that the standing search could cause injury to the suspect. This search is ideal for multiple
               apprehensions and is the primary search used during "high risk" operations.
           1.3.4.1.5. Apprehension Tactics: Single/Dual subject, escort controls and transport controls.1
           1.3.4.1.6. Military working dog presence.1
        1.3.4.2. Tools available at the second level (Compliance Techniques) include those in the first
        level and:1
           1.3.4.2.1. Verbal Manipulation Techniques: Targeted towards changing the behavior of an
           individual (basic conflict management) or of a group of individuals (basic crisis manage-
           ment).1
           1.3.4.2.2. Handcuffing Techniques: Standing, and prone1
               1.3.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) U.S. courts consider handcuffing a use of force; therefore,
               you must carefully analyze each situation to ensure you use the minimum level of force to
               protect yourself and others from injury. During an apprehension, security forces may apply
               handcuffs to ensure control of the apprehended individual during detention and search, at
               the apprehension site, and during transport. When applying handcuffs, security forces use
               a reasonable level of force to achieve control of a resisting detainee. Inform unresisting
               detainees of the handcuffing procedure and give them the opportunity to cooperate. Use
               handcuffs as a precaution against an apprehended person who may become uncooperative
               or violent, to prevent escape, or to ensure personal safety.

       1.3.4.3. Tools available at the third level (Compliance Techniques) besides those available in the
       first and second include:1
           1.3.4.3.1. Neuromuscular controls 1
           1.3.4.3.2. Chemical irritant application.1
           1.3.4.3.3. Baton used as leverage devices or in pain compliance role (non-striking)1
           1.3.4.3.4. MWD (off leash).1
       1.3.4.4. Tools available at the fourth level (Defensive Tactic) include those from the three levels
       below and:1
           1.3.4.4.1. Escape Techniques: For use in escape from grabs and chokes.1
           1.3.4.4.2. Assault defenses: To include use of head, hands, elbows, feet and knees in warding
           off or countering the subject assault.1
           1.3.4.4.3. Impact Weapons: To include the baton or riot stick as well as anything at hand for
           use in fending off or gaining control of the subject. Blocks, strikes, and jabs to non-lethal
           areas would be justified.1
           1.3.4.4.4. Weapon retention.1
       1.3.4.5. Tools available at the fifth level (Deadly Force) include those formerly outlined in Levels
       I-IV and Firearms.1
    1.3.5. Three tactical issues should be noted.1
       1.3.5.1. The principle strategic focus in the enforcement environment is to continue to promote
       and practice the confrontation equation; which by definition is simply the officer remaining in a
       constant position of recognizable advantage within any confrontation, while the subject stays in a
       continued position of recognizable disadvantage. One vivid and viable illustration of this tactical
       equation is the practice of the 2 on 1 advantage ratio of officers to subject, as the rule, rather than
       the exception.1
       1.3.5.2. The focus toward the confrontation should be primarily placed upon the "actions" of the
       subject, rather than the important, but secondary attributes of the "actor" in the situation. Cer-
       tainly the "who" involved is of concern (e.g., past actions, previous history of violence, the sub-
       ject's size/strength, etc.), but primary focus needs to be directed toward "what" is happening at the
       time - what the subject is doing. The “reasonable officer” must guard against being lulled into
       complacency by past knowledge of the subject, or placing himself in crisis by pre-judging a mode
       of force utilization based upon previous contact, not present at this point in time.1

       1.3.5.3. When placed into a confrontation, the “reasonable officer” must expand his/her perspec-
       tive from the common practice of “reaction” into a more strategic confrontational conduct of an
       action initiated response.1
           1.3.5.3.1. This response should be pro-active, drawn upon the expertise and experience with
           the actual subject and situations, or other similar participants and incidents. The officer should
           remain free of the pressure to pre-judge the actions of the subject, and gain the enhanced abil-
           ity to more properly perceive the actual and/or potential actions of the subject in question. 1
           1.3.5.3.2. Ideally, the officer should practice anticipatory behavior (stress reduction tech-
           niques, conflict avoidance/resolution tactics, fear management skills, etc.) to attempt to pre-
           vent potential non-compliant confrontations. Or, if a conflict is perceived as inevitable, he/she
           should initiate procedures to provide sufficient systems (strategic planning, team tactics, etc.)
           to maximize the status of safety for himself/herself, others, and the actual subject.1
           1.3.5.3.3. The response must be active, in that the controlling tactics the officer initiates will
           accomplish the re-control of the subject with a high degree of effectiveness and safety to the
           officer and to others. In this manner, the confrontation can be controlled as efficiently as pos-
           sible, thus avoiding the selection of higher levels of force utilization with the inherent risks of
           greater potential injury to the officer, the subject, or others.1
           1.3.5.3.4. And finally, the response must be based on the officer’s experience and training,
           directing the officer’s actions toward a mode of prevention via the tactical application of “Les-
           son’s Learned”, or response based research. Most confrontations are not unique or remain iso-
           lated in time, their components will re-occur at other times with other subjects. If a safe,
           successful solution evolves, the officer should follow that course of response in the future. If
           the solution is not found, the officer should use the past experience as a catalyst to seek a safe,
           strategic, future solution.1
           1.3.5.3.5. This principled, status of safety, can only be maintained if the officer strategically
           and systematically anticipates, assesses, and acts within the effective and accepted parameters
           of the situation. The officer must understand that this process, and its products exist in an
           environment that is ever changing in definition, direction, and depth.1

instruction was copyrighted by © Professor Conner in 1997 and is used with his permission.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      13


       1.3.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Unless provided for in a bilateral or international agreement, the
       United States, as a sending State, is obliged under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
       Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) SOFA, Article II, to
       “respect the law of the receiving State and to abstain from any activity inconsistent with the spirit
       and intent of the present Agreement (SOFA).” In developing local procedures and policies, com-
       manders should clearly distinguish between military police activities on and off the installation.
       Article VII, paragraph 10b, of NATO/PfP SOFA states that off-base activities of military police
       are “subject to arrangements with the authorities of the receiving State and in liaison with those
       authorities.” Additionally, regional or state host nation laws may vary on issues such as use of
       handcuffs, self-defense, and other issues. Therefore, when performing activities off the installa-
       tion, it is required that some level of coordination take place with the appropriate host nation
       authorities. For all activities, commanders must coordinate local procedures with the Staff Judge
       Advocate (SJA) and the installation host nation attorney.

1.4. Use of Deadly Force. The use of deadly force must meet the ‘objective reasonableness’ standard.
Use deadly force only when facing conditions of extreme necessity, when all lesser means of force aren't
feasible or have failed, and only under one or more of these circumstances as set forth in DoD Directive
5210.56.
   1.4.1. You may use force, including deadly force, when you reasonably believe yourself or others to
   be in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.
       1.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The force used in self-defense must be proportionate to the force used
       by the attacker. Use only the minimum force needed against attackers. Use of force is not justified
       when the attack stops. Consult the SJA and host nation or regional laws regarding parameters of
       self-defense.
   1.4.2. You may use force, including deadly force, to protect DoD assets designated as vital to the
   national security. The DoD designates its assets as "vital to the national security" only when their
   loss, damage, or compromise would seriously jeopardize the fulfillment of a national defense mission.
   This normally includes priority A, B, or C assets as defined in AFI 31-101, The Air Force Physical
   Security Program. Installation commanders must identify the resources specifically designated as
   vital to national security, and the procedures they will use to inform armed personnel of such specifi-
   cally designated property in their installation security instruction.
   1.4.3. You may use force, to include deadly force, to protect DoD assets not involving the national
   security but inherently dangerous to others. Designate these resources as such if their theft or sabo-
   tage would present a substantial danger of death or serious bodily harm to others. This category
   includes weapons, ammunition, missiles, rockets, explosives, chemical agents, and special nuclear
   material. Installation commanders must identify the resources specifically designated as inherently
   dangerous to others and the procedures they will use to inform armed personnel of such specifically
   designated property in their installation security instruction or installation resources protection plan.
   These assets include, but are not limited to, Hamlet, Redeye, Stinger, Dragon, Viper, and other
   anti-armor nonnuclear ready-to-fire missiles; light automatic firearms; heavy machine guns; mortars;
   grenade launchers; flame throwers; handguns, rifles, and shotguns; recoilless rifles; explosive and
   incendiary hand grenades; explosive mines; high explosives such as TNT, dynamite, and C-4 plastic;
   high explosive fuses and detonation cord; blasting caps, bulk riot control agents; and associated
   ammunition for the above firearms.

     1.4.4. You may use force, including deadly force, to prevent the commission of a serious offense
     involving violence and threatening death or serious bodily harm.
     1.4.5. You may use force; to include deadly force, when it reasonably appears necessary to detain,
     apprehend, or prevent the escape of a person suspected of committing an offense of the nature speci-
     fied in paragraphs 1.4.1., 1.4.2.,1.4.3., and 1.4.4., and it reasonably appears that the suspect presents
     an immediate danger to you or to others.
     1.4.6. You may use force, to include deadly force, when it appears reasonably necessary to prevent
     the escape of a prisoner who threatens serious bodily harm or death to escorting personnel or other
     persons. During an escape attempt, you must have probable cause to believe the prisoner is attempt-
     ing to escape and that the escaping prisoner poses a threat of serious bodily harm either to yourself or
     others.
     1.4.7. You may use your weapon as a signaling device as a last resort when all other means of com-
     munication have failed or are unavailable, and you are involved in a life-threatening situation. This is
     done by firing three rounds in rapid succession straight into the air away from resources or populated
     areas.

1.5. Special Considerations for the Use of Deadly Force. Fire shots only with due regard for the safety
of innocent bystanders. Do not fire shots if they are likely to endanger innocent bystanders. When possi-
ble, give an order to "HALT" before discharging a firearm to prevent death or serious bodily harm to oth-
ers.
     1.5.1. When you are under hostile attack in protection and recovery operations involving nuclear
     weapons or lethal chemical agents, the presence of innocent bystanders or hostages must not deter you
     from stopping the attack through all means at your disposal.
     1.5.2. When you discharge a firearm, fire it with the intent of rendering the targeted person or persons
     incapable of continuing the activity or course of behavior that led you to shoot. Rendering incapable
     may not require death in every circumstance. Do not fire shots as a warning to suspects except as oth-
     erwise provided by overseas theater directives.
     1.5.3. Commanders may impose further restrictions on the use of deadly force to comply with local
     and host-nation laws. Such restrictions must not unduly compromise the security interests of the
     United States. Commanders must list restrictions imposed by local or host-nation laws in their local
     guidance implementing instruction.
     1.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Special Considerations for the Use of Deadly Force within USAFE.
     Develop local procedures to ensure personnel are trained to give warning orders in English and the
     language of the host nation. The local Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) must be involved in coordination

                                                 Chapter 2

                                     PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

2.1. Authorization To Bear Arms. Before authorizing people to bear firearms, they must fulfill the
training requirements under paragraph 2.10.. They must not bear privately owned firearms while per-
forming official military duty, except as authorized in paragraph 2.8.. Issue an authorization to carry fire-
arms only when you have reason or evidence to believe that life or property may be in jeopardy if you
don’t authorize the individual to carry a weapon. Before issuing authorizations, you must consider the
duty assignment (paragraph 2.3.), suitability rules (paragraph 2.6.), and the possible consequences of
accidental or indiscriminate use of firearms.
     2.1.1. The following individuals may authorize people to openly bear and use firearms:
        2.1.1.1. Installation, center, squadron, and numbered flight commanders, including geographi-
        cally separated unit (GSU) commanders.
        2.1.1.2. Numbered Air Force (NAF), major command (MAJCOM), and wing commanders.
        2.1.1.3. Principal appointees of squadron, installation, GSU, wing, NAF, MAJCOM, division,
        and center commanders when specifically authorized in their respective MAJCOM supplements
        to this instruction.
        2.1.1.4. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) commanders according to AFPD
        71-1, Criminal Investigations and Counterintelligence.
        2.1.1.5. (Added-USAFE) The NATO SOFA and the PfP SOFA, which incorporates the NATO
        SOFA, specifically Article VI authorizes members of the sending state forces to possess and carry
        firearms in the performance of their duties when authorized by their orders. Therefore, the forces
        of the U.S., as a sending State, unless prohibited by this instruction, applicable host nation law, or
        international agreement, are authorized to carry firearms in the performance of official duties.
        Issue in writing whenever possible and after consultation with the staff judge advocate, authoriza-
        tion for off-base possession and carrying of firearms. Article VII, paragraph 6 (a) and paragraph
        10 (a) and (b) of the NATO SOFA are to be considered in determining local policy on joint host
        nation and U.S. investigation and the U.S. forces ability to perform security functions on or off the
        installation. Commanders should consult their staff judge advocate (SJA) for terms of relevant
        bilateral agreements between the U.S. and host nations. Activities involving arming and use of
        force in non-NATO and non-PfP countries must be evaluated with thorough and advance coordi-
        nation through the International Law Division (HQ USAFE/JAI) on a case-by-case basis.
            2.1.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) The HQ USAFE/A7S Chief and Deputy Chief of Security Forces
            are authorized to act as principal appointees for Commander, United States Air Forces in
            Europe (COMUSAFE).
            2.1.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) The 435th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Deputy Commander
            and numbered flight commanders are authorized to act as principal appointees for the 435th
            SFS.
     2.1.2. Only installation commanders (or equivalents), a higher authority, or their designated represen-
     tatives, may authorize their people to bear and use concealed firearms. Exceptions to this rule are
        2.1.2.1. AFOSI commanders, according to AFPD 71-1.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    17


       2.1.2.2. Assigned or gained flying squadron commanders of aircrews armed specifically for pre-
       venting hijacks.
       2.1.2.3. Security forces commanders may authorize security forces personnel to bear concealed
       firearms to meet certain mission requirements such as support of AFOSI operations, SF investiga-
       tions, protection of distinguished visitors, etc.

2.2. Arming Plans. Commanders must develop plans that specifically identify who may bear firearms
and when they may use them. Plans must contain command and control provisions and explain how the
installation will arm selected personnel during specific defense conditions (DEFCON), terrorist threat
conditions (THREATCON), and other military contingencies. Installation commanders must incorporate
these plans into their existing programs for installation security. The commander must insure that those
persons convicted of domestic violence are not armed.
   2.2.1. This instruction applies mainly to peacetime operations. During periods of conflict (declared
   or undeclared war), theater commanders may impose rules of engagement to replace these policies on
   deadly force. Commanders must ensure all armed personnel thoroughly understand the rules of
   engagement. When feasible, publish these rules of engagement in a MAJCOM or local contingency
   plan.
       2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Publish rules of engagement for deadly force during periods of conflict
       in local contingency plans.
   2.2.2. Local commanders must develop criteria consistent with this instruction as well as:
       2.2.2.1. DoD Directive 5210.56, Use of Deadly Force and the Carrying of Firearms by DoD Per-
       sonnel Engaged in Law Enforcement and Security Duties.
       2.2.2.2. Local laws for carrying firearms and using deadly force by contract security forces.

2.3. People Authorized to Bear and Use Firearms. People authorized to bear and use firearms include:
   2.3.1. Military, civilian, and contract security forces members armed with Government-owned fire-
   arms assigned to US Air Force units.
   2.3.2. AFOSI special agents.
   2.3.3. Military aircrews armed to prevent hijacks and protect resources.
   2.3.4. Pararescue members requiring arms in support of antihijacking missions and operational
   deployments.
   2.3.5. Military command post and operations center controllers.
   2.3.6. Military missile combat crews.
   2.3.7. Military munitions maintenance people.
   2.3.8. Military resource augmentation duty (READY) program security forces augmentees and selec-
   tively armed members.
   2.3.9. All drivers for senior USAF officials.

2.4. Arming Groups. All USAF people eligible to bear arms belong to one or more of three arming
groups:
18                                                        AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006


     2.4.1. Group A consists of security forces, AFOSI special agents, and people serving in an Air Force
     specialty (AFS) that specifies qualification to bear firearms as a mandatory requirement (Air Force
     Manual (AFMAN) 36-2105, Officer Classification; or AFMAN 36-2108, Airman Classification, for
     entry, award, and retention of the Air Force specialty code (AFSC). Group A also includes people
     who have a high potential to be in armed conflict, such as members of pararescue units, the Tactical
     Air Control Party, the Air Support Operations Center, and the Special Operations Weather Team Tac-
     tical Element.
     2.4.2. Group B consists of individuals other than those in Group A who arm in peacetime for protec-
     tion of Air Force assets and people. It also includes members who have the potential of engaging in
     armed conflict as part of their wartime operational mission. These would include:
        2.4.2.1. Aircrew members armed for air operations security (i.e. antihijacking).
        2.4.2.2. Primary nuclear airlift force (PNAF) and emergency nuclear airlift force (ENAF) air-
        crews.
        2.4.2.3. Command-post entry controllers.
        2.4.2.4. Couriers.
        2.4.2.5. Designated munitions maintenance personnel.
        2.4.2.6. Weapon custodians.
        2.4.2.7. Armed personnel selected by the commander for peacetime owner/user security.
        2.4.2.8. Explosive ordnance disposal personnel.
        2.4.2.9. Mobile aerial port squadron and flight personnel.
        2.4.2.10. Deployable combat logistics support squadron personnel.
        2.4.2.11. Combat control teams.
        2.4.2.12. Special operations command special tactics personnel.
        2.4.2.13. RED HORSE and PRIME BEEF personnel.
        2.4.2.14. Weather people supporting US Army forces.
        2.4.2.15. Combat communications units deployable or overseas in-place.
        2.4.2.16. Human intelligence (HUMINT) personnel assigned to unit type code (UTC) PFJIT,
        Intelligence Main Operating Base (MOB) Interrogation Team, and PFJCT, HUMINT Collection
        teams.
     2.4.3. Group C consists of members who carry arms in a combat area during wartime, in designated
     hostile fire areas not during wartime, or during an air base defense emergency. It includes Air Force
     personnel other than Group A or B, including all medical staff required to maintain firearms qualifica-
     tion or complete firearms training. It also includes MAJCOM-identified overseas in-place personnel
     (who are not part of Group A or B) and personnel assigned to mobility positions.

2.5. Arming Deployable (Mobility) Forces. Commanders may arm deployable forces to support con-
tingency, wartime, or training operations. A command contingency plan or tasking message provides the
arming requirements for deploying personnel.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     19


   2.5.1. The contingency plan or tasking message describes the type of firearms required, the arming
   mission, the anticipated tasks armed members will perform, and the command and control elements.
   2.5.2. Supported commands develop guidance and procedures on selectively arming and using these
   people.

2.6. Monitoring Suitability to Bear Firearms.
   2.6.1. Commanders must select people for armed duty with great care and continually monitor the
   suitability of their people for armed duty. Commanders must temporarily withdraw the authority to
   bear arms from people who are:
      2.6.1.1. Identified substance abusers.
      2.6.1.2. Emotionally unstable or whose behavior suggests they're incapable of using firearms with
      care.
      2.6.1.3. Determined by medical authority to be suffering from alcohol abuse (K2) or dependence
      (K3).
      2.6.1.4. Taking prescription medication that will impair their ability to use firearms with care.
      Commanders must consult with the responsible physician when medication such as Prozac is pre-
      scribed. The use of prescription medication does not necessarily mean the person cannot bear fire-
      arms. The physician has to make a determination regarding the individual’s access to firearms. If
      the physician determines that the individual should not have access to firearms, this will be docu-
      mented IAW AFI 48-123, Profiles and Duty Limitations.
      2.6.1.5. Relieved of duty for disciplinary reasons.
   2.6.2. Everyone has a special responsibility to stay alert for behavioral signs that arming someone is
   not suitable. If you have information or evidence of impairment of a member's mental or physical
   ability to arm, notify that person's commander immediately. Individuals under the influence of intox-
   icants will not be armed.
   2.6.3. Commanders must evaluate the information and if necessary take immediate action to tempo-
   rarily withdraw the affected person's authority to bear a firearm. If warranted, commanders must also
   deny the person access to any Government-owned or privately owned firearm and associated ammu-
   nition stored in a Government firearm storage facility. Commanders must follow the procedures in
   AFI 44-109, Mental Health and Military Law, in referring individuals for a mental health evaluation.
   2.6.4. The individual's commander, in consultation with the social actions officer and proper medical
   authorities, reviews the temporary status every 180-calendar days to either reaffirm that status or take
   other appropriate action. Commanders may file extensions on a case-by-case basis and normally only
   when their investigation is incomplete, or the member is undergoing medical treatment.
   2.6.5. Commander must not deny assignments, promotions, and reenlistment solely because of the
   temporary withdrawal of the person's authorization to bear a firearm.
   2.6.6. Commanders deciding to withdraw a person's authorization to bear arms for more than 72
   hours must notify the individual in writing of the withdrawal action. Provide a brief synopsis of cir-
   cumstances that form the basis for the withdrawal. Have the individual acknowledge the withdrawal
   action by endorsement on the notification letter. Provide a copy to the affected person and the servic-
   ing armory. Commanders may withdraw authority to bear arms for less than 72 hours by oral notifi-
20                                                       AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006


     cation to the affected person and the servicing armory. The servicing armory will take appropriate
     action to insure a weapon is not issued to a person who’s authority has been withdrawn.
        2.6.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Provide written notification of the withdrawal action to the affected
        person and the servicing armory within 24 hours of oral notification.
     2.6.7. Unit commanders may reinstate a person's authorization upon receiving a favorable report of a
     completed investigation, corrective action, or medical evaluation. Notify the individual and servicing
     armory in writing of the reinstatement. File all correspondence dealing with the withdrawal and/or
     reinstatement in the unit’s personnel information file for 12 months or until the affected person’s
     transfer, retraining, separation, or retirement, whichever comes first.
     2.6.8. Unit commanders or an equivalent authority who believe it's appropriate to permanently with-
     draw a member's authorization to bear firearms must first review the person's duty performance; and
     medical and disciplinary records to ensure warranting of this decision. They should also consult their
     chief of personnel, staff judge advocate, social actions officer, hospital commander, and Chief of
     Security Forces (CSF) before taking this action.
        2.6.8.1. When the person's AFSC specialty description in AFI 36-2105, Officer Classification, or
        AFI 36-2108, Airman Classification, requires qualification to bear firearms, commanders must
        take action according to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Airmen); or
        AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions.
        2.6.8.2. When issuing the permanent withdrawal of authority to bear firearms to a military mem-
        ber, commanders submit a copy of the written withdrawal action to the military personnel flight
        along with those documents withdrawing the affected person's AFSC. NOTE: Follow the same
        process to reinstate an individual's authority to bear a firearm.
        2.6.8.3. The decision to withdraw a person's authority to bear a firearm does not solely justify an
        administrative separation. However, the affected person may need to undergo retraining if he or
        she no longer meets the AFSC requirements outlined in AFI 36-2105 or AFI 36-2108. Command-
        ers review the reason for the withdrawal to determine whether to take disciplinary or administra-
        tive action.
     2.6.9. People whose peacetime authority to bear firearms has been permanently withdrawn may bear
     firearms in wartime or situations requiring immediate action to protect life or property. Commanders
     must weigh the benefits against the possible adverse effects of arming such personnel.
     2.6.10. Persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence are prohibited by the Gun
     Control Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. 922) from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving firearms or
     ammunition. Furthermore, it is a felony for anyone to sell or otherwise dispose of a firearm to any
     person so convicted.
        2.6.10.1. Commanders will take appropriate measures to insure that DoD personnel do not issue
        government owned and privately owned firearms or ammunition to anyone they have reasonable
        cause to believe has ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Com-
        manders will initiate an appropriate investigation to confirm suspected convictions of domestic
        violence.
        2.6.10.2. For personnel found to have a qualifying conviction, the commander will retrieve imme-
        diately all issued firearms and ammunition, withdraw their authority to possess firearms or ammu-
        nition, and advise them to dispose of their privately-owned firearms and ammunition lawfully.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       21


2.7. Documenting the Authorization To Bear Firearms. The appropriate authorizing official must
sign written authorization to carry firearms except in situations requiring immediate action to protect life
or property. Do not issue firearms to anyone who has not successfully completed their required weapons
qualification training as specified in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Pro-
gram.
   2.7.1. Uniformed personnel may be authorized to bear firearms for a continuing period, providing
   they maintain required qualification and get annual use of force training. The written authorization
   may be issued as a single multiple-listing letter, computerized roster, aircrew orders, or other group
   documents. Identify the individual by name, social security number, firearm type, and last qualifica-
   tion date (for that weapon). Send the original authorization letter, roster, aircrew orders, etc., to the
   organization's servicing arms room or armory. AFOSI special agent’s badge and credentials serve as
   written authorization for AFOSI personnel to carry firearms.
       2.7.1.1. (Added-USAFE) For German Units Only: Use USAFE Form 84 for local national
       employees. USAFE Form 84 is a German translation of Air Force Policy Statement - Firearms
       Safety and Use of Force. German Civilian contract guards sign the form to acknowledge under-
       standing of United States Air Force (USAF) Use of Force Policy.
   2.7.2. Besides getting written authorization, personnel not in uniform who have to openly bear fire-
   arms when performing official military duties must:
       2.7.2.1. Obtain an AF Form 523, USAF Authorization To Bear Firearms.
       2.7.2.2. Carry the AF Form 523 when armed.
       2.7.2.3. Surrender the form to the issuing authority when you complete the duties requiring you to
       bear a firearm.
   2.7.3. Standardize AF Form 523 permit numbers. For example, 37SFS 98-0012 refers to the 12th per-
   mit issued in 1998 at by the 37th Security Forces Squadron at Lackland AFB, Texas.
   2.7.4. AF Forms 523 issued for off-base operations require full face photographs. All others contain
   the statement "VALID ON (INSTALLATION NAME) ONLY."

2.8. Exemptions. Uniformed military members performing an operational mission in a combat or hos-
tile-fire zone; or in situations requiring immediate action to protect life or property don't require written
authorization to bear firearms.
   2.8.1. Civilian contract police may bear privately owned firearms if so stated in their Air Force con-
   tract.
   2.8.2. Those performing honor guard duties who use firearms for ceremonial purposes (i.e., no live
   ammunition) need only comply with paragraphs 2.14. - 2.16. of this instruction and with handling
   instructions for the M1 rifle found in AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Loading Procedures

2.9. Carrying Concealed Firearms. The Air Force prohibits all military, civilian, and contract employ-
ees from carrying concealed firearms on duty except when specifically authorized in writing by a fire-
arms-issuing authority and only while performing an official military duty. NOTE: Official aircrew
orders, specifying the USAF member carry a concealed firearm, satisfy the written authorization require-
ment. Military members who violate this provision prohibiting the carrying of a concealed weapon with-
out written authorization are subject to administrative or disciplinary proceedings under Article 92,
22                                                        AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006


Uniformed Code of Military Justice. Civilian employees who violate this provision are subject to admin-
istrative or disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for viola-
tions of related laws.
     2.9.1. Except when it might compromise your mission, always carry AF Form 523 while bearing con-
     cealed firearms. In those cases, the issuing authority retains the form. The permit number on AF
     Form 523 includes the heading "CONCEALED." (These procedures help ensure compatibility
     between US Air Force authorizations to bear concealed firearms and other jurisdictional require-
     ments.)
     2.9.2. MAJCOMs, including the Air National Guard, may authorize personnel to retain an AF Form
     523 when missions require those members to bear a concealed firearm on a regular basis (for example,
     assigned and gained aircrews armed specifically for antihijack purposes).
        2.9.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Personnel authorized to carry concealed firearms will retain AF Form
        523, USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms.
     2.9.3. AFOSI special agent’s badge and credentials authorize the carry of concealed firearms in place
     of the AF Form 523.
     2.9.4. Armed drivers for designated senior Air Force leaders must meet all qualification and training
     requirements established for Arming Group A personnel. They must comply with all provisions of
     this instruction with close attention paid to paragraphs 2.7.2., 2.7.4., and 2.9.1.. They must be knowl-
     edgeable of the Posse Comitatus Act and/or local SOFA agreements as they apply to the carry and use
     of firearms. All drivers will inform the installation security forces, AFOSI detachment, and appropri-
     ate local civil authorities of their arming authorization. Their commander must ensure these individ-
     uals understand their role is that of an “armed driver,” not as a security escort. The USAF protective
     service function belongs solely to AFOSI.

2.10. Training Requirements.
     2.10.1. All armed personnel must meet the level of firearms qualification required by the arming
     group to which they belong as specified in AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program. Only tasked certi-
     fied combat arms instructors (3POX1B/SEI 312, or civilian equivalent) are authorized to conduct the
     weapons qualification programs identified in AFI 36-2226. Document this training in a manner that
     records the name of the individual trained, the date of training, and the name and rank of the individ-
     ual responsible for giving the training. AFSC Functional Managers can impose additional firearms
     proficiency training policies once personnel are weapons qualified in accordance with AFI 36-2226.
     In addition:
        2.10.1.1. Unit commanders must ensure individuals in Arming Group A receive use of force
        training at least once every 12 months.
        2.10.1.2. Unit commanders must ensure individuals in Arming Group B receive use of force
        training before issuance of a firearm. Once given, this training is good for 12 months. NOTE:
        Each unit will be responsible for conducting use-of-force training for assigned personnel.
        2.10.1.3. Unit commanders must ensure Arming Group C individuals receive a briefing on the
        applicable theater rules of engagement before arming for any wartime mission.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                        23


   2.10.2. All MAJCOM identified Air Force personnel receive small arms training before stationing
   overseas according to AFI 36-2226. All personnel assigned to a mobility position receive small arms
   training as prescribed by the qualification group to which they belong.

2.11. Firearm Qualification Extensions.
   2.11.1. Squadron Commander Extensions. The arming authority for the unit may grant one-time
   qualification extensions of up to 120 calendar days. Unit training sections ensure qualification exten-
   sions are posted to the individual’s AF Form 522. Provide the installation Security Forces com-
   mander with a courtesy copy of the extension letter. Note: Do not grant qualification extensions to
   personnel who are identified for deployment to a critical threat area. Their firearms qualifica-
   tion (live-fire) must be current through out the tour length.
       2.11.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Use the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM)-declared threat
       level. If the threat level is declared critical, and personnel already have an extension, those person-
       nel must fire as soon as possible (circumstances permitting).
   2.11.2. Installation-Level Extensions. Installation commanders and senior-level tenant US Air Force
   Reserves (USAFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) offices may grant one-time qualification exten-
   sions of up to 12 continuous months. Qualification extensions significantly decrease an individual’s
   minimum skill proficiency level. For this reason, the below items should be considered before grant-
   ing lengthy extensions.
       2.11.2.1. Impact on the Force Protection mission.
       2.11.2.2. Identify the number of individuals, by organization, that the extension effects and what
       their specific arming requirements are (i.e., peacetime or contingency arming.)
       2.11.2.3. Identify compensatory measures should personnel be required to deploy to a critical
       threat area. Firearms qualification (live-fire) must be current through out the tour length for
       deploying personnel.
       2.11.2.4. Identify the reason for the extension, corrective action, and get well date.
   2.11.3. Notify the Security Forces commander when qualification extensions are approved for instal-
   lation personnel. The granting authority informs each unit of the types of firearms, courses of training,
   duration of extensions, and authorizing documents. Each unit training section ensures qualification
   extensions are posted to the individual's Air Force Form 522.
       2.11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) The granting authority is the munitions support squadron commander
       (MUNSS)/CC.
   2.11.4. MAJCOM Extensions. Qualification extensions required beyond 12 continuous months must
   be approved by the MAJCOM arming authority. Document these extensions by letter format, ensuring
   the type(s)of firearm(s), courses of training, and duration of extension are listed in the letter.
       2.11.4.1. (Added-USAFE) The major command (MAJCOM) arming authority is HQ USAFE/
       A7S. Forward requests to Programs and Resources Division (HQ USAFE/A7SXO), Unit 3050,
       Box 135, APO AE 09094-0135.

2.12. Firearms Safety. Draw or aim firearms only when you believe the lawful use of deadly force rea-
sonably appears necessary unless you are using your weapon as a signaling device as authorized by para-
24                                                         AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006

proceedings under Article 92, Uniformed Code of Military Justice. Civilian employees who violate this
provision are subject to administrative or disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable crim-
inal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
     2.12.1. Remember that when responding to an actual incident where you could reasonably expect to
     meet an armed adversary, respond with your firearm ready according to Attachment 5. You must
     base any decision to chamber a round of ammunition in a firearm that’s not normally carried with a
     round chambered, or draw a pistol from the holster, on the circumstances you’re facing and the threat
     present. AFOSI special agents follow the guidance set forth by their functional managers.
        2.12.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Respond with your firearms ready only when responding to an actual
        incident where you could reasonably expect to meet an armed adversary.
     2.12.2. Note that tactical exercises using multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)
     equipment or blank ammunition are exempt from the paragraph 2.11.. provisions. Field operating
     agencies (FOAs) and/or MAJCOMs must specify the safety requirements for using blank ammuni-
     tion.
        2.12.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Do not fire blank ammunition (with the exception of .38 caliber
        blanks used in military working dog training) from a weapon that is not equipped with a blank
        adapter. Do not fire blank ammunition at individuals within 20 feet of the shooter’s position. For
        guidance on ground combat skills, force-on-force, and live intruder play refer to AFI 36-2225
        USAFE Supplement, Security Forces Training and Standardization Evaluations Program.
     2.12.3. Do not load firearms when stored. EXCEPTION: Aircrew members performing anti-hijack
     missions and military personnel involved in actual combat.

     ons Loading Procedures, when armed with a US Air Force owned weapon. HQ AFSFC/SFO must
     approve any deviations to these procedures before MAJCOMs or units implement them.
     2.12.6. Clear firearms for duty only under the supervision of a trained clearing barrel attendant who
     has access to a clearing barrel. Clearing barrel attendants must know the clearing procedures for all
     firearms loaded and unloaded at their clearing area. EXCEPTIONS:
        2.12.6.1. Personnel engaged in combat, weapons qualification training, or training exercises sim-
        ulating combat.
        2.12.6.2. AFOSI personnel will follow guidelines specified in AFOSI Instruction 71-110, Arming
        and Use of Force for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
     2.12.7. You may use a firearm as an emergency signaling device when no other means of communi-
     cation is available to sound an alarm or when available communication means have failed. To signal,
     fire three shots in rapid succession straight up into the air, while considering that the fired round will
     come down somewhere. Do not fire shots indoors or when you might endanger innocent bystanders
     or nearby property.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      25


   2.12.8. When personnel are required to store government-issued firearms at a residence or non-gov-
   ernment location, they will use child safety lock devices. Safety locks and instructions for their proper
   use are to be provided with all issued government firearms by the agency that issues the firearm.

2.13. Peacetime Firearms Discharges. Commanders must investigate all peacetime accidental and
deliberate firearm discharges. You must immediately report peacetime discharges to your commander,
the commander of the person who discharged the firearm (if different), and the security forces. Failing to
report these incidents is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
   2.13.1. The commander of the person who discharged a firearm:
       2.13.1.1. Immediately begins an investigation of the incident or contacts the security forces for
       investigative assistance.
       2.13.1.2. Immediately withdraws (temporarily) the person's authorization to bear a firearm until
       the completion of the investigation and, if necessary, until the person completes a remedial fire-
       arms training course.
       2.13.1.3. Takes immediate corrective action, including applicable administrative or disciplinary
       action, if the investigation reveals the person used the firearm negligently or has a training defi-
       ciency.

       evidence shows the person discharged the firearm according to established policy.
   2.13.2. If a US military member, contract employee, or a civilian employed by the US military dis-
   charges a Government-owned firearm and the incident involves an injury, fatality, or possible adverse
   publicity, the installation commander:
       2.13.2.1. Reports the incident using the OPREP-3/BEELINE message format.
       2.13.2.2. Sends the message to HQ USAF/SF and HQ AFSFC/SFO within 24 hours of the inci-
       dent. Report Control Symbol HAF-XOO(AR)7118 covers this report. It is designated emergency
       status code C1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions. Priority. Continue reporting

       2.13.2.4. Sends a written follow-up report in a lesson learned format (Attachment 6) within 45
       calendar days of the discharge to all original addressees. Criminal investigations by security
       forces investigations or AFOSI into the shooting do not alleviate the need for this report. (When
       unauthorized firearm discharges don’t involve an injury, fatality, or possible adverse publicity,
       report the incidents according to MAJCOM or FOA instructions. Forward information on inci-
       dents from which we can learn significant lessons to HQ AFSFC/SFOP.)

2.14. Arming Senior Military and Civilian Officials. The heads of the DoD components, or their des-
ignees, may authorize senior military and civilian officials to carry firearms in overseas areas. Theater
commanders issue authorization for Air Force personnel in overseas areas. Arm only for personal protec-
tion in high-threat overseas areas in which intelligence analysis identifies a credible threat against US per-
sonnel. Issue authorizations to carry firearms on a case-by-case basis for a specified assignment.
     2.14.1. Before issuing authorizations to carry firearms for personal protection, commanders must
     weigh:
        2.14.1.1. The likelihood of the threat in a particular location.
        2.14.1.2. The adequacies of DoD protective personnel support.

        are not permanently assigned should contact their SJA or the U.S. embassy military liaison repre-
        sentative, as well as, the Transportation Management Office to ensure compliance with host
        nation laws, notifications, and transportation requirements.
     2.14.4. Commanders must ensure compliance with host-nation law and applicable status-of-forces
     agreements (SOFA).

2.15. Carrying Firearms as a Passenger aboard Aircraft. US Air Force military, civilian, and con-
tract personnel may bear Government firearms aboard military or commercial aircraft while performing
official military duties if the mission requires you to carry a firearm during the flight. All personnel car-
rying weapons aboard commercial aircraft will comply with Federal Aviation Administration guidelines
and training requirements. All personnel carrying firearms aboard military aircraft will notify the aircraft
commander prior to flight.

2.17. Local Civilian and Host-Nation Restrictions. Only Air Force theater commanders may authorize
personnel to bear arms in any foreign country for other than routine law enforcement and security duties.
Commanders may impose restrictions not contained in this instruction based on host-nation laws. MAJ-
COMs list any additional restrictions in a supplement to this instruction or in a foreign clearance guide
when a supplement isn't feasible.
   2.17.1. (Added-USAFE) Local Civilian and Host Nation Restrictions. Refer to DoD 4500.54-G,

ority A, B, or C resource and you encounter no hostile weapons fire, you must challenge, detain, and iden-
tify all intruders or suspected intruders.
   A2.1.1. If the suspects are compliant on the use of force model and obey the challenge, turn them
   over to appropriate security forces.
   A2.1.2. If the intruders or suspects are resistant, on the use of force model, and do not obey the chal-
   lenge, and penetrate a restricted area boundary or are inside a restricted area and do not endanger a
   Priority A, B, or C resource, use compliance techniques to isolate the intruders and physically appre-
   hend them. You must base the level of force you employ on your perception of risk to the assets.

A2.2. When faced with an apparent hostile attempt to penetrate a restricted area boundary, to gain access
to a Priority A, B, or C resource, or to steal, damage, or destroy such areas or resources, and hostile weap-
ons fire is involved or weapons are displayed, you may use deadly force, on the use of force model, if
necessary to stop the hostile act. You must base the level of force you employ on your perception of risk
to the assets.

A2.3. When faced with a hostile attempt to seize a nuclear asset, you must take all possible actions,
including the use of deadly force, on the use of force model, to stop such an act. If hostages are involved,
their safety and welfare must not deter you from taking prompt, decisive, and effective action, including
the use of deadly force, to prevent the unauthorized access to, removal of, or recovery of a nuclear

PERSONALITY AND BEHAVIOR FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT SUITABILITY TO BEAR
                             FIREARMS

A3.1. The personality and behavioral factors below are presented in categories so they may be more eas-
ily recognized. There is no magic number of these factors that suggests a personality or behavioral disor-
der. Rather, it is the extent to which the noted factor(s) is a change; that is, different from what is
considered "normal" that makes a factor important. Finally, it is the duration (how long the factor has
been present/how long it lasts), the frequency (how often it happens), and the intensity (strength) of the
factor that suggest the severity of the personality or behavioral trait.
     A3.1.1. Factors Relating to Thinking and Attitude:
        A3.1.1.1. Suspiciousness. Individual seems unable to trust others, is jealous, complains of plots
        against him or her, and sees hidden meanings in personal slights.
        A3.1.1.2. Arrogance. Individual assumes or presumes the possession of superior or unique ideas
        or abilities.
        A3.1.1.3. Lack of Humor. Especially the inability to laugh at one's self, at one's mistakes, or one's
        weaknesses.
        A3.1.1.4. Inflexibility. Especially in accepting new ideas originating among others.
        A3.1.1.5. Preoccupation. Sticking to one idea to the exclusion of almost all other thoughts so
        those relationships with others are strained and ranges of interests are severely narrowed.
        A3.1.1.6. Sensitivity. Particularly concerning status, where the individual is overly concerned
        with being left out, ignored, ridiculed, or talked about.
        A3.1.1.7. Arguing. When accompanied by the development of a personal logic to support
        unusual or unrealistic ideas.
     A3.1.2. Factors Related to Behavior or Activity:
        A3.1.2.1. Impulsiveness. Acts without considering the consequences, is easily distracted, seeks
        enjoyment of the moment to the exclusion of long-range goals, craves excitement, and may talk
        about disasters, violence, or destruction.
        A3.1.2.2. Destructiveness. May involve impulsive damage to military equipment.
        A3.1.2.3. Temper Tantrums. Childish outbursts of anger, sulking, or pouting over minor disap-
        pointments.
        A3.1.2.4. Agitation. Excessive restlessness due to emotional tension.
        A3.1.2.5. Excessive Talking. Particularly when no logical thought is communicated to the lis-
        tener.
        A3.1.2.6. Decreased Talking. Usually accompanied by boredom, listlessness, and apparent disin-
        terest.
        A3.1.2.7. Accident Prone. May show apparent disregard for safety procedures.
     A3.1.3. Factors Related to Awareness or Level of Consciousness:

     A3.1.3.1. Alcohol and Drug Intoxication. May cause loss of inhibitions, poor judgment, or phys-
     ical impairment.
     A3.1.3.2. Fainting Spells. May have both physical and emotional causes.
     A3.1.3.3. Sleep Attacks (Narcolepsy). Uncontrollable episodes of sleeping that may interfere
     with functional reliability.
     A3.1.3.4. Seizures (Epilepsy). May have convulsions, with or without complete loss of con-
     sciousness; trance-like states; attacks of inappropriate rage or repetitive, stereotyped behavior.
     A3.1.3.5. Sleepwalking. Individual may injure themselves or damage property while apparently
     asleep.
     A3.1.3.6. Daydreaming. Individual preoccupied with internal thoughts and fantasies with lack of

     accompanied by excessive physical activity, lack of sleep, excitement, and excessive talking.
     A3.1.4.2. Unusual Sadness. May indicate significant depression, particularly when accompanied
     by hopelessness, self-condemnation, dejection, feelings of guilt, pessimism, poor sleep, fatigue,
     loss of appetite, slow physical activity, or loss of interest in job and family.
     A3.1.4.3. Attempted Suicide. Particularly significant when attempted through the deliberate use
     of a firearm. Factors predictive of suicide include a history of previous suicide attempts, suicidal
     threats, depression, serious physical illness, alcoholism, loss of a loved one through death or
     divorce, financial or job reversals with loss of self-esteem, and apparent preparations for death,
     such as an unusual interest in wills and life insurance.
     A3.1.4.4. Suicide Gestures. May represent significant emotional disorder and require medical
     evaluation.
     A3.1.4.5. Hypochondria. Imagined illness. Disagreements with doctors who are pictured as not
     understanding.
     A3.1.4.6. Complaints of headaches, back pain, or abdominal pains without evidence of physical
     illness or medical evaluation.
     A3.1.4.7. Hostility. Particularly expressions of hostility towards one's country.

              INDICATOR OF DIFFICULTY IN COPING EARLY WARNING SIGNS

A4.1. The stress reactions below are presented in categories so that they may be more easily recognized
and understood. There is no magic number of these symptoms that suggests difficulty in coping, rather it
is the extent to which the noted reaction is a change that is different from a person's normal condition that
makes a reaction potentially important. It is the combined presence of symptoms that determines the
potency of the problem. Indicators may be isolated reactions or combinations among the three categories
listed below. Finally, it is their duration (how long the symptoms have been present/how long they last),
the frequency of such incidents (how often they happen), and the intensity (strength) with which they are
present that suggest the severity of the difficulty of coping.

                           EMERGENCY RESPONSES WITH FIREARMS

A5.1. When responding to an actual incident where you can reasonably expect to meet an armed adver-
sary, respond with firearms ready as follows:
     A5.1.1. When armed with the M16 rifle or the GAU-5A, GAU-5A/A, or GUU-5P, carry it at "port
     arms," a round in the chamber, safety selector on "SAFE," and the finger not in the trigger guard.
     A5.1.2. When armed with the M870, M12 or M500 shotgun, carry it at "port arms," safety selector on
     "ON," a round in the chamber, and finger not in the trigger guard.
     A5.1.3. When armed with the M9 (9mm) pistol (except AFOSI special agents), carry it in its holster
     at "ready pistol," flap open, shooting hand on the pistol grip, hammer not cocked, and finger not in the
     trigger guard.
     A5.1.4. AFOSI special agents will follow guidance set forth in AFOSI Instruction 71-110, Arming
     and Use of Force for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
     A5.1.5. When armed with the M203 grenade launcher attached to a M16 rifle, follow the instructions
     for the M16 rifle (A5.1.1.). You will chamber a 40mm round only when use is deemed necessary.
     A5.1.6. When armed with the M79 grenade launcher, carry it at “port-arms,” chamber empty, safety
     selector on “SAFE,” and the finger not in the trigger guard. You will chamber a round only when the
     use of a 40mm round is deemed appropriate.
     A5.1.7. When armed with the M60 machine gun, carry it at "port arms, "half loaded" or "full loaded"
     depending upon MAJCOM directives, safety lever on "SAFE," and finger not in the trigger guard.

                                  DEVELOPMENT
            PRESENTATION INSTRUCTOR’S NOTES

Lesson Objective: Identify basic facts and/or principles about the
Use of Force Policy.

Use of Force Policy - Governing Directives (AFI 31-207 and AFMAN
31-222.).

Introduction: Air Force personnel use only that force which is
reasonably necessary. Avoid the use of force not essential to carrying
out assigned responsibilities.
    - Tailor the type and level of force to its necessity. You must base
your use of force option on the actions of the individual(s) with whom
you are in contact.
   - Once a particular level of force is no longer required, you must
discontinue its use despite the fact a suspect’s efforts to thwart or evade
a seizure may arouse normal passions of anger, fear, or frustration.
  - If you use excessive force in discharging your assigned
responsibilities, you are subject to administrative or judicial action.
   - Authority for such action is in the UCMJ, Article 92; or United
States, local, or host-nation laws.

Lesson Objective: Identify the principles and practices of the Use of
Force Model.

Introduction: The USAF Use of Force Program: The proactive
management of use of force is critical to mission effectiveness. The risk
of liability or bad publicity from the excessive use of force is indeed an
ever-present issue in today’s society. The following information is
designed to prepare Air Force personnel to more effectively apply and
explain their application of force. As the information is presented, keep
these two main principles in mind:
  - Force: any effort or energy to detain or control.
  - Force can be used when objectively reasonable.

Use of Force Model - Designed to assist you in the overall knowledge,
understanding, and application of proper force management. The Model
replaces all reference to intent, opportunity, and capability.
  a. A consolidated effort to educate and train Air Force members in
Use of Force issues begins with the use of a visual aid to facilitate
learning of the various levels of force and the appropriate responses.
The UFM is a three-sided, five-tier structure. It is the basis by which
discussions and questions will be addressed as to how much force is
appropriate for a variety of situations with which you may be faced
during training exercises and real world situations.
  b. The UFM describes the progression or de-escalation of force based
upon the demonstrated level of compliance or resistance. Ideally, each
encounter flows in a logical and legal sequence of cause and effect
based upon reasonable perception of risk, causing you to escalate,
de-escalate, or maintain a level of appropriate force to gain or maintain
control of the subject.
  c. The elements involved in the use of force; risk perception, subject
action, and “officer response” is essential for a balanced use of force.
      (1) Subject Action - the action (s) perceived by the “reasonable
officer” that place the subject in one or more of the Model’s compliant /
non-compliant categories.
      (2) Risk Perception - the situations that are perceived by the
“reasonable officer” within a confrontational environment which
present a risk or potential risk to officer safety. Issues including the
severity of the crime, degree of subject non-compliance, knowledge of
the subject’s previous actions, etc., can act as a test for reasonableness
and a criteria for placement in one or more of the perception categories
on the UFM
     (3) “Officer Response” - the “balanced” response the reasonable
officer could and/or would select from the UFM’s identified categories,
in order to maintain or re-gain subject compliance and control.
  d. Each of these elements are integrated in a tri-facet, five tier, color
enhanced structure: the Use of Force Model. The proper perception
and assessment of risk is the core consideration in the decision-making
process toward proper force utilization. It is the functional foundation
for the two other major model categories and integral to their
understanding and application. To enhance this role and its retention,
color has been selected as an essential medium for the message. These
five categories and their color correlation include:
  - PROFESSIONAL - the broad foundation of the UFM represented
by the blue baseline of the risk perception spectrum. Here the officer is
engaged in duties with occupationally produced perception of
responsibilities and risks.
  - TACTICAL - the second category on the UFM is depicted by the
color green. At this level the officer perceives an increase of risk within
the confrontational environment and safety strategies are deployed.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                           43

  - THRESHOLD - the third category on the UFM utilizes the color
yellow to indicate an activated degree of alertness, where specific risks
are identified by the officer. (Many times this category represents the
most critical intervening level or phase within a confrontation. If the
officer assesses the subject's actions properly he may be able to stabilize
the degree of non-compliance at a resistant level before it escalates to an
actual assault on the officer or others. Here, a tactical plan of action
must be developed and deployed to gain compliance and control. This
advanced degree of risk potential should motivate the officer to increase
the level of receptiveness more formally away from the actor and more
directly toward the actions of the subject and others present.)
  - HARMFUL - at this category on the UFM the color orange denotes
an accelerated perception of danger and a more directed focus on
officer/citizen safety and defense.
  - LETHAL - the highest category of risk on the Model correlates to
the most intense color in the light spectrum, red. This potentially lethal
category of risk is the most infrequent and yet the most crucial for
officer/citizen.
   e. Subject Action consists of five categories of perceived subject
actions, potentially providing the additional foundational focus for an
appropriate, "balanced" response of controlling force. Note that
absolute definitions and/or demarcations of human conduct are in reality
difficult, if not impossible, to identify with great specificity. However,
the “reasonable officer’s” perceptions of the subject’s action (s) are a
necessary portion of the officer’s decision-making process toward
proper force utilization. The five categories of subject action include:
  - COMPLIANT - within the normal realm of interaction, the vast
majority of officer/subject encounters are positive and co-operative. The
officer maintains or gains compliance to desired directives via options
of tradition, time, communication skills, etc.
   - RESISTANT (Passive) - in some confrontational contacts, the
subject may offer a preliminary level of non-compliance. Here the
subject’s degree of non-compliance is free of physical or mechanical
enhancement, other than sheer unresponsiveness.
  - RESISTANT (Active) - at this level, the subject's non-compliance
has become more active in scope and intensity. The indifference to
control has increased to a level of energy enhanced physical or
mechanical defiance.
  - ASSAULTIVE (Bodily Harm) - the officer's attempt to gain lawful
compliance has met with active, non-compliance culminating in an
actual attack upon the officer or others. Here, the scope and severity of
the attack, would not support the reasonable officer’s assessment of
death or serious bodily harm to occur to the officer or others.
   - ASSAULTIVE (Serious Bodily Harm/Death) - this category
represents the least encountered, yet most serious risk to officer safety.
Here the reasonable officer could conclude that the officer or another, is
subject to death or great bodily harm as a result of the subject's actions.
  f. Officer Response facet of the UFM consists of the five categories
of officer initiated response, “balanced” in regard to the officer’s
reasonable assessment of risk and subject action.
   - COOPERATIVE CONTROLS - includes the fundamentals of
professional training capitalizing upon the acceptance of authority by
the use of a variety of controls including; communication skills,
common tactics, body language, etc.
44                                                                    AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006

  - CONTACT CONTROLS - in this first instance of non-compliance
the officer must deploy tactical talents to proportionately gain control
and cooperation through "hands on" techniques designed primarily to
guide or direct the subject. The primary force component at this level
could be transitional tactics, non-pain compliance techniques, etc.,
under the heading of RESISTANT (Passive)
COUNTERMEASURES.
  - COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES - tactical procedures at this level
now must address the non-compliant subject who has begun to use
physical or mechanical energy to enhance non-compliance. The officer
deploys “balanced” force to overcome this non-compliance, while
remaining increasingly vigilant for more aggressive behavior from the
subject. At this stage the force forms could include elements of pain
compliance, chemical irritants, joint restraints, etc. under the heading of
RESISTANT (Active) COUNTERMEASURES.
   - DEFENSIVE TACTICS - at this stage in the confrontation, the
non-compliant subject now directs an assaultive act toward the officer
or others. The officer is justified in taking appropriate steps to
immediately cease the assaultive action and to gain compliance and
maintain control of the subject. Forms of force could include weapon
strikes under the heading of ASSAULTIVE (Bodily Harm)
COUNTERMEASURES.
  - DEADLY FORCE - the officer is now confronted with an assaultive
situation that reaches the ultimate degree of danger. Absolute and
immediate tactics must be deployed to stop the lethal risk and secure
conclusive compliance and control. Force options could include those
leading to permanent debilitation or even death, and are identified under
the heading of ASSAULTIVE (Serious Bodily Harm/Death)
COUNTERMEASURES.
  g. Within each level of the UFM, the intensity of the color increases
as we move from the Subject Action Categories, through the categories
of Risk Perception, and to the Officer Response Categories. In each
application, the intensity of the color is always superior at the correlated
Officer Response Category. This visualization of color intensity is used
to enhance the understanding and maintain the principle that the officer
must maintain constant, controlled superiority over the subject's degree
of non-compliance at a "balanced" level of objectively reasonable force
utilization.
   h. The double headed assessment/selection arrows indicate the
dynamic and fluid nature of the processing of information toward
proper decision-making during a confrontation. The principle incorpo-
rated into proper compliance and control is that of tactical transition,
which includes escalation, stabilization, and/or de-escalation in force
applications. The properly trained member will be conditioned to flow
with the circumstances of the specific situation to properly control the
confrontation. The center portion of each of the arrows is presented in
white to indicate that each incident must be primarily based on the infor-
mation currently being presented and not unduly influenced by previous
contacts with the subject or the situation, either positive or negative.
  i. Each arrow is bordered with the survival shadow in red. This color
enhancement is provided to indicate and maintain the constant retention
of lethal risk perception, inherent in any officer/subject confrontation.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                           45

   j. The UFM supports the widely accepted premise and practice of
progressive application of force. This simply implies the process of
appropriate selection of force options in response to reasonable
assessment of risks presented in the confrontation; the level of
compliance or degrees of non-compliance from the individual to be
controlled; and proper selection of an objectively reasonable response.
Each officer/citizen confrontation should flow in a logical and legal
sequence of cause and effect. The member's tactical transition must be
capable of escalation or engagement, stabilization of the situation, or
de-escalation or disengagement within the context of the confrontation
toward the eventual goal of compliance and control.
  k. Progressive Application of Force encompasses three main elements
of action and assessment: tools, tactics, and timing.
   - Tools include the two broad forms of subject control; mental
manipulation (verbal skills, body language, officer presence, etc.) and
physical manipulation (weaponless controls, weapons, restraints, etc.).
   - The tactics encompass the actual application of these tools into
actual strategies deemed necessary and viable in the confrontational
setting.
   - Timing is demonstrated by the degree of actual force deemed
necessary; based upon the “reasonable officer's” ongoing assessment of
risks, the “reasonable officer's” perceived actions of the subject, and the
available options of control; measured in terms of reasonableness.
  l. Apply force with the appropriate tool.
     (1) Tools available at the first level (Cooperative Controls) would
include:
   - Mental Preparation: Perception skills, risk assessment, and survival
orientation.
  - Spatial Positioning: Stance, body language, and relative positioning.
    - Verbal Controls: Communication skills, interviewing, and
behavioral assessment.
  - Individual searching techniques: Frisk techniques, opposite sex
searches, position (standing, prone).
   - Apprehension Tactics: Single/Dual subject, escort controls and
transport controls.
  - Military work dog presence.
     (2) Tools available at the second level (Compliance Techniques)
include those in the first level and:
   - Verbal Manipulation Techniques: Targeted towards changing the
behavior of an individual (basic conflict management) or of a group of
individuals (basic crisis management).
  - Handcuffing Techniques: Standing and prone
  - Wrist elbow position
  - Hand rotation position
     (3) Tools available at the third level (Compliance Techniques)
besides those available in the first and second include:
  - Neuromuscular controls
  - Chemical irritant application.
    - Baton used as leverage devices or in pain compliance role
(non-striking)
  - K-9 (off leash).
     (4) Tools available at the fourth level (Defensive Tactic) include
those from the three levels below and:
  - Escape Techniques: For use in escape from grabs and chokes.
   - Assault defenses: To include use of head, hands, elbows, feet and
knees in warding off or countering the subject assault.
46                                                                    AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006

   - Impact Weapons: To include the baton or riot stick as well as
anything at hand for use in fending off or gaining control of the subject.
Blocks, strikes, and jabs to non-lethal areas would be justified.
  - Weapon retention.
    (5) Tools available at Level V (Deadly Force) include those formerly
outlined in Levels I-IV and Firearms.
  m. Three tactical issues should be noted.
     (1) The principle strategic focus in the enforcement environment is
to continue to promote and practice the confrontation equation; which
by definition is simply the officer remaining in a constant position of
recognizable advantage within any confrontation, while the subject
stays in a continued position of recognizable disadvantage. One vivid
and viable illustration of this tactical equation is the practice of the 2 on
1 advantage ratio of officers to subject, as the rule, rather than the
exception.
     (2) The focus toward the confrontation should be primarily placed
upon the "actions" of the subject, rather than the important, but
secondary attributes of the "actor" in the situation. Certainly the "who"
involved is of concern (i.e. past actions, previous history of violence, the
subject's size/strength, etc.), but primary focus needs to be directed
toward "what" is happening at the time - what the subject is doing. The
“reasonable officer” must guard against being lulled into complacency
by past knowledge of the subject, or placing himself in crisis by
pre-judging a mode of force utilization based upon previous contact, not
present at this point in time.
     (3) When placed into a confrontation, the “reasonable officer” must
expand his perspective from the common practice of “reaction” into a
more strategic confrontational conduct of an action initiated response.
  - This response should be pro-active, drawn upon the expertise and
experience with the actual subject and situations, or other similar
participants and incidents. The officer should remain free of the
pressure to pre-judge the actions of the subject, and gain the enhanced
ability to more properly perceive the actual and/or potential actions of
the subject in question.
   - Ideally, the officer should practice anticipatory behavior (stress
reduction techniques, conflict avoidance/resolution tactics, fear
management skills, etc.) to attempt to prevent potential non-compliant
confrontations. Or, if a conflict is perceived as inevitable, he should
initiate procedures to provide sufficient systems (strategic planning,
team tactics, etc.) to maximize the status of safety for himself, others,
and the actual subject.
  - The response must be active, in that the controlling tactics the officer
initiates will accomplish the re-control of the subject with a high degree
of effectiveness and safety to the officer and to others. In this manner,
the confrontation can be controlled as efficiently as possible, thus
avoiding the selection of higher levels of force utilization with the
inherent risks of greater potential injury to the officer, the subject, or
others.
AFI31-207_USAFE_I 22 SEPTEMBER 2006                                            47

   - And finally, the response must be re-active, directing the officer's
actions toward a mode of prevention via the tactical application of
"Lesson’s Learned", or response based research. Most confrontations
are not unique or remain isolated in time, their components will re-occur
at other times with other subjects. If a safe, successful solution evolves,
the officer should follow that course of response in the future. If the
solution is not found, the officer should use the past experience as a
catalyst to seek a safe, strategic, future solution.
  - This principled, status of safety, can only be maintained if the officer
strategically and systematically anticipates, assesses, and acts within the
effective and accepted parameters of the situation. The officer must
understand that this process, and its products exist in an environment
that is ever changing in definition, direction, and depth.

Lesson Objective: Identify the principles and practices of the Use of
Deadly Force. The use of deadly force must meet the ‘objective
reasonableness’ standard. Use deadly force only when facing
conditions of extreme necessity, when all lesser means of force aren't
feasible or have failed, and only under one or more of these
circumstances as set forth in DoD Directive 5210.56.
   a. You may use force, including deadly force, when you reasonably
believe yourself or others to be in imminent danger of death or serious
bodily harm.
   b. You may use force, including deadly force, to protect DoD assets
designated as vital to the national security. The DoD designates its
assets as "vital to the national security" only when their loss, damage, or
compromise would seriously jeopardize the fulfillment of a national
defense mission. This normally includes priority A, B, or C assets as
defined in AFI 31-101, Air Force Physical Security Program.
Installation commanders must identify the resources specifically
designated as vital to national security, or the procedures they will use
to inform armed personnel of such specifically designated property in
their installation security plan.
   c. You may use force, to include deadly force, to protect DoD assets
not involving the national security but inherently dangerous to others.
Designate these resources as such if their theft or sabotage would
present a substantial danger of death or serious bodily harm to others.
This category includes weapons, ammunition, missiles, rockets,
explosives, chemical agents, and special nuclear material. Installation
commanders must identify the resources specifically designated as
inherently dangerous to others or the procedures they will use to inform
armed personnel of such specifically designated property in their
installation security plan and installation resources protection plan.
These assets include, but are not limited to, Hamlet, Redeye, Stinger,
Dragon, Viper, and other anti-armor nonnuclear ready-to-fire missiles;
light automatic firearms; heavy machine guns; mortars; grenade
launchers; flame throwers; handguns, rifles, and shotguns; recoilless
rifles; explosive and incendiary hand grenades; explosive mines; high
explosives such as TNT, dynamite, and C-4 plastic; high explosive fuses
and detonation cord; blasting caps, bulk riot control agents; and
associated ammunition for the above firearms.
   d. You may use force, including deadly force, to prevent the
commission of a serious offense involving violence and threatening
death or serious bodily harm.

  e. You may use force; to include deadly force, when it reasonably
appears necessary to arrest, apprehend, or prevent the escape of a person
suspected of committing an offense of the nature specified in paragraphs
1.3.1. 1.3.2., 1.3.3., and 1.3.4..
  f. You may use force, to include deadly force, when it appears
reasonably necessary to prevent the escape of a prisoner who threatens
serious bodily harm or death to escorting personnel or other persons.
During an escape attempt, you must have probable cause to believe the
prisoner is attempting to escape and that the escaping prisoner poses a
threat of serious bodily harm either to yourself or others.

Lesson Objective: Identify Special Considerations for the Use of
Deadly Force. Fire shots only with due regard for the safety of
innocent bystanders. Do not fire shots if they are likely to endanger
innocent bystanders. When possible, give an order to "HALT" before
discharging a firearm to prevent death or serious bodily harm to others.
  a. When you are under hostile attack in protection and recovery
operations involving nuclear weapons or lethal chemical agents, the
presence of innocent bystanders or hostages must not deter you from
stopping the attack through all means at your disposal.
  b. When you discharge a firearm, fire it with the intent of rendering
the targeted person or persons incapable of continuing the activity or
course of behavior that led you to shoot. Rendering incapable may not
require death in every circumstance. Do not fire shots as a warning to
suspects except as otherwise provided by overseas theater directives.
  c. Commanders may impose further restrictions on the use of deadly
force to comply with local and host-nation laws. Such restrictions must
not unduly compromise the security interests of the United States.
MAJCOMs must list restrictions imposed by local or host-nation laws in
their supplements to this instruction.

CONCLUSION: Use of Force Model can and should become a
mechanism for use in understanding the dynamics of force utilization.
Its implied principles can and must be transmitted from the classroom to
the street.

The Use of Force Model provides an additional degree of clarity and
focus to this critical topic of contemporary law enforcement.
Remember, the Model and its implementation is your responsibility.

                                             Attachment 8

                               IC 99-1 TO AFI 31-207,
                 ARMING AND USE OF FORCE BY AIR FORCE PERSONNEL
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This interim change (IC) 99-1 corrects administrative errors in the document.
2.12.1. Remember that when responding to an actual incident where you could reasonably expect to meet
an armed adversary, respond with your firearm ready according to Attachment 5. You must base any
decision to chamber a round of ammunition in a firearm that’s not normally carried with a round cham-
bered, or draw a pistol from the holster, on the circumstances you’re facing and the threat present. AFOSI
special agents follow the guidance set forth by their functional managers.
