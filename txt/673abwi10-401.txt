Section A—GENERAL PLANS PROGRAM GUIDANCE

1. Program Requirement. Most units on JBER are routinely involved with planning for
contingencies that could impact JBER missions. Many JBER units maintain planning guidance
for deploying personnel and equipment to support contingencies away from the installation.
Often the unit representatives appointed as OPR for their plans program have little to no
experience in this additional duty assignment. This instruction was developed to provide units
the tools needed to effectively manage and operate their plans program. It includes program
requirements and provides concise step by step procedures to follow when developing a new
plan, reviewing an existing plan, and staffing a plan.
2. Operational Context:
   2.1. Operational Focus. The Plans program is an organization function with the goal of
   establishing procedures and guidelines to optimize mission effectiveness. The 673 ABW
   Plans Program Manager (PM) and unit plans representatives will ensure implementation
   across organizational and functional commands.
   2.2. Operational Effectiveness. The Plans program requires dedicated individuals that will
   analyze, prepare, draft, and revise operational procedures into a written document. Plans
   must be coordinated through subject matter experts (SME) to ensure accuracy, staffed
   through leadership for approval, and disseminated to all pertinent participants.
3. Security:
   3.1. Operations Security (OPSEC).            Protection of plans, checklists and plans
   correspondence is vital to the security of operations. All plans representatives must remain
   aware at all times of the need to safeguard critical information. Plans representatives must
   incorporate a strong sense of OPSEC responsibility into all plans and checklists.
   3.2. Classified Storage.
       3.2.1. The wing plans PM and unit representatives will ensure plans are stored
       appropriately based on their classification in accordance with DoD 5200.1-R, paragraph
       C6.3., Information Security Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
       Management.
       3.2.2. Units may store classified materials at other agencies when the volume of
       classified material or frequency of use does not justify maintaining a safe. Place the
       classified material in a sealed envelope. Mark the envelope on the front and back with
       the highest classification of the material contained in the envelope. The owner agency
       provides the storage agency a memorandum list of names, functional address symbols,
       and security clearances of personnel authorized access to the envelope. The owner
       agency reviews the material quarterly. The reviewing official dates and signs the
       envelope following each review. Use AF Form 614, Charge-out Record, when the
       envelope is temporarily removed. Establish procedures where all classified material is
       returned to the safe before the end-of-the-day checks.
4. Roles and Responsibilities:
   4.1. The 673 ABW Commander will:
4                                                      673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011

Section D—- Plan Process

9. Purpose. To help ensure a smooth transition from plan development or review to plan
completion, the following guidance should be followed in this chapter and throughout the
instruction. All offices that have a requirement to produce a plan should notify their unit plans
 12                                                    673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011


representative to ensure proper management and coordination. All OPRs will consult unit plans
representatives and AF directives and/or guidance before drafting, revising or rescinding a plan
to ensure compliance.
   9.1. Plan OPR Determination. The OPR is determined by the source document requiring
   the plan or as directed by 673 ABW/XPX. The OPR will be responsible for overseeing
   development and coordinate with unit plans representatives for proper staffing.
   9.2. Program Review. Unit plans representatives will review annually their plans program
   and plans that impact their organization. Note: Ensure plans are in compliance with current
   directives, regulations and/or guidance set by the wing and/or higher headquarters.
   9.3. Plan Development and Revision. Plans OPRs are responsible for developing and
   updating plans for which their organization is the designated OPR (see Section F, this
   instruction).
   9.4. Obtaining Signatures:
       9.4.1. Basic Plan and Memorandum of Transmittal. The basic plan is signed by the
       respective wing commander. The memorandum of transmittal is signed by 673
       ABW/XPX. To obtain theses signatures a plan package will be prepared.
       9.4.2. Plan Package. The plan OPR will prepare and forward a staff summary sheet
       (SSS) and draft plan to 673 ABW/XPX. XPX will prepare the coordination package that
       includes:
           9.4.2.1. Coordination Package (Bottom-line or Top-line Coordination):
              9.4.2.1.1. SSS. NOTE: Commanders, wing staff agency chiefs, and tenant
              organizations will concur with the plan and appropriate annex(es) by signing the
              SSS.
              9.4.2.1.2. Memorandum of transmittal on appropriate letterhead.
              9.4.2.1.3. Completed plan.
              9.4.2.1.4. All signed Bottom-line SSS (NOTE: Only for Top-line coordination).
           9.4.2.2. Staffing. See Section H, this instruction, for coordination process.
   9.5. Plan Suspense’s:
       9.5.1. The unit plans representative will confer with the OPR on establishing a suspense
       for their plan. NOTE: Suspense should be reasonable and allow enough time to process
       through all applicable organizations to include final signatures.
           9.5.1.1. Use the plans timeline matrix in Table 9.1, this instruction, to set a
           reasonable timeline for development, revision, coordination to final signature. At a
           minimum, creation to final signature should take no longer than four months.

      new plan posting.
      9.7.2. Functional areas will access the master plans e-library to view or obtain a copy of
      the appropriate plans.
      9.7.3. Any unit unable to view or obtain a copy of a plan via e-library may request a
      copy through the unit or 673 ABW/XPX, as appropriate.
   9.8. Reproduction. Generally, the plan will be made available to all units via e-library,
   however if a unit requires a hard copy the plan may be printed. NOTE: It is recommended
   that unit plans offices maintain a hard copy of their plans and associated plans that affect
 14                                                    673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011


   their organizations. The unit plans representative will file each plan in accordance with
   paragraph 6.2, this instruction. Ensure proper protocols are adhered to when maintaining
   classified plans (AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management).

Section E—- GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

10. Purpose. General administrative procedures must be followed to ensure all plans are
properly formatted.
   10.1. Marking:
      10.1.1. FOUO. Mark plans containing FOUO information ―FOR OFFICIAL USE
      ONLY‖ at the top and bottom of the front/back covers and on all pages (excluding blank
      pages) of the plan.
      10.1.2. Classified. See AFI 31-401 for marking classified plans.
      10.1.3. Covers will not have anything printed on the reverse side.
   10.2. Page and Paragraph Numbering:
      10.2.1. Page Numbering. Pages are numbered at the bottom center to indicate the page
      order in each element of the plan. Under the standard paragraph numbering format (as
      described in AFMAN 10-401V2, Planning Formats and Guidance) the main body of the
      plan will follow the standard i, ii, 1, 2 numbering system.
          10.2.1.1. The ―i‖ page numbering system will be used for numbering the Security
          Instructions page through the Table of Contents.
          10.2.1.2. Basic Plan. The basic plan uses standard numbering format beginning with
          number 1.
          10.2.1.3. Attachment Numbering. Annex, appendix, and tab pages use the following
          format: C-1-A-3 (denotes page 3 of Tab A to Appendix 1 to Annex C).
          10.2.1.4. Paragraph Numbering. Designations for subdividing, numbering, and
          lettering paragraphs are 1., a., (1), (a), 1, and a respectively. Indent each progressive
          subdivision. When a paragraph or section is subdivided, it must have at least two
          subdivisions. Remember, you cannot have an ―a‖ without at least a ―b‖ or a (1)
          without a (2), etc. Though not standard, some HHQ planning instructions may
          require the numbering format to be like this instruction, that is, 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, and
          1.1.1.1.
          10.2.1.5. Each new section (memorandum of transmittal, plan summary, basic plan,
          annex, appendix, and so forth) must start on a odd page. Blank pages or pages
          marked ―THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK‖ may be inserted as
          required to ensure this happens.
   10.3. Rules for Capitalizing and Underlining:
      10.3.1. References to specific annexes and other attachments are in this format (that is,
      Annex G is capitalized only in the Table of Contents or as a heading).
      10.3.2. Paragraph titles are capitalized and underlined, that is, PURPOSE.
673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 15


       10.3.3. Subparagraph titles are expressed and underlined, that is, Assumptions.
       10.3.4. Sub-subparagraph titles are not underlined and expressed, that is, Designations.
   10.4. Font Style and Text Spacing. Font size will be 12 pt in Times New Roman. Text is
   single spaced with a space between each paragraph.
   10.5. Dates. Each separate section of a plan must bear the date of issue or revision. Until a
   plan is revised, all sections should bear the same date of issue.
   10.6. Abbreviations. The first time a title or designation is used in an element of a plan, the
   title or designation must be spelled out and immediately followed by the approved
   abbreviation, that is, JBER. After the initial spell-outs and abbreviation, use abbreviation
   thereafter.
   10.7. Identifying Plans. JBER plans are assigned a number and/or title to coincide with the
   number and/or title of the USAF or PACAF plans they support or as specified by HHQ
   directives.
   10.8. Plan Organization. JBER plans are written in the format described in this instruction
   unless otherwise prescribed in a higher headquarters directive. Sample plan formats and
   administrative details are provided in Attachment 3, this instruction. Deviations should be
   kept to a minimum to maintain standardization.

Section F—- PLAN DEVELOPMENT

11. Plan Development. Plan development may require single or multiple wing coordination.
   11.1. The OPR will:
       11.1.1. Notify their unit plan representative to begin the creation of the new plan.
       11.1.2. Convene a working group of subject matter experts to research and discuss the
       creation of the plan.
       11.1.3. Draft a basic plan in coordination with the subject matter experts as noted in
       Figure 11.1. After the initial gathering of information, use the procedures in
       Attachment 3, this instruction, to assemble and format the draft plan. The Plan
       Development Checklist (also located in Attachment 3, Table A3.1, this instruction) will
       be used by the OPR in the development process.
       11.1.4. Track and document the basic level coordination. Use of a SSS to accomplish
       the coordination is optional at this stage.
   11.2. The unit plan representative will notify 673 ABW/XPX that a new plan is being
   created.
   11.3. Refer to Section H, this instruction, for Bottom-line and Top-line review/coordination
   procedures when staffing the plan.
 16                                                673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011

Section G—-REVIEWS, CHANGES AND REVISIONS

12. Review. All plans will be reviewed annually by their OPRs, unit plan representatives and
the wing plans PM. Additionally, a plan may require review outside the normal review cycle
because of higher headquarters/wing directives, which may require revisions or changes. The
plan review checklist in Table 12.1, this instruction, will be used for this purpose.
   12.1. Review Process. The review will identify areas requiring updates, changes,
   modifications, etc. All plan reviewers will use the comments matrix worksheet in Figure
   12.2, this instruction, to provide inputs/comments to the draft plan.
673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  17

         12.1.2. Comments will be identified as Administrative, Substantive, or Critical.
             12.1.2.1. Administrative comments identify grammar, punctuation, formatting errors,
             and so forth. Please include correct information or note discrepancy.
             12.1.2.2. Substantive comments pertain to information factually incorrect,
             unnecessary, misleading, confusing, or inconsistent. Please include correct
             information or note discrepancy.
             12.1.2.3. Critical comments pertain to major deficiencies that will cause non-
             concurrence with current directives, procedures, or common practices. Please note
             the correct or proper procedure or practice is. NOTE: A critical comment will
             equate to non-concurrence of the plan as written.
             12.1.2.4. Include any rationale to clarify or justify comments or inputs made.
             Include any directives and/or guidance (if applicable).
             12.1.2.5. All comments must be UNCLASSIFIED.
         12.1.3. Reviewers will send the comments matrix worksheets to their group plans office,
         who in-turn, will compile all inputs/comments and forward them to 673 ABW/XPX.
         XPX will review and forward the worksheets to the OPR for adjudication/plan update.
         NOTE: Consider the impact of JBER support agreements and memorandums of
         agreement/understanding (OPR: 673 CPTS/SAO) when revising or changing wing plans.
      12.2. Plan Change/Revision Process. The change or revision process begins when the
      OPR receives comments matrix worksheets during the plan review. The number of
      comments and degree of recommended changes will determine if a plan will be changed or
      revised. A plan change will generally be initiated if total write-in changes affect less than 40
      percent of the plan. A revision will take place if more than 40 percent of the plan changes or
      numerous write-in changes make the plan difficult to use.
         12.2.1. Adjudication. The OPR will determine if the inputs/comments should be
         incorporated into the plan. If inputs/comments are not incorporated into the plan, then
673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                             19


     the OPR must work with the units to adjudicate the inputs/comments on the matrix
     worksheet.
     12.2.2. Once a revision has been completed, a new draft is sent to 673 ABW/XPX for
     coordination to all organizations tasked by the plan.‖
     12.2.3. Second and possibly subsequent drafts will be required in order to obtain
     concurrence from all tasked organizations.
     12.2.4. Final Draft. After all tasked units‘ inputs/comments have been incorporated; the
     OPR will prepare a final draft and the draft SSS that only contains the Purpose,
     Background and Recommendation to be staffed to the 673 ABW/XPX. XPX will
     complete the organizations routing portion of the draft SSS and send it to each group
     commander, staff agency chief, and associate commander/chief.
     12.2.5. The change process is detailed in the plan change checklist in Table 12.2. The
     revision process is included in the plan preparation and revision checklist in Attachment
     3, this instruction. Comply with all checklist steps and information in this instruction
     when preparing a change or revision.

Section H—- Plan Staffing

13. Process Ownership. JBER is a complex military installation with many diverse
organizations and missions. It is imperative that OPRs, unit plans representatives, and the wing
plans PM share ownership in the coordination process. This section establishes staffing
protocols between supported, supporting and tenant unit leadership for coordination of all plans
affecting JBER. These coordination procedures will be followed to ensure proper staffing and
leadership approval.
   13.1. Bottom-line Coordination. This coordination process is used for the initial review by
   squadrons, groups, and tenant units on JBER; to include supported organizations.
 22                                                   673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011


       13.1.1. As outlined in Figure 13.1, the planner sends the plan package to 673
       ABW/XPX, which in-turn will staff the plan to all pertinent organizations below wing-
       level.
       13.1.2. All organizations will use the comments matrix worksheet in Figure 12.2, this
       instruction, to provide inputs/comments to the plan. Organizations will send completed
       worksheets to 673 ABW/XPX; which after cursory review will send them to the
       OPR/planner for plan update or adjudication.

Figure 13.1. Bottom-line Coordination




       13.1.3. After any required adjudication and plan updates are completed, the OPR/planner
       forwards the revised draft to 673 ABW/XPX for restaffing. XPX will resend the plan
       package to all tasked organizations to review all modifications to the plan and ensure no
       further concerns or revisions are needed. If no further comments or inputs are identified,
       the commanders will sign the SSS concurring with the plan as written and forward the
       SSS to 673 ABW/XPX.
NOTE: If additional commander‘s comments are noted, the review/adjudication process will
begin again (see paragraph 13.1.2, this instruction).
       13.1.4. Once all known changes have been incorporated into the new draft, 673
       ABW/XPX will create the Top-line coordination package that contains a Top-line SSS,
       signed Bottom-line SSS, and the most current draft plan.
   13.2. Top-line Coordination. Prior to top line coordination, all tasked units in the draft
   plan, through group level and tenant organizations on JBER should have been given the
   opportunity to review and provide comments to the plan. Any adjudication required at the
   bottom line review should now be complete.
       13.2.1. The Top-line coordination process as depicted in Figure 13.2 is used for the final
       plan review. 673 ABW/XPX will staff the plan through the appropriate wings or
       equivalent-level command‘s executive offices for command concurrence; as applicable,
       prior to forwarding to the approving wing. The process is as follows:
673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                           23


Figure 13.2. Top-line Coordination




          13.2.1.1. 673 ABW/XPX will send the plan package that includes a comments matrix
          worksheet, SSS, and most current copy of the draft plan to appropriate commanders
          through their executive officer.
          13.2.1.2. If commanders have any inputs and/or comments to the plan, they will
          forward them on the worksheet provided through their executive officers to 673
          ABW/XPX. If there are no comments, the commanders will sign the SSS concurring
          with the plan as written and forward through their executive officers to 673
          ABW/XPX.
          13.2.1.3. Following a cursory review, 673 ABW/XPX will send the worksheets to the
          OPR/planner for plan update and advise the OPR/planner as to what level of review
          and/or adjudication is required.
          13.2.1.4. After any adjudication and/or plan updates is completed, the OPR/planner
          will forward the revised draft to 673 ABW/XPX for final concurrence by wing and
          equivalent level commands. Once this final check is complete, reviewing
          commanders will forward their SSS to 673 ABW/XPX indicating concurrence of the
          plan as written.
          13.2.1.5. The 673 ABW/XPX will forward the plan package that includes group level
          and above signed SSS, latest draft plan, and a comment matrix worksheet to the
24                                                 673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011


        approving wing for signature. If no further comments or inputs are required for the
        plan, the commander will initial the SSS and sign the plan for implementation. Note:
        If additional commander‘s inputs/comments are noted, the update/adjudication
        process will begin again (see paragraph 13.2.1, this instruction).
     13.2.2. The final plan package is then sent to 673 ABW/XPX for distribution.
     13.2.3. The 673 ABW/XPX will notify organizations of the new plan posting to the
     JBER plans e-library.

     so forth) and describes the concept of mission support by the functional area. It contains
     detailed information for a specific organization or subject. See Figure A3.8 for a generic
     annex format.
         A3.1.8.1.1. All JBER plans will contain, as a minimum, an Annex A (Task
         Organization) and Annex Z (Distribution), unless specified otherwise in a higher
         headquarters directive. Refer to AFMAN 10-401V2, page C-28 for standard titles of
         remaining annexes and follow to the greatest extent possible. NOTE: Do not use the
         letters ―I‖ or ―O‖ as annex designators.
         A3.1.8.1.2. Annexes (except A and Z) will be approved by the functional area
         commander or wing staff chief by signing the SSS.
         A3.1.8.1.3. Limit annexes to essential information not covered in other publications.
         This does not preclude referencing those publications as appropriate. If there is no
         specific material for a titled paragraph, do not include that paragraph.
         A3.1.8.1.4. List all appendices (if any) addressed in the annex on the last page of the
         annex.
  A3.1.9. Task Organization. This is normally Annex A. As a minimum, list all major JBER
  organizations and/or units including active duty, National Guard, and reserve components
  tasked by the plan. An example of the task organization annex format is on Figure A3.9.

  copies, informs users which agencies and headquarters that maintains copies of the plan.
  JBER plans will be made available electronically to all tasked organizations as a minimum.
  Plan OPRs will review HQ PACAF distribution requirements. Addressees must advise plan
  OPRs of necessary changes to the distribution list. See Figure A3.10 for a distribution annex
  format.
  A3.1.11. Appendix. An appendix is a subordinate addition to an annex. It includes
  information too lengthy or detailed for the annex. Normally, each appendix is devoted to a
  major category of information. For example, if a plan requires more than one response
  option, a separate appendix could be used to address each option. See Figure A3.11 for an
  appendix format.
673ABWI10-401 18 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  37
