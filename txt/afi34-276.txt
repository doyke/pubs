SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This is the first publication of AFI 34-276 separating the requirements for Family Child Care Programs
from AFR 34-701 (now numbered AFI 34-248), Child Development Programs. It establishes a new sys-
tem for licensing on-base and Air Force off-based leased housing family child care providers and autho-
rizes the affiliation of off-base providers living in civilian housing with the Air Force family child care
program.

                                                Chapter 1

                                    ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of establishing a family child care program on an Air Force installation is to
make child care available to military members so that they can more successfully perform their military
mission, secure in the knowledge that their children’s safety, health, and well-being are protected. Having
child care available also supports the economic viability of military families by enabling spouses to seek
employment and contribute to the family income. Family child care provides an alternative to child
development center care for families that need evening care; weekend care; care for children with special
needs, infants, and school-age children; and care during swing and midnight shifts. Family child care
offers an opportunity for spouses to contribute to the family income while caring for their own children.

1.2. Requirements for a Program. Each installation with military family housing must have a proce-
dure for approving individuals to provide family child care in on-base quarters on the installation and for
restricting individuals who do not have approval from providing child care.
   1.2.1. If there is a shortage of on-base care, establish a relationship with the off-base licensing author-
   ities to affiliate spouses of active duty and retired military members, who are approved providers, with
   the on-base program.

1.3. Scope. Any individuals caring for other families’ children a total of more than 10 hours a week on a
regular basis must be licensed to provide care in on-base quarters.
   1.3.1. This does not include:
       1.3.1.1. Individuals who occasionally provide care for a friend or neighbor.
       1.3.1.2. Individuals providing baby-sitting on an occasional basis for other families.
       1.3.1.3. Teenagers doing evening or weekend baby-sitting for families.
       1.3.1.4. Child care provided in the parents’ own home.
       1.3.1.5. Parent cooperatives where one of the parents provides supervision for other parents’ chil-
       dren on an exchange basis and no fees are involved.
       1.3.1.6. Temporary full-time care of a child during a parent’s absence for temporary duty or
       deployment by the person listed on the AF Form 357, Family Care Plan.
   1.3.2. Compute the requirement to be licensed by multiplying the number of hours the provider offers
   care on a regular basis by the number of children in care. For example, if an individual provides care
   one afternoon a week for 4 children for 3 hours they must be licensed.
   1.3.3. Determine the geographic region in which it is feasible to affiliate off-base providers. Include
   this information in family child care recruiting and public relations materials.

1.4. Penalty for Not Seeking a License. Ensure that all those who should be licensed are licensed.
   1.4.1. Do not permit individuals who are not approved family child care providers to advertise in base
   publications or on base bulletin boards.
6                                                                       AFI34-276 1 NOVEMBER 1999

    1.4.2. Follow-up on reports of unlicensed care. Send a written request to individuals suspected of
    providing unlicensed care asking them to complete the licensing procedures. Have the family child
    care coordinator, accompanied by the flight chief, services commander, or security forces, make an
    unannounced visit to individuals who are suspected of providing care on a regular basis who are not
    licensed. If individuals who should be licensed do not become licensed, issue a written order from the
    support group commander directing them to cease providing care.
    1.4.3. The support group commander may revoke the housing privileges of individuals who provide
    child care but refuse to become licensed or who continue to provide care after their license has been
    suspended or revoked.

1.5. Application and Licensing. Provide written information to potential providers on how to become
licensed and the requirements for remaining licensed.
    1.5.1. Use AF Form 1928, Family Day Care License Application, to take requests from those wanting
    to become licensed; number each license.
    1.5.2. Start processing applications within 15 working days of receiving them. When feasible, con-
    duct screenings, pre-approval training, and pre-approval home inspections, concurrently, to expedite
    the process.
    1.5.3. Conduct a pre-licensing orientation to help individuals decide if they are interested in becom-
    ing family child care providers.
    1.5.4. Have the information on the applicant reviewed by the family child care panel before recom-
    mending approval for licensing by the support group commander.
    1.5.5. Issue AF Form 1927, Family Day Care License, to license those who successfully complete the
    licensing process. Ensure that all of the required checks are completed, the individual has a valid
    insurance policy, and the commander has signed the AF 1931, Family Day Care Home Approval
    Record, before issuing a license. Ensure that the date on the license is no earlier than the date the com-
    mander signs the AF 1931, Family Day Care Approval Record. Issue a provisional license to all indi-
    viduals receiving their first license. Make it valid for no more than 3 months.
    1.5.6. If the individual successfully completes the probationary period, issue a license for 21 months
    after the individual has completed the probationary period.
    1.5.7. Note on the license the level of standards with which the individual is in compliance: standard,
    developmental, or accredited. Issue a standard license to individuals who consistently comply with
    the standards at Attachment 5, Standards for Family Child Care Homes. Issue a developmental
    license to individuals who also consistently comply with the standards listed on Attachment 6. Issue
    an accreditation license to those providers who comply with the standards of Attachment 5 and 6 and
    who have been accredited by the National Association for Family Child Care.
    1.5.8. Provide an affiliation certificate to individuals who live off base that become affiliated with the
    on-base family child care program. Permit affiliated providers to be approved as standard, develop-
    mental, or accredited affiliated homes.
    1.5.9. Issue a window card or house/yard flag to identify homes in which the provider has been
    licensed to provide care on base.
AFI34-276 1 NOVEMBER 1999                                                                                      7

   1.5.10. Require that providers return their license or certificate and window card or house/yard flag to
   the family child care office when they cease providing care on the base or are no longer affiliated.

1.6. Applicants from Other Bases.
   1.6.1. If an individual has been licensed as a provider at another Air Force installation within the last
   12 months, permit them to become relicensed or affiliated at their new location after:
       1.6.1.1. A review of their family child care file from their previous location by the Family Child
       Care Panel.
       1.6.1.2. A health, safety, fire, and program inspection of their home.
       1.6.1.3. Obtaining approval from the support group commander.
   1.6.2. If the provider was in provisional status when leaving the former base, require them to com-
   plete an additional 3 months in provisional status at their new location.

1.7. Inactive Homes. Permit individuals who request to become inactive providers to do so for no more
than 3 months while retaining their current license.
   1.7.1. Have an inspection of their home conducted by the family child care coordinator before reacti-
   vating their license.
   1.7.2. During the period of their inactivity, keep their license on file at the family child care office.
   1.7.3. Require providers to return the materials from the family child care lending program if they
   will be inactive for more than one month.

1.8. Providing Sufficient Family Child Care. Determine if there is a need for additional child care for
families assigned to the installation including families who need infant and toddler care, evening and
weekend care, care for mildly ill children, hourly care, care during midnight and swing shifts, care during
TDYs, care other than in a child development center setting and care other than in a before- and
after-school setting.
   1.8.1. Prepare and implement a written marketing plan to increase the number of homes to the level
   needed to support the base population.
   1.8.2. Have a brochure to recruit on-base providers and to encourage affiliation of providers living off
   base.
   1.8.3. Brief newcomers on the opportunity to become a family child care provider and on the avail-
   ability of family child care.
   1.8.4. At least annually, conduct a survey to determine the satisfaction of parents using family child
   care with the care provided.
   1.8.5. Provide an exterior sign on the family child care office which informs the base population of
   the location of the program.
   1.8.6. Determine the number of enlisted housing units. Strive to have at least 3 percent of the homes
   licensed to provide family child care. Track the percent licensed monthly.

1.9. Family Child Care Panel. Have the support group commander appoint a panel to provide oversight
of the family child care program and determine which individuals should be recommended for licensing
and affiliation.
    1.9.1. The support group commander must appoint the following individuals to serve on the panel:
    deputy support group commander, services commander or director or their deputy, and the family
    member programs flight chief. Do not appoint other individuals on the panel. Have the deputy sup-
    port group commander chair the panel. . Have the family member flight chief serve as the recorder
    and the keeper of the records of the panel actions and minutes. Have the family child care program
    staff and the training and curriculum specialists assigned to the program attend the panel meetings in
    a staff/non-voting role
    1.9.2. Have a representative from each of the following offices appointed to assist the panel, when
    needed: base legal, family advocacy, safety, fire, mental health, the program medical advisor, security
    forces, and Public Health.
    1.9.3. Have the panel perform the following functions:
       1.9.3.1. Review individuals’ applications and supporting documents for initial licensing and reli-
       censing and affiliation including results of home inspections, screenings, interviews, recommen-
       dations, etc.

   1.11.1. They have had their family child care license revoked on another military installation or in a
   county, state, or country unless the requirements of 1.18 are met.
   1.11.2. They or any of their household members have been arrested for or convicted of child abuse or
   neglect, a criminal act involving violence, or other acts which would make them unsuitable for caring

   fortably. If there is not enough space, reduce the number of children the provider may accept for care.

     is home schooling, their age, and the amount of direct supervision/instruction required of the provider.

1.13. County, State and Country Licensing. If the county, state, or country in which the family day
care home is located requires individuals that provide care in their home to be licensed, certified, or regis-
tered, require Air Force family day care providers to have these approvals.
     1.13.1. Seek to establish a memorandum of agreement with the county, state, or country to delegate
     the licensing of on-base homes to the Air Force, if possible.
     1.13.2. If the local authorities will not defer to the Air Force licensing requirements, then ensure pro-
     viders are licensed as required.
     1.13.3. If the off-base licensing requirements are more stringent, then the providers must follow the
     most stringent requirement whether it is the county’s, state’s, country’s, or Air Force’s.
     1.13.4. Ensure that the provider’s insurance policy will provide coverage if county, state, or country
     licensing is waived.
     1.13.5. Ensure all off base homes have the required local, state, and country approvals prior to affili-
     ating them.

   Standards for Developmental Family Child Care.

1.15. Transferring Providers to a New Installation. Help licensed or affiliated providers transfer to
other military installations when their spouse is reassigned.
   1.15.1. Make a copy of the individual’s family child care file and express mail a copy of it to the fam-
   ily child care office at the new installation. This is required whether or not the individual requests it
   at the time of departure.
   1.15.2. Assist the receiving base in completing the installation records check at the losing installation.

1.16. Converting an Affiliated Home to a Licensed Home. When an individual who has been an affil-
iated home moves on base, require them to become licensed if they want to continue to provide family
child care.
   1.16.1. Conduct a health, safety, fire, and program inspection of their new quarters before licensing
   them.
   1.16.2. Give them a provisional license for 3 months. If they continue to meet the program require-
   ments during the 3-month provisional period, license them for 21 additional months.

moves to another residence on base, conduct an inspection of their new quarters and issue them a license
with their new address. Ensure their insurance policy reflects the new address. If they are not in compli-
ance with the Air Force standards in their new quarters, revoke their license and recommend that they
reapply for a license.

1.18. Reapplying After Revocation. When a provider’s license has been revoked, have the individual’s
request for relicensing reviewed by the family child care panel prior to their completing any of the steps
required for licensing. Do not permit such individuals to reapply for licensing unless there is evidence to
suggest that the reasons why their license was revoked would not be a factor in their operation of a family
child care home in the future.

1.19. Time Permitted to Complete the Required Training. Individuals who wish to continue to be
licensed or affiliated must make satisfactory progress toward completing the DoD Family Child Care
modules. Satisfactory progress is defined as completing at least one module per month or no fewer than
15 modules in 18 months. The months when a provider is in inactive status should not be counted in
determining whether the provider is making satisfactory progress. When a provider is more than 1 month
behind in completing a module their license must be suspended. When a provider is more than 3 months
behind in completing a module their license must be revoked. The family child care panel must review
12                                                                      AFI34-276 1 NOVEMBER 1999

the training status of all providers at least quarterly and determine which providers must have their license
suspended or revoked.

1.20. Converting Licenses. Require new providers to remain in provisional status for at least 3 months
before granting them a standard, developmental, or accredited license. When a provider who has a stan-
dard license wishes to apply for a developmental license ensure that he or she is in compliance with the
standards on both Attachments 5 and 6 for at least three consecutive months before converting their stan-
dard license to a developmental license. When a provider desires to have an accredited license ensure that
he/she provides written proof of being accredited as a family child care home by the National Association
for Family Child Care (NAFCC) and is in compliance with the Quality Standards for NAFCC Accredita-
tion before granting them an affiliated license.

1.21. Change in Licensing Status. If a provider who has a developmental license fails to maintain com-
pliance with the standards listed on Attachment 5 and Attachment 6, notify them in writing that they have
60 days to return to compliance with the standards. If they fail to do so, convert their developmental
license to a standard license. If a provider who has been accredited by the National Family Child Care
Association becomes unaccredited, convert his/her affiliated license to a developmental or standard
license within 30 days.

1.22. Special Requirements for Individuals with Provisional Licenses. During the time individuals
have a provisional license:
     1.22.1. Restrict the number of children for whom they may provide care to no more than 4 unless they
     have successful previous experience as a provider.
     1.22.2. Encourage them not to accept children with special needs.
     1.22.3. Assign an experienced family child care provider to serve as a mentor to them.

     vider’s own child/children under age 8 are sleeping upstairs or below ground level, have the provider
     take the child with them and remain there with her children and the family child care child until the

   members or DoD civilians for care.
   2.28.5. Give providers who meet the requirements for being affiliated, a certificate of affiliation. Do

   On-base fire, health, and safety staff may not conduct these inspections.
