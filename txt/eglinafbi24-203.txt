                                            Chapter 2

                       ARMS, AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES (AA

2.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel whose duties involve receiving, processing,
packaging, handling and shipping of arms, ammunition and explosives (AA&E), including
nonnuclear munitions.
     2.1.1. Except as provided in this instruction, all munitions/munitions-related items and their
     explosive components arriving or departing EAFB will be processed through the Munitions
     Supply Account FV2823 (46 MXS/MXMW) 46th Maintenance Squadron, Munitions Supply
     Account N62640 Navy School, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD), or
     Munitions Supply Account FV6628 (919 MXS/MXMVW) 919th Maintenance Squadron.
     These are the only authorized shipping or receiving points for munitions on EAFB.
     Munitions and munitions related items will not be shipped or received by anyone other than
     authorized personnel assigned to these supply accounts. The point of contact for FV2823 is
     Munitions Control Center at 850-882-8362/8363, DSN 872-8362/8363, N62640 is Inventory
     Manager at 850-882-9533, DSN 872-9533 and for FV6628 is Munitions Control Center at
     850-883-6323, DSN 875-6323.
     2.1.2. United Parcel Service and Federal Express type shipments cannot be shipped directly
     to the customer unless the shipment is IAW Munitions Accountability Procedures, and that
     prior coordination has been obtained through the Air Armament Center (AAC) Weapons
     Safety Office (AAC/SEW) and the Munitions Supply Accounts listed in paragraph 2.1.1 as
     applicable. Shipments properly coordinated through the Munitions Accountable Supply
     Officer (MASO) can be delivered to the requester for Hazard Class/Division (HC/D) 1.4
     items only. All HC/D 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 munitions must be delivered and processed through
     the Munitions Inspection Section.
2.2. Temporary Parking of Governmental Agency Shipments.
     2.2.1. Eglin occasionally receives requests for temporary parking of Governmental Agency-
     Sponsored Shipments. The authority for granting or denying all requests for temporary
     parking belongs to the Installation Commander. 96 LRS/LGRDDC will coordinate any
     requests for Temporary Parking with 96th Security Forces Squadron (96 SFS) 850-882-2503,
     DSN 872-2503 and AAC/SEW 850-882-2540 ext 3, DSN 872-2540 ext 3 before submission
     to the Installation Commander for approval.
     2.2.2. Requests for temporary parking may be either routine or emergency and fall into the
     following three categories.
        2.2.2.1. Routine Secure Holding. Carriers may seek temporary parking for DoD-owned
        AA&E while in transit due to circumstances beyond the carrier’s control (e.g. mechanical
        breakdown, driver illness, etc.). During FPCON NORMAL and ALPHA, if for any
        reason the installation cannot accommodate the carriers request, 96 LRS will assist the
        carrier in locating the nearest alternate DoD installation or DoD contractor activity
        capable of providing secure holding.
            2.2.2.1.1. Two primary locations will be considered in-turn for routine requests for
            temporary secure holding:
EGLINAFBI24-203 3 JUNE 2010                                                                    5


              2.2.2.1.1.1. 46 MXS Munitions Holding Area 1264.
              2.2.2.1.1.2. 46 OG Hot Cargo Pad (Taxiway Mike West).
      2.2.2.2. Non-Nuclear        Munitions    (Conventional     )    SAFE       HAVEN.
      Emergency/contingency and FPCON BRAVO, CHARLIE, and DELTA related situations
      may arise that will require a motor vehicle transporting DoD-owned AA&E to gain
      expedited secure holding at the nearest DoD installation. Under these conditions, the
      AA&E-laden motor vehicle will be allowed access. Requests for Non-Nuclear Munitions
      Safe Haven will be handled IAW the Installation Security Plan and EAFBI 31-101,
      Installation Security Instruction.
      2.2.2.3. Department of Energy (DOE) SAFE HAVEN/SAFE PARKING. Requests from
      DOE for either SAFE HAVEN or SAFE PARKING will be handled IAW
      Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan 10-2.
2.3. Movement Routes.
   2.3.1. All commercial vehicles transporting munitions for munitions accounts FV2823 and
   N62640 will enter the base through the EAFB North Gate. Upon arrival, 96 SFS will only be
   responsible for verifying the condition of the conveyance seals and ensure proper
   surveillance of shipment by matching the vehicle seal number(s) with the Bill of Lading. At
   no time will 96 SFS personnel take custody of the shipment by breaking the seals. Custody
   of the shipment remains with the driver until Munitions Inspectors accepts the shipment for
   receipt. Vehicles will be escorted or directed to the Eglin explosive laden vehicle inspection
   area by 96 SFS. Upon arrival at Duke Field, vehicles with shipments for FV6628 will be
   escorted or directed to the designated explosive laden vehicle inspection area. Contact
   Munitions Control at Duke Field for further assistance at 850-883-6323, DSN 875-6323.
   2.3.2. Vehicle Inspection: Vehicles will be inspected by 96 LRS/LGRDDC Cargo
   Movement Element at the designated vehicle inspection area. Note: All munitions-laden
   vehicles must be inspected and removed from the applicable vehicle inspection area within
   24 hours of arrival.
   2.3.3. Suspect or Suspicious Vehicles: If vehicle is suspect or suspicious, contact 96 SFS at
   850-882-2503, DSN 872-2503. If a vehicle has damage or safety defects, it will not be
   allowed to proceed to the munitions storage area. Personnel discovering damage/defects will
   immediately notify AAC/SEW at 850-882-2540 ext 3, DSN 872-2540 ext 3 and 96
   LRS/LGRDDC at 850-882-8862, DSN 872-8862. Correction of damage or defect will be
   accomplished and a determination made from a detailed inspection that the vehicle and cargo
   are sufficiently safe for movement to the munitions area. If it is determined that the vehicle
   is unsafe for further movement, the cargo will be transferred to another vehicle at the
   explosive inspection site by munitions personnel from the 46 MXS/MXMW, 919
   MXS/MXMVW or NAVSCOLEOD. If vehicle seals do not correspond with those shown on
   the Commercial Bill of Lading or have been tampered with, or if foreign and/or suspicious
   articles have been attached to the outside of the explosive laden vehicle, the vehicle must be
   isolated at the North Gate, away from other explosive laden vehicles. When personnel
   discover this situation, they will notify 96 LRS/LGRDDC.
2.4. Procedures.
