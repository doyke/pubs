This instruction implements AFPD 11-2, Flight Rules and Procedures, by providing guidance
and procedures for standard Air Force instrument flying. Since aircraft flight instrumentation
and mission objectives are so varied, this instruction is necessarily general regarding equipment
and detailed accomplishment of maneuvers. Individual aircraft flight manuals should provide
detailed instructions required for particular aircraft instrumentation or characteristics. This
manual, when used with related flight directives and publications, provides adequate guidance
for instrument flight under most circumstances, but is not a substitute for sound judgment.
Circumstances may require modification of prescribed procedures. Aircrew members charged
with the safe operation of United States Air Force aircraft must be knowledgeable of the
guidance contained in this manual. This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) Units and to the Air National Guard (ANG). This publication is applicable to all USAF
aircraft, to include Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) located at https://my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims. Submit recommended changes or questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF IMT 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s change of
command. Address any questions regarding this manual to HQ Air Force Flight Standards
Agency (AFFSA) at hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil or via mail, HQ AFFSA/AJW31AF, Attn: Flight

General: Changed formatting to conform to AFI 33-360 guidance. Deleted unused chapters
that were transferred to AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, INSTRUMENT FLIGHT PROCEDURES.
Some chapters and paragraphs were renumbered as a result. Corrected grammar, spelling, and
punctuation along with updated some graphics. The majority of the information in this manual
has been completely revised and/or updated. This manual also includes eight new chapters
(reference the addition of Chapter 4, REDUCED VERTICAL SEPARATION MINIMUMS
(RVSM); Chapter 5, TERRAIN AVOIDANCE WARNING SYSTEM (TAWS); Chapter 6,
TRAFFIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM (TCAS); Chapter 7 COMMUNICATION,
NAVIGATION, SURVEILLANCE (CNS)/AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (ATM); Chapter 8,
AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS; Chapter 9, EXTREME LATITUDE NAVIGATION; Chapter 10,
TERMINAL INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES (TERPS); and Chapter 13, OCEANIC
NAVIGATION. Therefore, this manual is considered new and should be reviewed in its
entirety.

NOTE: Where used, “miles” means nautical miles unless otherwise specified, and when used in
relation to visibility means statute miles.

NOTE: “Course, bearing, azimuth, heading, and wind direction” information shall always be
magnetic unless specifically stated otherwise.

NOTE: Since USAF aircraft are comprised of both multi-crew and single pilot configurations;
the terms “aircrew” and “pilot” may be used interchangeably as applicable.

NOTE: The reports in this directive are exempt from licensing according to AFI 33-324,
Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections.

                                Ground-Based Navigational Aids

1.1. Non-Directional Radio Beacon (NDB)

1.1.1. Introduction. The NDB is still an important navigational aid (NAVAID) used in the US
and around the world. In fact, at numerous airports, the NDB may provide the only form of
navigation. Although less precise than other NAVAIDs providing non-precision approach
course guidance, the NDB still provides a safe means of descent and a way to locate an airport in
marginal VFR or IFR conditions.

1.1.2. Usability. The low and medium frequency radio signals are not limited to Line Of Sight
(LOS) reception like VHF signals are. For this reason, if the transmitting power is high enough,
the NDB signal may be usable at low altitudes and/or at long distances from the station.

1.1.3. Frequency Range. Since ranges of the NDB can vary significantly, knowing which type
or “class” of NDB you are using is very important (refer to paragraph 1.1.6). The 190 to 535
kHz frequency range is assigned to NDBs, while the 540 to 1650 kHz range is reserved for
commercial amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast stations. Although commercial stations may
be picked up by your receiver; they are not flight-checked and thus, not intended for navigational
use.

1.1.4. Airway Designation. Although not used in the airway system in the continental US
(CONUS), NDBs are still used in parts of the world to define enroute airways as part of the
airspace structure. When designated in the FLIP, the NDB is often referred to in terms of its
signal output which is the low and medium frequency band width (or simply as LF/MF
NAVAIDS).

1.1.5. Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) Equipment.

1.1.5.1. Depending on the type of ADF equipment installed on your aircraft, you may be able to
receive frequencies between 100 and 1,750 kilohertz (kHz). The ADF uses two antennas (“loop”
and “sense”) to automatically determine the direction of the strongest signal strength being
transmitted by the ground station (NDB).

1.1.5.2. Through the use of a bearing pointer, the result is then displayed to the pilot as a bearing
from the aircraft to the station in relation to aircraft heading. The angular difference between the
bearing pointer and the aircraft’s magnetic heading is referred to as the “relative bearing” to the
station. If this information is then combined with a rotating compass card that automatically
aligns with the aircraft’s heading (as it is on USAF aircraft); a magnetic bearing (or course) “to”
or “from” the station is provided, similar in operating principle to VOR or TACAN RMI
procedures.

1.1.6. Classes of NDBs. The IFR En Route Supplement (IFR Supp) lists the class, location, and
frequencies of individual NDBs. In the legend of the IFR Supp, it also lists the power output and
ranges associated with each NDB class. NDBs are grouped into four classes based on their
10                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

individual power output and associated range capability.

1.1.6.1. HH class beacons transmit with approximately 2,000 watts of power and have a range of
at least 75 nautical miles (nm). They are normally used for long over-water routes.

1.1.6.2. H class beacons have a power output of from 50 to 1,999 watts and a range of 50 nm.

1.1.6.3. MH class beacons are the most common type used in the US. They have a power output
of less than 50 watts and a range of 25 nm.

1.1.6.4. The fourth class of NDB is the compass locator. The compass locator normally has a
power output equal to or less than 25 watts and a range of 15 nm. Compass locators are a part of
the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and are usually collocated with the outer markers (OM)
and/or middle markers (MM) and referred to as a Locator Outer Marker (LOM) and Locator
Middle Marker (LMM) respectively (reference paragraph 1.1.7.1.2). At locations where 400
watt radio beacons are used in conjunction with the OM, the aircrew may be able to obtain aural
weather information in the form of Transcribed Weather Broadcast (TWEB).

1.1.7. NDB Identification.

1.1.7.1. The NDB transmits a signal with an audible Morse code identifier. Some NDBs may
also carry voice transmissions (weather, etc.) which override the identifying code. Those
without voice capability will have a “W” (without voice) included at the end of the class
designator listed in the Flight Information Publications (FLIP). Facilities without voice
capability are also indicated by the frequency being underlined on government charts.

1.1.7.1.1. When using the NDB as the primary source of navigation, it is important to tune and
identify the station carefully. Since frequency congestion in combination with minimal
frequency protection may occur in certain parts of the world, aircrews should exercise extreme
caution when using the NDB or L/MF NAVAIDS. Consult the appropriate Area Planning series
FLIP for additional information.

1.1.7.1.2. If the NDB is a LOM, the identifier is the first two letters of the associated ILS
identifier. Likewise, if the NDB is a LMM, then the identifier is the last two letters of the ILS
identifier. For example, if the localizer identifier is I-SFO, the LOM identifier is SF. For a
LMM, the identifier would be FO.

1.1.8. Automatic Direction Finding Errors.

1.1.8.1. ADF receivers are subject to errors that could affect the accuracy of the bearing
received. Even when the ground facility has been positively identified and the set has been tuned
accurately, under some circumstances, the bearings received may still not be correct. Some of
the more common errors are described below.

1.1.8.1.1. Thunderstorm Effect. Radio waves are distorted by the electrical disturbances caused
by thunderstorms. Due to this effect, the pilot may experience erratic fluctuations of the bearing
pointer in the direction of the thunderstorm. There may even be cases when the bearing pointer
may home to the thunderstorm.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                11

1.1.8.1.2. Night Effect. This effect is caused by the ionosphere reflecting radio waves. The
effect is most noticeable when the height of the ionosphere is changing at sunrise and sunset.
The interference from the bouncing radio waves may cause the bearing pointer to fluctuate. The
amount of interference depends largely on the frequency used and the type of antenna. The
maximum night effect is on commercial broadcast stations operating near 1,000 kHz. Generally,
the interference is slight within 30 miles of the station and becomes more pronounced as the
distance from the station increases. Night effect can be reduced by increasing altitude, flying
closer to the station, or tuning a station of a lower frequency or stronger signal. If the needle is
fluctuating due to night effect, it may be necessary to interpolate the average of the fluctuations.
Diligence must be exercised when using the NDB at night due to the possibility of receiving
signals from another station on the same frequency as the one you intend to use.

1.1.8.1.3. Bank Error. This error is most predominant when the aircraft is at altitude close to the
station. While the aircraft is banking, a slight error is introduced since the bearing pointer points
down towards the station. The error is greatest when the aircraft is heading directly towards or
away from the station when the bank is applied and at a pitch angle other than straight and level
flight. Depending on the amount of bank (and pitch) used, this error may provide erroneous
bearing indications when flying an NDB approach.

1.1.8.1.4. Precipitation Static. When the ADF is used as a low frequency receiver, precipitation
static may make the reception noisy. This type of static can be reduced by putting static
dischargers on the trailing edges of the wing. Areas of ice crystals may also cause the bearing
pointer to fluctuate excessively or give erroneous indications.

1.1.8.1.5. Shoreline Effect. This error occurs when radio waves change direction crossing the
shore line. It is possible to have errors of 40° in bearing. The maximum error is found when the
bearing to or from the station is less than 30° to the shoreline.

1.1.8.1.6. Mountain Effect. Mountains reflect radio waves, creating fluctuations of the bearing
pointer. Sometimes the radio waves can be split or bent in the area of mountains, so be cautious
when taking a bearing fix in mountainous regions.

1.1.9. ADF Navigation.

1.1.9.1. Navigating directly to or from the station or intercepting an inbound or outbound course
is the same as those listed in RMI navigation techniques and procedures outlined in AFMAN 11-
217 Vol 1. Remember, all the ADF does is point to the station, the bearing to or from the station
is the heading that corresponds with either the head or the tail of the bearing pointer respectively.
Failing to correct for winds will result in an aircraft “homing” to the station. Where a published
NDB bearing is used to define an intersection on an aeronautical chart, it is always the bearing
TO the NDB. On an approach procedure where an inbound and outbound bearing may be flown
(e.g. procedure turn), both are published.

1.1.9.2. Although the procedures and techniques in using an ADF to navigate are essentially the
same as those used in VOR and/or TACAN RMI procedures, there is a slight difference in how
the displayed information is derived. An ADF is only capable of determining a relative bearing
to the station; the ADF needle must be combined with a functioning compass card to display
12                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

magnetic bearing. Conversely, A VOR receiver is only capable of determining a magnetic
bearing/radial to the station; the VOR needle must be combined with a functioning compass card
to display relative bearing. In the event of a compass card malfunction, an ADF needle should
indicate correct relative bearing but a false magnetic bearing. The opposite is true for a VOR
needle, it would indicate a correct magnetic bearing but false relative bearing. In either case, it
is very important that the pilot/crew carefully discern what information is being displayed prior
to using it to maintain or enhance situational awareness.

1.2. VOR System.

1.2.1. Introduction. Although other systems are rapidly being incorporated, the VOR remains
the primary NAVAID used to form airways and specified courses in both the low and high IFR
en route airspace structure within the National Airspace System (NAS). It is important to
understand that the VOR only provides the pilot/crew with azimuth information. Although
technically a separate component, many VORs are collocated with a DME transmitter.
Depending on the type of VOR receiver installed, under the frequency pairing plan, it is usually
transparent to the crew that the VOR and DME are completely separate components since
distance to a particular station is often automatically displayed in conjunction with azimuth
information when a VOR frequency is selected. Since transmitting equipment is in the VHF
(very high frequency) band width, VOR signals are relatively free of atmospheric disturbances;
however, reception is limited to line-of-sight (LOS); therefore, the usable range suitable for
navigation will vary according to the altitude of the aircraft, terrain, and the class of the VOR
station.

1.2.2. Transmission Principle. The transmission principle of the VOR is based on creating a
phase difference between two signals. One of the signals, the reference phase, is omni-
directional, and radiates from the station in a circular pattern. The phase of this signal is constant
through 360°. The other signal, the variable phase, rotates uniformly at 1,800 RPM and its phase
changes 1° for each degree change in azimuth around the VOR. Except when located in the
extreme latitudes (see 9.4.1), the majority of VORs use magnetic north as the baseline for
measuring the phase relationship between the reference and variable phase signals. At magnetic
north, the signals are exactly in phase; but a phase difference exists at any other point around the
station. This phase difference provides the magnetic bearing to the VOR or radial emanating
from the station. Depending on your aircraft instrumentation, this information can be displayed
as either a magnetic bearing TO or FROM the VOR station or the aircraft’s position in relation to
a selected radial.

1.2.3. TO and FROM Indications. VOR radials are identified by their magnetic bearing FROM
the station. The TO/FROM indicator displays whether the course selected, if properly
intercepted will take the aircraft TO or FROM the station. It is important to understand that
aircraft heading has no effect on the TO/FROM indication. For example, when the aircraft’s
position is located North of the line between 090° and 270°, if the pilot sets 180° in the course
selector window, regardless of aircraft heading, a TO indication will appear in the TO/FROM
window. If the aircraft is South of the line between 090° and 270° and the pilot sets 180° in the
course select window, regardless of heading, a FROM indication will be displayed. Should the
aircraft be located along a radial that is approximately 90 degrees offset from the one selected in
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 13

the course window, the signals may become ambiguous and result in a fluctuating TO/FROM
indication. Using the previous example, the TO/FROM indicator would normally begin to
fluctuate if the aircrafts location was close to the 090° and 270° line.

1.2.4. VOR Radio Class Codes and Standard Service Volume.

1.2.4.1. Normal usable altitude and range limitations for various classes of VOR stations, based
on interference-free signal reception, are specified in the Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
and the AIM, Chapter 1. Stations are classified as Low (L), High Altitude (HA), and Terminal
type of VORs. The frequencies of most (L) and (HA) class VORs are in the 112.0 to 118.0
MHz range. Most (T) class VORs have a frequency range between 108.0 and 112.0 MHz.

1.2.4.1.1. L Class VORs: Normally usable from 1,000 feet AGL up to and including 18,000 feet
AGL at radial distances out to 40 nm.

1.2.4.1.2. HA Class VORs: Between 1,000 feet AGL up to and including 14,500 feet, out to a
distance of 40 nm; between 14,500 feet and 60,000 feet, usable to 100 nm; between 18,000 and
45,000 feet AGL, usable range increases to 130 nm.

1.2.4.1.3. T Class VORs: Normally usable only within 25 nm between 1,000 feet AGL up to
12,000 feet AGL.

1.2.4.1.3.1. Terminal class (T) VORs are usually associated with an airfield and thus not
normally part of the IFR en route structure.

1.2.5. Usable Service Volume. In some cases the usable range of a VOR may be different from
the standard service volume. The service volume may be either expanded or restricted depending
on operational needs or other constraints (e.g. terrain, obstacles, etc). If a service volume is
restricted, the station’s broadcast area will be noted in the civilian Airport/Facility Directory, IFR
En route Supplement, and/or Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).

1.2.6. Voice Communications. In addition to the voice communication capabilities outlined in
AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, many VORs are able to broadcast weather information (e.g. ATIS,
TWEB, etc).

1.2.7. Errors Associated with VORs.

1.2.7.1. VOR energy will reflect from some features of the Earth’s surface. This results in an
effect known as “scalloping” which can be indicated on your aircraft instrumentation by either a
smooth, rhythmic deviation or a rough, irregular deviation, normally for short time intervals. The
effects will look similar to those effects experienced when an aircraft is approaching station
passage.

1.2.7.2. With a failed compass card, a VOR RMI needle will continue to display the correct
magnetic course indications; however, it will not give a correct relative bearing (see 1.1.9.2. for
additional information regarding how derived information is displayed). Since a relative bearing
is not displayed, a pilot/crew should exercise extreme caution when attempting to navigate using
VOR/TACAN needles on instruments with failed compass cards.
14                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

1.2.7.3. VOR ground stations are calibrated to account for magnetic variation in reference to
magnetic North. Since magnetic variation drifts (or changes) over time, the VOR stations
alignment in relation to magnetic North will also change. Therefore, any difference between
current and actual variation is translated to the aircraft using the VOR for navigation. When the
magnetic variation at the VOR is 6 degrees out of tolerance, the station will be re-calibrated.
The current magnetic variation settings for individual VORs are listed in the FLIP IFR Enroute
Supplement.

1.2.8. VOR Receiver Testing.

1.2.8.1. VOR Test Facility (VOT) Check. A VOT is a low-power (2 watt) VHF omni-test
transmitter which permits the ground checking of aircraft VOR equipment without reference to a
check radial. VOT emits an omni-directional magnetic North (360°) radial, plus an aural
identification consisting of a series of dots or a continuous tone. It is monitored to a tolerance of
± 1°.

1.2.8.1.1. Aircraft equipment properly tuned to a VOT should have the CDI centered and the
bearing pointer reading 0° with a FROM indication or 180° with a TO indication. The allowable
tolerance is ± 4°. If the VOR receiver operates an RMI, the needle should normally rotate to
indicate 180° or 360°.

1.2.8.1.2. LOS reference to the VOT should normally be established prior to use because any
intervening structure may induce a shielding effect and reduce signal strength.

1.2.8.1.3. Some VOT installations may also carry automatic terminal information service
(ATIS) data.

1.2.8.1.4. The airborne use of a VOT is permitted, but is strictly limited to those areas and
altitudes specifically authorized in the Airport/Facility Directory or appropriate supplement.

1.2.8.2. Designated Ground Checkpoint. At certain airports, a circle is painted on the pavement,
usually on the ramp or at the run-up area. The course TO and FROM a designated VOR will be
indicated. To use a designated ground checkpoint, park on the painted circle (aircraft orientation
does not matter). Then verify the indicated bearing to the VOR on the RMI and center the
needle in the HSI instruments. Both should read within 4° of the specified course TO or FROM
the VOR. A check of the DME against the published distance from the station to the checkpoint
can also be made. It should be within ½ mile or 3% of the total distance (whichever is greater).
Designated ground checkpoints are listed in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Airport/Facility Directory.

1.2.8.3. Airborne Checkpoint. Airborne checkpoints consist of certified radials that should be
received over specific points or landmarks while airborne in the immediate vicinity of the
airport. The course selector window should read within 6° of the specified radial. Locations of
airborne checkpoints can be found in the civilian Airport/Facility Directory and in FLIP Area
Planning.

1.2.8.4. Dual VOR Check. You may test two VOR instruments against each other, either RMI
or HSI by tuning both to the same VOR and comparing the indications. They should read within
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  15

4° of each other. The dual VOR check is the least desirable since it might “pass” two wildly
inaccurate instruments as long as they have similar errors. For example, if one instrument reads
+7° and the other +10°, they pass. The dual VOR check will also fail two instruments that
individually would pass a test. For example, if the VOT check shows one instrument + 3° and the
other -3°, they are both good VOR instruments, but will fail the dual VOR check since they are
6° apart.

1.2.8.5. Self-Test. Many aircraft have VORs with a self-test function that provides an
operational test of the system. The aircraft flight manual will discuss the specific procedures for
your aircraft. The self-test does not, however, test the aircraft antennas. If the self-test checks
within your aircraft’s flight manual tolerances and you can receive the identification from the
station, it is not necessary to test the VOR at a ground check point.

1.3. Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) System.

1.3.1. Introduction. Due to the unique requirements associated with military operations, the
TACAN was developed to augment other forms of civilian navigational systems. The TACAN
is an Ultra High Frequency (UHF) omni-directional NAVAID which provides continuous
azimuth information in degrees from the station and slant range distance information up to 200
nm from the station. Like the VOR, the receipt of a TACAN signal is dependent on LOS (line-
of-sight) principle. Therefore, aircraft altitude, distance from station, terrain and obstructions are
principle factors that affect TACAN navigation.

1.3.2. Equipment and Transmission Principles. The TACAN operates in the UHF band and has
a total of 126 channels operating between 1,025 to 1,150 MHz. DME-associated frequencies are
in the 962 to 1024 MHz and 1151 to 1213 MHz ranges. Channels are spaced at 1 MHz intervals
in these bands. The TACAN set may also have an X or Y setting to double the frequencies
available. A difference in microsecond pulse length is the only difference in the X and Y
settings. These settings are normally used in a dense signal environment where it is possible to
have duplicate frequency interference. The TACAN frequency published can be assumed to be X
unless the letter Y appears in parenthesis after the TACAN frequency.

1.3.3. Ground Equipment. The TACAN consists of a rotating type antenna for transmitting
bearing information and a receiver-transmitter (transponder) for transmitting distance
information. Permanent TACAN ground stations are usually dual-transmitter equipped (one
operating and other on standby) and are fully monitored installations. These automatically switch
to the standby transmitter when a malfunction occurs. Newer NAVAIDS may have only one
transmitter due to improved reliability of modern solid-state technology. Mobile TACANs still
use dual transmitters.

1.3.3.1. Use the TACAN only if it is providing both bearing and DME information in
conjunction with a proper IDENT. Engineering features in the design of TACANs require that
both the bearing and DME function together for proper operation. Receipt of only bearing or
only DME without the other indicates a malfunctioning TACAN station; therefore, the
information received should not be relied upon. Since bearing and DME are integral; even with
proper identification, receipt of one without the other not only indicates a malfunctioning
TACAN, it also signifies the built in error detection system has failed to automatically deactivate
16                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

the TACAN. The monitoring system is designed to detect radial shift errors in excess of ±1°
from the design reference point. The system also continuously monitors the NAVAID
equipment to detect power fluctuations, inaccurate signals, etc., and should automatically notify
the appropriate ATC responsible for the NAVAID’s proper operation should a malfunction
occur. If using a TACAN for primary navigation, and reception is suspect or bearing and/or
distance breaks lock in flight, you should retune and identify the selected NAVAID, switch to an
alternate NAVAID, verify your position with other sources of navigation data, and check on the
status of the ground equipment by querying ATC.

1.3.4. TACAN Identification. TACAN stations transmit an aural IDENT through international
Morse code every 30 seconds. There is only one transmitter for bearing, DME information, and
station identification. For this reason, the station identification is designed to operate less than
continuously, and the aircraft equipment has an installed memory system (approximately 3
seconds), which provides bearing and DME information while the signals are off the air during
an identification.

1.3.5. Theory of Operation.

1.3.5.1. The operating principle of the TACAN system is based on phase comparison of radio
signals for bearing information. It can be defined as the measurement of the time interval
between receptions from two separate signals.

1.3.5.2. Two basic signals are produced by the rotation of the inner and outer reflectors of the
central antenna. A 15 Hz signal is produced once during each rotation of the inner reflector. A
135 Hz signal is produced nine times with each rotation of the outer reflector. When the radio
wave’s maximum (lobe) of the 15 Hz signal passes through Magnetic East, a separate omni-
directional signal is transmitted. This is the main reference signal. When each of the nine lobes
of the 135 Hz signal passes through magnetic east, nine additional omni-directional signals are
transmitted and designated auxiliary reference signals (one of which is paired with the main
reference signal). These reference signals create nine separate 40 degree sectors within the 360
degree azimuth (reference 1.3.11.1 for azimuth lock on error indications).

1.3.6. Measuring Aircraft Bearing. To determine the aircraft’s position from the station (bearing
TO the station), a phase signal is electronically measured. This is done between the main
reference signal and 15 Hz signal. This time interval is converted to an angle, which isolates one
of the nine 40° segments. The time interval between the reception of the auxiliary reference
signal and the maximum of the 135 Hz signal is then measured within that segment. This angular
difference is finally converted into degrees magnetic and displayed on the TACAN bearing
pointer. For practical purposes, there are 360 radials which are read off the “tail” of the bearing
pointer. As previously mentioned, TACAN navigation is dependent on LOS operation between
the NAVAID and the aircraft’s receiver antenna. Temporary disruption of the TACAN signals
can occur in flight when the aircraft fuselage, gear, external stores, terrain, a wingman or other
obstruction gets between the ground station and the aircraft antenna. Receipt of a signal is also
not available during the TACAN station’s identification transmission. To combat these affects, a
3-second memory circuit within the receiver maintains the last bearing when there is a loss of
signal reception.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  17

1.3.7. Determining Distance. TACAN DME is measured by calculating the elapsed time
between transmission of interrogating pulses of the airborne set and reception of corresponding
reply pulses from the ground station. The aircraft transmitter initiates the interrogation process
by sending out a distance pulse signal. Receipt of this signal by the ground station receiver
activates its transmitter to reply in turn with a distance pulse signal. These pulses require 12
microseconds round-trip travel time per nautical mile (nm) of distance from the ground beacon.
Since a large number of aircraft could be interrogating the same beacon, the airborne set must
sort out only the pulses that correspond to its own interrogations. Interrogation pulses are
transmitted on an irregular random basis by the airborne set, which then “searches” for replies
synchronized to its own interrogations. If the signals are interrupted, a memory circuit maintains
the indication on the range indicator for approximately 10 seconds to prevent the search
operation from recurring. This range is accurate to within ± 600 feet plus 0.02 percent (0.02%
equals 240 feet at 200 nm) of the distance being measured. Although the TACAN can handle an
unlimited number of bearing interrogations, the ground equipment responsible for providing
DME is only capable of responding to 100 simultaneous interrogations before saturation occurs.
When more than 100 DME interrogations are received, the TACAN is designed to automatically
disregard the weaker signals.

1.3.8. The Cone of Silence. There is cone-shaped volume of airspace above the NAVAID
within which the CDI will fluctuate and bearing information becomes unreliable. It is commonly
referred to as the “cone of confusion.” Although distance information is still received, it is
providing vertical range versus an indication of horizontal distance. When an aircraft enters the
“cone of silence,” the DME equipment will approximate aircraft altitude (or vertical distance
over station) in miles with the expected distance to horizontally transgress the zone being twice
this measured distance. For example, an aircraft at 12000 feet will indicate 2 DME with loss of
bearing information for a horizontal distance of 4 NM. For this reason, a TACAN station is not
suitable as a holding fix or High Altitude Initial Approach Fix (IAF).

1.3.9. Station Passage. As the aircraft enters the “cone of silence” the bearing pointer will break
lock and begin to rotate. The track indicator and TO/FROM indicator may also reflect the
bearing pointer movement. If installed, the course warning flag will appear. The range indicator
will continue to decrease until the aircraft is over the station; then it will begin to increase as the
aircraft passes the station. As the aircraft leaves the “cone of silence,” the bearing pointer will
stabilize and the track indicator will resume its normal indication. Station passage is determined
when the range indicator stops decreasing. Aircrews can anticipate when station passage will
likely occur since the DME will normally approximate aircraft altitude above the station in
miles. For example, the range indicator in an aircraft at 30,000 feet above a station will normally
stop decreasing at approximately 5 nm. Lateral displacement from a course that passes directly
over the station may affect these approximations; therefore, regardless of aircraft altitude,
consider station passage to have occurred when the TACAN DME stops decreasing.

1.3.10. Usable Range. Although the operational principles are different, TACANs are also
listed according to the same standard service volumes (SSVs) that categorize other ground based
NAVAIDs (refer to para 1.2.4.1) and approximate the same level of operational performance.
Since the bearing and distance information is subject to LOS restrictions, at low altitudes, the
curvature of the earth, terrain, and buildings can restrict the distance from which the TACAN
signal is received from a ground station. Even though TACANs are rated according to the SSV
18                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

classification system, due to design features, receipt of bearing and distance information may be
acquired outside the standard parameters.

1.3.11. TACAN Characteristics and Errors. Since TACAN bearing and distance signals are
subject to LOS restrictions, the rotating bearing pointer and DME indicator may break lock if
these signals are obstructed beyond a certain length of time. Aircraft receiver memory circuits
prevent unlocking when signals are obstructed for short periods (10 seconds for DME and 3
seconds for bearing indications). Should a break lock occur, the equipment will stay unlocked
until the obstruction is removed and/or the bearing and DME reacquired. Extended maneuvering
that causes the TACAN antenna to be obstructed from clear signal acquisition with the ground
station for more than 3 to 10 seconds may cause a break lock condition.

1.3.11.1. Azimuth Error Lock On. The construction of the TACAN ground antenna (one main
and eight auxiliary reference pulses), makes it possible to have 40° azimuth error lock on. When
the airborne receiver is working correctly, these pulses lock onto the airborne equipment with the
main reference at 90°. When the airborne receiver is weak, the main reference pulse may “slide
over,” miss the 90° slot, and lock on at one of the auxiliary positions. When this occurs, azimuth
indications will be 40° (or some multiple of 40°) in error. Should this happen, re-channeling the
receiver to deliberately make it unlock may help re-acquire the TACAN signals and display
proper instrument indications for your aircraft position in relation to the ground station. To
confirm suspected TACAN errors, if available, use other navigational or geographical references
to fix your position. False or incorrect lock-on indications in the aircraft can also be caused by
misalignment or excessive wear of the internal components of the receiver. The wear of these
components or other misalignment can cause the wrong TACAN transmitter being tuned in, or
miss it entirely, resulting in a constant unlock. Should this occur, re-channeling from the
selected channel number and back (preferably from the opposite direction to the original setting)
will sometimes correct the error.

1.3.11.2. Co-channel Interference. Co-channel interference occurs when an aircraft is in a
position to receive TACAN signals from more than one ground station which utilizes the same
frequency. Since it is not possible for individual TACAN receivers to accept information from
more than one input source, when the aircraft is in a position to potentially receive two
TACANs, it is possible for your aircraft equipment to select and display unintended navigational
data. The only way to positively identify which TACAN you are using for navigation is through
its Morse code identification. Co-channel interference is not a malfunction of either air or
ground equipment, it is a result of ground equipment location in relation to aircraft position.

1.3.12. TACAN Approaches. To use the aircraft’s TACAN receiver to fly an approach, the term
“TACAN” or “TAC” must be published in the instrument procedures title (e.g., VOR or TACAN
RWY 18 or VORTAC RWY 36 – both examples stipulate that the approach may be flown using
either the VOR or TACAN equipment on the aircraft). Even if the NAVAID providing
navigational guidance is a VORTAC, if the approach is listed as a VOR and there is no mention
of TACAN in the approach name, the aircraft’s TACAN equipment cannot be used to fly the
approach.

1.4. Instrument Landing System (ILS).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              19

1.4.1. Introduction. The precision ILS consists of three separate components that, when
combined, form the system required to provide guidance, range, and visual information to the
aircrew. Electronic lateral and vertical guidance is provided by the localizer and glideslope
transmitter while range information may be provided in the form of associated marker beacons,
compass locators, precision radar, and/or DME (or a combination thereof). Visual information is
supplied by the approach light system (ALS, see 1.4.3.7), runway lights and at some locations,
touchdown and centerline lights. The electronic components of the system (localizer and
glideslope) are internally monitored and should automatically switch to a standby localizer or
glideslope transmitter in the event a malfunction is detected in the primary system.

1.4.1.1. NOTE: Compass locators may be substituted for the outer marker (OM) and middle
marker (MM). DME, crossing radial, or radar, when specified in the IAP, may be substituted for
the OM.

1.4.2. ILS Categories.

1.4.2.1. The ILS is classified by category according to both the ground and aircraft performance
capabilities. The lowest minimums with all required ground and airborne system components
operative are listed below. Reference the inoperative components section on the approach plate
to adjust landing minimums (if required).

1.4.2.1.1. Category I ILS equipment provides guidance information down to a Decision Height
(DH) of not less than 200 feet and a visibility of ½ statute mile or Runway Visual Range (RVR)
of 2,400 feet.

1.4.2.1.1.1. NOTE: With touchdown zone and centerline lighting, the visibility may be reduced
to 1800 RVR.

1.4.2.1.2. Category II ILS offer lower minimums with improved equipment (airborne and
ground) and an aircrew certification process to enable the use of a DH not less than 100 feet and
an RVR not less than 1,200 feet.

1.4.2.1.3. Category III ILS have three separate levels (a, b, and c). These approaches may have
DH below 100 feet or no DH published at all along with varying visibility requirements.

1.4.2.1.3.1. Category IIIa ILS provides for an approach that has a DH lower than 100 feet or has
no published DH and requires a RVR of at least 700 feet (the pilot is usually required to see the
runway to land).

1.4.2.1.3.2. Category IIIb ILS provides for an approach with DH below 50 feet or has no
published DH with a RVR requirement of not less than 150 feet (the pilot is usually not required
to see the runway to land).

1.4.2.1.3.3. Category IIIc ILS is essentially a zero/zero approach with no DH or RVR
requirement.

1.4.3. Components.
20                                                   AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

1.4.3.1. Localizer Transmitter. The localizer transmitter provides lateral guidance and is usually
located at the departure end of the runway so that it transmits its course signal along the extended
runway centerline.

1.4.3.2. Glideslope Transmitter. The glideslope transmitter normally sits about 1,000 feet from
the runway threshold so the Threshold Crossing Height (TCH) of a 3-degree glideslope is
between 30 and 50 feet. Not taking into account the final flare, if an aircraft is on the glideslope
and does not alter its descent angle after passing the runway threshold, it would touch down
abeam the glideslope antenna.

1.4.3.2.1. NOTE: The TCH is the altitude the aircraft receiver antenna crosses the threshold.
Depending on the location of the receiver antenna, aircraft type, pitch attitude and aircraft
position in relation to the glideslope, it is critical that the aircrew understand that the aircraft’s
landing gear may cross the threshold at a significantly lower altitude when compared to what is
displayed on the aircraft’s altimeter or radar altimeter.

1.4.3.3. Outer Marker. If an OM is installed, it is normally located approximately 5 nm from the
runway threshold and usually coincides with the point at which an aircraft on the localizer at the
glideslope intercept altitude will intercept the glideslope.

1.4.3.4. Middle Marker. If a MM is installed, it is approximately ½ mile from the threshold and
defines the point where an airplane on the glideslope reaches the Category I ILS DH.

1.4.3.5. Inner Marker (IM). An Inner Marker (IM) is located at the Category II ILS DH.

1.4.3.6. Compass Locator. There may be a low-power NDB, known as a compass locator, at the
OM or MM position. A low power NDB is either a LOM or LMM (refer to paragraph 1.1.6.4).
Where NDBs are utilized to define either the LOM and LMM position, they are designed to
operate in conjunction with the marker beacon equipment onboard your aircraft.

1.4.3.7. Approach Lighting System (ALS). An ALS is part of the ILS and aids the aircrew in
transitioning from instrument to visual conditions. The ALS comes in a variety of lighting
configurations depending on the instrument approach serving the runway. For precision
approaches, the ALS will normally extend 2400-3000 feet (approximately ½ mile) from the
landing threshold . Of note, at some military airfields, the normal ALS requirements for a
precision approach have been waived and may be as short as 2000 feet. In contrast, for non-
precision approaches, the ALS may only extend 1400-1500 feet (approximately ¼ mile) into the
approach area. For a complete description of different ALS systems, including diagrams, refer to
the Flight Information Handbook, the AIM, or the legend at the front of an Instrument Approach
Procedures (IAP) booklet.

1.4.4. Localizer Transmitter.

1.4.4.1. The localizer transmitter is normally located about 1,000 feet beyond the departure end
of the ILS runway. ILS localizer transmitters use the odd-decimal VHF frequencies from 108.10
to 111.95 (for example, 108.7). The antenna is normally positioned in line with the runway
centerline and radiates a 90-cycle and 150-cycle signal patterns on opposite sides of the extended
runway centerline. The 150-cycle signal is on the right when looking at the runway from the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 21

OM; and the 90-cycle signal is on the left. The course is formed along the extended runway
centerline (toward OM) where the signals overlap and are of equal strength. This course is
referred to as the front course.

1.4.4.1.1. WARNING: Since the same localizer frequency may be used for both landing
directions to the runway, it is critical to identify the localizer using Morse code to prevent flying
the wrong localizer course.

1.4.4.1.2. NOTE: Some aircraft’s ILS equipment may not be capable of receiving the .05 MHz
frequency even though the VOR equipment will receive this signal. In this case, the aircrew will
be unable to receive the ILS signal and cannot fly the ILS approach. These .05 MHz frequencies
are designed to eliminate a single frequency used for ILS equipment at both ends of a runway at
locations where frequency congestion is a concern.

1.4.4.2. Morse Code and Communication Capabilities. The Morse Code identifier for an ILS
normally consists of four letters, the first of which is always an “I.” There are instances where
the localizer associated with an ILS may have only three letters (e.g. Canadian instrument
procedures). At some locations, ATC may also have voice capability on these frequencies. An
underlined frequency indicates the transmitter has no voice capability. Localizer frequencies are
received by the same equipment as VOR signals; therefore, although different internal circuitry
is used to decode the course signal and the sensitivity varies between the two, the course
deviation indicator (CDI) reacts to them similarly.

1.4.4.3. Localizer Width. Depending on the distance of the transmitter from the landing
threshold, the localizer course width may vary from 3° to 6°. The exact width is chosen to
produce a signal ± 350 feet either side of centerline at the threshold. Since the localizer is
approximately four times more sensitive than a VOR signal, a full scale CDI deflection indicates
1.5° to 3° off course. On an instrument where two dots corresponds to full scale deflection, a
CDI off course indication of one dot represents approximately 800 feet displacement from
centerline at the OM and approximately 250 feet at the MM (based on a localizer width of 5°, a
runway length of 8,000 feet, and touchdown point 1,000 feet from threshold).

1.4.4.4. Localizer Alignment. The localizer is normally aligned with the extended runway
centerline; however, it may be offset up to 3 degrees. If the approach course alignment exceeds
3 degrees, then the instrument approach will be published as an LDA (refer to paragraph 1.4.15).

1.4.4.5. Back Course Localizer. Most localizer transmitters also provide a signal pattern around
the runway so course signals also overlap in the opposite direction forming a back course. Every
localizer antenna puts out a back course signal unless it is shielded. A back course localizer has
an on-course zone which is monitored and flight checked to wider tolerances than the inbound
(front) course associated with the ILS. It will normally vary between 3° to 6° wide depending on
the particular installation.

1.4.4.5.1. Back-course localizer IAPs are often published for civilian airfields and, on occasion,
military airfields.

1.4.4.5.2. NOTE: Disregard all glideslope signal indications when making a back course
approach unless a usable published glideslope is specified for that approach.
22                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

1.4.4.5.3. Back Course Localizer CDI Indications. When flying inbound on the back course, the
CDI is not directional unless the published front course for the ILS is placed in the course select
window of an HSI. The course arrow will be at the bottom of the HSI. Back course approaches
are flown using techniques similar to those for localizer approaches. Since the localizer antenna
will normally be on the approach end of the runway, the CDI will be more sensitive than a front
course localizer as you approach the runway. Unless your aircraft is equipped with reverse
sensing capability, the command bars of a flight director may not provide directional information
or function properly without the correct back course flight guidance mode selected. Consult
your aircraft flight manual for system specific guidance.

1.4.5. Caution Regarding the Use of Localizers.

1.4.5.1. Localizers are subject to reflection from terrain, buildings, vehicles, and aircraft (on the
ground or in the air). These reflections may cause scalloping and/or roughness in the course
deviation indicator and course bending. Scalloping indications are defined by a smooth rhythmic
deviation of the localizer course. Rough or ragged indications are defined by irregular or erratic
course deviations. When experiencing scalloping or irregular course deviations during an
approach, depending on the severity, the aircrew may elect to “average out” the deviations to
maintain a flyable course; however, any irregular indication received on your aircraft instruments
while in IMC conditions during an approach should be a cause for concern. Under these
circumstances, unless visual references associated with an instrument approach are present,
serious consideration should be given to executing a missed approach. A bend in the course is
not noticeable from the cockpit since the indications will appear normal. The ILS localizer and
glideslope signal may receive reflective interference when vehicles or aircraft are operated near
the localizer or glideslope antennas. To protect signal integrity, navigational reception, and
prevent distortion, at many airfields, an ILS critical area is established.

1.4.5.2. ILS Critical Area.

1.4.5.2.1. Localizer Critical Area. When reported conditions are less than 800-foot ceiling
and/or visibility is less than 2 statute miles, ATC will not authorize aircraft or vehicles to operate
inside the critical area while an aircraft is between the ILS final approach fix (OM or fix used in
lieu of the OM) and the airport. Operations inside the critical area may be allowed if:

1.4.5.2.1.1. The aircraft on the approach has reported the airfield in sight and is circling or side-
stepping to land on a runway other than the ILS runway.

1.4.5.2.1.2. A preceding aircraft on take-off or missed approach to the same or adjacent RWY
will pass through the area.

1.4.5.2.1.3. A preceding aircraft on the same or adjacent RWY will pass through the area while
landing or exiting the RWY.

1.4.5.2.2. In addition, when the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet or reported visibility less
than ½ mile (RVR 2000), all vehicle and aircraft are restricted from proceeding beyond the
instrument hold line (no exceptions) while an aircraft flying an ILS approach is inside the middle
marker.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  23

1.4.5.2.3. Glideslope Critical Area. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or visibility
is less than two miles, ATC will not authorize vehicle or aircraft operations in or over the critical
area. Operation inside the critical area may be authorized if:

1.4.5.2.3.1. The arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is circling to land on
another runway.

1.4.5.2.4. Additional Considerations.

1.4.5.2.4.1. If an arriving aircraft advises the tower that an AUTOLAND or COUPLED
approach will be flown, an advisory will be given when another vehicle or aircraft is in or over
the critical area while inside the ILS MM or 1 nm from touchdown if there is no MM.

1.4.5.2.4.2. Aircraft holding below 5,000 feet between the OM and the airport may cause
localizer signal variations for aircraft conducting ILS approaches. To prevent this, holding in
this area is not authorized when the ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility less than 2
statute miles.

1.4.5.2.4.3. Critical areas are not monitored at uncontrolled airfields and aircrews must be aware
that vehicles and aircraft not subject to ATC may cause interference with the localizer and glide
slope signals being received. Also, when the weather at controlled airfields is at/or above 800
feet and/or 2 statute miles, protective measures are not required and may not be implemented.
Aircraft conducting AUTOLAND or COUPLED approaches should monitor aircraft equipment
closely since signal interference may cause abrupt and/or excessive deviations in the aircraft
flight path or cause an unintended go-around command input.

1.4.5.3. Limits. Flight inspection aircraft regularly confirm the coverage and validity of ILS
localizer signals within 35° either side of a front course approach path to a distance of 10 nm and
through 10° either side of a front course approach path to a distance of 18 nm. A ground
monitoring system continuously evaluates the signal integrity and strength within the defined
parameters and should automatically switch to the secondary system or shut down the primary if
a malfunction is detected.

1.4.5.3.1. NOTE: Unless a higher services volume is indicated, the integrity of the signal
received cannot be guaranteed beyond the standard limits. When operating outside the standard
parameters and receiving ILS signals (course and/or glideslope), the aircrew should be aware that
erratic indications are possible.

1.4.5.4. False Courses or Low Clearances. It has been found that terrain or failure of certain
electronic elements within the localizer antennae may cause false courses or low clearances
within 35° of the front or back course centerline of a localizer without being detected by the
localizer monitoring system or onboard navigational equipment (see note).

1.4.5.4.1. CAUTION: Due to this potential, aircrews should confirm the localizer on-course
indication by referring to aircraft heading and utilizing other navigational resources (such as an
ADF bearing from the LOM) before commencing final descent. Any abnormal indications
experienced within 35° of the published front or back course centerline of an ILS localizer
should be reported to the appropriate ATC facility.
24                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

1.4.5.4.2. NOTE: A low clearance is a less than full scale deflection of the CDI at a position
where a full scale deflection should be displayed.

1.4.6. Glideslope Transmitter.

1.4.6.1. General Description. The glideslope transmitter is located approximately 750 to 1,250
feet down the runway from the approach end and 250 to 650 feet from the centerline. Like the
localizer transmitter, 90 and 150 Hertz (Hz) signal patterns are transmitted to form a glideslope.
The 150 Hz signal is below the glideslope; the 90 Hz signal is above it. The area of equal
strength forms the glideslope. These signals transmit out the front course with the glideslope
angle normally set to between 2½° to 3°. This angle usually approximates intersecting the MM
and OM (where installed) at 200 feet and 1,400 feet above the runway elevation respectively
along the extended glide slope. The glideslope envelope extends 0.7° above and below this
angle. With the aircraft established on course, the glideslope has a usable range of 10 nm
(measured from the glideslope antenna) unless an expanded service volume is established. Due
to glide path signal reflection and disturbances close to the ground (between 18 and 27 feet
AGL), a reliable glide path may not be received below these levels. Because of this limitation,
the aircrew should be aware that, unless certified as a CAT III ILS, the glideslope should not be
expected to provide complete guidance to a touchdown point on the runway.

1.4.6.2. Glideslope Frequencies. Glideslope transmitters operate in the 329.15 and 335.0 MHz
UHF frequency band and are paired to specific localizer frequencies. In most aircraft, the
glideslope receiver is automatically tuned when the localizer frequency is selected. Since
glideslope transmitters do not emit identification signals, on-board instrument warning flags are
the only means of determining the validity of glideslope signals.

1.4.6.3. Glide Path Errors. The ultra-high frequency (UHF) glide path signal is subject to
reflection from surface irregularities, vegetation, and other aircraft. The impact to the radio
signal caused by aircraft near the landing runway is the reason for the additional hold-short line
protecting the ILS critical area during poor weather. All procedures are flight checked to ensure
the procedure is flyable and any course irregularities like bends are within tolerance. Pilots are
unlikely to perceive any course irregularities on a published approach, but if a notable course
irregularity occurs, sufficient to cause the autopilot to decouple, the pilot should report the issue
to the airfield manager. An insidious error without an off flag glideslope warning occurs when
the pilot intercepts what is referred as the “false” glideslope. If a pilot intercepts a glideslope
inside the FAF (between the FAF and the runway) it is possible to intercept a “false” glideslope.
This is another reason for pilots to crosscheck their control/performance instrumentation. Pilots
flying a “false” glide path will notice an unusually steep approach with a much lower power
setting and a much higher than expected VVI. ILS approaches are evaluated by flight check
aircrew on a periodic basis to ensure users on the localizer course will receive a full fly-down
indication prior to a false glideslope. Additionally, false glide slope signals may also be received
during a back course localizer approach which may cause the glideslope warning flag (normally
in view) to disappear and give the impression that reliable glideslope is being displayed. When
flying a back course localizer, unless the glideslope’s use is specified on the IAP, consider any
glide slope indications to be erroneous.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              25

1.4.7. ILS DME. In most cases, ILS DME is also provided. If provided, the DME is usually
automatically paired with the LOC frequency and displayed when LOC frequency is selected. If
your DME is manually tuned, you will have to set it to the ILS DME frequency. The DME
provided may or may not be the distance to touch down depending on the location of the
transmitter. The pilot/crew can increase their situational awareness by comparing the published
DME at key points along the approach with the distance remaining to the runway provided on
the instrument approach plate.

1.4.8. Marker Beacons. Marker beacons are very low-powered 75 MHz transmitters located
along ILS final to “mark” a specific position along the approach course. Normally, two marker
beacons are used for this purpose, and are depicted on the terminal chart by the letters OM and
MM. An additional beacon called an IM may also be installed for Category II and Category III
ILS procedures. The beacons are identified in the aircraft visually (marker beacon light) and/or
aurally depending on your aircraft’s avionics equipment. The reception area of the aural signal is
larger than the visual signal. Marker beacons are not installed for navigation purposes, but
indicate a specific point on the localizer course to provide distance information of aircraft
position in relation to the runway.

1.4.8.1. Outer Marker (OM). The OM normally is located 4 to 7 nm from the end of the runway
and is identified aurally by the receipt of continuous low pitched (400 Hz) Morse code “dashes.”
Depending on your aircraft’s equipment, passing over the OM is also signified by actuation of
the blue marker beacon light. Normal width of this signal is 1,350 feet to 2,650 feet, which
means the light will flash for 7 to 13 seconds at 120 knots groundspeed (GS). The published
altitude at the OM is what the altimeter should indicate when the aircraft is over the marker and
on the glideslope; however, there are no specific limits. The OM altitude may also be the
procedure turn or glideslope interception altitude.

1.4.8.2. Middle Marker (MM). The MM is located approximately 3,500 feet from the runway
and is identified by alternating dots and dashes. The aural signal is comparatively high pitched
(1,300 Hz) and is easily distinguished from the OM signal. The MM actuates an amber marker
beacon light. The normal width of this signal is 675 to 1,325 feet, which means the light will
flash for 3 to 7 seconds at 120 knots GS. Category I published minimums are normally reached
at or near the MM whereby if an aircraft is on glideslope, it will be at an altitude of
approximately 200 feet above the elevation of the touchdown zone. The MM may not be used as
the sole method of identifying the MAP.

1.4.8.3. Inner Marker (IM). The IM is normally associated with and considered an integral part
of Category II and Category III ILSs. Receipt of the IM should coincide with the aircraft
arriving at a designated point that corresponds to the DH on the glideslope for a Category II ILS
and will mark the approximate position of an aircraft as it progresses along a CAT III ILS. The
IM is modulated at 3000 Hz and identified with continuous dots keyed at the rate of six dots per
second. The normal width of this signal is between 340 to 660 feet, which means the light will
flash for 2 to 3 seconds at 120 knots GS.

1.4.8.4. Back Marker (BM). A BM is located on a back course 3 to 5 nm from the runway
threshold and is identified by an aural tone of 6 dots per second. It modulates at an audio
frequency of 400 Hz per second (low pitched) and actuates the blue marker beacon light. At
26                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

some locations the BM may be supplanted by a “fix” intersection composed of the localizer
course and a radial from a VOR or a bearing from a non-directional beacon. Where installed, the
BM is used to mark the FAF on a published back course localizer approach.

1.4.9. Compass Locators. If the instrument approach design utilizes a compass locator, it is
usually installed to coincide with either the middle or outer marker beacon sites (MM and OM,
see 1.4.8.1 and 1.4.8.2). They can be an integral part of the instrument approach procedure or
used as an additional aid to navigation. Compass locators are low powered, non-directional radio
beacons operating between 200 and 415 KHz with a reliable reception range of at least 15 nm.
However, higher powered, low-frequency non-directional radio beacons may be collocated with
the marker beacons and used as compass locators. These generally carry TWEB information
(also see 1.1.6.4 and 1.1.7.2).

1.4.10. Flying an ILS.

1.4.10.1. Aircraft control. When flying an ILS approach the most common tendency is to “fly”
the CDI and GSI and neglect to incorporate a continual crosscheck of the control/performance
instruments. Immediate and smooth corrections should be made on the control instruments
based on aircraft and flight path performance indications. The importance of precise aircraft
control cannot be over emphasized. If a flight director is inoperative or unavailable, assessing
the affects of winds and determining a heading that compensates for drift will help significantly
in maintaining the inbound course. Small heading corrections to maintain track are important
during the final approach stage. Make these corrections with reference to the aircraft heading
indicator or compass because the CDI or GSI gives may only the aircraft position relative to the
inbound track or glide slope. “Chasing the CDI or GSI” is a sign of poor basic instrument flying.
If the aircraft drifts off the localizer, causing the CDI to move away from the center, make a
correction towards the CDI using the aircraft compass/heading indicator to regain the localizer.
Then select a new heading that accounts for wind drift.

1.4.10.2. Radar Vectors. When being radar vectored to an ILS final, retain radar service until
established at a point where you can transition to the published procedure. According to Order
7110.65, Air Traffic Control, the controller is required to provide vector headings to within 30°
of the localizer course, at least 2 nm from the glideslope intercept point, and at an altitude below
the glideslope (see 1.4.6.3 for potential glide path errors). When the controller issues the final
vector, altitude, and clearance for the approach, you should know your position in relation to the
airfield. If the aircraft is at a range beyond the coverage of the approach chart, maintain the last
assigned ATC altitude until established on a published segment of the approach. “Published
segment” means the course, radial, localizer, as appropriate, and the altitude for that segment of
the approach. You must be complying with both published course guidance and altitudes to be
established on a published segment of the approach. The localizer course may be flown outside
of the 18 nm flight-check distance if the instrument procedure depicts a greater distance or radar
service is provided. If the controller clears you to intercept a localizer course, regardless of the
distance from the antenna, radar service is being provided and you are expected to intercept the
localizer. Query the controller if you have any doubt concerning position or altitude clearance.
It is always highly recommended that you use radar monitoring service when available as an
additional source of information.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               27

1.4.10.3. Intercepting the Localizer. Before localizer interception, set the published front course
in the course selector window so that the aircraft heading/localizer relationship is displayed on
the CDI. The transition may require a large turn onto the localizer course; for example, a
teardrop penetration or procedure turn. If the CDI indicates full scale deflection (course
deviation 2 ½° or greater) during the latter portion of the turn, roll out with an intercept angle
that will ensure localizer interception prior to the glideslope intercept point. Normally a 30° to
45° intercept is sufficient; however, groundspeed, wind drift, distance from the localizer course,
and FAF location may require another intercept angle. Descent to the next lower altitude
published on the IAP should only be initiated IAW the “established on course” guidance found
in Chapter 11 of 11-217V1.

1.4.10.4. Course Deviation Indicator. Maintain the published track, ATC assigned heading, or
course reversal turn until first movement of the CDI whereby you can adjust your intercept bank
angle and heading depending upon the rate of CDI movement. Rate of CDI movement may also
help estimate the force and direction of the winds and aid in establishing an initial wind drift
heading to maintain course. Further adjustment to wind drift corrected headings will need to be
made to maintain course as the approach progresses. Heading corrections should be sufficient to
stop the CDI movement and return the aircraft to course. After returning to course, apply the drift
correction necessary to keep the CDI centered. Except during high crosswind situations, an
accepted technique is to limit heading corrections to within 5 degrees of the inbound course. As
the aircraft continues inbound, smaller and smaller heading changes should be required to
maintain course and adjust for wind drift. During high cross wind landings, establishing a
calculated wind drift heading and then varying aircraft heading no more than 5 degrees from this
reference heading is also a good technique. Maintain the glideslope interception altitude,
configure the aircraft for landing, and establish the final approach airspeed before reaching the
GSI point. Do not descend below glideslope interception altitude if the CDI indicates full scale
deflection.

1.4.10.5. Glideslope Indicator (GSI). As the GSI moves downward from its upper limits,
prepare to intercept the glideslope. Slightly before the GSI reaches the center position, establish
a pitch attitude on the attitude indicator and a power setting that will result in the vertical
velocity and airspeed required to maintain the glide path. The amount of pitch change required
will depend on the difference between the pitch angle required to maintain level flight and
calculated pitch based on the glideslope angle (gradient). VVI required is dependent upon the
aircraft groundspeed and pitch change made in reference to level flight (see Chapter 3, this
manual, regarding 60 to 1 calculations). One technique that may be used when intercepting the
glideslope (if the final approach airspeed and configuration have been established) is to change
the pitch attitude on the attitude indicator the same number of degrees as the glideslope angle,
normally 2 ½° to 3°.

1.4.10.6. Pitch corrections. Once you are established on the glideslope (GS), reference your
vertical velocity indicator to determine if your calculated pitch change, power setting, and VVI is
working. Should a minor deviation from the GS occur, an accepted technique is to make small
coordinated pitch and power changes that result in a vertical velocity change of less than 200 to
300 ft/min. As the aircraft nears re-intercepting the glide path, readjust your pitch and power
setting to reacquire the GS and establish a new descent rate. To correct for minor deviations
from the GS, the pitch change made should result in vertical velocity changes of less than 300
28                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

ft/min. To achieve these corrections, a 1° to 2° pitch change on the attitude indicator coupled
with a small addition or reduction of power is usually sufficient to achieve the desired vertical
velocity change of 200 to 300 ft/min. This glide path control technique works for most aircraft
since it is applicable for approach groundspeeds between 120 and 180 knots. Since the size of
the course and glideslope envelope narrows progressively throughout the approach, the degree of
pitch and bank corrections should also be gradually reduced as the distance to touchdown
decreases.

1.4.10.7. Decision Height (DH). This is one of the most critical parts of an ILS approach since
the pilot is required to make coordinated corrections (if required) to maintain course, glide path,
and airspeed while preparing to either continue or abandon the approach. Upon arrival at the
DH, if sufficient visual references are acquired (see AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Chapter 14), the
pilot can elect to continue the approach and/or land if in a safe if in a safe position to do so. If a
missed approach (MA) is required due to lack of visual references, it is important that you
execute the procedure at the DH. This is because obstacle clearance cannot be assured if you
initiate the MA below DH. This may be particularly hazardous if you are operating a
performance limited aircraft. If the MA is initiated at DH, obstacle clearance takes into account
the momentary dip below DH during the go-around maneuver to accommodate for the
downward vector an aircraft has when flying a constant rate descent (associated with a precision
approaches). Also, it is critical to remember that the CAT I DH is based solely on your
barometric altimeter and not the radar altimeter since the radar altimeter normally indicates the
height of the terrain over which the aircraft is currently flying and not necessarily the HAT listed
on the approach plate. Initiate the missed approach at DH if visual reference with the runway
environment is insufficient to complete the landing, when instructed by the controlling agency,
or when a safe landing is not possible. If the course warning flag is displayed during the final
approach, initiate the missed approach procedure. If the glideslope warning flag is displayed, the
approach may be flown no lower than the published localizer-only altitude or, if not published,
no lower than circling minimum altitude for the aircraft category.

1.4.11. Use of Flight Directors During ILS Approaches. In addition to the information
displayed by a course and glideslope indicator, the flight director provides computed pitch and
bank steering commands for intercepting the localizer course and glideslope to fly the final
approach. This section will give you a basic understanding of flight director functions during
ILS approaches; your aircraft flight manual will give specific guidance on the operation of your
flight director equipment. Two modes of operation, intercept and final approach, may be used
during an ILS approach. These two modes are referred to by various names, ILS, localizer, ILS
approach, etc.

1.4.11.1. Intercept Mode. The intercept mode is used for initial intercept of the localizer. When
this mode is selected, the bank guidance is displayed. Flying the bank guidance should intercept
the published localizer front course. The bank guidance may command up to a 45° angle of
intercept to the localizer front course without regard to the location of the glideslope intercept
(GSI) point. Some flight directors do not correct bank steering commands for wind drift in this
mode, in which case the intercept may have to be made disregarding the bank steering
commands. Before following the intercept mode commands, aircraft intercept heading should be
within 90° or less of the front course to ensure a turn in the shorter direction. The aircraft must be
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               29

positioned by use of other NAVAIDs or radar vectors to ensure localizer course interception
prior to the GSI.

1.4.11.2. Final approach mode. The final approach mode is usually selected (manually or
automatically) when the aircraft is established inbound on the localizer course. Restrictions for
manual selection of the final approach may vary with flight directors. Some systems allow
intercepts up to 90° while others may restrict operators to less than 15° of intercept and CDI
within one dot of center. See your aircraft flight manual for specific operating instructions for
your aircraft. When the final approach mode is selected, both pitch and bank guidance may be
displayed. With automatic glideslope switching, the pitch guidance will not appear until near
glideslope. Normally, bank steering commands are automatically corrected for wind drift in this
mode.

1.4.12. Front Course Approach. This approach is performed by maneuvering the aircraft as
depicted in reference to the published terminal IAP or through the receipt of radar vectors to
intercept the localizer course inbound. The pilot should analyze the entire approach procedure,
landing environment, missed approach procedure as well as descent and missed approach climb
gradient restrictions before beginning the approach (preferably during pre-mission planning if
able). Tune and identify the ILS as soon as practical during the transition. Set the published
localizer front course in the course selector window. Position the flight director switches for
localizer interception. The bank guidance will come into view. Use all available NAVAIDs
(NDB or TACAN for example), to remain aware of your aircraft’s position relative to the
localizer and glideslope intercept point.

1.4.12.1. Transitioning to the Localizer. When the aircraft is properly positioned and its heading
is within flight manual tolerances, bank the aircraft to center the CDI. Depending on your
aircraft’s avionics and flight director system, the final approach mode is usually selected either
when established on a base leg or when the final course is intercepted. Most systems will
provide a bank steering signal that is corrected for wind drift thereby decreasing the pilot’s
workload in flying the approach and enable some of their attention to be focused elsewhere if
needed.

1.4.12.2. Intercepting the Glideslope. Disregard the pitch steering command and maintain
glideslope interception altitude, published or assigned, until reaching the GSI point. Establish the
aircraft final approach configuration and airspeed in accordance with the aircraft flight manual.
Do not descend below glideslope interception altitude if the CDI indicates full scale deflection.
The GSI will move from the upper limits of the glideslope deviation scale toward center as the
aircraft approaches the glideslope intercept point. When the GSI approaches an on-glideslope
indication, adjust aircraft pitch to follow the steering command. Control pitch and power to
maintain final approach airspeed. Call the controlling agency at the FAF (OM, compass locator,
DME, radar, etc.) according to position reports required by the Flight Information Handbook
(FIH). During the remainder of the approach, control aircraft pitch and bank attitude to follow
the steering commands. Monitor flight path and aircraft performance instruments to ensure that
the desired flight path is being flown and aircraft performance is within acceptable limits. A
common and dangerous error when flying an ILS with the flight director is the over reliance on
the steering bars. It is important to cross check the information provided by the steering bars
with the other navigational instrumentation (raw data) and aircraft performance instruments.
30                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

Failure of the flight director computer may not be accompanied by the appearance of warning
flags. Steering commands should always be correlated with flight path raw data (CDI and GSI)
and aircraft performance instruments.

1.4.13. Localizer Approaches. Localizer-only approaches are planned and flown as non-
precision approaches. If the approach is based on timing, it’s important that the aircraft is
configured and on final approach speed prior to the FAF and the timing is commenced at the
FAF. There are also localizer-only approaches that use DME as the missed approach point
(MAP). Execute a missed approach when you have reached the MAP (timing or DME) and the
runway environment is not in sight or a safe landing is not possible.

1.4.14. Localizer Back Course Approach. This is a non-precision approach since glideslope
information is usually not provided (see 1.4.6.3). To maintain the proper aircraft
heading/localizer course relationship, set the published front course in the course selector
window. When inbound on the back course, the course arrow will point to the bottom of the
HSI. The CDI will now be directional. Back course approaches are flown using techniques
similar to those for localizer approaches. Since the localizer antenna will normally be on the
approach end of the runway, the CDI will be more sensitive than a front course localizer as you
approach the runway. Unless the flight director has a back course localizer mode, it should not be
used since steering information is reversed.

1.4.15. Localizer-type Directional Aid (LDA). This is of comparable use and accuracy to a
localizer, but is not part of a complete ILS system. The LDA course usually provides a more
precise approach course than a simplified directional facility (SDF) does (see paragraph 1.4.16
for more information on SDF).

1.4.15.1. Approach Alignment. The most important factor to remember about the LDA is that it
does not line up with the runway. It is just localizer (or ILS) that is offset more than 3°. Straight-
in minimums may be published if the LDA alignment with the runway does not exceed 30°.
Circling minimums are published when this alignment exceeds 30°. Although rare, there are
LDAs that do include a glideslope. They contain a bold typed note signifying the presence of a
usable glideslope.

1.4.15.2. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) LDA. You may see ICAO
approaches that list the approach as an “IGS,” an Instrument Guidance System. Essentially, this
is the ICAO version of the US LDA and uses the same procedures and data.

1.4.16. Simplified Directional Facility (SDF). This facility provides a final approach course
similar to that of the ILS localizer and the LDA; however, A SDF approach will not have
glideslope capability.

1.4.16.1. Frequencies. The SDF transmits signals within the 108.10 to 111.95 MHz frequency
range.

1.4.16.2. Approaches. The approach techniques and procedures used on an SDF instrument
approach are essentially the same as those used on a normal localizer approach. However, the
SDF course may not be aligned with the runway and the course is normally wider. These factors
result in a less precise approach. The SDF signal width is fixed at either 6° or 12° as necessary
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                31

to provide for maximum flyability and optimum course quality. Usable off-course indications
are limited to 35° on either side of the course centerline. Any instrument indications received
beyond this 35° limit must be disregarded.

1.4.16.3. Approach Alignment. The SDF antenna may be offset from the runway centerline. For
this reason, you must refer to the IAP chart to see at what angle the final approach course will
bring you into the runway. Normally this angle is not more than 3°; but because the approach
course begins at the SDF antenna, an approach continued beyond the runway threshold will lead
your aircraft to an offset position, not to the runway centerline.

1.4.16.4. Identifier. Identification of the SDF is accomplished by the three-letter Morse Code
identifier found on the IAP chart.

1.5. Precautions to Prevent Navigation Errors.

1.5.1. To prevent navigational errors, it is critical to ensure that the NAVAID providing primary
course guidance is properly identified. This is accomplished by continuously monitoring a
station’s identification (IDENT) either through a visual display or by listening to the aural Morse
code at a sufficient volume to detect a malfunction should one occur (refer to AFMAN 11-217
Volume 1, Chapter 7).

1.5.2. In addition to using the primary NAVAID, aircrew should increase their situational
awareness by using all available navigational sources to confirm their aircraft’s position relative
to heading, desired location, ETA, and terrain.

1.5.3. Check NOTAMs and FLIP before flight for possible malfunctions or limitations on
NAVAIDs to be used.

1.5.4. Discontinue use of any suspect NAVAID and, if necessary, confirm aircraft position with
radar or other equipment.

1.6. Reporting Malfunctions.

1.6.1. Since most NAVAIDs are designed with automatic back-up capabilities and/or monitored
by ATC; NAVAID anomalies are normally transparent to aircrews when operating in the
national airspace system (NAS). Despite these features, both the ground and space-based
NAVAIDS do experience malfunctions that may make them unreliable for use. When a
NAVAID signal is suspect (e.g., error message, “red” flag, lack of IDENT) and the instrument
indications are not the result of internal aircraft instrumentation problems (e.g., wrong frequency
or NAV source tuned) or aircraft positioning (e.g., beyond NAVAID service volume); aircrews
should report anomalies to the nearest ATC facility. Upon receipt of a reported problem, ATC
will normally ask a second aircraft to confirm NAVAID reception difficulties and/or contact the
facility responsible for monitoring the NAVAID to determine status and ensure back-up system
(if capable) is activated. This status and actions taken (if any) will normally be reported back to
the aircrew.

                                              Chapter 2

                                      WAKE TURBULENCE

2.1. Purpose. This chapter is intended to increase an aircrew’s awareness of potential hazards
associated with aircraft wake turbulence and generated disturbances associated with ground
operations. Following the initial discussions, techniques are provided in graphical format that
are designed to help mitigate the adverse effects of wake turbulence. The information in this
chapter was extracted from the FAA’s Advisory Circular (AC) 90-23F, Aircraft Wake
Turbulence, the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and Order 7110.65R, Air Traffic
Control.

2.2. Introduction to Wake Turbulence.

2.2.1. Vortex Generation. Lift is generated by the creation of a pressure differential over the
wing surfaces. The lowest pressure occurs over the upper wing surface and the highest pressure
occurs under the wing. This pressure differential triggers the rollup of the airflow aft of the wing
resulting in swirling air masses trailing downstream of the wingtips. After the rollup is
completed, the wake consists of two counter-rotating cylindrical vortices.

2.2.2. In-flight Hazard. Every aircraft in flight generates wake turbulence. This disturbance is
caused by a pair of counter-rotating vortices trailing from the wing tips. The vortices generated
by other aircraft (especially aircraft larger than your own) can create serious problems and in
some cases, impose rolling moments exceeding the control authority of your aircraft.
Additionally, the turbulence generated within the vortices, if encountered at close range, not only
has the potential to cause a serious aircraft upset, but could damage your aircraft and/or inflict
personal injury to the occupants within. Therefore, it is important to imagine the location of the
vortices generated by other aircraft and adjust your flight path accordingly.

2.2.3. Vortex Strength. The strength of a vortex is governed by the weight, speed, and shape of
the wing of the generating aircraft. The vortex characteristics of an aircraft will also change
when moving the flaps or other wing configuring devices. Since weight is the primary factor
regarding vortex strength, as aircraft weight increase, vortex strength increases proportionately.
Peak vortex tangential speeds of nearly 300 feet per second (approximately 200 MPH) have been
recorded. The greatest vortex strength occurs when the generating aircraft is HEAVY, CLEAN,
and SLOW.

2.3. Induced Roll and Counter Control.

2.3.1. Induced Roll. While it is possible for a wake vortex encounter to cause catastrophic in-
flight structural damage, the most common hazard is the induced rolling moment that exceeds
the roll control capability of the aircraft you are flying. During flight tests, the capability of an
aircraft to counteract the roll imposed by the wake vortex of the preceding aircraft primarily
depends on the wing span and counter control responsiveness of the encountering aircraft.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               33

2.3.2. Counter Control. Counter control is usually more effective and the induced roll reduced
in cases where the wing span and ailerons of the encountering aircraft are extended beyond the
rotational flow field of the vortex. Aircraft with short wing spans (relative to the vortex
generating aircraft) will usually find it more difficult to counter the imposed roll produced by
vortex flow. Therefore, pilots flying aircraft with short wing spans, regardless of their individual
performance capabilities, must be particularly cognizant of and respect the strength of the wake
vortices produced by much larger and heavier aircraft.

2.3.3. Vortex Behavior. Trailing vortices have certain behavioral characteristics that can help
pilots visualize the wake location and thereby take the necessary precautions to avoid them.
Since vortices are the by-product of lift, they are generated from the moment an aircraft rotates
for take-off until touchdown at the end of a flight. Thus, prior to conducting a takeoff or landing,
pilots should note the rotation or touchdown point of the preceding aircraft (see figure 2.1). The
vortex circulation is outward, upward, and around the wing tips when viewed from either ahead
or behind the aircraft. Tests with large aircraft have shown the vortices remain spaced
        Figure 2.1. Touchdown and Rotation Points when Following Larger Aircraft.
34                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009




a bit less than a wing span apart drifting with the wind at altitudes greater than a wing span from
the ground. Therefore, if you encounter turbulence that is being generated by the preceding
aircraft, a slight change of altitude and/or lateral position (preferably upwind) will normally
provide a flight path clear of the turbulence.

2.3.4. Flight tests show that vortices from large (transport category) aircraft during climb-out,
cruise, and descent sink at a rate of several hundred ft/min. The vortex strength and sink rate
diminishes with time and distance. Atmospheric turbulence will also hasten the breakup of
aircraft generated disturbances. Therefore, you should fly at or above the preceding aircraft’s
flight path, altering course as necessary to avoid the area behind and below the generating
aircraft. As a general rule, vertical separation of 1,000 feet may be considered safe (see figure
2.2).
                     Figure 2.2. Aircraft Generated Vortex Descent Profile.




2.3.4.1. When the vortices of a larger aircraft sink close to the ground (within 100 to 200 feet),
they tend to move laterally over the ground at a speed of 2 to 3 knots.

2.3.4.2. A crosswind will decrease the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increase the
movement of the downwind vortex. Thus, a light wind with a cross-runway component of 1 to 5
knots (depending on conditions) can result in the upwind vortex remaining in the touchdown
zone and hasten the drift of the downwind vortex toward another runway. Similarly, a tailwind
condition can move the vortices of the preceding aircraft forward into the touchdown zone.
Pilots should therefore be alert to larger aircraft upwind from their approach and takeoff flight
paths.

2.3.4.2.1. CAUTION: The light quartering tailwind requires maximum caution regarding the
effects of wake turbulence.

2.4. Operational Problem Areas. Wake turbulence may cause aircraft upsets similar to
traversing an area of turbulence with the severity of the encounter dependent on the direction of
the encounter, weight of the generating aircraft, size of the encountering aircraft, distance from
the generating aircraft, and point of vortex encounter. The possibility of an induced roll
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 35

increases when the encountering aircraft’s heading is generally aligned with or parallel to the
flight path of the generating aircraft.

2.4.1. Pilots should be particularly alert in calm wind conditions and maneuvering situations in
the vicinity of the airport where the vortices could:

2.4.1.1. Remain in the touchdown area.

2.4.1.2. Drift from aircraft operating on a nearby runway.

2.4.1.3. Sink into the takeoff or landing path from a crossing runway.

2.4.1.4. Sink into the traffic patterns from other airport operations.

2.4.1.5. Sink into the flight path of aircraft operating VFR.

2.4.2. Pilots of all aircraft should attempt to visualize the location of the vortex trail behind a
larger aircraft and exercise wake turbulence avoidance procedures to achieve safe operation. It is
equally important that pilots of larger aircraft plan or adjust their flight paths, whenever possible,
to minimize vortex exposure to other aircraft.

2.5. Vortex Avoidance Procedures. Under certain conditions, air traffic controllers apply
procedures for separating aircraft operating under IFR. The controllers will also provide
precautionary wake turbulence information to VFR aircraft which in the tower’s opinion may be
adversely affected by the vortexes generated by a larger aircraft. ATC will give the position,
altitude and direction of flight of larger aircraft followed by the phrase “CAUTION—WAKE
TURBULENCE.” Whether or not a warning is given, pilots are expected to adjust their flight
path(s) to avoid serious wake encounters. Vortex avoidance procedures are recommended for
the following situations:

2.5.1. Landing Behind a Larger Aircraft. When landing behind a larger aircraft on the same
runway; stay at or above the larger aircraft’s final approach flight path; note the touchdown point
and then, if safety permits, land beyond it (see figure 2.3).
         Figure 2.3. Recommended Flight Path Landing Behind a Larger Aircraft.




2.5.1.1. CAUTION: Avoid the area below and behind the preceding aircraft especially at low
altitude where even a momentary wake encounter could be catastrophic.

2.5.2. Parallel Runway Considerations. When landing behind and offset from a larger aircraft
landing on a parallel runway separated by less than 2,500 feet, consider the possibility of the
vortices drifting onto your runway. Stay at or above the larger aircraft’s final approach flight
path; note its touchdown point and, if safety permits, land beyond it (see figure 2.4).



Figure 2.4. Recommended Touchdown Point for Parallel Runway Operations.




2.5.2.1. Crossing Flight Paths. When landing behind a larger aircraft on a crossing runway;
cross above the larger aircraft’s flight path (see figure 2.5).

                       Figure 2.5. Crossing Flight Path Considerations.

2.5.3. Landing Behind Departing Aircraft – Same Runway. When landing behind a departing
larger aircraft on the same runway: note larger aircraft’s rotation point and land well prior to
rotation point (see figure 2.6).

                       Figure 2.6. Landing Behind a Departing Aircraft




2.5.4. Landing Behind Departing Aircraft – Crossing Runway. When landing behind a
departing larger aircraft on a crossing runway; note larger aircraft’s rotation point. If the aircraft
rotated past the intersection of the two runways, continue the approach and land prior to the
intersection (see figure 2.7). If the aircraft rotated prior to the intersection, consider abandoning
the approach unless able to land well before reaching the intersection (see figure 2.8).

                                     Intersection)

2.5.5. Departing Behind a Large Aircraft. When departing behind a larger aircraft; note the
other aircraft’s rotation point and, if able, rotate your aircraft prior to that point. Then, climb
above the larger aircraft’s climb path until turning clear of the larger aircraft’s wake (see figure
2.1). Continue to avoid subsequent headings which will cross below and behind a larger
aircraft. If unable, consider waiting 2 minutes to allow the wake induced vortices to dissipate.
2.5.5.1. When departing from a runway that intersects another, be alert for adjacent large aircraft
operations, particularly upwind of your runway, and avoid headings which will cross below a
larger aircraft’s flight path.

2.5.5.2. Because vortices settle and move laterally near the ground, the vortex hazard may exist
along the runway and in your flight path after a larger aircraft has executed a low approach,
missed approach or a touch-and-go landing, particular in light quartering wind conditions. It
these cases, it is highly recommended that you wait at least 2 minutes before your takeoff or
landing.

2.5.6. Flying Behind a Larger Aircraft. When operating VFR, avoid flight below and behind a
larger aircraft’s flight path. If a larger aircraft is observed above on the same track (meeting or
overtaking), adjust your position laterally, preferably upwind. If operating IFR, consider
contacting ATC to request and offset to avoid potential wake turbulence.

2.6. Pilot Responsibility.

2.6.1. Government and industry groups are making concerted efforts to minimize the hazards of
trailing vortices. However, whether operating VFR or IFR, pilots should make every effort to
reduce the hazards associated with vortex encounters. Vortex visualization and avoidance
procedures should be exercised by an aircrew using the same degree of concern as collision
avoidance.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                39

2.6.2. Pilots are reminded that when flying behind all aircraft, acceptance of instructions from
ATC in the following situations is an acknowledgement that the pilot will ensure safe takeoff and
landing intervals and accepts responsibility for providing their own wake turbulence separation:

2.6.2.1. Traffic information.

2.6.2.2. Instructions to follow an aircraft

2.6.2.3. The acceptance of a visual approach clearance.

2.7. ATC Responsibility.

2.7.1. For operations conducted behind heavy aircraft, ATC will specify the word “heavy” when
this information is known. Pilots of heavy aircraft should always use the word “heavy” in radio
communications.

2.7.2. For aircraft departing behind heavy aircraft, ATC is required to use at least a 2 minute
separation interval unless a pilot has initiated a request to deviate from the 2 minute interval and
accepts responsibility for maneuvering their aircraft so as to avoid the wake turbulence hazard.

2.7.3. Required ATC Separation Behind Heavy Jets and B-757. Because of the possible effects
of wake turbulence, ATC is required to apply no less than specified minimum separation for
aircraft operating behind a heavy jet/B757 and in certain instances, behind large non-heavy
aircraft at the same altitude or when less than 1,000 feet of vertical separation will occur:

2.7.3.1. Heavy jet behind heavy jet – 4 nm.

2.7.3.2. Large/Heavy aircraft behind B757 – 4 nm.

2.7.3.3. Small aircraft behind B-757 – 5 nm.

2.7.3.4. Small/large aircraft behind heavy jet – 5 nm.

2.7.4. Required ATC Separation for Small Aircraft. The following separation, measured at the
time the preceding aircraft is over the landing threshold, is provided to small aircraft:

2.7.4.1. Small aircraft landing behind heavy jet – 6 miles.

2.7.4.2. Small aircraft landing behind a B-757 – 5 miles.

2.7.4.3. Small aircraft landing behind large aircraft – 4 miles.

2.7.5. Required ATC Wake Turbulence Take-Off Separation: Aircraft will be separated by 2
minutes or the appropriate 4 or 5 mile radar separation applied when taking off behind a heavy
jet/B-757 when departing:
40                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

2.7.5.1. From the same threshold.

2.7.5.2. On a crossing runway and projected flight paths will cross.

2.7.5.3. From the threshold of a parallel runway when staggered ahead of that of the adjacent
runway by less than 500 feet and when the runways are separated by less than 2,500 feet.

2.7.6. Required Separation Behind Larger Aircraft. A three minute interval will be provided
when a small aircraft will takeoff:

2.7.6.1. From an intersection on the same runway (same or opposite direction) behind a
departing large aircraft.

2.7.6.2. In the opposite direction on the same runway behind a large aircraft takeoff or
low/missed approach.

2.7.6.2.1. NOTE: This 3 minute interval may be waived upon specific pilot request when
operating behind a large aircraft.

2.7.6.3. A 3 minute interval will be provided for all aircraft taking off when the operations are as
described above, the preceding aircraft is a heavy jet/B-757, and the operations are on either the
same runway or parallel runways separated by less than 2,500 feet.

2.7.6.3.1. NOTE: When operations are conducted behind a heavy jet /B-757, ATC may not
reduce or waive the required 3 minute interval.

2.7.6.4. When departing, pilots have the option of requesting timing versus horizontal spacing
when utilizing wake turbulence avoidance procedures (2 minutes instead of 4 or 5 miles). This
request should be made as soon as practical with ATC before taxiing onto the runway.

2.7.6.5. Controllers may anticipate separation and do not need to withhold a takeoff clearance for
an aircraft departing behind a large/heavy aircraft if there is reasonable assurance the required
separation will exist when the departing aircraft starts takeoff roll.

2.8. Special Wake Considerations.

2.8.1. Ground Hazards. During ground operations and during takeoff, jet engine blast (thrust
stream turbulence) at high power settings may cause damage and/or loss of directional control to
aircraft that are taxiing or parked, particularly if encountered at close range. Aircrew that are
taking-off or landing should exercise extreme caution when an aircraft is conducting high power
engine runs in close proximity to the runway and jet/prop exhaust is crossing the arrival or
departure flight path. Exhaust velocity versus distance studies at various thrust levels show a
need for light aircraft to maintain adequate separation behind large turbojet aircraft. Due to the
possible engine exhaust velocities generated by larger jet aircraft during ground operations
and/or initial takeoff roll, lighter aircraft awaiting takeoff should maintain separation by holding
well back. If holding well back is not possible, offset laterally and/or position the aircraft to
parallel any possible jet engine blast effects. Pilots of larger aircraft should be particularly
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  41

careful to consider the effects their jet blast will have on other aircraft, vehicles, and/or
maintenance equipment during ground operations.

2.8.2. Helicopters. In a slow hover taxi or stationary hover near the surface, helicopter main
rotor(s) generate downwash producing high velocity outwash vortices to a distance that equates
to approximately three times the diameter of the rotor. When rotor downwash hits the surface,
the resulting outwash vortices have behavioral characteristics similar to wing tip vortices
produced by fixed wing aircraft. However, the vortex circulation is outward, upward, around,
and away from the main rotor(s) in all directions. Pilots of small aircraft should avoid operating
within three rotor diameters of any helicopter in a slow hover taxi or stationary hover. In
forward flight, departing or landing helicopters produce a pair of strong, high speed trailing
vortices similar to wing tip vortices of larger fixed wing aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft should
use caution when operating behind or crossing behind landing and departing helicopters.

                                            Chapter 3

            THE 60-TO-1 RULE AND OTHER AVIATION CALCULATIONS

3.1. The 60-to-1 Rule. The 60-to-1 rule, along with the other mathematical formulas, provides
the professional aviator a set of predetermined calculations that enhance situational awareness
and precision while flying. The formulas are applicable in both the vertical and horizontal plane,
making them usable during all phases of flight. The 60-to-1 rule is a technique for establishing
pitch changes and lead points that aid you, for example, in determining course intercepts, arc
intercepts, enroute descent points, visual descent points, an expected rate of climb or descent,
etc… These calculations are valid as long as the pilot maintains (as closely as possible) a
constant airspeed, bank, or pitch depending on the application used. Listed below are some
reasons why learning and using the 60-to-1 rule and other aviation calculations presented in this
chapter is worthwhile:

3.1.1. It allows you to compute the pitch changes necessary to establish proper attitude using the
control and performance concept (establish pitch, trim, cross-check, and adjust) during flight.

3.1.2. Since applied calculations normally result in more precise flying, fewer and smaller
changes are required thus reducing your workload and increasing your ability to devote more
cognitive efforts towards other areas critical to the flight or mission.

3.1.3. When you fly the aircraft more precisely, fewer and smaller changes are required. This
equates to the aircraft being flown more economically.

3.2. When Do You Use the 60-to-1 Rule? The following are some examples of the types of
aviation problems that can be readily solved by applying the 60-to-1 rule:

3.2.1. You’re in level flight and flying 400 KTAS airspeed and you want to establish a rate of
climb or descent of 1,000 feet/min. What pitch change will give you the desired rate of climb or
descent?

3.2.2. You’re at 80 DME, at Flight Level 310 inbound to XYZ VORTAC, and ATC gives you
instructions to cross the VORTAC at 5,000 feet at “pilot’s discretion.” When should you start
your descent and what pitch change should you make?

3.2.3. You’re departing an airfield with a climb gradient requirement and would like to increase
your situational awareness by determining what the associated VVI to expect?

3.2.4. You’re climbing at 3,000 ft/min at 250 KIAS. What pitch change will be necessary to
level your aircraft at FL 350?

3.3. Application of the 60-to-1 Rule. The 60-to-1 rule should be used in flight as needed;
however, you may find it advantageous to perform some of the more complex calculations
during the preflight planning process. As a professional aviator, you can use the 60-to-1
calculations to determine your aircraft’s general performance figures that can (as long as the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             43

same parameters are used) be applied as “standard.” To expand on this concept, if your
particular aircraft is normally flown in the low altitude instrument environment at 180 KTAS,
then your “standard” speed (converted to nm/min) is 3 nm/min. As long as a constant airspeed is
maintained, the aircraft’s turn radius becomes a “standard” 1 nm, etc. Since this figure becomes
the known “standard,” it can make using the other formulas even easier.

3.3.1. NOTE: Although the 60-to-1 rule follows a standard set of physical properties and
normally applies to most aircraft; it is important to understand that it only provides
approximations based on general principles. It does not replace the more specific performance
data derived from an aircraft’s technical order (TO). The performance data taken from the TO
always takes precedence.

3.4. Mathematical Derivation of the 60-to-1 Rule.

3.4.1. Since the circumference of a circle is based on a known formula, we can mathematically
determine that 1 degree of arc at a distance of 60 nm from a ground based station is
approximately 1 nm in length. Let’s relate this to a VORTAC station. We know that the
formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr). C = the circumference, π = 3.142 and r = the
radius; therefore, we can calculate the circumference for a 60 nm circle around the VORTAC is:

3.4.1.1. Calculation: C = 2 × 3.142 × 60nm

               C = 377.04 nm (for a 60 nm radius circle)

3.4.2. By knowing the circumference (at a 60 nm radius), we are further able to determine the
length (in nm) of each individual degree of arc. This is computed by simply dividing the
circumference by the number of degrees in a circle, or 360°.

3.4.2.1. Calculation: X = C ÷ 360°

        X = 377.04 nm ÷ 360° = 1.0472 nm

3.4.2.2. Therefore, 1° approximates 1 nm at a radius (or distance) of 60 nm.

3.4.3. Because 1 nm = 6,076 feet or approximately 6,000 feet, we can say that: 1° = 1 nm at 60
nm. Therefore, if you fly 1° off your assigned heading, after 60 nm, you will be 1 nm off course.

3.4.4. This knowledge can further be used in a formula that equates nautical miles off course
(NMOC) or degrees off course (DOC) in relation to distance flown (DF):

3.4.4.1. NMOC ÷ DF = DOC ÷ 60°

3.4.5. For example, if you deviate from your required heading to maintain a course by 3° and
you fly for 40 nm, the aircraft will be 2 nm off the original course. Where the DOC = 3° and DF
= 40 nm, after applying basic algebra and solving the above equation for NMOC, the solution is:

3.4.5.1. NMOC = 3° × 40 nm ÷ 60° = 2 nm
44                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.4.6. This relationship does not only exist in the horizontal plane, but is also applicable in the
vertical plane. If a 1° pitch change is made, after traveling 60 nm; the aircraft will have a net
altitude change of 6000 ft (or 1 nm). Simple division then allows us to determine the altitude
change that will occur per nautical mile. This relationship is represented in the following
formula:

3.4.6.1. Formula: 1° = 6000 ft = 100 ft
                        60 nm 1 nm

3.4.7. Therefore, a 1° pitch change equates to a 100 foot altitude change per nautical mile flown.
Subsequently, a 2° pitch change equals 200 ft/nm gradient, a 3° pitch change equals 300 ft/nm
(normal glideslope), etc… This relationship is also referred to as the as the climb or descent
gradient and becomes the basis for many of the calculations utilized in the vertical plane (see
paragraph 3.6).

3.4.8. It is important to understand that when varying the pitch of the aircraft using a
conventional ADI, the pilot is attempting to change the glide path angle (gradient) the aircraft
will fly. Since an aircraft’s angle of attack (AOA) is the difference between pitch and flight path
angle, unless a constant airspeed is maintained, the actual gradient flown will not equal the one
calculated or desired (e.g. a constant altitude can be maintained as airspeed decreases by
increasing the aircraft AOA with pitch and the application of power while airspeed is allowed to
decay).

3.4.8.1. NOTE: Aircraft equipped with a Head-Up Display (HUD) are able to display a flight
path marker (FPM), also referred to as a velocity vector (VV). The FPM or VV displays pitch
compensated for angle of attack (including drift and yaw) and allows the pilot to make a more
precise glide path (gradient change) compared to aircraft equipped with conventional
performance instruments (ADI, VVI, and airspeed indicator) which can only provide an
approximate flight path (gradient) change. Therefore, if available, aircraft with properly certified
and endorsed HUDs should use the FPM or VV when applying the applicable 60-to-1 techniques
provided in this chapter.

3.5. Aviation Calculations.

3.5.1. Determining an Aircraft’s Rate of Travel. To increase the accuracy of the calculations
and make the 60-to-1 formula applicable at all altitudes, the formulas presented in this text are
based on either True Airspeed (TAS) or True Mach Number (TMN). These figures are then
converted to rate of travel in nautical miles per minute for use in the individual calculations.
Although TAS and TMN are used within the text, it does not negate the pilot or crew from using
an Indicated Airspeed or Mach Number (IAS or IMN) if this instrumentation is the only one
available in their particular aircraft and time does not permit converting to TAS or TMN.
Although large inaccuracies will normally result if IAS or IMN is used in the 60-to-1 at the
higher altitudes, in the low altitude structure, particular when maneuvering the aircraft while
conducting instrument approaches, the errors are normally negligible between indicated and true
airspeeds and thus interchangeable and slightly easier to use. For this chapter on the 60-to-1
“rule,” for simplification, we have assumed that IAS equals Calibrated Airspeed (CAS).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                   45

3.5.1.1. NOTE: Should your aircraft have a large installation error correction between IAS and
CAS for a particular phase of flight, it is highly recommended applying this correction to IAS
before converting IAS or CAS to TAS prior to using the formulas in this chapter

3.5.1.2. By using a simple conversion factor, we can convert TAS from nautical miles per hour
(nm/hr) into nautical miles per minute (nm/min):

3.5.1.2.1. Formula: TAS = nm × 1 hr

                             hr   60 min

3.5.1.2.2. Formula (condensed): TAS ÷ 60 = nm/min

3.5.1.3. Example: If an aircraft has a TAS of 420 nm/hr, if we divide by 60, it is also traveling
at a rate of 7 nm/min.

3.5.1.3.1. TAS (in nm/min) = 420 ÷ 60 = 7 nm/min

3.4.1.4. Although your Mach number as it equates to TAS will vary with temperature, a
reasonably accurate relationship exists between them as listed below:

3.5.1.4.1. TAS           =        nm/min       =       TMN

           300                     5                    .5
            360                     6                   .6
            420                     7                   .7
            480                     8                   .8

3.5.1.5. Therefore; by comparing the TMN to rate of travel in nm/min, the following calculation
can be deduced:

3.5.1.5.1. Formula: TMN X 10 = TAS in nm/min

3.5.1.6. Example: If an aircraft is traveling at .5 Mach, then the resultant rate of travel is
approximately 5 nm/min.

3.5.1.7. If the aircraft is not equipped with TAS or Mach instrumentation, an approximate TAS
can be computed from IAS. Since TAS increases at a rate of approximately 2 percent per 1,000
feet altitude increase for a given IAS, the following formula can be used:

3.5.1.7.1. TAS = [IAS × (2% per 1,000 feet)] + IAS

3.5.1.8. Example: If an aircraft has an indicated airspeed of 250 knots at 10,000 feet, the
resultant TAS is 300 knots TAS.

3.5.1.8.1. Calculation: TAS = [250 × (2% × 10)] + 250
                         TAS = (250 × .20) + 250
46                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

                         TAS = 50 + 250 = 300 knots
3.5.1.9. Using the airspeed ratios presented in paragraph 3.5.1.3.1; a TAS of 300 knots also
equates to 5 nm/min.

3.5.1.10. Another formula used to estimate TAS is to divide your altitude (converted to a flight
level) by two and then add result to your IAS. Using the previous example: The aircraft is
flying at 10,000 feet (equates to FL 100) and indicating 250 knots. The TAS can be calculated as
follows:


3.5.1.10.1. TAS = (FL ÷ 2) + IAS

           TAS = (100 ÷ 2) + 250
            TAS = 50 + 250

           TAS = 300

3.5.1.11. NOTE: The formulas used to convert TAS and TMN (or groundspeed) into a rate of
travel in nautical miles per minute (nm/min) form the basis for other useful calculations
applicable in the flying environment, such as rate of descent (VVI) and turn radius (TR).

3.5.2. Determining a VVI. Since we are able to determine the altitude gained or lost over a
given distance (or gradient), for each degree of pitch change, if we then correlate this
information with the aircraft’s speed (rate of travel), we can calculate a VVI. Referencing
paragraph 3.4.6, it was determined that one degree of pitch change approximates 100 ft/nm
(gradient). Therefore, based on the amount of pitch change or gradient (in ft/nm) and aircraft
speed, we can further calculate a VVI using the following formula (s):

3.5.2.1. Formula (a): VVI = nm/min × pitch change × 100 ft/nm

3.5.2.2. Formula (b): VVI = nm/min × gradient (in ft/nm)

3.5.3. Example #1: An aircraft is holding a positive (nose up) 1° pitch on the attitude indicator
to maintain level flight and has a TAS of 300 knots or an TMN of .5 Mach (both equate to 5
nm/min). If you adjust the pitch by 3° from the level flight attitude (to either 4° nose up or 2°
nose down) and adjust power/thrust to maintain your TAS or Mach, the resultant VVI will equal
a rate of ascent or descent of 1500 ft/min.

3.5.3.1. VVI = 5 nm/min × 3° × 100 ft/nm

         VVI = 1500 ft/min

3.5.4. Example #2: An aircraft is traveling at .6 Mach and makes a 1° pitch change (from level
flight). Since 0.6 Mach equates to 6 nm/min (see 3.4.1.2), we can calculate the VVI as follows:

3.5.4.1. VVI = 6 nm/min × 1° × 100 ft/nm
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               47

         VVI = 600 ft/min

3.5.5. Example #3: An aircraft is traveling at 150 KTAS (approximates 2.5 nm/min) in level
flight and makes a 2° pitch change, if the aircraft speed remains constant, the resultant VVI will
roughly equate to 500 ft/nm.

3.5.5.1. VVI = 2.5 nm/min × 2° × 100 ft/nm

        VVI = 500 ft/min

3.5.6. Example #4: You are planning to take-off from an airfield with a required departure
climb gradient of 330 feet per nm. See paragraph 3.8.3.

3.6. The Gradient. Whether climbing or descending, the gradient (or angle) the pilot chooses
to fly is usually predicated on one of the following three circumstances. First, the gradient can
be calculated individually by the pilot/crew based on the desired altitude to be gained or lost over
a known distance. Second, the gradient can be mandated by ATC (e.g., crossing altitude
restriction). Finally, it may be required by a published instrument procedure (e.g., SID, ODP,
STAR, or IAP). As stated earlier, the pilot controls the gradient flown by making positive or
negative pitch changes (normally in reference to the pitch attitude that maintained level flight at
a particular altitude). Therefore a 3° pitch change from level flight will yield a 300 feet per
nautical mile gradient, a 400 feet per nautical mile climb or descent gradient will result from a 4°
change or vice versa. The VVI associated with the pitch change (or chosen gradient) is
dependent on the aircraft’s speed (TAS or TMN) converted to nm/min. To obtain even more
accurate calculations, use groundspeed whenever practical since it adjusts the aircraft’s speed to
account for winds.

3.7. Descent Gradients.

3.7.1. Preplanned Descents (Altitude vs. Distance).

3.7.1.1. Example #1: You are cruising at 30,000 feet MSL and would like to estimate the pitch
change (or gradient) required to descend to the approximate FAF altitude, 3,000 feet MSL. The
DME from the destination is currently reading around 90 nm. With the given information, the
descent gradient (DG) is approximately 300 feet per nautical mile which equates to a pitch
change of around 3° (from level flight reference pitch).

3.7.1.1.1. DG = Total Altitude (to lose or gain) ÷ Distance

          DG = (30,000 ft – 3,000 ft) ÷ 90 nm
           DG = 27,000 ÷ 90 nm

          DG = 300 ft/nm (or 3°)

3.7.1.2. As previously shown (see 3.4.6), the resultant gradient is also equivalent to the required
pitch change from level flight; therefore a 300 ft/nm gradient also equates to a 3° pitch change.
48                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.7.1.3. Additionally, you may desire to utilize a predetermined descent gradient. By using
basic algebra and solving for “distance” in the equation above, you can determine at what
distance from a predetermined point, usually an airfield, upon which to start an enroute descent.
Although the final descent from cruise altitude to the final approach fix altitude is normally
divided by a variety of level-offs, calculating a predetermined point upon which to start an
enroute descent and then updating throughout the arrival phase should increase your situational
awareness. This application is very useful when cleared “pilot’s discretion” from the cruise
altitude to a lower one by ATC.

3.7.1.4. Example #2: An aircraft is level at 30,000 feet, 130 miles from the airfield and given an
initial clearance to descend “at pilot’s discretion” to 6,000 feet. Since a 300 ft/nm ratio or 3°
descent profile is quite common, the pilot/crew can determine the distance from the airport upon
which to initiate the descent by using the following formula:

3.7.1.4.1. Distance = Altitude (to lose or gain) ÷ Descent Gradient (DG)

          Distance = (30,000 feet – 6,000 ft) ÷ 300 ft/nm

          Distance = 24,000 feet ÷ 300 ft/nm

           Distance = 80 nm

3.7.1.5. Therefore, based on the current set of known information, the pilot/crew would wait
until instrument indications indicated the aircraft was 80 nm from the field and then start their
descent. As a technique, depending on the type of approach planned and where the IAF or FAF
was located in relation to the descent point, the pilot/crew may want to add or subtract 5 or 10
miles from the calculated figure to account for the additional distance needed to fly the IAP.
Another factor that should be accounted for in descent planning includes the affects of an
average headwind or tailwind component during the descent.

3.7.2. ATC Crossing Restriction.

3.7.2.1. Example #3: An aircraft is heading southbound on the 360 degree radial and established
at FL 270. ATC directs the pilot to cross 10 nm north of the ABC VORTAC at 12,000 feet.
Referencing the DME, the pilot determines the aircraft is approximately 35 miles from the ABC
VORTAC. The same 60-1 formula used in “Example 1” applies.

3.7.2.1.1. DG = Total Altitude (to lose or gain) ÷ Distance

          DG = (27,000feet – 12,000 feet) ÷ (35 nm – 10 nm)

          DG = 15,000 feet ÷ 25 nm

          DG = 600 ft/nm

3.7.2.2. Therefore, to lose 15,000 feet in 25 nm will require a 600 ft/nm gradient and also
equates to a 6° pitch change (from level flight). After calculating the required gradient/pitch
change, the approximate VVI to expect can also be determined. The VVI required during the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                49

descent will depend on the aircraft’s speed (in TAS, TMN, or groundspeed converted to nm/min)
experienced during the descent (or climb). Normally, if you base your VVI calculation (as in the
example above) on the initial speed (TAS) at the higher altitude, you will reach the lower altitude
prior to the crossing restriction fix. Because TAS increases for a constant IAS while climbing,
the reverse is not true. If you use the aircraft’s initial speed to calculate a VVI when vacating a
lower altitude and climbing to a relatively higher one, you will reach the higher altitude at a point
beyond that which was desired (see 3.8.2).

3.7.2.2.1. NOTE: When traversing through large altitude changes (whether climbing or
descending); utilizing an average TAS will increase the accuracy of VVI calculations.

3.7.3. Gradient Determined from a Published Procedure. During the arrival phase, there are
many applications that may require you to calculate a descent gradient (e.g., while flying a
STAR) or where you may desire to calculate one to increase your situational awareness as the
instrument approach progress.

3.7.3.1. Example #4: You are flying a jet enroute to Minneapolis via the EAU CLAIRE EIGHT
ARRIVAL, GREEN BAY TRANSITION (see figure 3.1.) Your aircraft is currently established
on the 278° radial at FL 240 flying westbound having just passed the GRB VORTAC. In order
to plan the descent profile, ATC is queried. ATC informs the pilot/crew to expect a descent
upon reaching the EAU VORTAC and cross the TWINZ intersection as depicted on the STAR.
Although ATC may assign a different altitude, for planning purposes (and for this example), a
descent gradient (pitch change) is calculated predicated on the published crossing altitude,
11,000 feet.
50                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009


Figure 3.1. STAR for Minneapolis, Minnesota (EAU CLAIRE EIGHT).




3.7.3.2. Although the scenario is slightly different from the two previous examples, the
application of the formula is the same. You must descend from your current altitude to a
predetermined crossing altitude in a certain amount of distance. The calculated descent gradient
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                51

also corresponds to a required pitch change. Here are the calculations based on the information
given and taken from the STAR (see Figure 3.1.):

3.7.3.2.1. DG = Total Altitude (to lose or gain) ÷ Distance

           DG = (24,000 feet – 11,000 feet) ÷ 36 nm

           DG = 13,000 feet ÷ 36 nm

           DG = 361 feet/nm

3.7.3.3. Therefore, you should plan to lose 13,000 feet in 36 nm (the total distance from EAU
VORTAC to the TWINZ intersection) which equates to a 361 ft/nm descent gradient. It also
equals a 3.6° (use 4° for 60-to-1 purposes) pitch change from level flight.

3.7.4. Affect of Maintaining a Constant IAS During a Descent. If you elect to fly a constant IAS
throughout the descent, which is a common practice (and often recommended by the MDS
performance manual), then the corresponding TAS will decrease as the aircraft descends. Since
the VVI calculation is predicated on the aircrafts speed, it too will decrease if a constant pitch is
held. Therefore, if you calculate and hold a VVI, particularly one predicated on a groundspeed,
versus maintaining a set pitch, the aircraft will reach the descent altitude at a point prior to the
fix. Since crossing the fix at the designated altitude is required, calculating and holding a VVI
that will enable the aircraft to descend to and reach the required altitude may work to your
benefit in this particular situation. If the situation was reversed and a climb gradient was based
on meeting a higher crossing fix altitude, a calculated VVI may not work since TAS as it relates
to a constant IAS increases with altitude. This concept is expanded upon in the discussion on
climb gradients in the following section.

3.7.4.1. NOTE: The most important part of the equation (which remains constant no matter
what speed the aircraft is flying) is the gradient. The pilot/crew must descend at the calculated
gradient in order to reach the desired descent point, mandated ATC crossing altitude restriction
or gradient published within an instrument procedure.

3.8. Climb Gradients. The formulas used to compute climb gradients (CG) and the factors
affecting the calculations are the same as those utilized in determining descent gradients.

3.8.1. ATC Crossing Restriction.

3.8.1.1. Example #1: An aircraft is maintaining 250 KIAS in straight and level flight at 2,000 ft
MSL with a positive 3° pitch attitude. ATC instructs the aircraft to “climb and maintain FL 200,
cross the ABC VORTAC at 12,000.” DME indicates the aircraft is 50 nm from the ABC
VORTAC. Here are the calculations:

3.8.1.1.1. CG = Total Altitude (to lose or gain) ÷ Distance

           CG = (12,000 ft – 2,000 ft) ÷ 50 nm
           CG = 10,000 ft ÷ 50 nm
52                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

           CG = 200 ft/nm (or 2°)

3.8.1.2. Therefore, based on this information, a positive 2° pitch change (or more) is required.
Since the aircraft already had a pitch attitude of 3°, with an additional 2° change, the pilot must
set and hold a new pitch attitude of 5° (or more) to meet the crossing restriction.

3.8.2. Affects of Changing TAS on VVI When Climbing.

3.8.2.1. If you maintain an IAS throughout the climb, which is a common practice (and often
recommended by the MDS performance manual or regulatory procedure), then your TAS will
increase as the aircraft ascends in altitude. Since the nm/min calculation utilized in the 60-1
formulas are predicated on TAS, it will similarly affect the VVI. Simply put, as your aircraft’s
TAS (and rate of travel in nm/min) increases, a larger VVI is required to maintain the integrity of
the calculation. Therefore, if you calculate and set a VVI based on initial TAS instead of holding
the calculated pitch attitude and do not account for the TAS changes as your aircraft climbs, you
will arrive at the crossing fix altitude at a point beyond that which was desired.

3.8.2.2. To prevent this, it is advisable that you set the required pitch; then adjust thrust to
maintain the airspeed recommended by the performance manual or accepted practice (e.g.,
accelerating to and maintaining 250 KIAS until 10,000 ft MSL).

3.8.2.3. Based on general aircraft performance characteristics (independent of aircraft type), you
will spend roughly half of your time ascending two-thirds of the total altitude to be gained. The
remaining time is spent climbing the final one-third of altitude to level off. Conversely, it takes
an aircraft about one-third the time to climb one-half the altitude to be gained and the other two-
thirds of the time climbing the other half. Since TAS increases with altitude, if we apply this
concept to a VVI calculation, we have to compensate for the extended period of time the aircraft
will spend at the associated higher true airspeeds. Therefore, should you wish to calculate a
required VVI for a climb; there are two recommended techniques:

3.8.2.4. Technique #1: Since you will spend approximately half the time traversing the final one
third of your altitude to be gained, it makes sense to compensate for this in the VVI calculation.
Therefore, a good approximation for the average TAS to use in is the one that would be two-
thirds of the total altitude traversed added to the altitude you started the climb from. Since TAS
increases approximately 2% per 1,000 feet, if we use the information from the example in
paragraph 3.8.1.1, the formula and subsequent calculations are:

3.8.2.4.1. TAS = IAS + 2% [2/3 (altitude traversed) + initial altitude]

           TAS = 250 + 0.02 [2/3 (12,000 ft – 2000 ft) + 2,000 ft]

           TAS = 250 + 0.02 [2/3(10,000 ft) + 2,000 ft]
           TAS = 250 + 0.02 [6,670 ft + 2,000 ft]
           TAS = 250 + 0.02 [8,670] … for simplification, use 9,000 ft
           TAS = 250 + 180
           TAS = 430
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               53

3.8.2.5. To convert the result into nm/min, we further divide by 60 to obtain an average airspeed
of 7.2 nm/min or for the purposes of this discussion, use 7 nm/min.

3.8.2.6. Utilizing the formula referenced in paragraph 3.5.2 and the expected TAS in nm/min (at
two-thirds of the altitude to be gained), we can calculate a VVI that should allow the pilot to
meet the crossing restriction.

3.8.2.6.1. VVI = nm/min × pitch change (or gradient) × 100 ft/nm

          VVI = 7 nm/min × 2° × 100 ft/nm

          VVI = 7 nm/min × 200 ft/nm

          VVI = 1400 ft/min

3.8.2.7. Technique #2: To virtually guarantee that you will arrive at the desired altitude at or
before the crossing restriction, the most conservative approach is to simply use the approximate
TAS (converted to nm/min) at the level off altitude. This should yield a VVI greater than
required; that if maintained, will allow you to meet your altitude restriction with some margin for
error provided (e.g., variable winds aloft, non-standard temperatures at altitude).

3.8.2.8. Using the level off altitude of 12,000 feet and airspeed of 250 KIAS from the same
example (paragraph 3.8.1.1), the TAS (converted to nm/min) and VVI computations would be:

3.8.2.8.1. TAS = IAS + (2% × altitude)
           TAS = 250 + (0.02 × 12,000 feet)
           TAS = 250 + 240
           TAS = 490 (for simplification, use 500 KTAS)
3.8.2.9. Again, we divide 500 KTAS by 60 to obtain a rate of travel of 8.3 nm/min (for
simplification we can use 8.5). Using the same VVI formula from above (see 3.8.2.6.1), the
calculation to determine the rate of climb needed is as follows:

3.8.2.9.1 VVI = nm/min × pitch change (or gradient) × 100 ft/nm
          VVI = 8.5 nm/min × 2° × 100 ft/nm
          VVI = 1700 ft/min

3.8.2.9.2. NOTE: TAS and TMN are used for “air mass” determinations and do not account for
the affect of wind on the aircraft’s ground track. To further increase accuracy of the calculations,
it is highly encouraged that you use your aircraft’s groundspeed (converted to nm/min) whenever
possible. Groundspeed is TAS or TMN corrected for wind.

3.8.2.10. To prove the theory mentioned in paragraph 3.8.2.1, if you did not calculate an average
TAS or (converted to nm/min) but instead only used the TAS for the initial part of the climb to
determine a VVI and then held it, it is very unlikely you would meet the crossing restriction.
Based on the TAS at 2,000 feet, the pilot/crew would have calculated an initial rate of travel at
54                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

4.8 nm/min (for simplification we’ll use 5.0) upon which a 2° pitch change would yield a rate of
climb of 1000 ft/min. If 1,000 ft/min rate of climb were held and 250 KIAS maintained while
pitch was allowed to vary, since TAS increases with altitude, the aircraft would actually not
maintain a rate of travel of 5 nm/min but would average almost 7 nm/min (see 3.8.2.3).

3.8.2.11. Using the known conditions and basic algebra we can determine that it will take the
aircraft a fraction over 7 minutes to travel 50 nm at the actual rate of 7 nm/min. Therefore; if a
climb rate of 1,000 ft/min were held for 7 minutes, the aircraft will climb 7,000 feet. If we add
this 7,000 foot increment to the initial altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft would be approximately
at 9,000 feet or 3,000 feet below the required crossing altitude. To climb the additional 3,000
feet at 1,000 ft/min would take another 3 minutes and at the average rate of 7 nm/min, the pilot
would not reach the required altitude until 21 nm beyond the fix.

3.8.3. Determining Climb Gradient from a Published Procedure.

3.8.3.1. Example #2: You are planning to depart RWY 19 at Jackson Hole (KJAC), Wyoming.
Referring to the TETON TWO DEPARTURE (figure 3.2.) and noting the TAKE OFF
MINIMUMS, a 330 feet/nm climb gradient is required to 11,400 feet. The total amount of feet
the aircraft must climb at 330 feet/nm is determined by subtracting the departure end of the
runway (DER) crossing height elevation from the required climb to altitude. In this case, you are
departing a civilian field which has a DER crossing restriction of 35’; therefore, the calculations
would require you to add 35 feet to the DER elevation and then subtract this figure from 11,400.
Therefore, the total feet the aircraft must climb (11,400 – 6413 + 35) is 5022 feet. For the
purpose of this example we’ll use 5000 feet. In addition, although the best climb speed for your
particular aircraft can be found in the applicable aircraft performance manual, for simplification,
we’ll utilize 250 KIAS. Since the climb gradient is already given (330 ft/nm) and the total
altitude that must be gained (5,000 feet) has been calculated, an approximate VVI can be
determined to increase your situational awareness as your climb progresses. In order to calculate
a VVI to meet the climb restriction, as stated previously, you need to determine what the average
TAS the aircraft will experience during the climb.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                 55


               Figure 3.2. Jackson Hole, Teton Two Departure

3.8.3.2. After determining an average TAS, a VVI can then be calculated and used to increase
your situational awareness as to whether the aircraft’s performance is meeting the required
climb gradient. For the purpose of this example, we’ll assume the aircraft accelerates to and uses
250 KIAS for the climb. The following calculations will guide you through the process.

3.8.3.2.1. To determine TAS (in nm/min) at DER (6400 feet) at 250 KIAS:

         TAS = IAS + (2% per 1,000 feet)

 TAS = 250 + (0.02 × 6.4 × 250)

 TAS = 250 + 32

 TAS = 282

3.8.3.2.2. To determine TAS at 11,400 feet:

        TAS = IAS + (2% per 1,000 feet)

                        TAS = 250 + (0.02 × 11.4 × 250)
                        TAS = 250 + 57

 TAS = 307.

3.8.3.2.3. By adding these two airspeeds together and then dividing by two, the average TAS for
the climb is 295 knots. By further dividing this figure by 60, we obtain a rate of travel of 4.9
nm/min (see paragraph 3.5.1).

3.8.3.3. Utilizing the formula referenced in 3.5.2 and the average TAS in nm/min, we can then
calculate an approximate VVI that will allow for the pilot to meet the climb gradient (CG)
crossing restriction.

3.8.3.3.1. VVI = nm/min × required gradient

          VVI = 4.9 nm/min × 330 ft/nm

          VVI = 1617 ft/min (or higher, ≈ 1650) required to meet CG.

3.8.3.3.2. NOTE: Since the aircraft will be accelerating and reconfiguring during the initial
phase of the departure, your tech order calculations should take these factors into account and
take precedence. The 60-to-1 calculations are used only as an approximation tool to confirm and
add additional insights and situational awareness to the data extracted from your specific
aircraft’s performance manual.

3.8.3.4. As mentioned earlier, to increase the accuracy of the calculations and actually validate
the climb gradient required against aircraft performance, an adjustment for winds needs to be
applied. Using the information from Example #2, an average TAS during the climb was
determined to be 295 knots. Referencing the forecasted airport weather and appropriate winds
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               57

aloft chart, an approximate groundspeed can be calculated by applying the average winds
experienced throughout the climb. For the purpose of this example, we’ll assume the take-off
winds for RWY 19 at KJAC are forecasted to be 210° at 9 knots and the winds aloft information
at 9,000 and 12,000 feet were 240° at 21 knots and 270° at 30 knots respectively.

3.8.3.5. By adding the individual wind direction information and speed information and then
dividing by three, the average climb winds experienced would be approximately 240° at 20
knots.

3.8.3.6. The SID at Jackson Hole requires the crew to intercept and track the 192 degree radial
after departing RWY 19 which is approximately aligned with runway heading. Therefore the
difference between the departure track heading and average wind direction would be 50 degrees.
Using a standard headwind/crosswind chart, the pilot/crew can then calculate an approximate
headwind component of 13 knots experienced during the climb.

3.8.3.7. To calculate an approximate groundspeed, the pilot/crew would then subtract the
headwind component (13 knots) from the average TAS (295 knots). The average groundspeed
would then be 282 knots which equates to an average rate of travel of 4.7 nm/min (see 3.5.1).

3.8.3.8. Inserting this figure into the VVI calculation (refer to paragraph 3.5.2) would give you a
slightly lower VVI of approximately 1550 ft/min (versus ≈ 1650 ft/min) required.

3.8.3.8.1. NOTE: With the performance benefit a headwind provides, you may elect to add an
additional safety layer within your calculations and not use it. It is; however, highly
recommended that you always take into account the effects of tail winds since they can adversely
affect the aircraft’s ability to meet a specified climb gradient.

3.8.3.8.2. NOTE: As with any mathematical formula, the gradient equation and its associated
formulas can be manipulated to solve for any variable desired.

3.9. Visual Descent Point (VDP).

3.9.1. Calculating a VDP. The first step in calculating a VDP is to find the distance the VDP is
located from the end of the threshold by dividing the Height Above Touchdown (HAT) listed in
the minimums section of the IAP by the desired descent gradient. Although some aircraft may
utilize a different descent gradient due to operational purposes, most use a 3° glide path for
landing which equates to 300 ft per nm. Next, you will need to add the calculated VDP distance
to the DME associated with the RWY threshold. This will give you the DME for the VDP. In
some cases, depending on the position of the DME source in relation to the RWY, you may need
to actually subtract the VDP distance from the RWY threshold DME. This is because the VDP
calculation is predicated on the distance in miles from the end of the RWY, not the DME source.

3.9.1.1. Formula: VDP = HAT ÷ Gradient (normally 300 ft/nm).

3.9.1.2. For practical purposes, you can use: VDP = HAT ÷ 300.
58                                              AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.9.1.3. Example. You are planning to fly the localizer portion of the ILS RWY 16 at McChord
AFB (KTCM). Referencing the landing minimums section of figure 3.3, the HAT for the S-LOC
16 is listed as 494 ft. The VDP calculation would be as follows:

3.9.1.3.1. Formula: VDP = HAT ÷ 300

                    VDP = 494 ÷ 300

                    VDP = 1.65 (or ≈ 1.7 nm from RWY)

3.9.1.4. From the profile or the airport diagram section, you can determine the RWY is 4.8 nm
from the FAF. Since the FAF is at 5 DME and the RWY is 4.8 miles away, the DME at the
approach threshold is the difference between these two figures or 0.2 DME.

3.9.1.5. Therefore, the DME for the VDP can be determined by adding the calculated VDP
distance (from the end of the RWY) to the DME associated with the RWY threshold. In this
example, the approximate DME associated with the VDP would be 1.9 DME (1.7 + 0.2).

VVI, and pitch change needed to descend from the FAF altitude to reach the MDA at the VDP.
This is explained in the following calculations.
3.9.2.2. First, determine the distance that the aircraft will travel from the FAF DME to the
calculated VDP DME.

3.9.2.2.1. Descent Distance = FAF DME - VDP DME

          Descent Distance = 5.0 DME - 1.9 DME = 3.1 nm

3.9.2.3. Then, calculate the altitude to lose from the FAF altitude to the MDA.

3.9.2.3.1. Altitude to lose = FAF altitude – MDA altitude

          Altitude to lose = 2000 feet – 780 feet = 1220 feet

3.9.2.4. Once the distance and altitude difference is known, a descent gradient (DG) can be
calculated.

3.9.2.4.1. DG = Altitude to lose ÷ distance

          DG = 1220 feet ÷ 3.1 nm = 394 ft/nm (or approximately 400 ft/nm).

3.9.2.4.2. Referencing paragraph 3.4.6, 400 ft/nm also equates to a pitch change of 4° from level
flight.

3.9.2.4.3. If you flew the approach at 150 KTAS which approximates 2.5 nm/min rate of travel,
then a corresponding VVI can be calculated at 1,000 ft/min.

3.9.2.4.4. By determining a descent gradient, pitch change, and target VVI, you can reach the
MDA at the VDP. With a slight pitch adjustment, you can then pick up a normal 3° glide path
(or aim point for landing).

3.9.2.5. To summarize this portion of the example, with the calculated information, you can
depart the FAF at 150 KTAS (2.5 nm/min), adjust your pitch from level flight by 4° and descend
along a 400 ft/nm gradient to reach the MDA at the VDP. If the aircraft maintains these
parameters, at each mile inside the FAF, the aircraft should lose 400 ft of altitude.

3.9.2.5.1. NOTE: Published VDP’s may be absent from an instrument approach procedure (IAP)
for a couple of reasons. First, there was a period of time when the FAA and DoD TERPS simply
did not emphasize publishing VDP’s, so they were not added to the IAPs. TERPS procedures
(ref AFMAN 11-226) may also dictate the exclusion of a VDP if an obstacle exists inside the
visual segment and penetrates either the 34:1 or 20:1 plane. Therefore, you should exercise
caution when departing an MDA without a published VDP, particularly during periods of
reduced visibility or at night. See 11-217 Vol 1, Chapter 15, Visual Glide Slope Indicators
(VGSI) for more information on obstacles that penetrate the 20:1 surface.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              61

3.9.2.5.1. In the TERPS design criteria for a non-precision approach, protected airspace
requirements and obstacle clearance is predicated on the aircraft leveling off at the MDA and
executing a go-around from the MDA if the runway environment is not acquired and a safe
landing cannot be made. Unlike a “go-around” or “missed approach” executed from a precision
approach, no account for obstacle clearance is made for a “momentary dip” below the MDA on a
non-precision approach. Without proper planning, an undesired “momentary dip” below the
MDA could occur during a constant rate descent is made to the VDP. Pilots and aircrew should
be aware of this and adjust accordingly so as to not go below the MDA should it appear that a
missed approach may be likely based on weather conditions (e.g. reported weather is at/or near
minimums) and/or other factors.

3.10. Calculating a VVI for a Precision Approach.

3.10.1. The glide path published for an approach will be the same for every aircraft. Therefore,
a pitch change from level flight equal to the published glide path can be made on the attitude
indicator when intercepting the glide path. The speed at which the approach is flown has no
effect upon the amount of pitch change required when intercepting the glide path. Airspeed only
affects the time required to fly the final approach segment and the rate of descent (VVI). Prior to
intercepting the glide path, to increase your situational awareness during this critical phase of
flight, you should compute a target VVI. When the aircraft has intercepted and is stabilized on
the glide path, you can crosscheck the actual VVI against the target VVI you computed. The
difference between the two should be relatively close. If not, it provides an indication that
something could be affecting the safety of the approach (e.g., wind shear) and further
investigation or a missed approach may be warranted.

3.10.2. Referencing paragraph 3.5.2, an expected VVI can be easily computed based on your
planned approach airspeed (TAS or TMN) converted to nm/min. To further increase the
accuracy of the final descent approach planning, it is highly recommended that you adjust for a
headwind/tailwind component and use a groundspeed when computing an expected VVI.

3.10.2.1. NOTE: A rate of descent table (based on groundspeed and angle of descent) is
published at the back of the instrument approach plate booklet.

3.10.3. Although the descent angle for a precision glide path listed on the instrument approach
plate (IAP) may vary, the majority are designed to provide a 3° glide path (or 300 ft/nm
gradient).

3.10.4. Example #1: A pilot/crew is flying an aircraft with a malfunction that requires a “no
flap” precision approach to be flown to the ILS RWY 16 at McChord AFB (KTCM), see figure
3.3. Due to the higher speeds flown for “no flap” approaches, an approach speed of .3 Mach
(TMN) is planned. Referencing the profile view, the IAP indicates there is a standard 3° glide
path associated with the ILS. In order to calculate an expected VVI on final approach, the
pilot/crew must first convert the TMN to nm/min for use in the 60-to-1 formulas. Converting
TMN (and TAS) to nm/min whereby a VVI can then be determined is discussed in paragraphs
3.5.1 and 3.5.2 respectively. Here are the computations for this example:
62                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.10.1.1. Aircraft speed in nm/min = TMN × 10
          Aircraft speed in nm/min = 0.3 TMN × 10

         Aircraft speed in nm/min = 3

3.10.5. VVI can be determined using the glide path angle as presented in Formula (a) or by
using the gradient as demonstrated in Formula (b). Here are the calculations for each:

3.10.5.1. Formula (a): VVI = angle × nm/min × 100
                        VVI = 3° × 3 nm/min × 100

        VVI = 900 ft/min

3.10.5.2. Formula (b): VVI = gradient × nm/min

                        VVI = 300 ft/nm × 3 nm/min

         VVI = 900 ft/min

3.10.6. Example #2: You are planning to fly the ILS RWY 12 at Mountain Home AFB
(KMUO), refer to figure 3.4. The final approach speed is approximately 120 KTAS. Again, you
must first convert the KTAS to nm/min in order to calculate the expected VVI. Notice, this
particular precision approach is set to 2.5° versus the standard 3° glide path.

3.10.6.1. Aircraft speed in nm/min = TAS ÷ 60

         Aircraft speed in nm/min = 120 KTAS ÷ 60

         Aircraft speed = 2 nm/min

3.10.7. VVI can then be determined using the angle of descent or gradient (b) as calculated
below:

3.10.7.1. Formula (a): VVI = angle × nm/min × 100

                        VVI = 2.5° × 2 nm/min × 100

         VVI = 500 ft/min

3.10.7.2. Formula (b): VVI = gradient × nm/min
                       VVI = 250 ft/nm × 2 nm/min
                       VVI = 500 ft/min

3.10.8. Additional formulas have developed over the years that have also proven beneficial,
particularly when time available to conduct approach planning is limited. The following
approximate the VVI required for a 3° and 2.5 ° glide path.

3.10.8.1. VVI for 3° = TAS × 10 ÷ 2
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                63

3.10.8.2. VVI for 2.5° = (TAS × 10 ÷ 2) – 100

3.10.8.2.1 NOTE: TAS is used for “air mass” determinations and do not account for the affect
of wind on the aircraft’s ground track. To increase the accuracy of the calculations, the
pilot/crew should determine their rate of travel in relationship with the earth’s surface and use a
groundspeed (converted to nm/min) if able. Groundspeed is TAS corrected for a
headwind/tailwind component.

3.11. Determining Turn Radius.

3.11.1. Overview. When an aircraft is flown in a steady, coordinated turn at a specific angle of
bank (AOB) and velocity, the turn rate and turn radius is fixed and independent of aircraft type.
Although turn radius (TR) formulas are not specifically derived from the 60-to-1 relationship,
they are very useful when used in conjunction with the other calculations provided in this
chapter.

3.11.1.1. NOTE: As an aid, an aircrew may calculate the TR for their particular aircraft at the
various altitudes and airspeeds that are flown regularly since these figures usually remain
relatively constant.

3.11.2. Relationship between AOB and TAS. An aircraft’s turn radius is dependent on TAS and
angle of bank. For a constant angle of bank in a level turn, if the TAS increases, the turn radius
also increases. If the TAS is kept constant, as the angle of bank increases in a level turn, the turn
radius decreases. In order to develop a technique for determining your TR, one of the two
elements in the equation, either angle of bank or TAS, must be kept constant. Since most
instrument procedures are based on the pilot/crew using 30° of bank through the initial phases of
the procedure, the majority of the calculations presented are based on this fact. However, it does
not preclude utilizing a constant TAS and calculating a desired bank angle for the set speed (e.g.,
standard rate and ½ standard rate turns).

3.11.2.1. NOTE: To increase accuracy, it is recommended that the pilot/crew add or subtract the
wind component from the TAS or True Mach Number (TMN) and use a groundspeed (converted
to nm/min) when determining the various formulas presented in the section. It not only increases
the accuracy of your calculations but will also help ensure the aircraft stays within the confines
of protected airspace (e.g., when performing a procedure turn course reversal maneuver).

3.11.3. Turn Radius Calculation. The following two relationships provide the distance required
to turn an aircraft 90° using 30° of bank. This distance is the aircraft’s approximate turn radius.
These formulas are particularly useful when determining lead turn points when planning to
perform a radial-to-arc or arc-to-radial portion of an instrument procedure.

3.11.3.1. Formula 1: TR = (TAS ÷ 60) - 2 or (TMN × 10) – 2

3.11.3.2. Formula 2: TR = (TAS ÷ 60)2 ÷ 10 or (TMN)2 × 10

3.11.3.3. Example. An aircraft is flying at 240 knots TAS with a corresponding indicated Mach
# of 0.4 (TMN). Based on this information, the aircraft’s approximate TR at 30°angle of bank
can be calculated directly from the TMN or after the TAS is converted to the aircraft’s rate of
travel in nm/min.

3.11.3.4. Formula 1: TR = (TAS ÷ 60) -2 (or)          TR = (TMN × 10) - 2
                      TR = (240 ÷ 60) – 2              TR = (0.4 × 10) - 2
                      TR = 4 – 2                       TR = 4 – 2
66                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

                       TR = 2 nm                        TR = 2 nm


3.11.3.5. Formula 2: TR = (TAS ÷ 60)2 ÷ 10 (or) TR = (TMN)2 × 10
                     TR = (240 ÷ 60)2 ÷ 10       TR = (0.4)2 × 10
                             2
                     TR = (4) ÷ 10               TR = 0.16 × 10
                     TR = 16 ÷ 10                TR = 1.6 nm
                     TR = 1.6 nm

3.11.3.6. As you can see, depending on which formula is used, slight variances are possible.
The final TR calculations; however, are close enough and will enable the pilot to fly a more
precise IAP whether Formula 1 or Formula 2 is used.

3.11.4. Turning Performance Chart. The actual turn performance curve (dashed line) is derived
from the General Turning Performance Chart (reference Figure 3.5). Depending on which type
airspeed presentation is available and/or which method is easier to use normally determines
which formula is used. As you can see, when the results are compared against each other, a ½
nm difference is noted. This is because accuracy is slightly improved when Formula 2 (refer to
3.11.4.2.) is used since the results closely mirror the actual turning performance line. In fact,
except at the upper speed regimes, when Formula 1 is used, the largest variation from actual data
is approximately 0.5 nm. Above the Mach .8 (480 KTAS) airspeed regime, the difference
becomes quite large; however, few aircraft accomplish instrument procedures at this speed.
Even though slightly less accurate, the benefit of using Formula 1 is that it provides a small
margin of increased safety during maneuvering. The calculations provide for more TR than is
actually required which the pilot can compensate for by decreasing the angle of bank. When
using Formula 2, unless all factors affecting the turn are taken into account (e.g., winds) and the
turn started at the correct point, the potential exists for you to overshoot the desired course/arc or
exceed protected airspace. Additionally, it may tempt you to bank the aircraft beyond the
accepted 30° limit in IMC and expose you to the possibility of becoming spatially disoriented
(which increases as the angle of bank increases). Considering these factors, it is usually better to
allow for additional TR than not enough.

3.12 Standard and ½ Standard Rate Calculations.

3.12.1. Determining Lead Points - Standard and ½ Standard Rate Turns. The previous
techniques work well for computing radial-to-arc and arc-to-radial turns using 30° of bank;
68                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

however, they do not necessarily translate into standard rate turn calculations. To determine the
aircraft’s approximate turn radius (TR) for a standard rate turn (SRT) or ½ standard rate turn (½
SRT); the following formulas have proven useful.

3.12.1.1. TR for SRT = .5% of KTAS (or GS).

3.12.1.2. TR for ½ SRT = 1% of KTAS (or GS).

3.12.1.3. Example: You are flying at 200 KTAS, using the formulas above, the SRT and ½ SRT
are determined as follows:

3.12.1.3.1. TR for SRT = .5% × 200 KTAS.

     TR for SRT = 0.005 × 200

     TR = 1 nm

3.12.1.3.2 TR for ½ SRT = 1% × 200 KTAS

            TR for ½ SRT = 0.01 × 200 KTAS

            TR for ½ SRT = 2 nm

3.12.1.4. Therefore, for an aircraft flying 200 KTAS, the radius for a standard rate turn and ½
standard rate turn would be 1 nm and 2 nm respectively.

3.12.2. Determining Bank Angles - Standard and ½ Standard Rate Turn. While we are
discussing standard rate and ½ standard rate turns, the following calculations have proven useful
in determining approximate bank angles (∆) associated with each maneuver.

3.12.2.1. Bank ∆ for SRT = (TAS ÷ 10) + 7.

3.12.2.2. Bank ∆ for ½ SRT = (TAS ÷ 20) + 7.

3.12.2.3. For precision or non-precision radar approaches, the controller expects the pilot to
make the transition to final using a bank that allows the aircraft to approximate a standard rate
turn. After established on final segment of the approach, no more than ½ SRT should be used.

3.12.2.4. Example: You are maneuvering your aircraft in the radar pattern in preparation for a
radar approach. You are currently flying at 180 KTAS but will subsequently slow to 120 KTAS
on the final approach segment after configuring the aircraft. The calculation for a SRT at 180
KTAS is as follows:

3.12.2.4.1 SRT Bank ∆ = (180 ÷ 10) + 7.

            SRT Bank ∆ = 18 + 7
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               69

           SRT Bank ∆ = 25°

3.12.2.5. After configuring the aircraft and slowing to 120 KTAS on the final approach segment
of the procedure, smaller heading changes are required and the bank angle should normally not
exceed that required to make a ½ standard rate turn. Therefore, based on 120 KTAS, the
calculations for the ½ SRT is as follows:

3.12.2.5.1. ½ SRT Bank ∆ = 120/20 + 7

            ½ SRT Bank ∆ = 6 + 7

            ½ SRT Bank ∆ = 13°

3.12.3. Turn Relationships for Turns Greater than 90°. The turn radius discussion outlined in
paragraph 3.11.3 is based upon making a 90° turn when flying a radial-to-arc or arc-to-radial turn
intercept. However, you may experience situations requiring a turn that is more than 90° or less
than 90°. The following chart allows you to determine the approximate offset or lead distance
required based on a fraction of what would be required for a 90° turn. Simply put, you must
determine your 90° turn radius, then apply a fractional percentage of this figure to determine the
required offset or lead distance to make a turn that is greater than or less than 90°. The following
relationships should help in determining a more accurate lead point:
                              Degrees to       Fraction of
                              Turn             90° Turn

                              150              1 5/6

                              30               1/6

3.12.3.1 The items in BOLD refer to degrees of turn that are commonly used.

3.12.3.2. Example: If your mission profile dictates making a 180° turn, you must offset your
desired course twice the distance required to make a 90° turn. For 60° of turn (intercept), you
need to apply one-half the computed lead point. Based on a 3 nm TR computed in example
3.11.2.2 (Formula 1), the following offset/lead points can be determined from the chart above.

3.12.3.2.1. 180° turn = 2 × 3 nm = 6 nm lead/offset

            150° turn = 1 5/6 × 3 = 5 ½ nm lead/offset

            135° turn = 1 2/3 × 3 = 5 nm lead/offset

            120° turn = 1 ½ × 3 = 4 ½ nm lead/offset
70                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

            90° turn = 1 × 3 = 3 nm lead/offset

            60° turn = ½ × 3 = 1.5 nm lead/offset

            45° turn = 1/3 × 3 = 1 nm lead/offset

            30° turn = 1/6 × 3 = ½ nm lead/offset

3.12.3.3. Of the fractional formulas listed, you may want to consider committing the
relationships corresponding to 180°, 120°, 90°, and 60° to memory since they provide the
majority of the TR’s you will encounter during instrument flight. When making intercepts
requiring less than 60° of turn, your lead point is usually small enough that it is normally not
worth calculating.

3.13. Arc-to-Radial and Radial-to-Arc Calculations.

3.13.1 Computing a Lead DME (turning to intercept an arc). Computing the aircraft’s turn
radius for a 90° turn to intercept an arc using 30° of bank is relatively simple. While established
on a particular radial (either tracking inbound or outbound from the NAVAID), you will add or
subtract the TR (see 3.11.3.) from the DME associated with the arc. Formula:

3.13.1.1. Lead Point DME = Desired Arc DME ± TR.

3.13.1.2. Example: You are established in holding as depicted and planning on flying the ILS
RWY 16 at McChord AFB (reference figure 3.3) via the STEIL IAF. For the purpose of this
example, you are holding at 5000 feet MSL and indicating 200 KIAS which will be maintained
until configuring prior to reaching the FAF. Since TAS increases approximately 2% per 1,000
feet, after converting IAS to TAS, the calculations below will be predicated on 220 KTAS.
Therefore, you need to determine a lead point (DME) upon which to initiate the turn to intercept
the 10 DME arc (based off of the TCM VORTAC). Here are the no-wind calculations:

3.13.1.3. Lead Point (LP) DME = Desired Arc DME ± TR

         LP DME = 10 DME + TR

 LP DME = 10 DME + [(220 ÷ 60) – 2]

           LP DME = 10 DME + (3.7 – 2)

           LP DME = 10 DME + 1.7 DME

           LP DME = 11.7 DME

3.13.1.4. Therefore, after you have received clearance for the approach, when tracking inbound
on the 070° course (250° radial) to the TCM VORTAC, upon reaching 11.7 DME, the calculated
LP, you should commence a left turn to intercept the 10 DME arc.

3.13.1.4.1 NOTE: The formula is predicated on knowing the aircraft’s turn radius which is
based on the aircraft’s speed in nm/min. Although accuracy will vary slightly, for the purpose of
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 71

60-to-1 calculations, the formula works regardless of whether nm/min was determined using
TAS or TMN (see 3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.4).

3.13.1.4.2. NOTE: TAS is used for “air mass” determinations and does not account for the
affect of wind on the aircraft’s ground track. To increase accuracy, you should, if able, use a
groundspeed (converted to nm/min). This is accomplished by adjusting your TAS to account for
the headwind or tailwind component.

3.13.2. Maintaining The Arc. As stated in 11-217 Vol 1, Chapter 7; there are two techniques
you can use to maintain an arc. You can use either a series of straight legs or maintain a constant
bank angle (∆). To determine the approximate bank angle to maintain an arc, the following
formula may be utilized:

3.13.2.1. Require Bank ∆ (to maintain arc) = (30 ÷ Arc DME) × TR

3.13.2.2. Based on the example used in paragraph 3.13.2, if you intercept the 10 DME arc (as
depicted) and maintain a relatively constant 220 KTAS during your approach until configuring
just prior to the FAF, then you would need to hold approximately 5° of bank to maintain the arc.
Here are the calculations:

3.13.2.3. Required Arc Bank ∆ = (30 ÷ Arc DME) × TR

           Required Arc Bank ∆ = (30 ÷ 10) × TR (in nm/min)

          Required Arc Bank ∆ = 3 ×1.7 = 5.1° (or approximately 5°)

3.13.2.4 NOTE: Calculating and using a constant bank on an arc may be required when flying
relatively “tight” arcs, for example, 6 DME arc or less; however, the pilot must be aware that
doing so may increase the exposure to developing spatial disorientation (the leans).

3.13.3. Computing a Lead Radial (turning from an arc onto a radial). The following provides a
discussion on how to compute a lead radial upon which you can use to intercept an inbound
course from an arc. The formulas you use to determine a lead radial to start an arc-to-radial turn
are based on the original 60-to-1 calculation. Referencing paragraph 3.4.1, we know that 1° (or
radial) equals 1 nm at 60 nm. Using the 60-to-1 formula, if an aircraft is established on the 60
nm (DME) arc and you wanted to intercept an inbound (our outbound radial); then you should
initiate the turn 1° (or 1 radial) prior to the desired radial. If the aircraft’s turn radius is 4 nm,
then you would need to lead the turn by 4° (or 4 radials) prior. Since virtually all arc-to-radial
intercepts occur closer (e.g., 10, 15, 20 DME arc) to the NAVAID, you can easily determine the
lead radial upon which to start your turn based on a simple relationship to the original 60-to-1
formula. The relationship enables you to determine the number of radials per nm at a certain
distance from the NAVAID (other than 60 nm). Then, based on this figure and the aircraft’s turn
radius (refer to paragraph 3.11.1), you can calculate the lead radial needed to turn from the arc to
the desired radial. The following formula relationships simplify this discussion.

3.13.3.1. The number of radials per nm at a certain distance (arc DME) from a NAVAID is
equal to 60 divided by the arc DME. The formula is written as:
72                                                   AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.13.3.1.1. Radials per nm = 60 ÷ DME (arc)

3.13.3.2. To determine a lead radial; you then multiply the radials per nm by the aircraft’s TR.
The formula is written as:

3.13.3.2.1 Lead radial = radials per nm × aircraft’s TR

3.13.3.3. Example: You are planning on flying localizer portion of the ILS RWY 16 at
McChord AFB (reference figure 3.3) via the STEIL IAF and will therefore intercept the inbound
course from the 10 DME arc (based off of TCM VORTAC). The turn is initially based on the
TCM 338° radial, then once established in the turn, the primary NAVAID providing lateral
guidance will become the localizer. For the purpose of this example, you’ll maintain 220 KTAS
until slowing to configure prior to the FAF. Here are the calculations to determine which radial
indication you should use to initiate your turn to intercept the inbound course:

3.13.3.3.1. Radials per nm = 60 ÷ DME (arc)

             Radials per nm = 60 ÷ 10

             Radials per nm = 6

3.13.3.3.2. Lead radial = radial per nm × aircraft TR

     Lead radial = 6 × aircraft TR

     Lead radial = 6 × 1.7

     Lead radial = 10.2 (approximately 10 radials)

3.13.3.4 Therefore, if the computed aircraft’s turn radius is 1.7 nm, the lead radial upon which
you should initiate their turn upon reaching the TCM 328° radial (or 10 radials prior to the TCM
338° radial) in order to intercept the 160° inbound localizer course at KTCM.

3.13.3.5. NOTE: When TERPS publishes a lead radial on an instrument procedure that includes
an arc, it is normally based on a TAS of 240 knots and can allow for 2 or 1 nm of turn. Since it
is unknown which turning distance the TERPS specialist used and your aircraft’s turn radius will
vary depending on your airspeed (or groundspeed), it is highly recommended that you calculate
your own lead radial.

3.14. Procedure Turns Calculations (PTs).

3.14.1. Overview. The following formulas are designed to aid the pilot/crew in determining the
expected distance that is utilized when executing either the 45/180, 80/260, or teardrop portion of
a procedure turn course reversal. More importantly, the calculations are designed to help the
pilot stay within the required TERPS protected airspace. To reemphasize the information stated
in 11-217 Vol 1, paragraph 13.4.1, in order to not exceed protected airspace, based on airspeed
flown, it is critical you take into consideration factors affecting the aircraft’s turn performance
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              73

(e.g., winds, TAS, bank angle). A procedure turn should have a “remain within” distance of
either 10 or 15 nm annotated on the profile view of the instrument approach procedure.

3.14.1.1. NOTE: TAS is used for “air mass” determinations and does not account for the affect
of wind on the aircraft’s ground track. To increase accuracy of the procedure turn calculations
and more importantly, stay within the confines of protected airspace, the pilot/crew should
determine their rate of travel in relationship with the earth’s surface by using a groundspeed.
This is accomplished by adjusting TAS to account for the headwind or tailwind component.

3.14.2. 45/180 Course Reversal Maneuver Distance. The following formula provides a good
estimate to determine the distance that will be utilized (no wind) while flying a 45/180 course
reversal maneuver.

3.14.2.1. 45/180 Maneuver Distance = (3 × TR) + 2

3.14.2.2. For example, a pilot/crew plans to fly a 45/180 procedure turn course reversal at 180
KTAS. In order to complete the calculation, the crew must first convert their rate of travel (TAS
or TMN) into nm/min; then compute their TR. Since 180 KTAS equates to 3 nm per min (refer
to 3.5.1.2.1), this in turn gives a TR of 1 nm (refer to 3.9.1.3). Here is the calculation:

3.14.2.3. 45/180 Maneuver Distance = (3 × TR) + 2 nm

 45/180 Maneuver Distance = (3 × 1 nm) + 2 nm

 45/180 Maneuver Distance = 3nm + 2 nm

 45/180 Maneuver Distance = 5 nm

3.14.2.4. Based on this information, the distance require to perform the maneuver would be
approximately 5 nm (not corrected for winds).

3.14.2.5. Therefore, if the course reversal is flown at 180 KTAS, 5 nm of the “remain within”
distance will be dedicated towards executing the 45°/180° maneuver. If the annotated “remain
within” distance is 10 nm, the pilot/crew must begin the 45/180 no later than 5 nm from the
procedure turn fix (no wind) to stay within protected airspace.

3.14.3. 80/260 Course Reversal Maneuver Distance. The following formula provides a good
estimate to determine the required distance needed for the 80/260 course reversal procedure turn
maneuver:

3.14.3.1. 80/260 Maneuver Distance = 3 × TR

3.14.3.2. Based on the information provided in the example above (refer to paragraph 3.11.2), if
the pilot/crew elected to perform an 80/260 course reversal, approximately 3 nm of the “remain
within” distance would be devoted to performing the maneuver. Here are the calculations:

3.14.3.3. 80/260 Maneuver Distance = 3 × TR
74                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

 80/260 Maneuver Distance = 3 × 1 nm

 80/260 Maneuver Distance = 3 nm

3.14.3.4. Therefore, based on the information given, 3 nm of the “remain within” distance will
be used to perform the 80/260 maneuver. If the “remain within” distance was annotated as 10
nm, the pilot/crew should go outbound no farther than 7 nm from the procedure turn fix before
starting the 80/260 maneuver (no wind).

3.14.4. Teardrop, Determining Outbound Distance. In order to determine the required outbound
distance (OD) you should fly when executing a teardrop approach and then turn to intercept an
inbound course using 30° angle of bank requires the use of the following formula.

3.14.4.1. OD = 60 × turn diameter ÷ degrees between radials

3.14.4.2. Since the turn diameter is twice the turn radius (TR), the formula can be further be
simplified as follows:

3.14.4.3. OD = 60 × (2 × TR) ÷ degrees between radials

 OD = 120 × TR ÷ degrees between radials

3.14.4.4. Example: You are planning to fly a teardrop with a calculated average TAS of 180
KTAS (equates to an approximate TR of 1 nm). A review of the IAP indicates that the outbound
radial is 045° with an inbound course (195°) corresponding to the 015° radial. Based on the
information given, the outbound distance the pilot is required to fly (no wind) would be
calculated as follows:

3.14.4.5. OD = 120 × TR ÷ degrees between radials

          OD = 120 × 1 nm ÷ (045 radial - 015 radial)

        OD = 120 ÷ 30

        OD = 4 nm

3.14.4.6. Therefore, you would proceed outbound on the 045° radial for 4 nm to acquire the
proper spacing and then execute a 30° bank turn and roll out on the 015° radial (195° course to
the station) at 180 KTAS. Since the aircraft had a 1 nm turn radius, the total distance required to
execute the teardrop maneuver would be 5 nm [4 nm + 1 nm (used to complete the first 90° of
the turn)].

3.14.4.7. NOTE: In order to ensure the aircraft stays within protected airspace, it is highly
recommended that the pilot/crew account for any known winds and use a groundspeed when
determining procedure turn calculations. Also, the distance used when performing any
procedure turn maneuver can be reduced by using a slower TAS (or groundspeed).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               75

3.14.5. Determining Teardrop Bank Angle (∆) Required. If the teardrop approach has a required
or “hard” turn point, you may want to consider calculating a constant bank angle that would
enable you to roll out on the inbound course. To determine a constant bank angle under these
circumstances, the pilot/crew must first determine the distance the aircraft will travel between the
two radials used in the teardrop procedure.

3.14.5.1 Distance between radials = [Radial (a) – Radial (b)] × DME
                                                60

3.14.5.2. Once the distance between radials is known, the bank angle that will enable the
pilot/crew to roll out on the inbound course (no wind) can be determined by inserting the result
into the following formula:

3.14.5.3 Bank angle required = TR × 60 ÷ distance between radials

3.14.5.3.1. NOTE: The teardrop bank angle calculation works equally as well when rate of
travel in nm/min and subsequently TR is determined from a TMN (refer to paragraph 3.9.1.3).
Depending on which method is used, TAS versus TMN, the resulting bank angle required will
vary within a few degrees.

3.14.5.4. Example: You are planning to fly the HI-ILS or LOC RWY 33 at Bangor International
(KBGR) and will maintain an average 210 KTAS for the teardrop portion of the maneuver.
Referencing figure 3.6, the teardrop turn is initiated from the BGR 177° radial at 22 DME with
the desire to roll out on the 153° radial (closely aligned with the localizer 333° inbound course).
Based on the aircraft’s speed and information taken from the IAP, you can determine the
approximate bank angle to maintain during the turn using the following two formulas:

3.14.5.4.1. Distance between radials = [Radial (a) – Radial (b)] × DME
                                                     60

           Distance between radials = (177° - 153° radial) × 22 DME ÷ 60

           Distance between radials = (24) × 22 DME ÷ 60

           Distance between radials = 8.8 nm (≈ 9 nm)

3.14.5.5. As previously discussed, this figure is then inserted into the bank angle (∆) formula.
The aircraft’s turn radius (TR) is calculated using the formula in paragraph 3.11.3. Based on the
aircraft’s average TAS of 210 knots, it is therefore determined to have a TR of 1.5 miles.

3.14.5.5.1. Bank ∆ required = TR × 60 ÷ distance between radials

            Bank ∆ required = 1.5 nm × 60 ÷ 9 nm

            Bank ∆ required = 10°
76                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

3.14.5.6. Therefore, upon reaching 22 DME, if you establish approximately 10° of bank during
the turn, the aircraft should roll out on the 153° radial (or the 333° course inbound).

3.14.5.6.1. NOTE: This example does not take into account the affects of winds. To increase
accuracy of the calculations, the pilot/crew should determine, if able, their rate of travel in
relationship with the earth’s surface and use an average groundspeed (converted to nm/min).
Groundspeed is TAS corrected for wind.

3.14.6. Teardrop Offset. The teardrop offset angle calculation enables the pilot/crew to achieve
78                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

required spacing that should allow them to make a standard 30° bank turn back to an inbound
course. The calculation works for either a procedure turn course reversal maneuver or may also
be used in holding. Since the calculation is predicated on using all available airspace, it is
usually more advantageous to utilize the 45/180 and 80/260 course reversal formulas mentioned
in the previous discussion when executing a procedure turn and reserve the teardrop offset
calculation to holding applications. This is because holding pattern airspace is not only larger
but will usually not expose the crew to the same dangers associated with obstacle clearance if
inadvertently exceeded.
3.14.6.1. NOTE: Since the formula is predicated on using all available airspace, it is highly
recommended that TAS be compensated for winds and groundspeed utilized in the calculation.
This will not only increase the accuracy of the calculation, but more importantly, help the
pilot/crew stay within protected airspace.
3.14.6.2 When the calculation is used to determine an offset angle for a holding pattern, the “leg
length” used in the formula will be based on the distance displayed on the chart, instrument
approach plate (IAP), or from timing (e.g., rate of travel for 1 or 1 ½ min will equal a certain
distance).
3.14.6.3. For the procedure turn (PT) calculation, to determine the “leg length” distance that
should be inserted into the formula, the pilot/crew should subtract the aircraft’s TR from the
“remain within” distance.
3.14.6.4. Given a known TAS (or preferably a groundspeed) converted to nm/min and “leg
length” distance, the pilot/crew can determine an offset angle (or radial) by using the following
formula:
3.14.6.4.1. Degree offset = 60 × turn diameter ÷ leg length
3.14.6.5. Since the turn diameter is twice the turn radius (TR), the formula can be further be
simplified as follows:
3.14.6.5.1. Degrees offset = 60 × (2 × TR) ÷ leg length
     Degree offset = 120 × TR ÷ leg length
3.14.6.6. Example: Referencing figure 3.4, you are traveling westbound from the east and
planning to fly the full procedure ILS RWY 12 at Mountain Home AFB (KMUO) via the
“Mustang” IAF (MUO 224° radial, 12 DME). After receiving clearance to enter holding, you
determine that you are conveniently aligned to execute a teardrop upon reaching the fix. The
aircraft’s current rate of travel is 180 KTAS. Referring to the IAP, the charted “leg length” is 10
nm (22 DME – 12 DME). After determining the aircraft’s turn radius for 180 KTAS (refer to
paragraph 3.11.1.), based on the information given, the calculations to determine an offset angle
that will enable a 30° bank turn back to the inbound course is as follows:
3.14.6.6.1. Degree offset = 120 × TR ÷ leg length

             Degree offset = 120 × 1 nm ÷ 10 nm

             Degree offset = 12°
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          79

        3.14.6.7. Therefore, upon reaching the IAF fix, if you offset the 224° outbound heading
by 12° and set a 236° heading (± wind drift) until reaching 22 DME (10 nm), you should be able
to enterFigure  3.7 Summary

               REDUCED VERTICAL SEPARATION MINIMUMS (RVSM)

4.1. RVSM Airspace.

4.1.1. RVSM is a program that enables vertical separation to be reduced from 2,000 feet to
1,000 feet between properly equipped aircraft and appropriately trained aircrew operating from
FL 290 to FL 410. Historically, the vertical separation provided to aircraft operating above FL
290 was 2,000 ft. This was due to barometric altimeter inaccuracies at higher altitudes.
However, advances in altimeter technology, autopilot capabilities, and altitude deviation warning
systems have enabled aviation authorities around the world to safely decrease separation
minimums to 1,000 feet (airspace dependent) as long as the aircraft is outfitted with certain
avionics capabilities (see paragraph 4.2). Currently within domestic (U.S.) airspace, the RVSM
flight levels are between FL 290 and FL 410 with the following orientation based on direction of
flight:

4.1.1.1. Magnetic Course 000-179° = Odd Flight Levels

4.1.1.2. Magnetic Course 180-359° = Even Flight Levels

4.1.2. RVSM airspace has been implemented in various regions worldwide. Normal RVSM
altitudes include FL 290–410, but altitudes may vary. Therefore, you should consult the
appropriate AP Series FLIP to determine the specific regional altitudes and operational rules
before operating in RVSM airspace.

4.1.3. The benefits of RVSM include allowing aircraft to fly more optimum altitudes and routes,
increased fuel and time savings, increased enroute airspace capacity, and greater air traffic
control flexibility.

4.2. Access to RVSM Airspace.

4.2.1. In order for aircrews to fly in RVSM airspace, the aircraft must be properly certified and
approved by the lead command. An ATC clearance may be obtained which allows the entrance
of a non-RVSM approved aircraft into RVSM airspace.

4.2.2. The FAA has currently authorized DOD non-RVSM compliant aircraft access to RVSM
airspace if traffic conditions and controller work load permit. When a non-compliant RVSM
aircraft is operating in RVSM airspace, the vertical separation standard applied between the
aircraft and others will be 2,000 feet.

4.2.2.1. NOTE: Pilots and crews that are operating in RVSM airspace in a non-RVSM
compliant aircraft (whether due to certification or component failure) will state “negative
RVSM” upon initial contact with each frequency change.
84                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

4.2.2.2. NOTE: Procedures for non-RVSM aircraft to gain access to RVSM airspace, or climb
to/descend from altitudes above RVSM airspace, vary by region. Consult FLIP to determine
flight plan designation and access requirements.

4.3. RVSM Aircraft Equipment Requirements. Aircraft must have certain equipment prior to
obtaining certification/approval to operate in RVSM airspace. The following equipment must
meet specific tolerances and be functional prior to conducting flight in RVSM airspace:

4.3.1. Two independent altitude measurement systems. Each system should be composed of the
following elements:

4.3.1.1. A cross-coupled static source/system with proper ice protection feature (if located in an
area subject to ice accumulation).

4.3.1.2. Equipment capable of measuring and displaying pressure altitude to the flight crew
(altimeter).

4.3.1.3. Equipment able to convert the displayed pressure altitude into a digitally coded signal
for automatic altitude reporting purposes.

4.3.1.4. A static source error correction (if needed to meet the specified performance
requirements to operate in RVSM airspace).

4.3.1.5. Equipment that provides reference signals for automatic control and alerting when
aircraft is approaching, level, or vacating a selected altitude.

4.3.1.6. An automatic altitude control system (autopilot).

4.3.1.7. An altitude alert system. An altitude deviation warning system should signal an alert to
the pilot/crew when a certain deviation from selected altitude is experienced.

4.3.1.8. At least one altitude reporting transponder. If the aircraft has only one altitude reporting
transponder, it should have the capability of operating from either independent altitude
measurement system.

4.3.1.9. Although a traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) is not required to operate in
RVSM airspace, if the aircraft is equipped with TCAS II, in order to conduct flight in RVSM
airspace, it must be modified with, meet, or exceed TCAS II Version 7.0.

4.3.2. Should any of the required equipment needed to operate in RVSM airspace fail, either
prior to or while operating in RVSM airspace, notify the controlling agency as soon as possible.
Examples of equipment failure that should be reported to ATC either before or after entering
RVSM airspace include the following:

4.3.2.1. Failure of the automatic altitude control system (autopilot)
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               85

4.3.2.2. Loss of required redundancy capability of the dual independent pressure altitude
measuring systems.

4.3.3. Access into or continued flight in RVSM airspace may or may not be granted by the
controlling agency based on the level of degradation, ATC traffic considerations, or specific
contingency procedures associated with the RVSM airspace (refer to FLIP for regional specific
guidance).

4.4. Executing an RVSM Flight.

4.4.1. Flight Planning. While planning a flight that will operate in RVSM airspace, the flight
crew and mission planners (if applicable) should pay particular attention to conditions that may
affect operation in RVSM airspace. These include, but may not be limited to:

4.4.1.1. Consulting regional or area specific FLIP regarding guidance and contingency
procedures while operating in RVSM airspace.

4.4.1.2. Verifying the aircraft has been certified/approved for RVSM operations and required
equipment is operating normally (see paragraph 4.3).

4.4.1.3. If the aircraft is not RVSM-approved or the required equipment not operating within
designed specifications, the flight crew must comply with applicable procedures for a non-
RVSM capable aircraft and file using the appropriate non-RVSM suffix code.

4.4.1.4. To meet mission requirements, the FAA may be contacted prior to an aircraft’s
departure (1-4 hours in advance) to receive a conditional or tentative approval for a non-
compliant aircraft to operate in domestic RVSM airspace. The FAA facility to be contacted and
the method used depends on the number of the “centers” the flight will traverse in RVSM
airspace:

4.4.1.4.1. Two hours or less prior to departure: The Traffic Management Unit (TMU) should be
contacted at the Air Route Traffic Control Center’s (ARTCC) airspace office where the
departure airport is located. Contact information can be found at the following link:
        http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/enroute/rvsm
        /

4.4.1.4.2. Three or more hours from departure: The FAA has set up a specific website (DOD
Priority Mission Site) where military units can enter specific information. It is located at the

4.4.1.5. Annotate on the FAA, ICAO, or military flight plan the appropriate suffix code
indicating that the aircraft is approved for RVSM operations.
86                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

4.4.1.5.1. NOTE: Only RVSM-approved aircraft with required equipment may use an aircraft
equipment suffix indicating RVSM capability. Refer to FLIP General Planning for RVSM flight
plan equipment suffix guidance.

4.4.1.6. Obtain reported and forecast weather conditions, particularly areas of turbulence, on the
route of flight that may affect RVSM operations.

4.4.1.6.1. NOTE: For information regarding domestic, oceanic, and international RVSM
airspace, requirements, and procedures; pilots, crews, and mission planners can access an FAA
RVSM website at:
     http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/enroute/rvsm/


4.4.2. Preflight Actions. The following preflight actions should be accomplished prior to flight
in RVSM airspace:

4.4.2.1. Review maintenance forms to ascertain the condition of equipment required for flight in
RVSM airspace. Equipment required for flight in RVSM airspace should be operational and
any malfunction resolved.

4.4.2.2. During the external inspection of the aircraft, particular attention should be paid to the
condition of static sources and the condition of the fuselage skin in the vicinity of each static
source and any other component that may affect altimeter accuracy

4.4.2.3. Before takeoff, the aircraft altimeters should be set to the local altimeter setting and
should display a known elevation (e.g., field elevation) within the limits specified in aircraft
flight manuals. The difference between the known elevation and the elevation displayed on the
altimeters should not exceed 75 ft. Both altimeters should also agree within limits as specified in
the aircraft flight manual between each other.

4.4.3. Inflight Actions. During flight in RVSM airspace:

4.4.3.1. Flight crews should understand and use proper pilot/controller phraseology while
operating in RVSM airspace. Refer to FLIP Area Planning documents for proper RVSM
phraseology.

4.4.3.2. Flight crews should ensure aircraft equipment required for operations continue to
function normally. Any malfunction or failure that potentially degrades the aircrafts ability to
operate safely and meet RVSM requirements should be reported to ATC or appropriate
controlling agency.

4.4.3.3. All primary and standby altimeters (if installed) should be promptly set to 29.92 in. Hg
when passing the transition altitude and rechecked for proper setting when reaching assigned
flight level (FL).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                87

4.4.3.4. In level cruise it is essential that the aircraft is flown at the assigned FL. Except in
contingency or emergency situations, the aircraft should not intentionally depart from assigned
FL without a positive clearance from ATC or controlling agency.

4.4.3.5. When climbing or descending between assigned FL(s) in RVSM airspace, the aircraft
should not be allowed to overshoot or undershoot the cleared FL by more than 150 ft. It is
recommended that the level off be accomplished using the altitude capture feature of the
automatic altitude-control system, if installed.

4.4.3.6. When entering or changing flight levels within RVSM airspace, vertical speeds should
be limited to 1000 feet per minute or less. This helps ensure the aircraft does not overshoot or
undershoot the assigned FL by more than 150 feet and reduce the likelihood of inadvertent
TCAS resolution advisories occurring.

4.4.3.7. An automatic altitude-control system (autopilot) should be operative and engaged
during level cruise, except when circumstances such as re-trimming the aircraft or encountering
turbulence require disengagement.

4.4.3.8. At intervals of approximately one hour, it is recommended that the pilot/crew
crosscheck the altitude displayed on both primary altimeters and the stand-by altimeter (if
installed). The two primary altimeters should agree within 200 ft (60 m) or a lesser value if
specified in the aircraft flight manual. (Failure to meet this condition requires the altimetry
system be reported as defective and ATC or controlling agency notified). The difference
between the primary and stand-by altimeters should be noted for use in contingency situations.

4.4.3.9. Normally, the altimetry system being used to control the aircraft should be selected to
provide the input to the altitude-reporting transponder transmitting information to ATC. If the
pilot is notified by ATC of an altitude deviation error that exceeds 300 ft, the pilot should take
action to return to assigned FL as quickly as possible or resolve the issue.

4.4.3.10. The pilot/crew should notify ATC of contingencies (aircraft system failures, weather
conditions) that affect the ability to maintain the assigned FL (within ± 200 feet or greater) and
coordinate a plan of action. Contingency procedures for specific regions and areas are located in
FLIP Area Planning documents.

4.4.3.11. Pilots should be aware of the potential for wake turbulence encounters while operating
in RVSM airspace, particularly:

4.4.3.11.1. In the vicinity of aircraft climbing or descending through their altitude.

4.4.3.11.2. Approximately 12-15 miles after passing 1,000 feet below opposite direction traffic.

4.4.3.11.3. Approximately 12-15 miles behind and 1,000 below same-direction traffic.

4.4.3.11.3.1. NOTE: Regions may implement use of track-offset procedures to mitigate the
effect of wake turbulence and reduce the likelihood of operational errors in RVSM airspace.
Specific offset procedures are located in FLIP Area Planning documents.

                    TERRAIN AVOIDANCE WARNING SYSTEM (TAWS)

5.1. Definitions.

5.1.1. Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). The term CFIT defines an accident in which a
fully qualified pilot or certificated crew inadvertently flies a properly working airplane into the
ground, water, or an obstacle with no apparent awareness by the pilots. TAWS is designed to
increase situational awareness (particularly during IMC or night conditions) by providing
sufficient information and alert notification to detect a potentially hazardous terrain situation.
With its enhanced design parameters, TAWS should permit the pilot/crew to take the action
necessary to prevent a CFIT event.

5.1.2. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). GPWS was the first generation of ground
proximity warning. The traditional GPWS was unable to predict accurately what was ahead of
the aircraft since the system only took real time vertical measurements of the terrain directly
beneath the aircraft. It did have some limited predictive capabilities based on trend information
since the computer kept a track of how quickly the terrain was rising in relation to the aircraft’s
profile (climbing, level, or descending). Therefore, it was able to warn the aircrew under some,
but not all, circumstances since it could not detect steep gradients in terrain (sheer cliff or
extremely steep slope) in a timely fashion. Still, by monitoring the aircraft’s height in relation to
the ground through a radio altimeter and providing basic trend information, the original GPWS
significantly reduced CFIT accidents.

5.1.3. Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). EGPWS expands on the
technology provided by the original or traditional GPWS by incorporating additional terrain
alerting features. To provide the aircrew with additional positional awareness, EGPWS may also
include a visual display of the aircraft’s position in relation to surrounding terrain to. This is
accomplished by adding a terrain database for special reference.

5.1.4. Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS). TAWS improves on existing GPWS
systems by using position data from a navigation system (e.g. GPS, INS), a digital terrain
database, forward looking terrain avoidance capability, and continued operation in the landing
configuration. These features provide the aircrew earlier aural and visual warnings of an
impending or potential terrain conflict and make a smoother corrective action. Most modern
multi function displays have capabilities to interface and display terrain information overlaid
with the aircraft’s geographical position along with other types of useful data.

5.1.4.1. NOTE: Air Force flight crews should ascertain the regional area of coverage their
specific TAWS database covers, particularly when flying internationally.

5.2. TAWS Equipment (Class A and Class B).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                89

5.2.1. Class A TAWS. TAWS is divided into two different classes. Of the two, Class A is the
more advanced version. Class A TAWS equipment, as a minimum, will provide alerts for the
following circumstances:

5.2.1.1. Reduced required terrain clearance.

5.2.1.2. Imminent terrain impact.

5.2.1.3. Premature descent.

5.2.1.4. Excessive rates of descent.

5.2.1.5. Excessive closure rate to terrain.

5.2.1.6 Negative climb rate or altitude loss after take-off.

5.2.1.7. Flight into terrain when not in landing configuration.

5.2.1.8. Excessive downward deviation from an ILS glideslope.

5.2.1.9. Descent of the airplane to 500 feet above the terrain or nearest runway elevation.

5.2.1.10. Voice callout “Five Hundred” during a non-precision approach.

5.2.1.11. Class A TAWS installations must provide a terrain awareness display that shows either
the surrounding terrain or obstacles relative to the airplane, or both.

5.2.1.12. Class A systems require input from a 2500 ft. radio altimeter.

5.2.2. Class B TAWS. Class B TAWS equipment, as a minimum, will provide alerts for the
following circumstances:

5.2.2.1. Reduced required terrain clearance.

5.2.2.2. Imminent terrain impact and premature descent.

5.2.2.3. Excessive rates of descent.

5.2.2.4. Negative climb rate or altitude loss after take-off.

5.2.2.5. Descent of the airplane to 500 feet above the terrain or nearest runway elevation.

5.2.2.6. Voice callout “Five Hundred” during a non-precision approach.

5.2.2.7. Class B TAWS installation may provide a terrain awareness display that shows either
the surrounding terrain or obstacles relative to the airplane, or both.

5.2.3. Terrain Awareness Display (TAD). These functions use aircraft geographic position,
aircraft altitude, and an internal terrain database to predict potential conflicts between the aircraft
flight path and terrain, and to provide graphic displays of the conflicting terrain. The TAD of
Class A TAWS displays an image of surrounding terrain in varying density dot patterns of green,
yellow and red. The display is generated from the aircraft altitude compared to terrain data in the
EGPWS computer. With terrain data available, these dot patterns represent specific terrain
separation with respect to the aircraft.

                  TRAFFIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM (TCAS)

6.1. General Information. The objective of TCAS is to provide collision avoidance
information. This is achieved primarily through the use of a display medium that provides an
overview of squawking aircraft in the general proximity (based on range selection and
capabilities). Should an aircraft become a perceived threat, a traffic advisory (TA) is issued
whereby the crew is intended to visually acquire and avoid the intruding aircraft. If the aircraft is
not visually acquired and the threat increases, a resolution advisory (RA) is then issued directing
the pilot to immediately maneuver the aircraft to avoid the potential collision. Figure 6.1
represents a standard TCAS display with the basic color-coding you could expect to see between
the various traffic and threat indications. Additional data may be provided as well. This may
include but is not limited trend information such as whether traffic is climbing or descending and
relative height of traffic (whether above or below) to your aircrafts present altitude. TCAS was
designed to reduce the risk of midair collision in the existing conventional air traffic control
system while minimizing unwanted alarms in encounters for which the collision risk does not
warrant an escape maneuver. TCAS is not dependent upon any ground-based systems, but does
need transponder information to operate. TCAS is the U. S. version of ACAS, which is the
ICAO accepted name for Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS). TCAS II, version 7 is
the same as ACAS II and is the latest version of TCAS software. Although not intended for
aircraft that fly in tight formation packages (e.g. fighter-type), it is beneficial for pilots of these
types of aircraft to have an understanding of how TCAS works. Doing so may help prevent
inadvertently causing a resolution advisory (RA) on another aircraft.
Figure 6.1. Typical TCAS Display
92                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

6.2. TCAS Advisories. TCAS is capable of providing two classes of advisories. RAs either
direct vertical maneuvers, or impose restrictions that are predicted on increasing or maintaining
the existing vertical separation from threatening aircraft. TAs indicate the approximate positions
of potential threats (e.g., aircraft that may later cause RAs to be displayed). Remember, TCAS
RAs only offer vertical solutions and will not give a horizontal escape maneuver. It is also
important to understand that while pilots are expected to maneuver their aircraft in response to an
RA, they are not expected to do so based on a TA.

6.3. TCAS Operation. When airborne, TCAS equipment periodically transmits interrogation
signals. These interrogations are replied to by transponders installed on nearby aircraft. The
required nominal tracking range is 14 NM. TCAS surveillance range will be reduced in
geographic areas with a large number of ground interrogators and/or TCAS equipped aircraft. A
minimum surveillance range of 4.5 NM is guaranteed for TCAS aircraft that are airborne. A
Mode C transponder replies with its altitude. A Mode S transponder replies with its altitude and
unique aircraft address. The TCAS equipment computes the range of the intruding aircraft by
using the round-trip time between the transmission of the interrogation and the receipt of the
reply. Altitude information, whether the aircraft is climbing or descending, range, closure rate,
acceleration and bearing are estimated from the reply information. This data is then processed to
determine whether the intruding aircraft is a threat.

6.4. Traffic Advisories.

6.4.1. TAs alert the flight crew to a potential threat aircraft which may or may not become an
impending RA. A TA indicates the general position of a potential threat relative to their aircraft.
The general position will normally include some or all of the following; range, range rate,
altitude, altitude rate, and bearing of the intruding aircraft relative to their own aircraft. The
information conveyed in TAs is intended to assist the flight crew in sighting nearby traffic.
TAs without altitude information also guard against non-altitude reporting, transponder-equipped
aircraft. However, this type of TA is much more difficult to visually acquire since altitude
information is not displayed to the pilot/crew. TAs can be issued against any transponder-
equipped aircraft even if the aircraft does not have altitude-reporting capability.

6.4.2. Azimuth resolution accuracy using TCAS equipment is nominal at best. Worst-case
azimuth accuracy within +/-10o, elevation is +/-9o with a peak of +/-27o. From 10o to 20o of
elevation, the worst-case azimuth accuracy degrades to +/-15o with a peak of +/-45o. The TCAS
is designed to alert the crew to aircraft deemed a potential threat. The pilot/crew is responsible
to exercise the appropriate scan techniques to visually acquire the aircraft.

6.5. Resolution Advisories.

6.5.1. If the threat detection logic in the TCAS computer determines that an encounter with a
nearby aircraft could soon lead to a near-collision or collision, the computer threat resolution
logic determines an appropriate vertical maneuver that will ensure the safe vertical separation
from conflicting aircraft. The selected maneuver ensures adequate vertical separation within
constraints imposed by the climb rate capability and proximity to the ground of the TCAS
aircraft. The aural advisory given may also be used in conjunction with a electronic vertical
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                93

velocity indicator (EVVI) whereby the pilot is provided a rate of climb, either positive or
negative, that needs to be complied with to ensure separation (see figure 6.2).

6.5.2. The RAs provided to the pilot/crew can be divided into two categories: corrective
advisories, which instruct the pilot to deviate from the current flight path (e.g., “CLIMB” when
the aircraft is in level flight); and preventive advisories, which advise the pilot to maintain or
avoid certain vertical speeds (e.g., “DON’T CLIMB” when the aircraft is in level flight).

6.5.2.1. NOTE: RAs can be issued only in the vertical plane and only against aircraft that are
reporting altitude.

Figure 6.2. Example of a Typical EVVI Display with TCAS RA




6.6. Warning Times. TCAS advisories are typically based on time to Closest Point of
Approach (CPA). The time must be short and vertical separation must be small, or projected to
be small, before an advisory can be issued. The separation standards provided by air traffic
services are different from those against which TCAS issues alerts. In encounters with a slow
closure rate, TCAS advisories will be issued based on distance. Thresholds for issuing a TA or
RA vary with altitude. The thresholds are larger at higher altitudes. RAs are chosen to provide
the desired vertical miss distance at CPA. As a result, RAs can instruct a climb or descent
through the intruder aircraft’s altitude. In any potential collision, the TCAS equipment generates
an RA nominally 15 to 35 seconds before the CPA of the aircraft. The TCAS equipment may
generate a TA up to 20 seconds in advance of an RA.

6.7. Advisory Thresholds. The following are the criteria that a TCAS uses for issuing TAs and
RAs.

6.7.1. The TA altitude threshold is an 850-foot bubble below FL420 and a 1,200-foot bubble
above FL420.

6.7.2. When the vertical miss distance is projected to penetrate the bubble, an RA requiring a
change to the existing vertical speed will be issued. The TCAS desired separation varies from
300 feet at low altitude to a maximum of 700 feet above FL300.
94                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

6.7.3. When the vertical miss distance is projected to be just outside the bubble, an RA that does
not require a change to the existing vertical speed will be issued. This separation varies from 600
to 800 ft.

6.7.4. RA fixed range thresholds vary between 0.2 NM at low altitude and 1.1 NM at high
altitude. These fixed range thresholds are used to issue RAs in encounters with slow closure
rates.

6.8. Air-Air Coordination of Resolution Advisories.

6.8.1. When the pilot of a TCAS aircraft receives an RA and maneuvers as advised, the TCAS
aircraft will normally be able to avoid the intruding aircraft provided the intruder does not
accelerate or maneuver so as to defeat the RA response of the TCAS aircraft.

6.8.2. If the intruding aircraft is equipped with TCAS II, a coordination procedure is performed
via the air-to-air Mode S data link in order to ensure that the TCAS RAs are compatible.

6.8.3 Failure to respond to an RA negates the collision protection provided by the TCAS. By
not taking the appropriate action indicated with a RA, the flight crew effectively takes
responsibility for achieving safe separation. In TCAS-TCAS encounters, failure to comply with
an RA also degrades the ability of the other aircraft’s TCAS equipment to successfully calculate
a separation solution.

6.8.4. TCAS provides RAs against aircraft equipped with altitude reporting Mode A/C or
Mode S transponders. Aircraft operating a transponder without altitude encoding will only
generate a TA. Aircraft not equipped with or not operating Mode A/C or Mode S transponders
cannot be tracked by TCAS. Therefore, see and avoid is always warranted to avoid collisions
with other aircraft.

6.9. General TCAS Operational Procedures. The TCAS system is intended to assist
pilots/crews in the avoidance of potential collisions and in the active search for, and visual
acquisition of, potentially conflicting traffic. For TCAS to work as designed, immediate and
correct crew response to TCAS advisories is essential. Delayed flight crew response to an RA or
reluctance to maneuver the aircraft in response to an RA can significantly decrease or negate the
protection afforded by TCAS. Therefore, a clear understanding among flight crews of their
respective responsibilities when a TCAS advisory occurs is required. Flight crews are expected
to respond to TCAS indications in accordance with the following guidelines:

6.9.1. Respond to TAs by attempting to establish visual contact with the intruder aircraft and
other aircraft that may be in the vicinity. Coordinate to the degree possible with other crew
members to assist in searching for traffic. Do not deviate from an assigned clearance based only
on TA information. For any traffic that is acquired visually, continue to maintain safe separation
in accordance with current regulations and good operating practices. Pilots should not make
horizontal maneuvers based solely on information shown on the traffic display. Slight
adjustments in vertical speed while climbing or descending, or slight adjustments in airspeed
while still complying with the ATC clearance are acceptable.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               95



6.9.2. When an RA occurs, it is very important that the PF (Pilot Flying) respond immediately
by looking at the RA displays and maneuver as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardize the
safe operation of the flight. The pilot’s instinctive reaction should always be to respond to RAs
in the direction and to the degree displayed, without delay.

6.9.3. If a decision is made not to respond to an RA, the flight crew negates the safety benefits
provided by their TCAS. A decision to not respond also decreases the safety benefits to all other
aircraft involved in the encounter and results in the flight crew taking responsibility for
maintaining safe separation.

6.9.3.1. WARNING: Disregarding or maneuvering in such a manner that is not in compliance
with a commanded RA could result in a collision with the intruder aircraft.

6.9.4. The following considerations should be taken into account:

6.9.4.1. TCAS does not alter or diminish the pilot’s basic authority and responsibility to ensure
safe flight.

6.9.4.2. If the intruder aircraft is equipped with TCAS, both systems will communicate with
each other and provide individual RAs to provide positive separation. However, it is possible
that the other pilot may not respond appropriately and maneuver in an unexpected direction
contradictory to the RA provided.

6.9.4.3. Traffic acquired visually may not be the traffic causing the RA, or it may not be the only
aircraft to which TCAS is responding.

6.9.4.4. Visual perception of the encounter may be misleading. It is difficult to visually
determine the vertical displacement of other aircraft especially when ground reference
information is unreliable or at cruise altitudes where the earth’s horizon is obscured.
             Table 6.1. Recommended Pitch Change in Response to TCAS RA.
          SPEED                                PITCH ADJUSTMENT
          .80 MACH                             2°
          250 KIAS below 10,000 feet           4°
          APPROACH below 200 KIAS 5° to 7°

6.9.5. Respond to RAs by disconnecting the autopilot and using prompt, smooth control inputs.
Maneuver in the direction and vertical rate recommended by the TCAS. To achieve the required
vertical rate (normally 1,500 feet per minute) on aircraft where the RA is displayed on a vertical
speed indicator, it is recommended that the aircraft’s pitch is changed using the guidelines shown
in the table 6.1 above. Referring to the vertical speed indicator (VSI) or vertical speed tape,
make any further pitch adjustments necessary to place the vertical speed in the green area.

6.9.6. On aircraft with pitch guidance for TCAS RA displays, follow the RA pitch command for
initial, increase, and weakening RAs.

6.9.7. For TCAS to provide safe vertical separation, the PF is expected to initiate the appropriate
RA maneuver within 5 seconds of when the RA is first displayed. Deviations from assigned
altitude, when responding to an RA, typically will be no more than 300 to 500 feet. RA
maneuvers should use vertical speeds within the green areas, or the indicated pitch angle, and
avoid red areas on vertical speed indicators or tapes, or outlined pitch avoidance areas.

6.9.8. The PNF (Pilot Not Flying) should provide updates on the traffic location and monitoring
the response to the RA. Proper crew resource management (CRM) should be applied.

6.9.9. Respond immediately to any “increase” or “reversal” RA. Initiation of the increase or
reversal RA maneuver is expected within 2 ½ seconds after issuance of the advisory. Again, fly
to the green area or indicated pitch angle and avoid red areas or outlined pitch avoidance areas.

6.9.10. If an RA is weakened, such as a ‘climb’ RA weakened to a ‘do not descend’ RA,
respond to the weakening RA by adjusting the aircraft’s vertical speed or pitch angle as required
by the RA display. Pilots are reminded that prompt and correct reaction to the weakened RA will
minimize altitude deviations and disruptions to ATC. This will also reduce the possibility of
additional RAs against the intruder or other traffic.

6.9.11. Excessive responses to RAs are disruptive to ATC and may result in additional RAs.

6.9.12. If an RA requires the pilot to maneuver their aircraft that is inconsistent with a recently
given clearance or contradicts a traffic avoidance vector received by ATC, pilots shall follow the
RA.

6.10. ATC Considerations. ATC may have older altitude data than the TCAS and normally
will not know when a TCAS issues an RA. It is possible for ATC to unknowingly issue
instructions that are contrary to the TCAS RA indications. When one aircraft maneuvers
opposite the vertical direction indicated by TCAS and the other aircraft maneuvers as indicated
by TCAS, a collision may occur. Therefore, if conflicting instructions are received from ATC
that are contrary to the RA, maneuver the aircraft IAW paragraph 6.9.12 and AFI 11-202 Vol 3
General Flight Rules (the RA takes precedence).

6.10.1 ATC may not be providing separation service to the aircraft causing the RA or the
intruder may not be known to ATC (e.g., military operations in some countries).

6.10.2. If an RA requires maneuvering contrary to “right-of-way” rules, “cloud clearance” rules
for Visual Flight Rules (VFR), Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), or other such criteria, pilots are
expected to follow the RAs to resolve the immediate traffic conflict. Deviations from rules or
clearances should be kept to the minimum necessary to satisfy an RA, but the RA must be
satisfied.

6.10.3. If an RA response requires deviating from an ATC clearance, comply with the RA and
then correct back to the current ATC clearance in an expeditious manner when the traffic conflict
is resolved or the TCAS “clear of conflict” message is heard.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               97



6.10.4. If an RA requires a deviation from an assigned altitude, communicate with ATC
immediately after responding to the RA.

6.10.5. When the RA is cleared, the flight crew should 1) immediately return to their previously
assigned clearance and advise ATC of that maneuver, or 2) comply with any amended clearance
issued

6.10.6. Stall warning, windshear, and Ground Proximity Warning System/Enhanced Ground
Proximity Warning System/Terrain Awareness Warning System (GPWS/EGPWS/TAWS) alerts
take precedence over TCAS RAs. Pilots shall respond to these alerts instead of RAs.

6.10.7. Pilots should use TCAS traffic information displays to assist in establishing visual
contact with other aircraft. Certain Electronic Flight Information System (EFIS) TCAS
installations operating in conjunction with “track up” mode may require the pilot to make
allowances for the difference between the aircraft heading and track when visually searching for
nearby aircraft.

6.10.8. Pilots are expected to operate TCAS while in-flight in all airspace, or as directed by
MAJCOM guidance.

6.10.9. When feasible, flight crews should use the same altitude data source that is being used
by the PF to provide altitude information to the TCAS and to ATC. Using a common altitude
source precludes unnecessary RAs due to differences between altitude data sources.

6.11. Operating Practices. The following are recommended TCAS operating practices that
have been established when using the system throughout the world.

6.11.1. To preclude unnecessary transponder interrogations and possible interference with
ground radar surveillance systems, TCAS should not be activated (TA-only or TA/RA mode)
until taking the active runway for departure and should be deactivated immediately after clearing
the runway after landing.

6.11.2. During flight, TCAS traffic displays should be used to assist in visual acquisition.
Displays that have a range selection capability should be used in an appropriate range setting for
the phase of flight. For example, use lower range scales in the terminal area and longer range
scales for climb/descent and cruise as appropriate.

6.11.3. If available and traffic density is a factor, the “Above” mode may be used during climb.
Likewise, the “Below” mode may be used during descent.

6.11.3.1. NOTE: The configuration of the traffic display, e.g., range and Above/Below selection,
does not affect the TCAS surveillance volume.

6.11.4. The normal operating mode of TCAS is TA/RA. It may be appropriate to operate TCAS
in the TA only mode in conditions where ICAO States have approved specific procedures
98                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

permitting aircraft to operate in close proximity, in the event of particular in-flight failures,
performance limiting conditions as specified by the Aircraft Technical Order, or as directed by
MAJCOM/local directives.

6.11.4.1. NOTE: Careful consideration should be given when selecting the TA only mode.
Operating in TA only mode eliminates the major safety benefit of TCAS.

6.11.5. Operating in TA/RA mode and then not following an RA is potentially dangerous. If an
aircraft that does not intend to respond to an RA operates in the TA only mode other TCAS-
equipped aircraft operating in TA/RA mode will have maximum flexibility in issuing RAs to
resolve encounters.

6.11.6. When safe, practical, and in accordance with written guidance, pilots should limit
vertical speeds to 1,500 fpm or less when within 1,000 feet of assigned altitudes. This procedure
will reduce the frequency of unnecessary RAs and be in conformance with the ICAO guidance
contained in PANS-OPS. Note that TCAS II Version 7 reduces alert thresholds to account for
the reduction in vertical separation to 1000 feet above FL 290 in RVSM airspace.

6.11.7. Some ICAO States have taken actions to require vertical speed reductions when
approaching an assigned altitude. These requirements, defined in the State’s Aeronautical
Information Publications (AIPs), were implemented as a means for reducing the probability of
unnecessary RAs when an aircraft is climbing or descending to level at an adjacent altitude to
another aircraft.

6.12. Limitations of TCAS. It is important to understand that TCAS will neither track or
display non-transponder equipped aircraft or aircraft with an inoperable transponder. TCAS
does not alter or diminish the pilot’s basic authority and responsibility to ensure safe flight.
Since TCAS does not track aircraft that are not transponder equipped or whose transponder is
inoperative, TCAS alone does not ensure safe separation in every case. It is particularly
important that pilots maintain situational awareness and continue to use good operating practices
and judgement when using TCAS and following RAs. Maintain a frequent outside visual scan
and continue to communicate with ATC.

6.12.1. TCAS Failures. TCAS will automatically cease functioning if the input from the
aircraft’s barometric altimeter, radio altimeter, or transponder is lost.

6.12.1.1. NOTE: In some installations, the loss of information from other on-board systems such
as an inertial reference system (IRS) or attitude heading reference system (AHRS) may result in
a TCAS failure. Pilots should be aware of what particular types of aircraft system failures will
result in a failure of their TCAS.

6.12.2. Other System Limitations.

6.12.2.1 Some aircraft within 380 ft AGL or another nominal value may not be displayed. If
TCAS is able to determine an aircraft below this altitude is airborne, it is usually displayed.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             99

6.12.2.2. TCAS may not display all proximate, transponder-equipped aircraft in areas of high-
density traffic. Because of design limitations, the bearing displayed by TCAS is not sufficiently
accurate to support the initiation of horizontal maneuvers based solely on the traffic display.

6.12.2.3. Because of design limitations, TCAS will neither display nor give alerts against
intruders with a vertical speed in excess of 10,000 ft/min. In addition, the design implementation
may result in some short-term errors in the tracked vertical speed of a potential conflict during
periods of high vertical acceleration by the intruder.

6.12.2.4. Stall warnings, GPWS/TAWS warnings, and windshear warnings take precedence over
TCAS advisories. When either a GPWS/TAWS or windshear warning is active, TCAS aural
annunciations will be inhibited, and TCAS will automatically switch to the TA only mode of
operation. TCAS will remain in TA Only mode for 10 seconds after the GPWS/TAWS or
windshear warning is removed.

6.12.3. When TCAS Functions are Inhibited. Certain functions of TCAS are inhibited under the
following conditions:

6.12.3.1. Increase descent RAs are inhibited below 1450 (±100) ft AGL.

6.12.3.2. Descend RAs are inhibited below 1100 (± 100) ft AGL.

6.12.3.3. All RAs are inhibited below 1000 (± 100) ft.

6.12.3.4. All aural annunciations are inhibited below 500 (± 100) ft AGL. This includes the
aural annunciation for TAs.

6.12.3.5. In some aircraft types, the altitude and/or configuration may inhibit a climb and/or
increase climb RAs given. TCAS can still issue climb and increase climb RAs when operating at
the aircraft’s maximum altitude or certified ceiling. Responses to climb RAs while operating at
the maximum altitude or certified ceiling should be complied with in the normal manner.

6.12.3.5.1. NOTE. In some aircraft types, climb or increase climb RAs are never inhibited.

                                           Chapter 7

      COMMUNICATIONS, NAVIGATION, SURVEILLANCE (CNS)/AIR TRAFFIC
                         MANAGEMENT (ATM)

7.1. General Overview. CNS/ATM is an umbrella term that encompasses all the avionics
functions, including flight deck displays, which will enable the concept of Free Flight, a concept
where aircraft operators select paths, altitudes, and airspeeds in real time to maximize either
efficiency or mission timing. CNS/ATM describes the evolving requirements, enabling
technologies, and international harmonization efforts aimed at improving air traffic safety and
efficiency. Within DoD, CNS/ATM initiatives replace the GATM (Global Air Traffic
Management) effort to enable operational compliance with domestic and international civil
performance requirements in order to ensure continued global access to civil controlled airspace.
CNS/ATM modernization allows for greater airspace capacity and routing flexibility while
incorporating and improving upon safety enhancements. Failure to equip aircraft in line with
performance criteria mandates will result in delayed clearances, less than optimal routing, and
ultimately, restriction from airspace.

7.1.1. The purpose of this section is to provide a basic description of pertinent CNS/ATM
concepts and requirements and is based upon information provided at the following websites:

7.2. Communications.

7.2.1. 8.33 kHz VHF.

7.2.1.1. In the mid-1990’s, European agencies recognized that the radio frequency spectrum in
Europe was becoming too crowded. Increased demand for airspace and communications was
becoming a definite safety hazard. In response, on 7 Oct 99, 8.33 kHz channel spacing radio
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              101

communication equipment became mandatory in the ICAO EUR Region for aircraft operating
above FL 245. On 15 March 2007, this requirement was expanded to incorporate aircraft
operating above FL 195. Many European nations now require 8.33 kHz channel spacing to
enable operational improvements and airspace restructuring, increased airspace capacity, as well
as improved safety.

7.2.1.2. Where 8.33 kHz spacing has been adopted, no alternative 25 kHz frequency will be
published. Unless there is a specific exemption published elsewhere, the only non-8.33 kHz
aircraft permitted to fly in 8.33 kHz airspace are State aircraft with UHF radios where UHF
coverage is provided or special procedures are implemented. Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA)
implementing the 8.33 kHz channel spacing are expected to make appropriate arrangements for
the requirements of State aircraft operating as General Air Traffic (GAT) and unable to
communicate on the 8.33 kHz spaced channels.

7.2.1.3. ICAO encourages European States to maintain and/or to achieve sufficient UHF
coverage in the areas where the new channel spacing is introduced and to adapt their procedures
accordingly.

7.2.1.4. Transmissions at traditional 25 kHz spacing in an 8.33 kHz channel spacing
environment may not be received and will likely interfere with 8.33 kHz channel transmissions.

7.2.1.5. The emergency channel 121.5 MHz is not affected by the new channel spacing. Its
availability and use remain unchanged.

7.2.2. FM Immunity.

7.2.2.1. Until 1979, a buffer zone existed between FM radio stations and VHF
communication/navigation frequencies. Frequency congestion in Europe resulted in legacy VHF
communication/navigation receivers being susceptible to FM radio interference, making them
unreliable for IFR operations. Modifications to existing VOR and ILS receivers, new multi-
mode receivers (MMR), or approved operational workarounds are now required. The FM
spectrum is still protected in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). For more information,
see FLIP General Planning (GP) and Area Planning (AP) series.

7.2.3. Data Link.

7.2.3.1. Data link is simply the electric transmission of digital data between aircraft and/or a
ground station. Data link is an enabling technology to facilitate future air traffic management
(ATM) criteria. Data link is essential to enable performance-based operations, including the
provision of varying service levels to allow airspace users to equip based on varying need.

7.2.3.2. Future Air Navigation System (FANS-1/A) is a set of protocols and applications used
for Air Traffic Services (ATS) communication. FANS-1/A comprises Automatic Dependent
Surveillance (ADS), Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), and ATS Facilities
Notification (AFN) sent over ARINC 622-enhanced Aircraft Communications Addressing and
Reporting System (ACARS). The LINK 2000+ program is a European initiative to expand the
102                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

use of domestic data link capability across adjacent ATS providers (ATSP). It is likely that both
FANS and Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) will be accepted.

7.2.3.2.1. Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC). CPDLC is a data link
application that allows for the direct exchange of text-based messages between controller and
pilot, improving communication capabilities for en route, terminal, and oceanic areas. Apart
from the direct link, CPDLC adds a number of other benefits to the ATS system, to include:

7.2.3.2.1.1. Auto load of specific uplink messages into the flight management system (FMS)
reducing crew-input errors.

7.2.3.2.1.2. Downlink of a pilot route clearance requested for controller approval.

7.2.3.2.1.3. Specific uplink messages arm the FMS to automatically downlink a report when an
event, such as crossing a waypoint, occurs.

7.2.3.2.1.4 Specific downlink messages and the response to some uplink messages will
automatically update the flight data record in some ground systems.

7.2.3.2.2. VHF Data Link (VDL). VDL is the name given to the sub-network supporting data
communications that are sent over VHF frequencies. VDL Mode 0 (VDL-0) is currently used
for ACARS for airline control and ATS messages and may be used to transmit FANS-1/A data.
VDL-2 is designed to digitize VHF and approve the speed, or data rate, of the VHF link and will
probably be used within CONUS as an interim data link solution for enroute ATC functions.
VDL-3 is a future technology in development by the FAA for air-ground digital voice and data.

7.2.3.2.3. Satellite Communications (SATCOM). SATCOM supports aircraft communication in
oceanic and remote areas where typical line of sight communication systems are nonexistent.
SATCOM provides real-time pilot-to-controller communications and electronic message routing
that supports reduced separation oceanic tracks. Traditional methods of long-range
communication using HF (high frequency) radios are difficult and inefficient. With SATCOM,
users tap into a satellite network that provides worldwide, 24/7 coverage of digital voice and data
services. Air Force aircraft use the INMARSAT satellite services.

7.3. Navigation.

7.3.1. Performance-Based Navigation (PBN). PBN is an internationally-recognized concept
encompassing both Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP). As
described in the FAA’s Roadmap for Performance-Based Navigation, “PBN is a framework for
defining a navigation performance specification along a route, during a procedure, or in airspace
within which an aircraft must comply with specified operational performance requirements. It
provides a simple basis for the design and implementation of automated flight paths and for
airspace design, aircraft separation, and obstacle clearance. It also offers a straightforward
means to communicate the performance and operational capabilities necessary for the utilization
of such paths and airspace.” Through the implementation of RNAV and RNP performance
standards, PBN offers more flexible routings and reduced separation criteria to accommodate
increasing demands on airspace capacity while improving IFR capability into locations
previously constrained by terrain, noise abatement, high traffic density, and other limitations.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  103

7.3.2. Area Navigation (RNAV). RNAV is a method of navigation permitting aircraft operation
on any desired course within the coverage and capabilities of the aircraft onboard navigation
equipment. Increasingly, there will be greater dependence on the use of RNAV in lieu of routes
defined by ground-based navigation aids. The FAA has the goal to mandate RNAV by 2015 as
traditional ground based NAVAIDs are decommissioned. The RNAV concept incorporates
random RNAV routes, published RNAV routes, and RNAV departure, arrival, and approach
procedures. Specific guidance for conducting RNAV operations is included in AFM 11-217V1.
Furthermore, as mandated by civil standards within certain designated airspace, the aircraft
RNAV system must be capable of achieving specified levels of accuracy and functionality.
Referencing figure 7.1, when an RNAV type is specified for a specific procedure or airspace, the
aircraft RNAV system is required to maintain a track-keeping accuracy for the RNAV type for
95% of the flight time (e.g., RNAV 5 requires the aircraft to be able to maintain positional
accuracy within 5 miles of the desired track 95% of the time). Various RNAV designations may
also require certain operational standards, such as autopilot or flight director usage, database
management/certification processes, etc. Safety is assured through a combination of navigation
system accuracy, radar monitoring, and airspace buffers.

7.3.3. Required Navigation Performance (RNP). RNP is RNAV with on-board navigation
monitoring and alerting. This incorporates the concepts of containment region, containment
integrity, containment continuity, and database requirements as defined in the industry developed
“RNP RNAV” concept (RTCA DO-236B). Although it appears that neither the FAA nor ICAO
will adopt the term “RNP RNAV” per se, the concept of containment is the key factor
distinguishing RNP from RNAV. RNP may have additional functional requirements beyond
those of RNAV, e.g., alerting of the loss of RNP capability must occur in the flight crew’s
primary field of view. RNP avionics assume the ATS provider ensures their navigation
infrastructure meets desired performance requirements. However, since all ATS providers may
not provide identical performance from their navigation infrastructure, aircrews must ensure the
service provider’s existing infrastructure supports the desired RNP operation.

7.3.3.1. Containment Region. The containment region (see figure 7.1) for cross-track (cross-
track containment limit) is currently defined as twice the RNP value (e.g., for RNP-0.3 RNAV
the containment region is 0.6 NM). Future definitions are expected for along-track containment
and vertical containment.
                     Figure 7.1 RNAV accuracy vs. RNP containment.

7.3.3.2. Containment Integrity. Containment integrity is a measure of confidence that the
navigation system will not exceed the containment region without detecting and annunciating the
104                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

deviation to the crew. The probability that an aircraft will exceed the cross-track containment
limit without annunciation cannot exceed 10-5 per flight hour. In other words, containment
integrity assures a 99.999% probability per flight hour that the crew will be alerted when the
Total System Error (TSE) is greater than 2 x RNP. This performance assurance is intended to
facilitate the assessment of operational risk and safety for applications where ATC intervention
is not feasible or timely (e.g., instrument procedure).

7.3.3.3. Containment Continuity. Containment continuity is a measure of confidence that the
navigation system will satisfy containment integrity without unscheduled interruptions. This
includes actual annunciated loss of navigation capability, as well as false alarms. The probability
of an annunciated loss of RNP capability cannot exceed 10-4 per flight hour. In other words,
containment continuity assures a 99.99% probability per flight hour that an annunciated loss of
RNP—true or false alarm—will not occur.

7.3.3.4. Database requirements. Database requirements are concurrently mandated with
avionics hardware performance for compliance with RNP and P-RNAV airspace access.
Specifically, RNP-4 or more accurate navigational performance or P-RNAV (RNAV 1) require
databases from approved suppliers. The database is updated on a regular schedule and resides in
the flight management or mission computer, providing the reference information that is the basis
for executing the flight plan. The FAA and DoD have approved database suppliers. The
National Geospacial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has been designated as the primary supplier for
the DoD. Both the FAA and DoD reference RTCA DO-200A, Standard for Processing
Aeronautical Data and RTCA DO-201A, Standard for Aeronautical Information, to define the
processes and quality of the database content required to be provided by an approved database
supplier.

7.3.4. PBN Harmonization. Regional implementations of RNAV and RNP have resulted in a
lack of harmonization with respect to naming conventions, definitions, navigation specifications,
and functional requirements. As a result, some current RNP designations do not actually require
containment monitoring and alerting. Furthermore, various functional and operational
requirements create differences in airspace/procedures that go beyond the simple RNAV or RNP
type designation. Therefore, certification and approval to operate in more stringent PBN
airspace does not automatically qualify an aircraft to operate in less stringent PBN airspace.
Certification authorities and operators must reference the specific criteria for the airspace in
question in order to determine qualification to participate in that airspace. Recognizing this
divergence in standards, ICAO has begun a harmonization effort to ensure a common global
understanding of RNAV and RNP system functionality. The new published 2008 ICAO Doc
9613 was revised and renamed the Performance-Based Navigation Manual and explains the
global application of PBN. It is expected that ICAO will define the key distinction between
future applications of RNAV and RNP to be the requirement for on-board performance
monitoring and alerting. The following diagrams, taken from a presentation made by the ICAO
RNP Special Operational Requirements Study Group at the Thirtieth Meeting of the ICAO
Implementation Task Force, 12-16 March 2007, illustrate some expected outcomes.
                           Figure 7.2. Performance-Based Navigation

Table 7.1. Airspace RNP and RNAV Accuracy Requirements




7.3.5. Current PBN Implementations. The following paragraphs provide a brief description of
current implementations. There is no intent to address all functional and operational
requirements. As stated in the previous paragraph, certification authorities and operational
approval authorities must refer to respective source guidance for comprehensive specifications.
Air Force aviators should consult their MAJCOM guidance prior to flying RNAV/RNP
procedures.

7.3.5.1. RNP-10 has been designated in oceanic/remote areas where 50nm lateral separation
standards are applied (Pacific regions). RNP-10 does not require containment monitoring and
alerting. FAA Order 8400.12, Required Navigational Performance 10 (RNP-10) Operational
Approval, is a guide to RNP-10 aircraft and operator approval. Order 8400.12 does not address
communications or surveillance requirements that may be specified to operate on a particular
route or in a particular area. Those requirements are specified in documents such as
Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) and ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures
(Doc. 7030).

7.3.5.2. RNP-4 has been implemented on a trial basis in certain oceanic airspace (Pacific) where
30nm lateral and longitudinal separation standards (30/30) are being applied. RNP 4 approval
requires a number of functional and operational requirements, including use of CPDLC and
ADS-C. Civil standards are addressed in FAA Order 8400.33, Procedures for Obtaining
106                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

Authorization for Required Navigation Performance 4 (RNP-4) Oceanic and Remote Area
Operations.

7.3.5.3. Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace has been designated
in the North Atlantic (NAT) and northern Canada. Although MNPS predates the implementation
of RNP, it is consistent with the principles and is generally equivalent to RNP-12.6 (without the
requirement for containment monitoring and alerting). Civil requirements are addressed in AC
120-33, Operational Approval of Airborne Long-Range Navigation Systems for Flight Within the
North Atlantic Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications Airspace, as well as the NAT
MNPS Airspace Operations Manual which may be found at http://www.nat-pco.org/mnpsa.htm.

7.3.5.4. Basic RNAV (B-RNAV)/Precision RNAV (P-RNAV). Since 1998, Europe has
mandated a B-RNAV capability (equivalent to RNAV 5) for operations in European en route
airspace. More recently, certain European terminal airspace has been designated P-RNAV
(equivalent to RNAV 1). JAA AMJ 20X2 and JAA TGL 10 are the European source documents
for obtaining B-RNAV and P-RNAV approval, respectively. The FAA has incorporated these
requirements into AC 90-96A, Approval of U.S. Operators and Aircraft to Operate Under IFR in
Airspace Designated for B-RNAV and P-RNAV.

7.3.5.5. RNAV 1/RNAV 2. The FAA recently implemented RNAV 1 and RNAV 2 criteria
applicable to RNAV SIDS, RNAV STARS, and U.S. RNAV routes (Q-routes and T-routes), not
including over water RNAV routes or Alaska VOR/DME RNAV routes. These designations
replace the former Type A and B designations for DPs and SIDs. Civil standards for RNAV 1
and RNAV 2 are published in AC 90-100A, U.S. Terminal and En Route RNAV Operations.

7.3.5.6. Basic RNP. Within the NAS, standards are under development for Basic RNP which is
expected to encompass the previously defined “standard RNP levels” used for various RNAV
routes and procedures. The U.S. standard RNP Levels are 2.0 for en route and terminal area
operations, 1.0 for initial and intermediate approach segments, 0.3 for final approach segments,
and 1.0 for missed approach segments. The Basic RNP designation is expected to incorporate
the performance and functional characteristics of TSO-C129A (GPS) and TSO-C146A (WAAS)
systems with the implication that containment monitoring and alerting will be accomplished
through RAIM and/or CDI displacement.

7.3.5.7. RNP Special Aircraft and Aircrew Authorization Required (SAAAR) approach
procedures have been implemented in more challenging locations to leverage the advanced
capabilities of modern avionics and navigation systems. RNP SAAAR incorporates very
stringent reliability, performance, and operational standards, along with advanced capabilities
such as radius-to-fix legs, fixed radius turns, and time-of-arrival control, to create more efficient
and reliable approach and departure paths to lower minima. AC 90-101, Approval Guidance for
RNP Procedures with SAAAR, addresses civil standards for airworthiness and operational
approval.

7.3.6. Differential GPS (DGPS). DGPS is a term encompassing technologies that augment the
GPS signal by applying corrections for inherent GPS navigation system errors, such as
atmospheric error, multi-path error, ephemeris error, and clock error. DGPS has the potential to
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               107

enable precision GPS approaches equivalent to Cat I, II, and III ILS. DGPS systems use
precisely surveyed ground reference stations to receive and measure the accuracy of GPS signals,
then relay a correction back to the aircraft.

7.3.6.1. Satellite-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) use geosynchronous satellites to relay
corrections to aircraft equipped with the appropriate receiver and avionics. Therefore, SBAS
systems provide a larger coverage area. The FAA has implemented the Wide Area
Augmentation System (WAAS), which is an SBAS system, within the CONUS and Alaska.
Likewise, other regions throughout the world have plans for SBAS implementations in the near
term. TSO-C145A and TSO-C146A address the technical specifications for WAAS equipment,
and ACs 20-130A and 20-138A address airworthiness installation of the equipment.

7.3.6.2. Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS) use local VHF transmitters to relay
corrections to aircraft equipped with a compliant multi-mode receiver (MMR). GBAS provides
coverage for a more localized area, essentially within VHF radio range. GBAS technology could
potentially offer a relatively inexpensive and agile IFR approach capability for tactical situations.
The FAA is exploring implementation of GBAS via the Local Area Augmentation Systems
(LAAS) with trials being conducted at various locations. The DoD is exploring the development
of a Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS) as a potential GBAS implementation.

7.4. Surveillance.

7.4.1. CNS/ATM surveillance technologies include the Mode-S transponder, TCAS, and
Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS and ADS-Broadcast, ADS-B). Improved surveillance
enhances situational awareness for aircrew and air traffic control, collision avoidance, and
automatic position reporting. The Mode S is an evolutionary upgrade to the Air Traffic Control
Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS). Mode S is required in all TCAS II installations and in Europe
for military aircraft starting 2009

7.4.1.1. Mode S is based on an international standard for aircraft surveillance under the civilian
air traffic control (ATC) system. The costly utilization of primary ATC radar relies on radio
signal transmissions that are passively reflected back from the skin of the aircraft. Secondary
Surveillance Radar (SSR) interrogates aircraft transponders and processes the transponder
replies. The aircraft’s Mode 3/A code is displayed on the ATC SSR display. Mode C (altitude
reporting) enhances the controller’s vertical situational awareness through the aircraft’s
barometric altimeter reporting. Mode 3/A is commonly referred to as the 4096 code, because
there are only 4,096 combinations with the 4-digit code. Mode S provides a data link capability
for surveillance purposes (e.g., to communicate aircraft identification and flight parameters) and
an improved positional accuracy.

7.4.1.1.1. Mode S relies on a unique 24-bit address assigned to each aircraft. Civilian aircraft
have this address permanently installed so that the address is identified with that particular
aircraft throughout its service life (or until the aircraft changes state registry). Military Mode S
transponders allow aircrew or ground personnel to change the address on the aircraft to preserve
operational security of military aircraft. No two aircraft may have the same address. There are
two basic reasons for this. First, one feature of the beacon system is the ability to selectively
interrogate a particular aircraft. ATC can send an addressed message (via its data link capability)
108                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

directly to a specific aircraft based on its unique address. If more than one aircraft had the same
address, then a message cannot be sent to the single intended aircraft. Second, a unique Mode S
address allows the surveillance radar to separate targets that are close together (this is a problem
with the older ATCRBS). The ATCRBS may not be able to provide surveillance on two aircraft
within 2 miles of one another. The display to the Air Traffic Controller of the tracks for two
such aircraft may merge, be lost, or cross over identification.

7.4.1.1.2. In order for military aircraft to continue to use civil airspace throughout the world,
with military aircraft having the ability to change their Mode S address, it is imperative that the
loaded operational address is from an appropriate issuing authority ensuring a unique code for
each aircraft. ICAO has issued a block of Mode S addresses to the US. Within this block, the
FAA has issued the DoD a subset of addresses. An address for a US military aircraft is issued by
the DoD AIMS program office through HQ AFFSA/A3ON.

7.4.1.2. Surveillance is rapidly evolving into several levels of transmission formats. Basic
surveillance begins with an interrogation by ATC or by an aircraft’s acquisition squitter (if
TCAS equipped) followed by a reply from an aircraft receiving the interrogation. The reply is a
stream of data, the extent of which depends on the target aircraft’s equipage and can include
Mode C altitude, Mode S address, vertical rate status, and max speed. ATC merges this
information with primary radar data to create a situational awareness picture for ground
controllers.

7.4.1.2.1. Mode S European Elementary Surveillance (ELS) takes basic surveillance and
expands it to include additional information such as data link capability report, aircraft
identification, and TCAS/ACAS active resolution advisory report. As the name implies this is
only being implemented within the European Union. ELS uses this unique 24-bit aircraft
address for selective interrogation and to acquire down-linked aircraft identification. Among
other attributes associated with ELS is the ability to acquire altitude in 25 foot increments.

7.4.1.2.2. Mode S European Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) consists of ELS supplemented by the
extraction of Downlink Aircraft Parameters (DAPs) for use in the air traffic management (ATM)
systems. These parameters include vertical intent, track turn, heading and speed reports. Some
parameters are for display to the controller and others are for ATM system function
enhancements. EHS allows for improved situational awareness and eases congestion, thus
enhancing safety and capacity. It will help to reduce the increasing amount of altitude deviations
and improve the performance of other safety net tools. EHS is only being implemented in a
limited number of states within the European Union.

7.4.1.2.3. Aircraft Identification. The reporting of Aircraft Identification (or Flight ID) is an
ICAO requirement for Mode S, level 2 and above, transponders. It permits direct radar
identification by a controller and has the capability to relieve the shortage of Mode 3/A codes.
Correct setting of Flight ID (entered by the aircrew in the cockpit) is also essential for the
correlation of radar tracks with flight plan data in ATM system. Aircraft ID will be identical to
the designation entered by the aircrew on the flight plan.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 109

7.4.1.3. Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) provides for the automatic exchange of
aircraft position, intent and flight data by data link from the aircraft to the ATC facility without
pilot interaction.

7.4.1.3.1. Automatic—periodically transmits information with no pilot or operator input
required. Information includes identification, position or other flight plan-related data of a given
aircraft.

7.4.1.3.2. Dependent—position and velocity vector are derived from the aircraft’s GPS or FMS.

7.4.1.3.3. Surveillance—a method of determining position of specific aircraft, vehicles or other
asset.

7.4.1.4. Automatic Dependent Surveillance Contract (ADS-C). ADS-C (previously referred to
as ADS-Address, ADS-A in the US) transmits surveillance information to a location for use by
ATC. After connectivity is established, the controller can use the link to obtain aircraft position
data either on demand (send the requested data now), periodically (send every x minutes), or
event-driven (send it when an altitude, waypoint, vertical speed, or cross-track error threshold is
exceeded). Methods of ADS-C transmission may include High Frequency Data Link (HFDL),
SATCOM, ACARS, and VDL-2.

7.4.1.5. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B).

7.4.1.5.1. ADS-B equipped aircraft broadcast surveillance data that may include position, data
integrity information, velocity and other flight information. There are two primary ADS-B links
in the US—1090 MHz Mode S Extended Squitter (1090 ES) and the 787 MHz Universal Access
Transceiver (UAT). To help manage the frequency spectrum, the FAA will allow both links to
be developed and rely on ground rebroadcast stations to translate between the two. ADS-B
provides coverage at low altitudes and on the ground. It can be used to monitor traffic on the
taxiways and runways of an airport. Additionally, it is effective in remote areas and in
mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage, or where radar coverage is limited. Other
applications may include enhanced visual traffic acquisition, situational awareness, ground
operations, in-trail climb and descent, and decreased final approach spacing.

7.4.1.5.2. Both ADS-A/C and ADS-B data is received by ATC through a two-step process.
First, the data is transmitted to a ground station, and then it travels by telephone or Internet to the
intended receiver. Additionally, data goes through the two-step process for ATC and operations
centers, but it can also be received air-to-air by nearby aircraft if they carry the proper ADS-B
avionics.

7.4.1.6. Third Party Surveillance relies on some external sensor to gather traffic information
which is transmitted to aircraft requesting this information.

7.4.1.6.1. Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS). JTIDS is one form of third
party surveillance already in use by the military. This data link system allows both airborne and
ground assets to transmit and receive information. By sharing information, an expanded, more
complete picture is developed and available to use by all that are able to connect to the system.
110                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

7.4.1.6.2. Traffic Information Service (TIS) provides transmission of ground-based derived
traffic information to an aircraft. TIS is an alerting service providing automatic traffic advisories
from a Mode S sensor to a requesting Mode S-equipped aircraft. The information is tailored to
the requesting aircraft to up-link the closest intruders with each scan. The TIS service is intended
to improve the pilot’s ability to visually see other traffic in the air and on the airport surface so
that pilots can more effectively apply traditional “see-and-avoid” techniques. The information
provided on other traffic is NOT intended to be used as a collision avoidance system and does
NOT relieve the pilot of the responsibility to "see-and-avoid" other aircraft.

7.4.1.6.3. Traffic Information Service—Broadcast (TIS-B) is a ground-based surveillance
service using the ADS-B format. The purpose of TIS-B is to provide ADS-B transmissions for
aircraft that are not ADS-B equipped. Positional data from ground radars is broadcasted using
the ADS-B format and frequencies.

7.4.1.6.4. Traffic Information Service—Re-Broadcast (ADS-R). ADS-R is provided by a
ground station. Its purpose is to translate between the two ADS-B links authorized in the United
States (1090ES and UAT). A broadcast from a UAT equipped aircraft received on the ground is
re-broadcast as a 1090ES ADS-B message. Similarly, a 1090ES broadcast from an aircraft is
rebroadcast as a UAT ADS-B message. This allows full use on ADS-B in air-to-air applications
in a mixed equipage environment.

7.5. CNS/ATM Compliance. USAF aircraft modernization programs must meet performance
requirements based upon the civil directives. Certification and approval of CNS/ATM upgrades
must be made in accordance with AFPD 63-13 “Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air
Traffic Management and Navigation Safety Performance for USAF Aircraft”, and AFI 63-1301,
“Assurance of Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic management and
Navigation Safety Performance”.

                                  AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS

8.1. Pressure Instruments.

8.1.1. Pitot and Static Systems. Altitude, speed, and vertical velocity are measured by sensing
the pressures surrounding an aircraft. These pressures are furnished either directly to the
instruments or to a central air data computer (CADC) by the pitot and static systems.

8.1.1.1. Pitot pressure, or impact air pressure, is taken through the open-end pitot tube that is
pointed directly into the relative wind flowing around the aircraft. The pitot tube provides the
information to the airspeed indicator.

8.1.1.2. Static pressure is measured at a flush port where the air is not disturbed. The ports are
in a location shown by flight tests to be in undisturbed air. They are normally paired, one on
either side of the aircraft. This prevents lateral movement of the aircraft from giving erroneous
static pressure indications. The static ports provide information to the altimeter, airspeed
indicator, and vertical speed indicator (also referred to as a vertical velocity indicator or VVI).

8.1.2. Pitot and Static Sensing Errors. Both the pitot and static systems have inherent
characteristics that affect the pressures being supplied to the instruments.

8.1.2.1. Position Error. This error is sometimes referred to as “installation error” and is the
result of erroneous static pressure being supplied from the static port or ports. In the design of
aircraft, engineers attempt to place the static port (or ports) in locations where, under most flight
operations, the air pressure being sensed is being provided by undisturbed free-flowing air.
However, under some flight conditions and/or configurations, (e.g., at high angles of attack with
the landing gear and flaps down) the air around the static port may become disturbed enough to
cause errors in the instruments that require static input, primarily airspeed, mach, and altitude
indications. Although the vertical velocity indicator will initially show a pressure change, it is
not appreciably affected and stabilizes with the proper indication relatively quickly. The
amount and direction of this error is determined by flight test and is found in the performance
section of the aircraft flight manual.

8.1.2.2. Compressibility Error.

8.1.2.2.1. For simplicity of design, the airspeed indicator is built to operate in air that is
incompressible. Since air is compressible, the error introduced is called compressibility error.
The error is zero at sea level density, regardless of airspeed, and increases with altitude as
density decreases. It is negligible below 10,000 feet and 250 knots calibrated airspeed (CAS).
Above sea level, CAS is always equal to or greater than equivalent airspeed. To correct for
compressibility error, refer to the performance data in the aircraft flight manual or apply the “F”
factor found on most dead reckoning (DR) computers (see figure 8.1). The error applies only to
standard airspeed indicators that are calibrated by the manufacturer to read correctly at sea level
112                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

conditions. It does not apply to mach or true airspeed indicators since compressibility is factored
into the calibration of those indicators.



                Figure 8.1. Correction for Compressibility on DR Computer.




8.1.2.2.2. It is important that the appropriate altimeter position error correction be applied to
ensure the aircraft is flying the proper attitude or flight level. The direction (positive or negative)
of this error is found in the performance charts and it is critical for the aircrew to understand
whether the correction value to be applied should be added or subtracted from the altimeter
readout. For example, if your aircraft has an error of - 1,500 feet when cruising at FL250, you
should fly at an indicated altitude of FL 235 because of installation error. This error must be
applied whether flying IFR or VFR to ensure proper altitude separation between aircraft.

8.1.2.2.2.1. NOTE: Altimeter corrections for installation error are not required on aircraft
equipped with a servo/pneumatic AIMS system unless operating in the standby mode.

8.1.2.3. Reversal Error. This error is caused by a momentary static pressure change when the
aircraft pitch attitude is changed.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                 113

8.1.2.3.1. Rotation. When an aircraft is rotated for takeoff, the instruments may indicate a
temporary descent and loss of altitude and airspeed due to a momentary higher pressure being
sensed by the static system. The effects of this error can be minimized by smooth pitch changes.

8.1.2.3.2. Power. When power (collective) is applied for helicopter takeoff, the instruments may
indicate a temporary descent and loss of altitude due to a momentary higher pressure being
sensed by the static system. The effects of this error can be reduced by smooth power inputs.

8.1.3. Alternate Static System.

8.1.3.1. With Alternate System. An alternate static system is provided in some aircraft in the
event the normal system fails or becomes obstructed (e.g., icing). The alternate static ports are
usually located at a point within the airframe that is not susceptible to contamination by outside
sources. There is normally a pressure difference between the alternate and normal systems that
will change the indications of airspeed, mach, and altitude. If the amount and direction of this
error is not available in the flight manual, you should familiarize yourself with the differences in
cruise, letdown, and especially the approach configurations.

8.1.3.2. Without Alternate System. For aircraft that do not have an alternate static system,
consult your flight manual. Here are other actions that you may want to consider:

8.1.3.2.1. Icing. If the failure is due to icing, use the attitude indicator as the primary reference
and establish a known power setting. (Check angle of attack). Depart the icing conditions as
soon as possible.

8.1.3.2.2. Making an Alternate System. If an alternate static source is not available, you can
make one in the cockpit by gently breaking the glass seal of any non-electric differential pressure
instrument, such as the VVI, altimeter, airspeed indicator, mach indicator, etc. Select one that is
not mandatory for recovery (e.g., mach indicator). If it becomes necessary to use an alternate
static source, don’t forget that you will have to depressurize the cockpit. You may, as a result,
have to descend to comply with oxygen requirements in AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight
Rules.

8.1.3.2.2.1. NOTE: When using an alternate static source, indicated readings may be higher than
actual due to the venturi effect. The direction and magnitude of the error will vary with type of
aircraft.

8.1.4. Central Air Data Computer (CADC). Many aircraft use electrically operated vertical tape
instruments as well as electrically driven round dial counter-drum-pointer altimeters. To provide
the necessary electrical signals to drive these instruments, a CADC or an altitude computer is
used. These computers often correct instrument displays for positional and scale errors.

8.1.4.1. CAUTION: Failure of instrument components receiving inputs from a CADC can result
in the display of erroneous information without an accompanying warning flag or light.

8.1.5. Altimeter and Altitude Measurement.
114                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

8.1.5.1. Barometric Altimeter. There are many ways to measure the altitude of an aircraft;
probably the simplest is with a barometric altimeter. The pressure of the Earth’s atmosphere
decreases as height above the Earth increases. If this pressure difference is measured by some
mechanical means, it can be directly related to height in feet, meters, or other linear
measurement. The height at which a particular pressure is sensed varies with atmospheric
conditions.

8.1.5.2. Atmosphere Chart. A standard atmosphere chart provides a reference for altitude
measurement. Barometric altimeters are designed to display altitude relative to the pressure
difference shown on the chart. For example, if the barometric scale is referenced to 29.92” Hg
(sea level, standard conditions) and the instrument is supplied with a static pressure of 20.58” Hg
(pressure at 10,000 feet, standard conditions), the altimeter should indicate 10,000 feet. The
pressure difference between the sea level and 10,000 feet on a standard day is 9.34 inches of
mercury. Any time the altimeter senses this pressure difference between the barometric scale
setting and the actual static pressure supplied to the instrument, it will indicate 10,000 feet.
Since the actual height of these standard pressure levels varies with atmospheric conditions, the
altimeter rarely indicates a true height. This does not cause any aircraft separation problem for
ATC purposes since all aircraft flying in the same area are similarly affected. However, under
certain conditions, terrain clearance can be a very real problem.
                                       Figure 8.2. Altimeters.




8.1.5.3. Altimeter Errors. Although the altimeter is designed to very close tolerances, there are
inherent errors that may affect its accuracy. These are:

8.1.5.3.1. Temperature Error. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitude (the
aircrafts actual altitude MSL) under International Standard Atmospheric (ISA) conditions. Any
deviation from the standard temperature (or pressure) will result in an error induced into the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               115

altimeter. When the air is warmer than standard, the aircraft is actually higher than the altimeter
indicates. Likewise, when the air is colder than standard, the aircraft is lower than is actually
being indicated on the altimeter. How much higher or lower from actual versus indicated
altitude is determined by the magnitude of the temperature deviation from standard and
proportional to the height of the aircraft above the altimeter setting source. The amount of error
is approximately 4 feet per thousand feet for each degree Celsius (from ISA). With regards to
terrain or obstruction clearance, warmer than standard temperatures are not a factor. However,
when operating in extreme cold conditions, it is important that the pilot compensate for the
reduction in terrain or obstruction clearance (e.g. when conducting an instrument approach) by
adding a cold temperature correction. When conducting an instrument approach, mandatory
procedures for applying cold temperature corrections is outlined in AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
General Flight Rules. The correction table along with an example is found in Section D of the
Flight Information Handbook (FIH).

8.1.5.3.2. Scale Error. This error is caused by the aneroids not assuming the precise size
designed for a particular pressure difference. It is irregular throughout the range of the
instrument; that is, it might be -30 feet at 1,000 feet and +50 feet at 10,000 feet. The tolerances
for this error become larger as the measured altitude is increased. At 40,000 feet an error of
±200 feet would be considered within tolerance. The amount of scale error actually encountered
varies with each altimeter. Instrument maintenance personnel calibrate the altimeter prior to
installation. No aircrew action is required.

8.1.5.3.3. Friction Error. This error is caused by friction in the moving parts of mechanical
altimeters and causes lags in instrument indications. Usually, natural vibrations will resolve
friction error in reciprocating engine aircraft. Jet engine aircraft usually have instrument panel
vibrators installed to eliminate this error. If the vibrator is inoperative, lightly tapping the
instrument at certain intervals may be necessary. These intervals must be determined by the
proximity of the aircraft to minimum altitudes. There is an internal vibrator installed in counter-
pointer and counter-drum-pointer altimeters. When operating in the non-electrical mode with the
internal vibrator inoperative, the 100-foot pointer has been known to ‘‘hang up.”

8.1.5.3.4. Mechanical Error. This error is caused by misalignment or slippage in the gears or
linkage connecting the aneroids to the pointers or in the shaft of the barometric set knob. It is
checked by the altimeter setting procedure during the instrument cockpit check.

8.1.5.3.5. Hysteresis Error. This error is a lag in the altitude indications caused by the elastic
properties of the materials used in the aneroids. It occurs after an aircraft has maintained a
constant altitude for a period of time and then makes a large, rapid altitude change. The lag in
indication occurs because it takes time for the aneroids to “catch up” to the new pressure
environment. This error has been significantly reduced in modern altimeters and is considered
negligible (less than 100 feet) at normal rates of descent for jet aircraft (4,000-6,000 fpm).

8.1.5.4. Altimeter Settings.

8.1.5.4.1. There are three different altimeter settings (QNH, QFE, and QNE, see figures 8.3 and
8.4) referenced in FLIP and it is important to understand the different settings, how each are
derived, and what information is being indicated.
116                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009




                                 Figure 8.3. Altimeter Settings.




8.1.5.4.1.1. QNH Altimeter Setting. Set QNH when descending through and operating below
the transition level. This setting is obtained by measuring the existing surface pressure and
converting it to a pressure that would theoretically exist at sea level at that point. This is
accomplished by adding the pressure change for elevation above sea level on a standard day. To
illustrate this, consider an airport with an elevation of 1,000 feet (standard atmospheric value
28.86) and an actual observed surface pressure of 29.32 inches of mercury that is a pressure
altitude variation (PAV) of 0.46 inches or 432 feet. To obtain the QNH altimeter setting, the
pressure differential of 1.06” Hg (29.92”-28.86”) is added to the observed surface pressure
(29.32” + 1.06”) resulting in an altimeter setting of 30.38” Hg. Theoretically, the altimeter will
indicate 1,000 feet when 30.38” is set on the barometric scale. The QNH altimeter setting is
usually standard throughout most of the world; however, some nations may report QFE. It is
very important that the aircrew understand which altimeter setting (QNH or QFE) is being
reported and should be used.

8.1.5.4.1.2. QFE Altimeter Setting. This setting is the actual surface pressure and is not
corrected to sea level. Using the previous example, if 29.32 inches of mercury were set on the
barometric scale, the altimeter would indicate zero feet although field elevation is 1,000 feet.
This is because there is no pressure difference between the altimeter reference on the barometric
scale and the existing surface pressure that is sensed by the static system. The QNH altimeter
setting result in the altimeter indicating height above MSL, while QFE altimeter setting results in
the altimeter indicating height above field elevation.

8.1.5.4.1.3. QNE Altimeter Setting. Set QNE when operating at, climbing through, or operating
above the transition altitude. This setting is always 29.92 inches of mercury and results in the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              117

altimeter indicating height above the standard datum plane or pressure altitude. This altimeter
setting is used at and above transition altitude. Many nations use this altimeter setting for all
flights above a specific transition altitude. In these cases, the minimum en route altitude for
airways is based on the lowest barometric pressures ever recorded and obstacle height.

8.1.5.4.2 NOTE: Altimeter setting accuracy varies with the distance from where the surface
pressure is measured and is considered reliable only when in the vicinity of where it was
measured. Local pressure disturbances from wind flow around large buildings may also affect
the accuracy of the altimeter. Both QNH and QFE settings may be reported in millibars or
hectopascals (one millibar is equivalent to one hectopascal) of pressure rather than inches of
mercury. You must then correct this setting to inches of mercury using the conversion tables
found in FLIP.
                                 Figure 8.4. Types of Altitude.




8.1.5.5. Types of Altitude.

8.1.5.5.1. Absolute Altitude. The altitude above the terrain directly below the aircraft.

8.1.5.5.2. Pressure Altitude. The altitude above the standard datum plane (SDP). SDP is the
pressure plane where air pressure is 29.92” Hg, corrected to plus 15°C.

8.1.5.5.3. Density Altitude. The pressure altitude corrected for temperature. Pressure and
density altitudes are the same when conditions are standard (refer to standard atmosphere table).
As the temperature rises above standard, the density of the air decreases resulting in an increase
in density altitude.

8.1.5.5.7. Flight Level. A surface of constant atmospheric pressure related to the SDP. In
practice, it is calibrated altitude with 29.92’ Hg reference on the barometric scale.

8.1.6. Speed Measurement.

8.1.6.1. Airspeed measurements are a comparison of pitot (ram) pressure to static (ambient)
pressure. The difference between these two pressures is differential (dynamic) pressure. The
airspeed indicator measures this dynamic pressure by supplying pitot pressure to a flexible
metallic diaphragm and static pressure to the airtight chamber that surrounds the diaphragm.
                             Figure 8.5. Airspeed Measurement.




8.1.6.2 When the pitot system is blocked by something, such as ice, the ram pressure is trapped
and the static pressure is not, the airspeed indicator then acts as an altimeter. As the aircraft
climbs, airspeed indications increase. On most supersonic aircraft, the static source is located on
the pitot boom, so if the boom ices over, probably both systems are blocked. In this case the
airspeed will remain constant, indicating the speed it had when blockage occurred. On subsonic
aircraft the static ports are usually located somewhere on the aircraft not significantly influenced
by the airstream. If the static source is blocked and the pitot boom is not, the airspeed will
decrease as the aircraft climbs. This situation is possible even with the pitot heat operating, since
most aircraft do not have static port heaters. Many aircraft have an alternate static source located
in the cockpit for this occurrence.

8.1.6.3. The most important action you should take if you suspect an airspeed error is to
establish a known pitch attitude and power setting, then consult your flight manual. Other
actions you may consider taking include ensuring your pitot heat is on. If it is on, recheck the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               119

circuit breakers. Check the attitude indicator against the standby attitude indicator or against the
other pilot’s attitude indicator. Crosscheck the angle of attack indicator (if available).

8.1.6.4. Types of Airspeed.

8.1.6.4.1. Indicated Airspeed (IAS). The airspeed displayed by the airspeed indicator. (This
airspeed is uncorrected for all errors associated with airspeed measurement.)

8.1.6.4.2. Calibrated Airspeed (CAS). The indicated airspeed corrected for installation error.

8.1.6.4.3. Equivalent Airspeed (EAS). Calibrated airspeed is corrected for the effects of

8.1.6.4.4. True Airspeed (TAS). The equivalent airspeed corrected for air density.

8.1.6.4.5. Groundspeed (GS). The true airspeed corrected for wind.

8.1.6.4.6. Indicated Mach Number (IMN). The Mach number displayed on the mach indicator.

8.1.6.4.7. True Mach Number (TMN). The indicated Mach number corrected for installation
error.

8.1.6.5. NOTE: Depending on your aircraft’s instrumentation; calibrated, equivalent, and true
mach numbers may be determined by referring to the performance data section of your aircraft’s
flight manual.

8.1.7. Vertical Velocity Measurement.

8.1.7.1. VVIs use “rate of change of static pressure” for measuring vertical rate. The rate of
change of static pressure is obtained by supplying static pressure directly to a thin metallic
diaphragm and through a calibrated orifice to an airtight case surrounding the diaphragm. As the
aircraft climbs from level flight, the static pressure in the case is momentarily “trapped” by the
calibrated orifice and the static pressure in the diaphragm is allowed to decrease immediately.
This decrease causes the diaphragm to contract and, through a mechanical linkage, the pointer
indicates a climb. In a descent, the opposite is true. Case static pressure is momentarily
“trapped” at the lower static pressure while the diaphragm expands because of the higher static
pressure. This expansion causes the pointer to indicate a descent. Because of this “delay” or
“lag” caused by the calibrated orifice, it may require up to 9 seconds for indications to stabilize.
However, due to the fact that the needle will point in the proper direction immediately, trend
information is available. Many of the “instantaneous” types of indicators use either a pitch gyro
signal or an accelerometer signal for the initial indication and then stabilize the indication with
barometric information.

8.2. AIMS.

8.2.1. Components of AIMS. Aims is an acronym for:

8.2.1.1. Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS)

8.2.1.2. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)

8.2.1.3. Mark XII Identification

8.2.1.4. AIMS is a system that provides altitude reporting and several selective identification
features. The equipment is capable of automatically reporting a coded altitude and aircraft
identification signal to ground stations upon interrogation. This information provides selective
identification and altitude readout for control of air traffic. Two types of AIMS systems
presently being used in Air Force aircraft are the servo/pneumatic system and the altitude
encoder system. Consult your flight manual for a description of the system utilized in your
aircraft.

8.2.2. Servo/Pneumatic AIMS System.

8.2.2.1. Components. The servo/pneumatic type system generally consists of an IFF and
selective identification feature (IFF/SIF) transponder, precision pressure altimeter, servo-
mechanism, altitude computer, controls, and other associated equipment. In this system, pitot
and static pressures are provided to an altitude computer that is designed to apply a correction for
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  121

installation error. The computer supplies calibrated altitude information to the transponder for
altitude reporting and to the servoed altimeter for display to the pilot.

8.2.2.2. Modes. The AAU-19 servo/pneumatic counter-drum-pointer altimeter has two modes
of operation: the primary or servoed mode (reset) and the secondary or nonservoed mode
(standby). In the primary (servoed) mode, the altimeter displays calibrated altitude. The
installation error correction is applied to the barometric altitude by a servo-mechanism using
electrical signals supplied by the altitude computer. A secondary (nonservoed) mode is provided
in the event of malfunction. The altimeter display then operates directly from static air pressure,
and the appropriate altimeter installation error correction must be applied to ensure the aircraft is
at the proper altitude. As long as the altitude computer is operating properly, it will supply an
altitude reporting signal to the air traffic control radars, regardless of the mode displayed on the
pilot’s altimeter.

8.2.3. Altitude Encoder AIMS System. The altitude encoder type system is found in aircraft
with small or negligible installation error. It generally consists of an IFF/SIF transponder,
precision pressure altimeter and an altitude encoder. In this system, the altimeter and altitude
encoder are a single unit. The encoder portion of the unit simply takes the barometric altitude
measured by the altimeter and converts it to signals for altitude reporting. The appropriate
altimeter installation error correction must be applied at all times to ensure the aircraft is at the
proper altitude.

8.2.3.1. Altitude Reporting. AIMS systems report altitude based on the standard datum plane
(29.92” Hg), regardless of the value set in the altimeter barometric scale. When aircraft are
flying below the lowest usable flight level, ground station computers automatically apply the
local altimeter setting to display accurate altitude to the air traffic controller. In order for cockpit
altimeters to reflect the correct altitude as displayed to the controller, the proper value must be
set in the altimeter barometric scale.

8.2.3.2. NOTE: “Code of P’ and “standby” flags on AIMS altimeters do not always mean that
altitude reporting has been lost. If a warning flag appears, verify that your altitude is being
reported to the air traffic controller.

8.2.4. Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS). ARTS is designed to provide controllers
with an alphanumeric display of aircraft identification and groundspeed on aircraft equipped with
transponders, along with altitude readout on those aircraft capable of automatic altitude reporting
(Mode C). This information is displayed on the controller’s radar display as a data block in
addition to the “primary” traffic target return. ARTS is installed at many, but not all, terminal
areas.

8.2.4.1. Advantages. ARTS equipment has simplified coordination with the terminal ATC
facilities and significantly reduced the pilot and controller radio calls. This reduction in
communications allows the controller to concentrate more attention on control decisions and
planning.

8.2.4.2 Flight Considerations. While the FAA has provided automated ground equipment, the
benefit to individual aircraft operation is dependent on the status of the airborne transponder
equipment. The following are recommendations to assist pilots in obtaining optimum use of
transponder equipment.

8.2.4.2.1. Aircraft with Transponders. Aircraft with transponders having altitude reporting
capability should have them turned on before takeoff and contacting departure or approach
control.

8.2.4.2.2. Discrete Code. When you are assigned a discrete code (four digits) and you are not
sure of the number, ask for a repeat. It is important to dial the correct code as it is a discrete code
specified for your aircraft alone. If you dial the wrong code, there is a chance that it has already
been assigned to another aircraft. The computer cannot distinguish between two aircraft on the
same code in the same radar coverage area.

8.2.4.2.2.1. NOTE: Squawking a four-digit code does not supply the ground equipment with
altitude readout. Altitude reporting is a separate function and must be specifically selected on
the transponder.

8.2.4.2.3. Beacon Code. When dialing in the assigned beacon code, delay in the selection of
each digit of the assigned beacon code can result in the transmission and recognition by the
computer of a code assigned to a different aircraft. As noted above, the computer cannot
distinguish between two aircraft on the same code in the same radar coverage area. Consistent
with safe aircraft control, avoid hesitating between the selection of each digit. As a technique,
the pilot or aircrew member can momentarily switch the transponder to “standby,” change the
beacon code, and then turn back to the transmit.

8.2.4.2.4. Automatic Altitude. For controllers to use your automatic altitude report, they must
first verify your altitude. In order to use the automatic altitude data, it must not have an error of
300 feet or more of the pilot’s reported altitude. Actual altitude reports will permit the controller
to verify the automated altitude report transmitted by your transponder. (There are several ways
the controller can verify altitude without directly asking you; therefore, you are not always aware
that your altitude has been verified).

8.3. Attitude Instruments.

8.3.1. Attitude Indicator. This indicator provides you with a substitute for the Earth’s horizon to
maintain a desired aircraft attitude during instrument flight. This is accomplished by displaying
an attitude sphere positioned by a self-contained gyro, remote gyros, or an inertial platform. The
figures represented below represent typical attitude indicators.
Figure 8.7. Three-Axis Attitude Director Indicator (ADI).
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              123




8.3.1.1. Precession. To serve as an attitude reference, the gyroscope spin axis must remain
aligned with relation to the Earth’s surface. Any movement (real or apparent) of the spin axis is
called:

8.3.1.1.1. Apparent Precession. As the Earth rotates or as a gyro is flown from one position on
the Earth to another, the spin axis remains fixed in space. However, to an observer on the
surface of the Earth, the spin axis appears to change its orientation in space. Either the Earth’s
rotation (Earth rate precession) or transportation of the gyro from one geographical fix to another
(Earth transport precession) may cause apparent precession.

8.3.1.1.2. Real Precession. Movement of the gyro spin axis from its original alignment in space
is real precession. It is caused by a force applied to the spin axis. This force may be
unintentional force such as rotor imbalance or bearing friction, or an intentional force applied by
the erection mechanism or torque motor.

8.3.1.1.3. Erection Mechanisms. The erection mechanisms compensate for precession by
keeping the gyros aligned with the Earth’s surface.
Figure 8.8. Precession of Gyroscope Resulting from Applied Deflective Force.

8.3.2. Turn and Slip Indicator. The principal functions of the turn and slip indicator (see Figure
8.9) are to provide an alternate source of bank control and to indicate a need to correct, if
required, for a yaw trim. One needle-width deflection on the turn indicator provides for a 360°
turn in either 2 minutes (3°/sec) for a 2-minute indicator, or 4 minutes (1½°/sec) for a 4-minute
indicator.

8.3.2.1. NOTE: A standard-rate turn is 3° per second and a half standard-rate turn is 1½° per
second.




                             Figure 8.9. Turn and Slip Indicators.




8.4. Heading Systems.

8.4.1. Heading Information. Heading information is usually obtained by using the Earth’s
magnetic lines of force. The magnetic compass is a self-contained instrument that operates
independently of the electrical system and converts these magnetic lines of force to aircraft
heading information. Other heading systems require electrical power to convert the magnetic
lines of force to aircraft heading.

8.4.2. Basic Operation of Magnetic Compass. The magnetic field that surrounds the earth
consists of invisible lines of flux. These lines leave the surface of the earth at the magnetic north
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               125

pole and reenter at the magnetic South Pole. The Earth’s magnetic north pole does not actually
coincide with the geographic North Pole, but is located at a position that approximates 200 nm
north of Resolute Bay, Canada. Also, the location tends to move within the confines of a
magnetic polar area several hundred miles in diameter. Thus, there is actually no exact position
of the magnetic North Pole. These lines of magnetic flux have two important characteristics:
any magnet that is free to rotate will align with them, and an electrical current is induced into any
conductor that cuts across them. Most magnetic direction indicators installed in an aircraft make
use of one or both of these two characteristics. One of the oldest and simplest instruments for
indicating direction is the magnetic, or “whiskey” compass. An aircraft magnetic compass has
two small magnets attached to a metal float sealed inside a bowl of clear compass fluid similar to
kerosene. A graduated compass card marked with the four cardinal directions of the compass
(N, S, E, and W) as well as smaller increments, is wrapped around the float and viewed through a
glass window with a lubber line across it. The float and card assembly has a hardened steel
pivot in its center that rides inside a special, spring-loaded, hard-glass jewel cup. The buoyancy
of the float takes most of the weight off the pivot, and the fluid damps the oscillation of the float
and card. This jewel-and-pivot type mounting allows the float to freely rotate and tilt up to
approximately 18° angle of bank. At steeper bank angles, the compass indications may become
erratic and unpredictable.

8.4.2.1. Variation. Variation is the difference between true and magnetic direction. Maps and
charts are drawn using meridians of longitude that pass through the geographic poles. Directions
measured from the geographic poles are called “true” directions. Directions measured from the
magnetic poles are called “magnetic” directions. Isogonic lines (see Figure 8.10) are lines of
equal variation traced on the surface of the globe. They connect places at which the deviation of
the magnetic needle from true north is the same. The line that passes near Chicago is called the
agonic line, and anywhere along this line the two poles are aligned, and there is no variation.
East of this line, the magnetic pole is to the west of the geographic pole and a correction must be
applied to a compass indication to get a true direction. West of this line, the magnetic pole is to
the east of the geographic pole and a correction must be applied as well. Add west variation to
the true course to obtain the magnetic course. Subtract east variation to the true course to obtain
the magnetic course. Variation does not change with the heading of the aircraft; it is the same
anywhere along the isogonic line.
                                   Figure 8.10. Isogonic Lines.
126                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009




8.4.2.2. Deviation. Deviation is an error in the magnetic heading introduced by production of
local magnetic fields. Electrical currents flowing in the structure of the aircraft induce localized
magnetic fields that can cause deviation in the magnetic compass. Localized magnetic fields
outside the aircraft can induce deviation errors as well. Whereas variation error cannot be
reduced or changed, deviation error can be minimized by calibrating the magnetic compass to
compensate for known localized magnetic fields within the aircraft. This is a maintenance task
known as a “compass swing”. Most airports have a compass rose, which is a series of precisely
aligned lines drawn in an area of the airport where there is no magnetic interference. By aligning
the aircraft with the known magnetic headings, maintenance personnel can calibrate the magnetic
compass. The compass correction card shows the amount of deviation on various compass
headings. Corrections for variation and deviation must be applied in the correct sequence. To
find the magnetic course when the true course is known: True Course ± Variation = Magnetic
Course ± Deviation = Compass Course. To find the true course that is being flown when the
magnetic course is known: Compass Course ± Deviation = Magnetic Course ± Variation = True
Course.

8.4.2.3. Dip Errors. The lines of magnetic flux are considered to leave the Earth at the magnetic
North Pole and enter at the magnetic South Pole. At both locations the lines are perpendicular to
the Earth’s surface. At the magnetic equator, which is halfway between the poles, the lines are
parallel with the surface. Since the magnets in the compass are designed to align with the
horizontal component of the magnetic field, the compass card tends to progressively dip or tilt
(error induced become more pronounced) near the poles. The float is balanced with a small dip-
compensating weight, so it stays relatively level when operating in the middle latitudes of the
northern hemisphere. This dip along with this weight causes two very noticeable errors:
northerly turning error and acceleration error.

8.4.2.3.1. Northerly Turning Error. The pull of the vertical component of the Earth’s magnetic
field causes northerly turning error, which is apparent on a heading of north or south. When an
aircraft is flying on a heading of north, if a turn toward east is made, as the aircraft banks to the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                127

right it will cause the compass card to tilt to the right. The vertical component of the Earth’s
magnetic field pulls the north-seeking end of the magnet to the right, and the float rotates,
causing the card to rotate toward west, the direction opposite the direction the turn is being made.
If the turn is made from north to west, the aircraft banks to the left and the card tilts to the left.
The magnetic field pulls on the end of the magnet that causes the card to rotate toward east. This
indication is again opposite to the direction the turn is being made. The rule for this error is:
when starting a turn from a northerly heading, the compass indication lags behind the turn (see
figure 8.11). When an aircraft is flying on a heading of south and begins a turn toward east, the
Earth’s magnetic field pulls on the end of the magnet that rotates the card toward east, the same
direction the turn is being made. If the turn is made from south toward west, the magnetic pull
will start the card rotating toward west—again, in the same direction the turn is being made. The
rule for this error is: When starting a turn from a southerly heading, the compass indication leads
the turn (see figure 8.11).




                     Figure 8.11. Northerly and Southerly Turning Error.




8.4.2.3.2. Acceleration/Deceleration Error. In the acceleration error, the dip-correction weight
causes the end of the float and card marked N (this is the south-seeking end) to be heavier than
128                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

the opposite end. When the aircraft is flying at a constant speed on a heading of either east or
west, the float and card are level. The effects of magnetic dip and the weight are approximately
equal. If the aircraft accelerates on a heading of east, the inertia of the weight holds its end of the
float back, and the card rotates toward north. As soon as the speed of the aircraft stabilizes, the
card will swing back to its east indication. If, while flying on this easterly heading, the aircraft
decelerates, the inertia causes the weight to move ahead and the card rotates toward south until
the speed again stabilizes. When flying on a heading of west, the acceleration errors or induced.
Inertia from acceleration causes the weight to lag, and the card rotates toward north. When the
aircraft decelerates on a heading of west, inertia causes the weight to move ahead and the card
rotates toward south. An acronym that is used to describe this error is “ANDS” which means
that when an aircraft is on an easterly or westerly heading, “Accelerate = North, Decelerate =
South.” Figure 8.12 provides a graphical presentation of the acceleration/deceleration error.




                         Figure 8.12. Acceleration/Deceleration Error.




8.4.2.4. Oscillation Error. Oscillation is a combination of all of the other errors, and it results in
the compass card swinging back and forth around the heading being flown. When setting the
gyroscopic heading indicator to agree with the magnetic compass, use the average indication
between the swings.

8.4.3. Slaved and Non-Slaved Heading Systems. There are many types of heading systems, but
each may be classified as either slaved or non-slaved. The non-slaved system uses a gyro to
supply the directional reference, while the slaved system uses the signals from a remote compass
transmitter to orient the system to magnetic north. In both systems the gyro acts as a stabilizing
component to reduce the inherent errors.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              129

8.4.3.1. Heading System Errors. All heading systems are subject to errors produced by real and
apparent precession. In many modern aircraft heading systems, provisions to correct for these
errors are usually incorporated making them negligible and transparent to the crew.

8.4.3.1.1. Real Precession. During turns and periods of acceleration and deceleration, forces are
produced which combine with the force of gravity causing the erection mechanism and the
remote compass transmitter to induce errors in the heading system. However, once wings-level,
unaccelerated flight is resumed, the remote compass transmitter and the erection mechanism
sense true gravity and correct any errors.

8.4.3.1.2. Apparent Precession. As discussed earlier, apparent precession is caused by two
factors: the rotation of the Earth; and transportation of the gyro from one location on the Earth to
another. The gyro is kept horizontal by the erection mechanism.

8.5. Angle of Attack System. Angle of attack information is obtained by comparing the
relative wind to the chord line of the wing. Its primary use in instrument flight is usually during
the final phase of an instrument approach. Maintaining the computed final approach airspeed
during un-accelerated (1G) flight should also maintain the approach angle of attack. The
information can be used in the same manner as airspeed. This allows either angle of attack or
airspeed to be flown while using the other indication as a backup. Refer to the aircraft flight
manual for specific guidance on the use of angle of attack.

8.6. Radar Altimeters. A radar altimeter is used to measure the height of the aircraft in
reference to the terrain directly below it and normally only accurate in straight and level flight
over landmasses. Due to these design limitations, it usually will not provide accurate
information while turning or warning information regarding rapidly rising terrain ahead of the
aircraft. In addition, altitude readouts over areas covered by water, ice, and snow may also be
unreliable. Consult your flight manual for proper operation and use of your aircraft’s particular
radar altimeter (if installed).

8.6.1. Except where authorized in your flight manual, the radar altimeter should not be used to
determine when you have arrived at the DH or MDA. If authorized, it may be used to identify
the DH when conducting a Cat II or III ILS. This is because a Cat II/III ILS will depict the
height of the aircraft above the terrain at the DH point.

                           EXTREME LATITUDE NAVIGATION.

9.1. Areas of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU). The AMUs consist of two large areas of
operation, centered around the earth’s poles where unique features significantly complicate air
navigation. The two major factors affecting navigation in the polar regions are magnetic
variation and the convergence of true meridians at the poles.

9.1.1. Since the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field vanishes near the magnetic
poles, magnetic compasses are highly unreliable and unusable in an area approximately 1000 nm
from each magnetic pole. Within these areas, air navigation is further complicated by very rapid
changes in magnetic variation over short distances as the isogonic lines converge. For example,
when flying between the magnetic north pole and the geographic north pole, a heading of true
north results in a magnetic heading of south (a magnetic variation of 180°).

9.1.2. Since the two major AMUs also occur near the geographic poles, the convergence of
meridians also present an additional navigation problem. When flying courses at the extreme
latitudes (polar operations), convergence of the meridians can create rapid changes in true
headings and true courses with small changes in aircraft position. While maintaining a course
(without turning), your true heading will change strictly based on your aircraft’s relative position
to the true pole as you cross meridians. Figure 9.1 provides a graphical depiction of how
heading information changes in relation to the angular difference from true north as meridians
are crossed. As a result, relatively small errors introduced can make determining the aircraft’s
actual position very difficult when trying to determine the proper heading to fly to maintain or
correct back to the desired flight path. When even small errors occur, very large navigation
errors can develop over extremely short distances.

9.1.3. Due to the combined effects of magnetic unreliability and the geographic convergence of
meridians at acute angles, when flying in the polar regions, to navigate more precisely, a “grid”
system was developed (see para 9.3). Navigating in the AMU was also enhanced by the
development of gyro driven heading indicators (also see paragraph 8.4 for more information on
heading systems and the associated errors).

9.2. Boundaries of the AMU. AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules and AFMAN 11-
217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, delineate the location and requirements for
operations in the AMU.

9.2.1. For the northern hemisphere, the Canadian Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP)
establishes the basic boundaries for the AMU. In general, this corresponds to Canadian Northern
Domestic Airspace, and the entire Canadian Northern and Arctic Control Areas. AMU’s are also
depicted on Canadian Enroute Charts. The FAA refers to the AMU in the northern hemisphere
as the “North Polar Area” and defines this region as all geographical area and airspace located
above 78 degrees North.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             131

9.2.2. For the southern hemisphere, the FAA refers to the AMU as the “South Polar Area” and
defines this region as any area south of the 60° South latitude.


Figure 9.1. Heading Indications while Crossing Meridians.




9.3. Grid Operations. Grid navigation is a reorientation of the standard heading references and
is used to offset the difficulties of trying to navigate in an AMU (North or South Polar Area)
using conventional techniques and procedures. Grid navigation uses a set of parallel and
perpendicular “green” lines depicted on most GNC and JNC charts and enables the aircrew to fly
a constant grid heading (GH) while crossing rapidly changing longitudinal lines and contend
with the erratic magnetic variations present in the AMU. The use of a GH, whether provided
automatically by on board systems or manually calculated, provides a method upon which an
aircrew can safely navigate in an AMU region. Most modern USAF aircraft incorporate a switch
(sometimes referred to as a “Heading Reference Select switch” or HRS) that allows the pilot to
select between “True, Magnetic, or Grid.” With the HRS selected to “Grid” mode, the on board
navigation systems should automatically switch to “grid” operations and update the navigational
displays to reflect aircraft grid heading/position. In “Grid” mode, the onboard navigation
magnetic variation is automatically set to “0” (zero) and therefore magnetic heading (MH) is
equal to true heading (TH). The on-board system then applies a known correction (added or
subtracted), based on the current longitudinal line to provide a Grid Heading (GH) for the pilot to
fly.

9.3.1. There are several ways grid lines may be depicted on charts depending on the type of
projection. For example, the Polar Grid chart is designed using the Prime Meridian as the base
reference line of longitude. A particular GH is then calculated based on this standard reference.

9.3.2. To manually calculate a GH, the pilot needs to multiply the appropriate longitude with the
chart’s convergence factor (normally stated in the margin) and then add or subtract the aircraft
true heading (TH). The convergence factor is particular to the chart being used and is
determined by the angle at which the “longitudinal line” cuts across the “grid” line. This angle is
known as the convergence angle. In the Southern Hemisphere, the pilot must add “East
Longitudinal” lines and subtract “West Longitudinal” lines to calculate a GH. It is the opposite
in the Northern Hemisphere (add “West Longitude” and subtract “East Longitude”). Since the
convergence factor on the Polar Grid Chart is equal to 1 (one), to obtain GH, the pilot must
simply add or subtract the longitudinal line to TH. As an example, at McMurdo Station, the
longitudinal line of the Pegasus Field (NZPG) runway is 167 “East;” therefore for any given TH,
adding 167 will give you GH. Refer to AFPAM 11-216, Chapter 14, for more details on “Grid
Navigation.”

9.4. Definition of an Emergency in the AMU. Many situations are considered an emergency
regardless of geographic location. For example, engine failure is considered an emergency by
most aircrews whether in or out of the AMU. When operating in the AMU, USAF directives
require aircraft to be equipped with a heading source other than magnetic. However, there are
situations (electrical power loss, gyro failure, etc.) where the heading source may become
inoperative after entering the AMU. A simple gyro failure typically would not be considered an
emergency outside the AMU, especially if an alternative means of navigation is available. This
situation; however, is dramatically different in the AMU where navigation options may be
extremely limited, diversion airfields widely spaced, radar vectors are generally unavailable,
weather conditions are less than optimal, and communications often unreliable. Any equipment
failure in the AMU that leaves an aircrew with magnetic information as the sole source of
heading information is typically considered an emergency.

9.4.1. AMU Emergency Procedures. The techniques outlined below are useful for emergency
navigation should the true/grid heading source become inoperative or unreliable while operating
in the AMU. Use of these techniques should be limited to emergency navigation to an alternate,
the planned destination, or out of the AMU. They should not be used as normal navigation
procedures for aircraft not equipped with a heading source other than magnetic.

9.4.1.1. In the unlikely event that all navigation systems become unavailable, reversion to
manual navigation (i.e. dead reckoning (DR)) is required. Radar, NAVAIDS or visual fixes may
be available. Application of basic navigational principles will ensure that the aircraft proceeds
in a direction that at least approximates the desired track until such time as more accurate
navigation or a safe landing is possible. A thorough review of basic DR techniques and
procedures is recommended prior to flight in the AMU, particularly without a navigator on
board. You should always have a backup DR plan ready for every flight in the AMU.

9.4.1.1.1. WARNING: Accurately plotting the cleared flight path track on a suitable chart,
along with frequent position checks, helps ensure the flight remains on course. This not only
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  133

increases and maintains positional awareness, but enables the pilot/crew to make the transition to
DR (if required) should one or more navigation systems fail.

9.4.1.2. If your aircraft has the additional AHRS (Aircraft Heading Reference System), you may
be able to operate the system in Directional Gyro (DG) mode and manually set the heading to
coincide with the FMS/True/Inertial heading from your primary navigation source IAW flight
manual instructions. This will provide a backup true heading reference in case the GPS, INS, or
other primary navigation system fails. Update the heading periodically IAW your flight manual
to correct for AHRS DG drift.
9.4.1.2.1. NOTE: This technique is not acceptable for use as the primary means of navigation,
but is very useful as an emergency backup source of true heading information.
9.5. Using the VOR in the AMU.


9.5.1. Flight Instrument Indications and Interpretation.
9.5.1.1. Because of problems associated with magnetic referenced navigation in the AMU, VOR
navigation stations are aligned to true north in this area. See AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1
Instrument Flight Procedures for charting of NAVAIDS oriented to true north.

9.5.1.2. Flight instrument indications and interpretation for VORs in the AMU are different than
for conventional VORs outside the AMU. This is due to convergence of the meridians and the
fact that VOR radials are defined at the station, not at the aircraft. The VOR display does not
provide a “relative bearing” to the VOR, it uses the received radial and displays it against that
azimuth value on the HSI. At lower latitudes, the received radial matches the relative bearing to
the station, so there appears to be no difference between them. In the AMU, it is quite likely that
the VOR bearing pointer will not be pointed at the station or even at the correct true bearing to
the station. This is due to the fact that the radial being sent out from the station is specific to true
north from the station which is slightly different from true north seen at the aircraft.

9.5.1.3. True VOR radials, which are based on phase relationships formed at the VOR
transmitter are decoded in the aircraft. The radial leaving the VOR station is based on the
meridian (true north) location of the station, while at the aircraft, the VOR radial information is
decoded and portrayed using a heading which is based on the meridian at the location of the
aircraft, not the VOR station. The difference or apparent error seen on the instruments depends
on the aircraft distance from the VOR and the convergence angle of the meridians involved. The
difference seen will become zero as the VOR station is crossed, where the station and aircraft
meridians are the same.

9.5.1.4. Aligning the VORs to true north eliminates the magnetic variation problem and compass
unreliability factors, but does not eliminate the convergence angle problem.

9.5.2. Navigating TO the Station.

9.5.2.1 If you were navigating strictly by using a VOR and wanted to proceed direct to the
station, center the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) with an inbound bearing and make heading
134                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

corrections as necessary to keep the CDI centered. Make heading corrections as you would wind
corrections to maintain a desired track. As you approach the station, your true heading will
change progressively until, as you pass the station, it is the same as the CDI course (+/- wind
drift). Reference the VOR indications versus the heading indications represented in figure 9.1.
Do not select magnetic heading references, stay in true heading. You should not turn to a true
heading that places the bearing pointer at the top of the case and keep it there until you arrive
over the station. Doing this would eventually get you to the station, but it would take you off the
direct course.

9.5.3. Navigating FROM the Station.

9.5.3.1. Making use of VOR bearing information in this case is the reverse of the paragraph
above. Set the desired outbound radial and keep the CDI centered. The heading required to keep
the CDI centered will progressively diverge from the CDI course. If the outbound radial is not
printed on the chart and you still want outbound information, you will have to draw a true North
line from the station symbol, then plot a course line from the station and measure the course. Set
that radial and keep it centered. This should not be relied upon as your primary means of
navigation.

9.5.4. Using Off-Route True VORs to Perform Coast-in/out, and Enroute Accuracy Checks.

9.5.4.1. Interpreting bearing information from an off-route VOR station is somewhat involved.
Plot a true north line from the station as a reference to draw the true radial or bearing that
represents the centered CDI radial. Locate the aircraft’s position on this line using the DME
indicated distance.

9.5.4.2. To check the FMS indicated true track to the station, plot a true north line from the
plotted aircraft position and measure the true track back to the VOR station using the true north
line at the aircraft location. This should match the indicated FMS true track. The FMS distance
to the VOR station should match the DME indication.

9.6. Using an NDB in the AMU.

9.6.1. Despite some inherent errors that may cause minor inaccuracies, (see chapter on Ground
Based NAVAIDS for further information), the NDB offers an excellent source upon which to
navigate from in the AMU since the basic operating principle remains unaffected. The ADF
needle simply points directly towards the NDB station. Even if the compass card and other
navigational anomalies are occurring from operating in the AMU, the ADF needle will point to a
properly tuned and identified NDB station. This attribute of the NDB can greatly reduce some of
the concerns experienced when dealing with the navigational complexities caused by the rapidly
changing magnetic variation or meridian convergence at higher latitudes.

                   TERMINAL INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES (TERPS)

10.1. United States Standard for TERPS. FAA Order (FAAO) 8260.3B (also called AFMAN
11-226 (I)) is the regulatory document that provides mandatory rules and information for the
construction of instrunent procedures at civil and military airports where the United States has
jurisdiction. FAA Order (FAAO) 8260.3B prescribes standardized methods for designing
instrument flight procedures. AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures is the US Air Force
supplement to FAA Order (FAAO) 8260.3B. It provides USAF specific guidance on
establishing, approving, revising, or deleting instrument procedures. It applies to flying activities
at all airfields where the Air Force, or an Air Force component of a unified command conducts
or supports instrument flight. AFI 11-230 is used in conjunction with FAAH 8260.3B (AFMAN
11-226) to develop instrument procedures at installations where the USAF has TERPS
responsibility.

10.2. General Criteria and Common Information.

10.2.1. Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS). The OCS is an obstacle evaluation surface
associated with each segment of an instrument procedure. The OCS can be either level or
sloping. See Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC) discussion below.

10.2.2. Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC). ROC is the minimum measure of obstacle
clearance considered to supply a satisfactory level of vertical protection. The ROC is added to
the OCS. The level of vertical protection provided is based on variety of factors. First, the
aircraft meets required performance standards based on the certification process. Second, the
pilot operates the aircraft IAW procedures outlined in the T.O. Additionally, it also assumes that
all aircraft systems are functioning normally, the required NAVAIDS are performing within
flight inspection parameters, and the pilot is conducting instrument operations in accordance
with directives. ROC is provided through application of either a level or sloping ROC.

10.2.2.1. Level ROC. The level OCS concept is applicable to level flight segments. This is
intended for enroute, initial, intermediate segments, and non-precision final approaches. A
single ROC value is applied over the length of the segment. These values were determined
through testing and observation of aircraft and pilot performance in various flight conditions.
Typical ROC values are: for enroute procedure segments, 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in designated
mountainous terrain); and for initial segments, 1,000 feet, and 500 feet in intermediate segments.
In determining ROC for the final segments, 350, 300, or 250 feet may be applied and is
dependent on the type of non-precision procedure and a variety of other factors (e.g. whether
DME is available, if a final-approach-fix (FAF) exists, location of the FAF, remote altimeter
setting required, etc…). For additional information regarding how ROC is applied, see FAAO
8260.3, United States Standards for TERPS and AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures.

               Figure 10.1. Relationship of OCS and ROC for Level Segment.




10.2.2.2. Sloping ROC. Sloping ROC is applicable to segments dedicated to descending on a
glidepath or climbing in a departure or missed approach segment. This requires a different
obstacle clearance concept than the level OCS because the ROC value varies throughout descent
or climb segment. The value of ROC near the runway is relatively small, while the value at the
opposite end of the segment is designed to satisfy one of the level standards discussed in
paragraph 10.2.2.1.

Figure 10.2 Relationship of OCS and ROC for Sloping Segment.




10.2.3. Units of Measurement (US TERPS Only).

10.2.3.1. Bearings and courses are expressed in degrees magnetic (except in the AMU).

10.2.3.2. Radials are expressed in degrees magnetic (except in the AMU) and are prefaced by
the letter “R” to the magnetic bearing FROM the facility.

10.2.3.3. Altitudes are expressed in feet. Published heights below the transition level (18,000
feet) are expressed in feet above MSL. Published heights at and above the transition level are
expressed as flight levels.

10.2.3.4. Distances are expressed in nm and hundredths, except where feet are required. When
applied to visibility, distance is expressed in statute miles (sm) and appropriate fractions. In
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               137

overseas areas, visibility may be expressed in nm or meters where it coincides with host nation
practice.

10.2.3.5. Aircraft speeds are expressed in KIAS.

10.2.4. Positive Course Guidance. Positive course guidance is provided for feeder routes, most
initial segments, intermediate and final segments. Positive course guidance should be provided
within the service volume of the facility(ies) used except when Expanded Service Volume (ESV)
has been authorized. This means that if a course is published, even if outside the normal service
volume, it has been authorized for use in accordance with that published procedure.

10.2.5. Approach Categories. Aircraft performance differences have an effect on the airspace
and visibility needed to perform certain maneuvers. Because of these differences, categories are
assigned by either the manufacturer or operational directives so that appropriate obstacle
clearance areas and takeoff, approach and landing minimums can be established. Aircraft
categories are assigned by FAR Part 97 and further explained in AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1,
Instrument Flight Procedures.

10.3. Procedure Construction. An instrument approach procedure (IAP) usually has four
separate segments. They are the initial, intermediate, final, and missed approach segments. In
addition, an area for circling the airport in visual conditions is usually considered, but not always
required when designing an IAP. Fixes associated with each segment are named to coincide with
the associated segment. The initial approach fix (IAF), intermediate fix (IF), FAF, and MAP
identify the fixes along the procedure. Referring to figure 10.3, you can see that as the aircraft
transitions from one segment to the next during the approach, the segment corridors narrow and
ROC tolerances are reduced. Upon executing a missed approach, the parameters expand.
                       Figure 10.3. Segments of an Approach Procedure.




10.4. Enroute Operations.
138                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

10.4.1. Feeder Routes. When the IAF is part of the enroute structure, there is no need to
designate additional routes for aircraft to proceed to the IAF. However, when an IAF is not part
of the enroute structure, it is necessary to provide a route that enables the aircraft to transition
from the enroute phase of flight to the approach phase. This is accomplished through the use of
feeder routes to the IAF. Enroute airway obstacle clearance is applied to feeder routes. The
minimum altitude on a feeder route will not be less than the altitude published at the IAF. The
angle between the feeder route and the next straight segment (feeder or initial) will not exceed
120°. The optimum descent gradient in a feeder route is 250 ft/nm. The maximum permissible
descent gradient is 500 ft/nm.

10.5. Minimum Safe/Sector Altitudes (MSA) and Emergency Safe Altitudes (ESA). An
explanation of MSA and ESA altitudes and obstruction clearances is in AFMAN 11-217 Volume
1, Instrument Flight Procedures.

10.6. Initial Approach Segment. The instrument approach begins at the IAF. In the initial
approach, the aircraft has departed the enroute phase of flight and is maneuvering to enter an
intermediate segment. When the intermediate segment is part of the enroute structure, it may not
be necessary to have an initial approach segment. The initial approach segment has no defined
minimum length; however, it should be long enough to ensure sufficient distance is available to
permit altitude changes required by the procedure. The length should not exceed 50 NM unless
an operational requirement exists.

10.6.1. Composition of Initial Segment. An initial approach may be made along an arc, radial,
course, heading, radar vector, or combination. Additional parts of a procedure that comprise the
initial segment also include procedure turns, holding pattern descents, and high altitude
penetrations. Positive course guidance is required except where dead reckoning courses can be
established over limited distances. Although there may be more than one IAF, the number
should be limited to the minimum required to accommodate traffic flow and operational
requirements. When holding is required, the holding fix and the IAF usually coincide. When
this is not possible, the IAF will be located within the holding pattern on the inbound holding
course.

10.6.2. Course Alignment. The angle between the initial approach course and the intermediate
course will not exceed 120°. If the angle is greater than 90°, a lead radial or bearing that
provides at least 2 nm of lead will be published to aid the pilot in determining a potential point
upon which to commence a turn from the initial segment to the course associated with the
intermediate segment. This published lead radial may or may not work depending on your
aircrafts airspeed; therefore, the pilot may elect to determine an alternate lead point or radial
based on the concepts provided in chapter 3 of this manual.

10.6.3. Obstacle Clearance. The total width of the initial approach segment is 6 nm on each side
of the initial approach course. This width is divided into two segments: a primary area and a
secondary area. The primary area extends 4 nm on either side of the course. The secondary area
extends laterally on either side of the primary area for 2 nm on each side.

10.6.3.1. Obstacle clearance in the primary area is a minimum of 1,000 feet.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               139



10.6.3.2. Obstacle clearance in the secondary area starts at 500 feet and tapers to 0 feet at the
outer edge.

10.6.3.3. Allowances are made for precipitous terrain.

10.6.3.4. When any portion of the initial approach segment is over 50 nm from the navigation
facility, the criteria for enroute airways applies.


                                Figure 10.4. Obstacle Clearance.




10.6.4. Descent Gradient. The optimum descent gradient in the initial approach segment is 250
ft/nm. Where a higher descent gradient is necessary, a maximum of up to 500 ft/nm may be
used. The optimum descent gradient for a high altitude penetration is 800 ft/nm. Where a higher
descent gradient is necessary, the maximum is 1,000 ft/nm.

10.6.5. Procedure Turns. A procedure turn is normally used when it is necessary to reverse the
direction of travel to establish an aircraft on either the intermediate or final approach course. If
there is a holding pattern established at the FAF, an intermediate segment is not constructed.
Ideally, the minimum holding altitude is the same as the FAF altitude. In cases where this is not
possible, the minimum holding altitude is limited to no more than 300 feet above the FAF
altitude.

10.6.5.1. NOTE: If a holding pattern is established over the intermediate fix, the minimum
holding altitude will permit descent to the FAF altitude within the same descent gradient
tolerances prescribed for the intermediate segment.

10.6.6. High Altitude Teardrop Penetration.

10.6.6.1. The teardrop penetration consists of departing an IAF on an outbound course, followed
by a turn toward and intercepting the inbound course at or prior to the intermediate fix or point.
Its purpose is to permit an aircraft to reverse direction while losing considerable altitude within a
relatively confined airspace.

10.6.6.2. The outbound penetration course will be between 18° and 26° to the left or right of the
reciprocal of the inbound course. The actual angular divergence between the courses will vary
inversely with the distance from the facility at which the turn is made.

10.6.6.3. The optimum descent gradient is 800 ft/nm. The maximum descent gradient is 1,000
ft/nm.

10.6.6.4. The size of the penetration turn area must be sufficient to accommodate both the
penetration turn and the altitude loss required by the procedure. The turn distance will not be
less than 20 nm from the facility. The penetration turn distance depends on the altitude to be lost
in the procedure and the point at which the descent is started. The procedure is designed so the
aircraft should lose half the total altitude or 5,000 feet, whichever is greater, outbound prior to
starting the inbound turn. The penetration turn area has a width of 6 nm on both sides of the
flight track up to the intermediate fix or point and will encompass all the areas within the turn.

10.6.6.4.1. All of the penetration turn area, with the exception of the outer 2 nm of the 6-mile
obstacle clearance area on the outer side of the penetration track, is primary area. The outer 2
miles is secondary area. The outer 2 miles on both sides of the inbound penetration course
should be treated as secondary area.

10.6.6.4.2. Obstacle clearance in the primary area is a minimum of 1,000 feet. Obstacle
clearance in the inner edge of the secondary area is 500 feet tapering to zero feet at the outer
edge.

10.7. Intermediate Approach Segment. The intermediate approach segment blends the initial
approach segment into the final approach segment. It is the segment in which aircraft
configuration, speed, and positioning adjustments are made for entry into the final approach
segment. The intermediate segment begins at the intermediate fix, or point, and ends at the FAF.

10.7.1. Composition of Intermediate Segment.

10.7.1.1. There are two types of intermediate segments: the radial or course, and the arc. In
either case, positive course guidance must be provided.

10.7.1.2. The length of the intermediate segment depends on the angle between the initial and
intermediate segments. The minimum length of the intermediate segment is 5 nm for categories
A/B and 6 nm for Categories C/D/E. The optimum length is 10 nm and the maximum length is
15 nm.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                141



10.7.1.3. The width of the intermediate segment is the same as the width of the segment it joins.
Where the intermediate segment joins an initial segment and a final segment, the width begins at
the width of the initial segment and tapers to the width of the final segment. When the
intermediate segment is not aligned with the initial or final segments, the resulting gap on the
outside of the turn is a part of the preceding segment and is closed by an appropriate arc.

10.7.2. Course Alignment. Normally, the course defining the intermediate segment will be the
same as the final approach course. The exception is when the FAF is the navigation facility and
it is not practical for the courses to be identical. In such cases, the intermediate course will not
differ from the final approach course by more than 30°.

10.7.3. Obstacle Clearance. The intermediate segment is divided into primary and secondary
areas. In the primary area, 500 feet of obstacle clearance will be provided. In the secondary
area, 500 feet of obstacle clearance is provided at the inner edge, tapering to zero feet at the outer
edge. There is an allowance for precipitous terrain. Of note, it is important for the pilot to
understand that the receipt of positive course guidance (“case break”) or upon reaching a pre-
calculated lead point does not necessarily guarantee that the aircraft has entered the “primary
area” and thus safe to descend. This may occur when the NAVAID providing course guidance is
located well beyond the landing runway on the opposite side of the airport from which the
approach is flown (geographically separated from the airport environment). Therefore, when
making a turn from the initial to the intermediate segment (e.g. from an arc), the pilot should
exercise caution prior to initiating an immediate or rapid descent to the next lower published
altitude since the aircraft could may exceed the parameters of TERPS protected airspace. When
conducting an instrument approach, to ensure that the aircraft is in a safe position to descend;
follow the “established on course” guidance found in Chapter 11 of 11-217V1. Detailed
information regarding the use of primary and secondary areas in IAP development may be found
in Chapter 2, General Criteria, in AFMAN 11-226, United States Standards for Terminal
Instrument Procedures (TERPS).

10.7.4. Descent Gradient.

10.7.4.1. The intended purpose of the intermediate segment is to allow the aircraft to establish
the airspeed and configuration to enter the final approach segment. Consequently, the gradient
should be as flat as possible. The optimum gradient is 150 ft/nm. The maximum gradient is 318
ft/nm except for a localizer approach published in conjunction with an ILS procedure. In this
case, a higher gradient equal to the commissioned ILS glideslope is permissible. Even in this
case, the angle should not exceed 3°. Higher gradients are possible due to arithmetic rounding.

10.7.4.2. When the descent gradient does exceed 318 ft/nm, there should be a segment prior to
the intermediate segment to prepare the aircraft speed and configuration for entry into the final
segment. This segment should be a minimum of 5 nm and its descent gradient should not exceed
318 ft/nm.

10.8. Final Approach Segment. This segment sets up for alignment and descent for landing.
The final approach segment considered for obstacle clearance begins at the FAF and ends at the
142                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

runway or MAP, whichever is encountered last. A visual portion within the final approach
segment may be included for straight-in non-precision approaches. The alignment and
dimensions of the final approach segment varies with the location and type of navigation facility.

10.8.1. Visual Area.

10.8.1.1. The visual area is an area evaluated for obstacles to determine whether night
operations must be prohibited because of close-in unlighted obstacles, or if visibility minimums
must be restricted. There are three areas evaluated, depending on the type of final approach
guidance and alignment with the runway centerline. They are: standard, straight-in, and offset.

10.8.1.2. The standard visual area is for runways to which an aircraft is authorized to circle. The
standard visual area begins 200 feet from the threshold at the threshold elevation and extends out
10,000 feet along the runway centerline. The beginning width is 200 feet on either side of the
centerline (400 feet total). The sides splay outward relative to the runway centerline.
                               Figure 10.5. Standard Visual Area.




10.8.1.3. The straight-in visual area is for runways with approach procedures aligned with the
runway centerline. The visual area for a straight-in approach begins 200 feet from the threshold
at the threshold elevation, and extends to the DH for precision procedures and the VDP (even if
one is not published) for non-precision procedures. The beginning width of the visual area is
400 feet either side of the centerline (800 feet total). The sides splay outward relative to the
runway centerline.

AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               143



10.8.1.4. The offset visual area is for a straight-in approach not aligned with the runway
centerline. When the final approach course does not coincide with the runway centerline, the
visual area will be modified to account for this via a series of formulae. The exact dimensions
and calculations are not important for aircrew to understand. It is important to remember that it
is offset based on the angular difference of the final approach course and the extended runway
centerline.

10.8.2. Obstacle Clearance in the Visual Area. Two obstacle identification surfaces (OIS)
overlie the visual area with slopes of 20:1 and 34:1 from the approach end of the runway. When
a runway is evaluated for circling, the 20:1 surface is used. When evaluating a runway for
straight-in approaches, both the 20:1 and the 34:1 surfaces are used. Obstacles that penetrate
either of these surfaces will affect visibility minimums for that runway.

10.8.2.1. 34:1 Slope Penetration. If the surface is penetrated by an obstacle, the TERPS
specialist must take one of the following actions:

10.8.2.1.1. Coordinate with appropriate agencies to have the obstacle height adjusted or have the
obstacle removed, or;

10.8.2.1.2. Limit the visibility to ¾ mile.

10.8.2.2. 20:1 Slope Penetration For a straight-in approach, if the 20:1 surface is penetrated, the
TERPS specialist must take one of the following actions:

10.8.2.2.1. Coordinate with appropriate agencies to have the obstacle height adjusted or have the
obstacle removed, or;

10.8.2.2.2. No VDP will be published, visibility will be limited to 1 mile, and the obstacles will
be marked and lighted, or;

10.8.2.2.3. No VDP will be published, visibility will be limited to 1 mile, and a note will be
published prohibiting the approach (both straight-in and circling) to the affected runway at night.

10.8.2.3. If the 20:1 surface is penetrated on circling runways, marking and lighting of the
obstacle(s) is required or a note will be published prohibiting circling to the affected runway at
night.

10.8.3. Descent Gradient. The optimum non-precision final segment descent gradient is 318
ft/nm, which approximates a 3° gradient. The maximum is 400 ft/nm, which approximates a
3.77° gradient. When the maximum descent gradient will be exceeded, then straight-in
minimums will not be published.

10.8.3.1. NOTE: For RNAV (GPS), RNP, and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
approaches see AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures Chapter 8 for
discussion on descent angles for final approach.
144                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

10.8.4. Visual Descent Point. VDPs are applicable to straight-in approaches only. Where dual
minimums are published, the lowest MDA is used to calculate the published VDP. If one is not
published or you are going to fly to an MDA based on higher minima, you may compute your
own VDP. However, when computing a VDP to use when one is not published, the pilot/aircrew
need to carefully consider the information presented below. Additional information is found in
AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures. A VDP may be published for all
non-precision approaches, except as follows:

10.8.4.1. An obstacle penetrates the 20:1 surface.

10.8.4.2. When determination of the MDA is based on part-time or full-time remote altimeter
settings, or;

10.8.4.3. When the VDP would be prior to a step-down fix, or;

10.8.4.4. When the VDP would be between the MAP and the end of the runway.

10.8.4.5. Even if all the parameters in paragraph’s 10.8.4.1 through 10.8.4.4 are met, the TERPS
specialist is not required to publish a VDP.

10.8.4.5.1. NOTE: Since there is no way to determine if an obstacle prevented the a VDP from
being published or it was due to another reason (listed above), pilots/aircrew need to exercise
extreme caution when departing the MDA using their own VDP calculation in lieu of one that
was not published.

10.8.5. Circling Approaches. The size of the circling area depends on the approach category of
the aircraft. Some aircraft will be in a higher approach category for circling approaches based on
the airspeed upon which the pilot chooses to fly the circling maneuver at. See AFMAN 11-217
Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures for airspeed ranges by aircraft category.

Figure 10.7. Circling Approach Area Construction.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             145




10.8.5.1. Circling Obstacle Clearance. A minimum of 300 feet of obstacle clearance is provided
in the circling approach area. The TERPS specialist may exclude certain sectors from
consideration where prominent obstacles exist in this area provided a safe approach and landing
can be conducted without using the sector. In this case, a note is provided on the procedure
excluding this sector from use during the circling maneuver with reference to the runway
centerline(s). Sometimes illumination of certain runway lights may be required.

10.8.5.1.1. NOTE: There is no secondary obstacle clearance area for circling approaches.

10.8.5.1.2. NOTE: The circling area is determined by drawing a series of arcs of the
appropriate radius from the ends of each useable runway. The extremities of the adjacent arcs
are joined with lines drawn tangent to the arcs. The arc radii distance will vary dependent on the
aircrafts approach category. See figure 10.7.

10.9. Missed Approach Segment. A missed approach procedure will be established for every
IAP. The missed approach procedure commences at the DH or MAP for the procedure being
flown and ends at a clearance limit.

10.9.1. Missed Approach Composition. The missed approach procedure will specify an altitude,
a routing, and a clearance limit. The altitude will be high enough to permit holding or enroute
flight.

10.9.2. Missed Approach Course Alignment. Wherever practical, the missed approach course
should be a continuation of the final approach course. However, there are cases where this is not
146                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

possible due to airspace, terrain, or other concerns. For these situations, turns are permitted by
TERPS, but should be minimized in the interest of safety and simplicity.

10.9.2.1. NOTE: When the missed approach course is within 15° of the final approach course, it
is considered a straight missed approach.

10.9.3. Missed Approach Obstacle Clearance.

10.9.3.1. Obstacle clearance for missed approach from a precision approach (ILS or Precision
Approach Radar (PAR)) accounts for a momentary dip below DH during the go-around
maneuver to account for the downward vector of the aircraft during the descent to DH. Obstacle
clearance for a missed approach from a non-precision approach does not allow for any deviations
below the published MDA. This is important to remember when applying the technique of using
precision glidepath information as a guide for a constant rate descent to a non-precision MDA.

10.9.3.2. Obstacle clearance for missed approach takes into account a primary and secondary
area. Of note, in the US and at USAF installations, “alternate” missed approach instructions
(those received from ATC) are developed using the same obstacle clearance TERPS criteria used
in the design of published missed approach procedures. This may or may not be the case when
executing missed approach instructions received by a host nation ATC facility; therefore, due
diligence and an emphasis on maintaining situational awareness in relation to obstacle clearance
is paramount when executing “alternate” missed approach under these circumstances.

10.9.3.2.1. For straight missed approaches, the width of the primary area is equal to the final
approach area at the MAP and expands uniformly to the width of the initial approach. The width
of the secondary area varies at the MAP and expands uniformly to 2 nm outside the primary area
15 nm from the MAP (see figure 10.8, Straight Missed Approach Area).

Figure 10.8. Straight Missed Approach Area.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            147

10.9.3.2.2. For turning missed approaches the primary and secondary area widths vary based on
the number of degrees of turn required, the width of the final approach area at the MAP, and the
categories of aircraft authorized to use the procedure.

10.9.3.2.3. If the HAT is less than 400 feet, then a combination straight and turning missed
approach will be constructed to accommodate the climb to 400 feet AGL prior to turning.

10.9.3.2.4. Within the primary area the OCS begins at the MDA/DH for the procedure at the
MAP. It extends upward on a 40:1 slope (2.5% gradient, or 152 ft/nm) to the clearance limit (see
figure 10.9). ROC is added to this to account for less than ideal conditions.

10.9.4. Missed Approach Climb Gradient Considerations.

10.9.4.1. As with departures, the historical standard ROC for missed approaches is 48 ft/nm.
The FAA has changed their criteria for computation of ROC for missed approach from 48 ft/nm
to a formula based on 24% of the climb gradient required to clear the obstacle (see figure 10.10).
This transition will take a number of years for all FAA designed procedures. During the
transition there is no way of knowing which criteria were used to calculate the ROC for a
particular FAA procedure; however, there will always be at least 48 ft/nm ROC. Both the USAF
and ICAO are continuing to use 48 ft/nm.

10.9.4.2. Most missed approach climb gradients require the standard 200 ft/nm. This is because
when a penetration of the OCS causes the missed approach climb gradient to increase beyond
200 ft/nm, the TERPS specialist usually raises the minimums for the approach in order to
eliminate the obstacle. This is not always feasible. Although rare, it is important to understand
that due to the need to publish a lower minimum, the TERPS specialist may have to publish a
missed approach climb gradient that is greater than 200 ft/nm.
                         Figure 10.9. Missed Approach Cross Section.




              Figure 10.10. Obstacle Clearance Surface for Missed Approach.

10.10. Holding. Criteria for holding pattern airspace is provided in FAA Order 7130.3. There
are currently 31 separate holding pattern templates. The template the TERPS specialist uses to
design a specific holding pattern will vary based on altitude, location, distance from the facility,
airspace type, whether the holding fix is defined by conventional ground based NAVAIDs or
GPS, whether outbound leg length is predicated on time or DME, along with other factors. Since
it is impossible for a crew to determine which factors affected the design of a particular holding
pattern, the specific dimensions of each will not be discussed; however, certain basic criteria
apply.

10.10.1. Turn Effect. Pilot procedures specify that entry and holding turns should be conducted
using 30° of bank or standard rate turn, whichever requires the least bank angle. However, due
to instrument tolerances, pilot technique, holding pattern design criteria is based upon 25° of
bank. Additionally, for the entry turn, 6 seconds at the highest aircraft airspeed is applied in the
direction of protected airspace to compensate for any pilot delay in recognizing and reacting to
fix passage.

10.10.2. Wind Effect. Analysis of winds recorded at various levels over a five-year period led
to a standard wind velocities being applied to holding pattern design. Starting at 4,000 feet
MSL, 50 knots is applied to the computations and increases at a rate of 3 knots per 2,000 feet of
altitude.

10.10.3. Holding Course Alignment. Whenever practical, holding patterns should be aligned to
coincide with the flight course to be flown after leaving the holding fix.

10.10.3.1. A holding pattern will not be aligned with an arc. In this case, the holding fix will be
aligned with a radial.

10.10.3.2. When a holding pattern is located at the FAF and a procedure turn is not used, the
inbound holding course will be the same as the final approach course unless the FAF is the
facility. When the FAF is the facility, the inbound holding course will not be more than 30°
from the final approach course.

10.10.4. Holding Obstacle Clearance. When designing a holding pattern, the TERPS specialist
applies a template that provides for obstacle clearance with a primary and secondary area taken
into consideration.

10.10.4.1. Primary Area. A minimum of 1,000 feet of obstacle clearance will be provided
throughout the primary area.

10.10.4.2. Secondary Area. The secondary area provides 500 feet of obstacle clearance at the
inner edge, tapering to zero feet at the outer edge. There is an allowance in TERPS for
precipitous terrain. The secondary area is 2 nm wide and surrounds the primary area.

10.11. Summary. Flight procedures in the terminal area are developed by the TERPS specialist
and designed to accommodate the performance capabilities of civil and military aircraft. Which
factors and rule sets are applied to the approach or departure design is very complex; however,
under all circumstances, a primary consideration is obstacle clearance. This chapter was
designed to provide the aircrew member a basic introduction and some insights into the criteria
and considerations a TERPS specialist takes into account when constructing an instrument
procedure.

                                          Chapter 11

                USING NON-DOD/NACO INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

11.1. Introduction. Throughout the world, various sets of criteria are used to create and
publish instrument procedures. The DoD (NGA) and FAA (NACO) use U.S. TERPS criteria
and the USAF applies additional criteria through AFI 11-230. In order for an instrument
procedure to be published in DoD or NACO FLIP, the procedure must pass a stringent set of
checks designed to ensure the procedure meets US standards for safety. Other nations; however,
may or may not use U.S. TERPS criteria. They may have their own criteria, use ICAO or ICAO
criteria with a list of exceptions or combination thereof when designing an instrument procedure.
As a result, the SECDEF has established a policy requiring a U.S. TERPS review of any
instrument procedure not developed by the DoD or FAA. This review insures the instrument
procedures meet U.S. TERPS standards and provide an equivalent level of safety prior to use by
any aircrew. AFI 11-230 outlines this review process. AFI 11-202 Volume 3 General Flight
Rules also provides aircrew specific guidance regarding the use of host nation procedures
published by sources other than NGA or NACO.

11.2. Commercial Products. Instrument procedures published by a commercial vendor (e.g.,
Jeppesen) are drawn directly from data provided by the host nation and are simply reformatted.
While the product may have many useful features regarding lay-out, ease of use, and some
esthetic qualities, it may or may not be safe to fly. This is because, unlike DoD/NACO
procedures, commercially reproduced procedures are not flight checked or verified against a
standard set of criteria and thus, cannot guarantee proper obstruction clearance even if flown
correctly. A DoD/NACO designed instrument procedure, if properly flown, is able to guarantee
obstacle clearance. Because of this difference between commercially reproduced procedures and
those provided by DoD/NACO, commercial vendors will normally carry a legal disclaimer
assuming no responsibility for obstruction clearance. As a result, all commercially produced
procedures require a TERPS review prior to use.

11.3. Using FLIP Other Than NGA or NACO. In addition to the potential design safety
issues previously discussed, other nations may not (and frequently don’t) use the same charting
standards as NGA and NACO. Aircrew can be completely unfamiliar with symbology, wording,
abbreviations, etc. contained in host nation procedures. The same is true of instrument
procedures produced by commercial vendors. As a result, AFI 11-202V3 stipulates that aircrew
members are required to obtain MAJCOM approval to use FLIP other than those produced by
NGA or NACO. Also prior to their initial use, the aircrew must also receive MAJCOM directed
training.

11.4. Determining Review Status. One way to determine whether your MAJCOM has
approved the use of a host nation or commercial product is via the AMC GDSS web site at
https://www.afd.scott.af.mil. The Approach/Departure Information section of both the ASRR
and Giant Report contain a list of procedures available (see Fig 11.1) along with which ones
have received a TERPs review (see Fig 11.2). Figure 11.3 from the “Giant Report” depicts
which MAJCOM provided the TERPS review of the procedure(s) and approved their use (in this
example – USAFE). AFI 11-202V3 states that procedures approved by one MAJCOM may be
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                          151

flown by aircrew from any other MAJCOM. Use caution here; your MAJCOM may have more
restrictive guidance on this policy. Additionally, your MAJCOM is still required to provide you
with training prior to the use of host nation or commercial products.

                                           Chapter 12

                              NIGHT VISION DEVICES (NVD)

12.1. Introduction. Arguably one of the most important senses used in flight is vision because
it allows a crewmember to quickly ascertain their position in space. The brain rapidly interprets
visual cues during daylight. Unfortunately, when we transition to night operations, visual acuity
decreases as the illumination levels reduced. To compensate for this and improve our ability to
operate in the night environment, the Air Force uses night vision devices (NVDs). NVDs permit
us to operate more effectively in the low-illumination environment, but we must remember that
NVDs have important limitations. To effectively exploit the night using NVDs, you must
recognize those limitations and then exercise proper planning and good judgment.

12.2. Dark Adaptation. Dark adaptation is the process by which your eyes increase their
sensitivity to lower levels of illumination. People adapt to the dark in varying degrees and at
different rates. For most people, the sensitivity of the eye increases roughly 10,000-fold during
the first 30 minutes, with little increase after that time. One of the variables that determines the
time for dark adaptation to take place is the length of exposure to bright light. If you have not
been exposed to long periods of bright light, either through the use of sunglasses or spending the
day indoors, you will likely dark adapt normally. On the other hand, if you are exposed to a large
amount of unfiltered white light during the day, dark adaptation will take much longer. In
extreme cases (snow-blindness or very reflective sand and water conditions), dark adaptation
may not be possible for hours or even days. Under normal circumstances, complete dark
adaptation is reached in approximately 30 to 45 minutes. If the dark-adapted eye is then exposed
to a bright light, the sensitivity of that eye is temporarily impaired, with the amount of
impairment depending on the intensity and duration of the exposure. Brief exposure to a bright
light source can have minimal effect upon night vision because the pulses of energy are of such
short duration. However, exposure to a bright light source (e.g., lightning or flares) for longer
than one second can seriously impair your night vision. Depending on the intensity and duration
of exposure, recovery to a previous level of dark adaptation can take anywhere between 5 and 45
minutes. The average image luminance in a night vision goggle (NVG) is not particularly bright,
and your eyes will be in an intermediate state of dark adaptation when viewing scenes of typical
uniformity. Once reaching this intermediate state and after discontinuing goggle use, it will take
you approximately 5-8 minutes to regain full dark adaptation. Consequently, NVG use should be
discontinued for a period of time prior to your requiring full dark adaptation (e.g., performing a
landing without the use of NVGs).

12.3. Spatial Orientation and NVGs. Spatial orientation, or the ability to determine one’s
position and relative movement with respect to some frame of reference (usually the earth’s
surface), requires inputs from the two components of the visual system. Those two components
are focal vision, which is primarily responsible for object recognition, and ambient vision, which
is primarily responsible for spatial orientation. The use of NVGs allows aircrews to see objects
at night that could not be seen during unaided operations. However, you must use your focal
vision to interpret the NVG image. Since interpretation of focal vision is a conscious process,
more time and effort is required to maintain spatial orientation during NVG operations than
during daytime operations. Additionally, due to the goggles reduced field of view (FOV) and the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               155

lack of visual cues in the periphery, more reliance is placed on focal vision. This reliance on
focal vision can increase the aviator’s workload and susceptibility to spatial disorientation.

12.4. The Night Environment.

12.4.1. Electromagnetic Spectrum (see Figure 12.1). Areas on the electromagnetic spectrum
represent both the light that stimulates the unaided eye and the energy intensified by NVGs. The
human eye is sensitive to the visible spectrum (approximately 400 to 700 nm), which progresses
from violet to blue, green, yellow, orange, then red. A substantial amount of near-infrared (IR)
energy (approximately 700 nm to 900 nm) is present in the night sky, so NVGs were designed to
be sensitive to both visible and near-IR wavelengths. Thermal imaging systems, such as forward-
looking infrared (FLIR) devices, are sensitive to energy in the mid- and far-IR regions.

12.4.2. Terms. The following terms are used to describe properties of light:

12.4.2.1. Illuminance. Illuminance (illumination) refers to the amount of light that strikes an
object or surface at some distance from the source. An example is the amount of ambient light
that strikes the ground from the moon.

12.4.2.2. Luminance. Luminance refers to the amount of light emitted or reflected from a
surface area. An example is the apparent brightness of a surface that is illuminated by
moonlight.

12.4.2.3. Albedo. Albedo is the ratio between luminance to illuminance, in other words, the
ratio of reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation. Simply put, albedo is the fraction of light
or other electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface. For example, a mirror would have an
albedo of near 1 or 100% while something that is very dark (black) would have an albedo near
zero. Illumination from a light source may remain constant, but the luminance of different
terrain features or objects will vary depending on their different albedos. The light source
provides illumination, but what our eyes see, and what NVGs intensify, is the energy reflected
from objects and terrain.
                           Figure 12.1. The Electromagnetic Spectrum.
156                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

12.4.2.4. Contrast. Contrast is a measure of the luminance difference between two or more
surfaces. In the night terrain environment, contrast is dependent upon differing albedo values for
each type of terrain surface.

12.4.2.5. Nanometer (nm). The nanometer, (1 billionth meter) is a measurement of the
wavelength of radiant energy.

12.5. Sources of Illumination. Many natural and artificial sources of energy combine to
illuminate the night environment. Natural sources include the moon, stars, solar light and other
atmospheric reactions, while artificial sources include city lights, fires, weapons discharge,
searchlights and/or flares.

12.5.1. Moon. When present, the moon is the primary source of natural illumination in the night
sky. The amount of moon illumination reaching the earth’s surface is dependent on moon
elevation above the horizon (moon angle) and the lunar phase.

12.5.1.1. Moon angle. Illumination from the moon is greatest when the moon is at its highest
point (zenith) and at its lowest when the moon is just above the horizon. This effect is caused by
absorption of energy as it travels through the atmosphere; at low moon angles there is more
atmosphere for the energy to penetrate and hence more energy absorption occurs. Particulates in
the atmosphere (e.g., rain, fog, dust) will also increase this absorptive effect. An additional
problem associated with a low angle moon concerns the adverse effect it has on the NVG image.
The bright light source (moon) will degrade the image, making it difficult to see terrain detail
such as ridgelines. In fact, flying towards a low angle moon results in problems similar to those
experienced when flying towards a low angle sun. All these factors should be considered during
mission planning.

12.5.1.2. Phases of the Moon. Illumination is also affected by the phases of the moon. There
are four distinct phases in the lunar cycle: new moon, first quarter, full moon and third quarter.
For a period of time during the new moon phase, the moon is in conjunction with the sun and the
dark side of the moon faces earth. However, this phase, which lasts about 8 days, also includes
periods when approximately one quarter of the moon’s surface is illuminated. A relatively low
light level is characteristic of the new moon phase. Following the new moon phase is the first
quarter (waxing) moon phase. One quarter to three quarters of the moon disk is visible during
this phase, which lasts approximately 7 days, and good illumination is provided. The full moon
phase covers the period when more than three quarters of the moon disk is visible and lasts
approximately 8 days. The third quarter (waning) moon is the last phase and lasts about 7 days. It
covers the time period when three quarters to one quarter moon disk illumination is present.
Good illumination is provided during this phase, though slightly less than during the first quarter
due to the type of lunar surface (mountainous) being illuminated by the sun. The entire cycle is
repeated each “lunar month,” which lasts approximately 29 days.

12.5.1.3. Moon Shadows. Another characteristic of the changing moon position is shadowing.
Moonlight creates shadows during nighttime just as sunlight does during the day. However,
understanding what you cannot see in nighttime shadows is critical to NVG operations. Since
they contain little or no energy (and some energy must be present for the NVGs to provide an
image), shadows can completely hide obstructions such as ridgelines or towers, and may make it
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              157

difficult to detect waypoints, targets, landing zones (LZ), drop zones (DZ), etc. The term
foreshadowing refers to a particular shadowing situation in which near objects may be masked
by the shadow created by a distant, higher object. Any of these effects can be a serious threat
during low level flight.
12.5.2. Stars. The stars provide about 20 percent of the night sky illuminance on a moonless
night. They contribute some visible light, but most of their contribution is in the form of near-IR
energy. This means the majority of the energy is invisible to the human eye but is within the
response range of NVG image intensifiers.

12.5.3. Solar Light. Skyglow is ambient light from the sun that can adversely affect NVG
operations up to 1 ½ hours after sunset and ½ hour prior to sunrise, depending on latitude and
time of year. For example, in Alaska skyglow will have a prolonged effect during the time of
year when the sun does not travel far below the horizon. Skyglow will affect the gain of the
goggle and thus reduce image quality. The effect is similar to flying into a sunset and results in
the loss of visual cues when looking either west (sunset) or east (sunrise). Mission planning
should take skyglow and its effects into consideration.

12.5.4. Other Background Illumination. The greater portion (approximately 40 percent) of
energy in the night sky originates in the upper atmosphere and is produced by chemical reaction
(ionization) processes. Other minor sources of night illumination are the aurora and zodiacal
light caused by the scattering of sunlight from interplanetary particulate matter.

12.5.5. Artificial Sources. Lights from cities, industrial sites, and fires are also sources of
illumination. Light from missile fly-out, weapon flashes, flares, and explosions can adversely
affect NVG performance, but the effects are usually short lived due to the nature of the source
(e.g., short 20mm/30mm bursts). In this case, the goggle image would return to normal as soon
as the offending light source disappears.

12.6. Night Vision Goggle Characteristics. The NVG is an advanced night vision system. The
goggles chosen by the Air Force are binocular-style, helmet mounted, image intensification
devices that amplify visible and near-IR energy. This amplification is a passive process, meaning
no emissions are created by the goggles themselves.

12.6.1. Basic Components of the Image Intensifier Tubes. The NVG is a lightweight, fully
adjustable binocular assembly consisting of two monoculars, one for each eye. Each monocular
amplifies available ambient light and presents an intensified image to one eye. Each monocular
is comprised of the following components.

12.6.1.1. Objective Lens. The objective lens of each monocular consists of a combination of
optical elements which focus the incoming photons of light onto the photocathode of the
intensifier tube. During this process the image is inverted.

12.6.1.2. Minus Blue Filter. Coated onto the inside of the objective lens, the minus blue filter
prevents certain wavelengths from entering the intensification process. This allows the use of
properly filtered cockpit lighting to aid the pilot in viewing the cockpit instruments with unaided
vision underneath the goggles. There are three standard classes of minus blue filters on goggles
158                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

produced in the United States. Class A filters use a 625 nm minus blue filter that blocks energy
with a wavelength shorter than 625 nm—primarily wavelengths in the blue, green and yellow
regions. Class B filters use a 665 nm minus blue filter to block energy with a wavelength shorter
than 665 nm. This type filter reduces the NVG response in the orange and red region and allows
the use of more colors in cockpit lighting. Class C filters are a modification of the Class B filter
and add a small “notch” that allows an additional specific wavelength of energy to pass through
and be sensed and intensified by the NVG and be seen by the aircrew. This is specifically
intended for viewing of the heads-up display (HUD) in the intensified image.

12.6.1.3. Photocathode. The photocathode is the first element in an intensifier tube; it is a light-
sensitive surface onto which the scene being viewed is focused by the objective lens of the
monocular. It is similar to the film in a camera. It is made of gallium arsenide, and releases
electrons when photons impact it, starting the intensification process.

12.6.1.4. Microchannel Plate. The microchannel plate is the next element in an intensifier tube.
It consists of a thin wafer containing millions of microscopic glass tubules that channel the
electrons exiting the photocathode. The tube walls release multiple electrons when an electron
impacts the wall. The tubules are tilted to ensure electron impact with the tubule wall. The result
is a “cascade effect,” which is an essential part of the intensification process. As a result of this
process, for every single electron that enters one of the tubules, over one thousand exit.

12.6.1.5. Phosphor Screen. The phosphor screen is the next successive element in an intensifier
tube. The screen is located on the front surface of the fiber optic inverter, next to the rear (exit)
surface of the microchannel plate, and consists of a chemical that emits energy in the visible
spectrum (light) when struck by electrons. Thus, as the electrons exiting the microchannel plate
strike the phosphor, an image is created. Due to the type of phosphor selected for NVGs, the
resultant image is green.

12.6.1.6. Fiber Optic Inverter. The fiber optic inverter serves to convey the intensified image
created on the phosphor screen to the output of the intensifier tube. The inverter reorients the
image that was inverted by the objective lens.

12.6.1.7. Diopter (eyepiece) Lens. The diopter lens is the final optical component of the image
intensifier tube. The lens is adjustable and focuses the image onto the retina.

12.7. NVG Characteristics.

12.7.1. Gain. Gain refers to the ratio of output to input, or the amount of energy the
intensification process produces relative to the amount that entered the intensification process. A
NVG has circuitry that determines the amount of energy entering the intensification process, and
this circuitry automatically controls the level of intensification needed to produce images of
consistent brightness over a wide range of illumination levels. The control of the level of
intensification is called automatic brightness control (ABC). At some point, the ability of the
intensifier to increase gain is reached and image brightness and quality begin to degrade. Image
degradation caused by lowering light levels can be very insidious and leads to problems for the
aircrew.

12.7.2. Image color. The NVG image appears in shades of green. Since there is only one color,
the image is said to be monochromatic.

12.7.3. Visual performance. When compared to the human eye under daylight conditions, your
vision is limited while utilizing NVGs—detection ranges decrease and recognition of objects,
terrain and targets can be severely limited. While NVGs can be vastly superior to the human
eyes’ performance under night conditions, NVGs DO NOT TURN NIGHT INTO DAY.

12.8. NVG Limitations. The following visual limitations are common to most NVGs.

12.8.1. Field of view. FOV refers to the total instantaneous area covered by the NVG image.
Regardless of the type of NVG utilized, it is important to understand that the FOV it is able to
provide is less than your eye’s FOV, particularly in your peripheral vision. This loss of
peripheral vision is often a contributing factor in the onset of spatial disorientation.

12.8.2. Resolution. Resolution refers to the capability of the goggle to present an image that
makes clear and distinguishable the separate components of a scene or object. Though not
technically accurate, it is easiest to discuss resolution in terms of Snellen visual acuity (the same
system used for vision testing during flight physicals). Current NVGs have a resolution
capability of 20/25 to 20/40 Snellen. Though quite an improvement for NVGs, the performance
is still less than 20/20, which is accepted as “normal day vision.” However, NVG performance
far exceeds the eye’s unaided visual performance at night, which is approximately 20/200 to
20/400. It should be noted that while NVGs have a rated acuity of 20/25 to 20/40 Snellen, this is
the best an aircrew can expect to achieve under optimum conditions. There are many factors that
affect NVG operations and degrade the expected acuity. These factors are discussed in the next
section.

12.8.2.1. NVGs will not correct for sight deficiencies such as myopia or astigmatism. If you
wear glasses during the day, you will still have to wear them when flying with NVGs to see
properly.

12.8.3. Depth Perception and Distance Estimation. Depth perception is the ability to determine
where objects are located relative to each other, whereas distance estimation is the ability to
160                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

determine the distance to something, such as the ground or a target. Depth and distance are
discussed together because they use the same visual cues—binocular and monocular.

12.8.4. Binocular Cues. An aircrew’s binocular cues are usually quite degraded due to the
design of the goggle. Binocular cues are needed for tasks relatively close (within an arm’s
reach) and for tasks at distances up to approximately 200 meters. Binocular cues, by definition,
require the use of both eyes functioning together and include stereopsis, vergence and
accommodation.

12.8.5. Monocular Cues. Monocular cues appear to be most important for deriving distance
information while flying. Monocular cues do not require the coordination of both eyes and are
available beyond the distances at which binocular cues are. NVGs adversely affect monocular
cues several ways. The decreased resolution of the NVG image results in a loss of sharp contrast
and definition, both helpful for determining depth and distance. The limited FOV of the image
diminishes depth and distance tasking by reducing the availability of cues. Also, anything
adversely affecting the image (e.g., low illumination) will aggravate the problem. Examples of
monocular cues used when flying include:

12.8.5.1. Size constancy. If two hangers are known to be equal in size, the one appearing
smaller must be further away.

12.8.5.2. Motion parallax (optical flow). Nearer objects appear to be moving past more quickly
than distant objects.

12.8.5.3. Linear perspective. The convergence of parallel lines at a distance.

12.9. Avoiding Depth and Distance Problems. Be aware that anything adversely affecting the
NVG image will also adversely affect the assessment of depth and distance. Avoid the tendency
to fly lower or closer in order to see more detail. Over a period of time, an aircrew member
“learns” how to assess depth and distance when flying in the same area. However, the “learned”
techniques may not transfer to a new area where terrain and objects might be completely
different in size and perspective. In general, there is a tendency for aircrew to overestimate how
well they can see when using NVGs.

12.9.1. Contrast. As with resolution, contrast in the NVG image is degraded relative to that
perceived by the unaided eye during daytime. Also, any bright light source within or near the
NVGs FOV will further reduce contrast by reducing gain, creating veiling glare across the
image, or both. Additionally, there are differences in sensitivity to contrast among
crewmembers, which may lead to differences in image interpretation.

12.9.2. Dynamic Visual Cues. Dynamic visual cues provide information that helps to determine
direction, altitude and speed. The three primary dynamic cues are:

12.9.2.1. Static Cue Motion. Static cue motion is the summed effect of the change in one or
more of the static cues caused by aircraft movement. Static cues include elevation, known size,
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              161

and perspective. Central vision tracking is a method for seeing static cue motion and will be
degraded when using NVGs.

12.9.2.2. Optical Flow. Optical flow is the angular rate and direction of movement of objects as
a result of aircraft velocity measured relative to the aviator’s eyepoint. This provides our visual
system the information necessary to interpret speed and direction of motion. If there is no
relative motion, there is no optical flow. We use central vision to obtain optical flow information.
Since visual acuity is degraded with NVGs, the optical flow cues will be degraded when
compared to daytime cues.

12.9.2.3 Peripheral Vision Motion. Peripheral vision motion is a subconscious method of
detecting optical flow. It is dependent on a wide FOV and is the primary attitude sensory input.
With the reduction in FOV due to NVGs, this cue is severely degraded and central vision
tracking becomes the primary attitude detection means. This leads to one of the most insidious
dangers when flying low altitude—flying at a lower than expected/allowed altitude. Just as in the
day, visual acuity will improve as the aircraft gets closer to the ground. However, because of the
reduction in peripheral vision motion, the ensuing “speed rush” that would indicate close
proximity to the ground is degraded and controlled flight into terrain becomes a real danger.

12.9.3. NVG Scan. The reduction in FOV necessitates an active, aggressive scan on the part of
the NVG wearer. By continually scanning, aircrew members increase their field of regard by
increasing the mental image of the surrounding terrain, aircraft, and cultural features. This
information can then be compared and added to the aircraft flight instruments. Aircrew members
should establish a scan pattern that allows information from outside the cockpit to be merged
with cockpit flight instrumentation. Fixating in one direction may be necessary for a short
duration (e.g., identifying a waypoint), but the scan should be continued after just a few seconds.
A crewmember’s scan pattern may be disrupted during high cockpit workloads or when fatigued.
Under these conditions, an extra emphasis needs to be given to the scan pattern, especially
keeping the horizon in the field of regard.
                      Figure 12.3. Basic Night Vision Goggle Components.
162                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009




12.9.4. Preflight Adjustment and Assessment. Following proper NVG adjustment procedures
prior to each flight is imperative to ensure a safe and effective operational capability. Even a
small error in goggle adjustment can significantly degrade NVG aided visual acuity. The
problem is compounded by the fact that it is nearly impossible to measure a loss in visual acuity
without a controlled test environment, which means you can lose visual performance and not
realize it.

12.9.4.1. Tube alignment. The human visual system is designed to subconsciously fuse the
images from each eye into a single image without the perception of two separate images. This
concept is called binocular fusion. To ensure proper alignment, the aircrew member should be
able to see a complete circle through each monocular independently, and when viewed by both
eyes the image should come close to forming a circle. Eye strain, fatigue, disorientation, or
nausea can occur if NVG alignment errors are significant. If fusion becomes difficult, double
images can form. Even if improperly aligned NVGs appear to have no adverse effects when used
for short periods, they may prove intolerable when used for longer periods.

12.9.4.2. Assessment of Visual Acuity. The assessment of visual acuity is the most critical
function of goggle preflight. It is impossible to accurately assess the acuity of the goggle
without the use of a defined measuring device. The Air Force primarily utilizes the Hoffman
ANV-20/20 Visual Acuity Box with a Night Vision Lane as a back up. It is paramount that
individuals are familiar with the proper use and function of the 20/20 Box. Proper assessment of
goggle acuity allows crewmembers to accurately determine the best case acuity of their specific
goggles prior to flight. The visual acuity obtained with both image intensifier tubes should
always be at least as good as the vision of the best image intensifier tube alone. If this is not the
case, the goggles should be returned.

                      Figure 12.4. ANV- 20/20 Visual Acuity Box Image
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              163




12.9.4.3. Assessment of Image. The following image defects are typical deficiencies that can be
either normal or defective in nature. It is important to understand the difference to determine the
proper course of action.

12.9.4.3.1. Shading. Shading is a condition encountered when a full image cannot be obtained
and a dark area appears along the edge of the image. Attempt to eliminate shading by readjusting
either the tilt or the interpupillary distance (IPD), or by shifting the helmet’s position. Shading
can also occur as a result of a shift in the microchannel plate caused by the goggles being
dropped or handled roughly. If shading can not be corrected by readjustments or by repositioning
the mounting bracket on the helmet, turn the goggles in for maintenance.

12.9.4.3.2. Edge glow. Edge glow appears as a bright area along the outer edge of the image. It
can result from an incompatible light source outside the goggle FOV, a shift in the microchannel
plate due to mishandling, or a power supply problem within the tube assembly. If edge glow is
noted, move your head or cup your hand around the periphery of the objective lens in an attempt
to alleviate the condition. If the edge glow does not disappear, turn the goggles in for
maintenance.

12.9.4.3.3. Honeycomb. At times of very high luminance, a hexagonal (honeycomb) pattern
may be visible across the intensified field of view. This pattern is a result of the manufacturing
process during which the fiber optic inverter is assembled within the tube. Normally it is faint in
appearance and does not affect NVG performance. Should it appear as a bold outline or during
low luminance conditions, turn the goggles in for maintenance.

12.9.4.3.4. Bright spots. Bright spots are the result of irregular emission points on the
photocathode, usually occurring during the manufacturing process. Because these spots are
normally detected during the quality control process at the manufacturer, you will seldom see
them. However, if an NVG has an excessive number of spots present in the image, or if the spots
are distracting, turn the goggles in for maintenance.
164                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

12.9.4.3.5. Dark spots. Dark spots are simply the bright spots described above that have been
corrected at the manufacturing facility. This correction is accomplished by exposing the light
spots to laser energy and burning out that portion of the photocathode. Dark spots may also be
caused by material allowed to enter the system during maintenance. NVG acquisition contracts
usually include a specification that limits the number, size, and location of dark spots.
Nevertheless, if you are distracted by the dark spots, even if the NVG is within specification,
turn the goggles in for maintenance.

12.9.4.3.6. Distortion. The two most common types of distortion are bending and shear.
Bending distortion results in the image having a wavy appearance, usually in a horizontal or
vertical direction. Shear distortion results in a choppy appearance somewhere in the image. If
distortion is present and likely to interfere with normal operations, turn the goggles in for
maintenance. Flying with tube distortion can cause problems in distance and altitude
estimations.

12.9.4.3.7. Scintillation. A sparkling effect normally occurs in the NVG image during low
illumination conditions as a result of increased goggle gain and system noise. In flight, it can be
an indication of decreasing illumination caused by such things as deteriorating weather
conditions or flight into shadows.
                                Figure 12.5. NVG Image Defects.




12.10. Factors Affecting NVG Operations.

12.10.1. Cockpit Lighting. NVG compatible cockpit lighting allows the crewmember to see
cockpit instruments underneath the NVG while not measurably affecting NVG performance.
Although NVG filters allow the use of cockpit lighting that will not adversely effect gain and
image quality, unfiltered aircraft lighting is incompatible. If the lighting is not properly modified,
it will emit wavelengths that affect NVG performance. There are aircraft in the inventory that
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  165

have not been fully modified to be NVG compatible. The following points are provided for
clarification:

12.10.1.1. Just because a light is green or blue does not mean it is compatible. When the
filament in a light glows, it releases a significant amount of near-IR energy which will affect
NVG gain and performance. Light bulbs and other energy sources in the cockpit must be
modified in some manner to block the emission of all energy to which NVGs are sensitive in
order to make them NVG compatible.

12.10.1.2. Turning down the brightness of incompatible cockpit lighting will not make them
compatible because NVGs are also sensitive to the near-IR energy emitted by the lights.
Attempting to turn down lighting to reduce the effect on goggles can be a two edged sword—the
NVG image will still be degraded and vital instruments may not be readable with the unaided
eye.

12.10.1.3. An incompatible light does not have to be within the NVG FOV for it to have an
effect on gain. MAJCOMs have specific lighting modification procedures if your aircraft
cockpit lighting is not NVG compatible. When modifying your cockpit, remember that AFI 11-
202 Volume 3 requires you to always have primary flight instrumentation present and properly
illuminated. It must provide full-time attitude, altitude, and airspeed information; an
immediately discernible attitude recognition capability; an unusual attitude recovery capability;
and complete fault indications.

12.10.2. Transparency Transmissivity. Another impact on NVG performance is the degradation
caused by windscreens, canopies, or other transparencies through which aircrew must look.
Some transparencies transmit visible wavelengths fairly well, but near-IR wavelengths very
poorly. Since NVGs are sensitive to near-IR wavelengths, transparencies that “trap” much of that
energy will degrade NVG performance. All transparencies absorb near-IR energy to some
extent, so there will be some goggle degradation in your cockpit.

12.10.3. Weather and Visibility Factors. Any atmospheric condition which absorbs, scatters, or
refracts illumination, either before or after it strikes the terrain, will effectively reduce the usable
energy available to the NVG. This reduction, in turn, degrades our ability to see key features
critical for flight. The exact amount of reduction is difficult to predict because a common factor
cannot be applied to each condition.

12.10.3.1. Clouds. Because of their variability, it is very difficult to predict the effect clouds
may have on NVG operations. In general, NVGs easily “see” clouds that are dense but may not
see clouds that are less dense. In the case of the more dense clouds, both visible and near-IR
energy is reflected and the NVG can see the cloud (just as you can see the cloud unaided if there
is enough light), especially if silhouetted against the night sky. However, dense clouds will
reduce the amount of illumination striking the ground and therefore reduce the luminance
available for NVG use. Thin (less dense) clouds have more space between their particles.
Because the near-IR wavelength is slightly longer, it has a greater chance of passing through
these type clouds than does the shorter visible wavelength. It is possible for the thin and wispy
166                                                  AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

clouds (which may be seen with the naked eye during daytime) to be invisible when viewed
through the NVG. This potential invisibility is possible given three conditions:

12.10.3.1.1. The clouds are less dense,

12.10.3.1.2. The clouds are low level, and set in against the terrain rather than being silhouetted
against the night sky, and

12.10.3.1.3. Ambient illumination is either very high or very low.

12.10.3.1.3.1. NOTE: The invisibility of thin clouds can create a severe hazard for NVG
operations. Even though a cloud is “invisible,” you may not be able to see the terrain behind it
because the cloud reduces luminance, which in turn reduces scene contrast and texture. This
may, in turn, produce a false perception of distance, resulting in the pilot either not seeing the
terrain or thinking it is farther away than it actually is. Additionally, the cloud may get
progressively thicker, allowing the pilot to progress into the cloud without initially perceiving it
or the terrain beyond. If a cloud is detected, the perception may be that it is at a distance.

12.10.3.2. Fog. Fog is another atmospheric condition of concern for the NVG operator. Its
effects on goggles are similar to those of clouds, but there is a greater tendency for fog to be less
dense and therefore more of a problem. It is important to know when and where fog may form in
your flying area. Typically, coastal and mountainous areas are most susceptible.

12.10.3.3. Rain. Like clouds, the effect rain may have on goggle performance is difficult to
predict. Droplet size and density are key ingredients to its visibility or invisibility. Light rain or
mist may not be seen with NVGs, but will affect contrast, distance estimation, and depth
perception. Heavy rain is more easily perceived due to the large droplet size and energy
attenuation.

12.10.3.4. Snow. Snow occurs in a wide range of particle sizes, shapes, and densities. Snow
crystals, while small in size, are generally large in comparison to the wavelength of visible light
and near-IR energy, and will easily block or scatter those wavelengths. As with clouds, rain, and
fog, the more dense the airborne snow, the greater the effect on NVG performance. On the
ground, snow has a mixed effect depending on terrain type and the illumination level. In
mountainous terrain, snow may add contrast, especially if trees and rocks protrude through the
snow. In flatter terrain, snow may cover high contrast areas, reducing them to areas of low
contrast. On low illumination nights, snow may reflect the available energy better than the terrain
it covers and thus increase the level of illumination.

12.10.3.5. Sand, Dust, Smoke and Similar Obscurants. The effect of sand, dust, smoke and
similar obscurants is similar to that created by the weather factors. However, the individual
particulates in these obscurants are usually far more dense, which means they can block energy
even if less concentrated.

12.10.4. All the atmospheric conditions described above reduce illumination levels.
Recognition of this reduction in the cockpit is very difficult. The change is often a very subtle
reduction in contrast that is not easily perceived with NVGs. Cues can be very subtle and the
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                               167

crewmember will have to stay aware to catch their significance. Common cues to reductions in
ambient illumination due to visibility restrictions include loss of celestial lights, loss of ground
lights, reduced contrast, reduced depth perception or distance cues, reduced acuity or resolution,
increased graininess or scintillation, and a more pronounced “halo” effect around incompatible
light sources outside the aircraft.

12.10.5. Cockpit lighting, weather, transparency effects, the illumination level, and terrain type
all have an effect on NVG performance. The visual acuity you achieve in the eye lane will
usually not be what you get in the aircraft during the mission—it will usually be less. It is
therefore imperative you maximize NVG performance before flight and avoid doing anything to
the goggle during flight to disrupt it (e.g., readjust the diopter). Maximizing the NVGs
performance will help offset the negative effects discussed.

12.11. Night Operations with NVGs. The NVG environment is always changing, so you must
always be aware of what cues are presented and work to interpret them. Even then, beware of
the potential misperceptions or illusions in any NVG scene. Many terrain characteristics
influence our ability to see features or objects and distinguish differences. Due to the variability
of the weather, the illumination level, and the moon angle, any given scene may look radically
different on consecutive nights. A basic understanding of NVG operations requires the
crewmember to blend the following considerations with an awareness of those changing
conditions over different types of terrain.

12.11.1. Terrain Albedo (Reflectivity). Differences in terrain albedo, or reflectivity, will greatly
influence luminance. For example, surfaces such as snow will reflect more energy than surfaces
like asphalt or dark rock. Since NVGs intensify reflected energy, different albedos become
critical in interpreting the NVG scene. Albedo will also vary with specific conditions of terrain
even though the terrain type remains constant. For instance, dry sand is twice as reflective as wet
sand.

12.11.2. Terrain Contrast. Terrain contrast is a measure of the difference between the
reflectivity of two or more surfaces. The greater the differences in contrast, the more “normal”
the scene appears in the NVG image, and the easier it becomes to pick out objects. Contrast
generally improves with higher light levels, but there comes a point where there is actually too
much light. This is usually noted when flying over low contrast terrain during high illumination
conditions. Normally, however, as the ambient light level increases, overall definition is
improved. Some examples of the effects of contrast in varying conditions are below.

12.11.3. Roads. The ability to detect roads with goggles depends primarily on the albedo
difference between the road and the surrounding terrain. For example, the highly reflective
surface of a concrete highway is easily identified in a grassy area during most illumination levels
because of the difference in their albedos. However, asphalt roads are usually difficult to identify
in heavily vegetated areas because both the asphalt road and the vegetation absorb available
energy, and therefore have similar albedos. Conversely, in desert areas the reflective sand can
make asphalt roads easily detectable.
168                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

12.11.4. Water. Still water, when seen with NVGs, normally looks dark when viewed at high
angles from higher altitudes. Under low illumination, there is very little contrast between a
vegetated landmass and a body of water. In desert areas, lakes and small bodies of water are
normally detectable as a dark area in a light background. Lakes in a forested area are more
difficult to detect due to the low reflectivity of the surrounding terrain. As light levels increase,
land-water contrast increases. Due to the reflective nature of water, when over-flying large
bodies of calm water, the stars appear to move across the surface as the angle of reflection is
changed by the movement of the aircraft. This phenomenon may contribute to or induce the
onset of spatial disorientation. Any action on the water caused by wind, such as white caps, may
improve the contrast, aiding in surface identification. Over the ocean, the normal wave action
breaks up reflections, thus reducing the problem. As in non-NVG flight, however, all night
flight over open water is best performed with a heavier reliance on primary instruments.

12.11.5. Open fields. Contrast is usually very good over fields that are tended for crops. Various
types of vegetation differ widely in their near-IR reflectance characteristics. For example, due to
differences in the near-IR reflectance of chlorophyll, an oak tree will appear brighter than a pine
tree. The same holds for crops. However, if flying over a large area of similar vegetation,
contrast will be reduced. Additionally, the differences in the surface texture due to plowing are
very apparent. A freshly plowed field may lack vegetation, but may produce a good NVG image
when the coarse texture of the upturned soil contrasts well with the relatively undisturbed soil
between the rows.

12.11.6. Desert. Open desert without vegetation can produce a washed-out NVG image. This is
due to the high reflectivity of the sand and poor contrast offered by the lack of different albedos
in the scene. Desert environments which have bushes, low trees, and cacti provide better
contrast cues, allowing for more detail in the image. In general, flying over this type of terrain is
similar to flying over water and is best accomplished with more reliance on your instruments.

12.11.7. Mountain Ranges. Normally, mountain ranges can easily be identified if the lower
reflectivity of the mountains contrast with a lighter, more reflective desert floor. However, if
ridges between your aircraft and a distant ridge have similar albedos, the intermediate ridges can
for all practical purposes be “invisible.” Low, rolling terrain with the same reflectivity as the
surrounding terrain can also blend together and be difficult to distinguish. These effects are more
pronounced in low-light situations, but can occur under any conditions.

12.11.8. Forested areas. Heavily forested areas do not reflect energy efficiently, and solid
canopied forests or jungles look like a dark mass at night. Excellent contrast does exist between
deciduous (leafy) and coniferous (pines, firs, etc.) trees as well as between open fields, exposed
rocks, and surrounding forest areas.

12.11.9. Snow. Fresh, wet snow reflects approximately 85 percent of the energy reaching it,
thus providing the best natural reflectivity of any terrain surface. Under high illumination, this
can provide excessive light which can, in turn, lower intensifier tube output and decrease
resolution. During periods of predicted low illumination conditions, snow may add to the
illumination level. Snow on the ground can also be a factor for flight planning; landmark
recognition may be difficult if deep snow obscures prominent terrain features.

12.11.10. Terrain Shadows. Shadows form at night just as they do during the day, and anything
blocking moonlight will create a shadow. The amount of terrain obscuration within a shaded area
is dependent on the amount of ambient illumination and relative position of the moon. The
smaller the moon disc, the darker the shadowed area and the more difficult to see detail.
However, never plan on seeing any terrain features within shadows, regardless of the moon disc
size.

12.12. NVG Misperceptions and Illusions. While most misperceptions and illusions
encountered during NVG operations are simply a carryover of those experienced during daytime
flight, others are specific to the NVGs themselves. Reduced resolution, limited field of view, and
susceptibility to obscurants can intensify misperceptions and illusions. The most common NVG
misperceptions and illusions are discussed below.

12.12.1. Depth Perception and Distance Estimation Errors. A common belief is that depth
perception (DP) and distance estimation (DE) capabilities do not exist when using NVGs. It is
true that these abilities are degraded by environmental conditions and goggle limitations, but
techniques can be developed to assess depth and distance. The most helpful depth and distance
cues are those with which the aircrew is most familiar. Flying over familiar terrain and culture
features can reduce DP and DE errors. When flying over different terrain with unfamiliar
features, serious errors in DP and DE can develop. For example, if someone normally flies over
terrain with 30 foot trees, but is then deployed to an area populated with 5 foot shrubs, that
person may fly lower than normal trying to make the scene look as it normally does. Using visual
information alone, that person would likely think they were higher than they actually were. In
this situation, bringing a radar altimeter into the cross-check would help minimize the effects of
the illusion. Overall, the best way to train for the lack of DP and DE cueing is through proper
planning, training, and a good discussion of differences between the deployed location and the
normal area of operations. Training over a wide variety of terrain, features, and illumination
levels can build the experience level of the aircrew to handle varying situations. Additionally, a
thorough pre-brief should be incorporated to familiarize aircrew with the cues expected in the
area of NVG operations. Be aware that a light source’s halo intensity is not an accurate
representation of its distance from the aircraft. The various wavelengths of light affect halo size
significantly. When viewing light sources with NVGs, a technique that may help DP and DE is
to look at the source with unaided vision. By looking underneath or around the goggles, not only
can colors be determined, but the halo effect produced by the NVGs is eliminated. This
additional information can be combined with the information presented in the NVG scene to
improve the accuracy of your assessments.

12.12.2. Terrain Contour Misperceptions. Terrain contour misperceptions are exaggerated by
anything that degrades the NVG image. The following are a few techniques to aid the aircrew in
correct terrain perception.

12.12.2.1. Discriminating Between Near and Distant Terrain. One way to discriminate between
near and distant terrain that contain little contrast difference is being attentive to motion parallax
between the two. For example, a hidden ridgeline close to you may be highlighted by noting its
movement relative to a distant, higher mountain.
170                                                 AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009



12.12.2.2. Gradual Changes in Terrain Elevation. Gradually rising or descending terrain can be
very difficult to assess when the terrain is low contrast. It becomes even more difficult when
there are few cultural features available for comparison. To aid in detection of the gradual
changes, an aggressive NVG scan must be maintained. By scanning aggressively, indicators of
changes in terrain elevation may be picked up in areas other than directly in line with the flight
path. Also, an aggressive instrument scan—when altitude, mission, and terrain type allow—can
provide additional inputs to the developing situation.

12.12.2.3. Maintaining Scene Detail. If for any reason scene detail is reduced, there may be a
tendency to fly lower in an attempt to regain the lost detail. In the worst case, this can lead to
ground impact. Examples of when scene detail can be reduced include transitioning from an area
of high contrast to one of low contrast, or when transitioning from an area of high illumination to
an area of low illumination.

12.12.2.4. Undetected or Illusory Motion. Motion illusions experienced by aircrews are usually
due to flights over areas of reduced contrast, or a sudden loss of contrast and flow cues. This can
result from the lack of perceived “flow” information in the NVG image and may create the
illusion that the aircraft has slowed down or stopped. This situation can induce spatial
disorientation, especially if coupled with other factors such as loss of the horizon. An increased
instrument scan will help alleviate the problem. Another insidious aspect of undetected motion
is when an aircrew perceives they are motionless. Helicopter crews hovering over low contrast
terrain, whether a large field or over open water, can actually be moving at fairly high speeds
without knowing it. Without cues to provide stimulus to the visual system, this movement can
go undetected and is very dangerous. Again, this is a known problem even during daytime, but
the decreased resolution and FOV of the NVG image can accentuate the effects.

12.12.3. Recommendations. Susceptibility to illusions and misperceptions can be lessened by
maximizing visual acuity. The best way to accomplish this is proper preflight adjustment and
assessment of the goggles, ensuring the best NVG image. In-flight attentiveness is another
building block to ensure NVG effectiveness. As stated earlier, reliance solely on visual cues will
nearly always result in a flight path that is lower, closer, or steeper than intended, so the aircraft
instruments must be readable and included in your cross-check. Use all information available to
you, not just one piece of the puzzle. By using the entire picture, you lessen the likelihood of
relying too much on NVGs. As usual, an aggressive scan is required to maintain situational
awareness and spatial orientation.

12.13. Emergency Situations. In general, consider the type of emergency and what actions
might be required from the pilot or the crew. If the NVGs will not be useful during emergency
procedures, consider removing them. However, if you can still gain valuable information from
the NVGs, aircrews may continue to use them.

12.13.1. Ejection. Ejection seat aircrew members must remove the NVGs prior to ejection
unless they are ejection seat compatible. During the ejection sequence, with the NVGs in place
on the helmet, fatal neck injuries can occur due to the forward center of gravity and weight of the
goggles. It is for this reason that aircrews not leave the NVGs in a raised position during
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             171

emergencies that may lead to an ejection sequence. It is probable that you will forget you are
wearing them in a highly stressful situation.

12.13.2. Inadvertent IMC. One of the most dangerous situations that can be experienced with
NVGs is flight into undetected meteorological conditions. The inability of the NVGs to see
various areas of moisture can lull the aircrew to continue further into instrument meteorological
conditions (IMC) to a point where there is virtually no visual information. This can result in a
gradual loss of scene detail and place the aircrew in an area of heavy moisture and, in the low-
level environment, place the aircrew in a potential conflict with masked terrain. The following
NVG cues will help alert you to impending IMC:

12.13.2.1. Halos surrounding incompatible light sources outside the cockpit (e.g., external lights
from another aircraft) may change in appearance. Normally sharp edges to the halos can become
less distinct and the halo may appear larger due to energy dispersion from the moisture.

12.13.2.2. A gradual loss of scene detail, visual acuity, or terrain contrast.

12.13.2.3. Partial or complete obscuration of the moon and stars.

12.13.2.4. An increase in scintillation.

12.13.2.5. The glow or flash from your aircraft external lights/strobes/landing lights/searchlights
may become visible or intensify.

12.13.2.6. Looking underneath or around the NVGs with the unaided eye can aid in detecting
IMC, but be aware that you can be in precipitation without seeing it in the NVG image. Use all
the cues available to you.

12.14. Spatial Disorientation. Spatial disorientation can occur at any time during flight.
Although NVGs usually improve situational awareness and reduce the possibility of spatial
disorientation, they can also enhance momentary disorientation. This is due to the limited field of
view and lower resolution. Maintaining spatial orientation at night requires complex conscious
processing of data from various instruments, displays, and references. The task of maintaining
spatial orientation competes with the usual tasking of navigation, terrain masking, threat
avoidance, etc. Add to this the fact that fatigue occurs more frequently at night and it is easy to
understand why the incidence of spatial disorientation in this environment appears to be
logarithmic as variables are added. Constant vigilance and a good scan pattern, both inside and
outside the cockpit, must be maintained to help prevent spatial disorientation. Keeping the
horizon in the NVG scan can help avoid spatial disorientation. If you feel disoriented, react in
exactly the same way as if you were on a non-NVG flight.

12.14.1.1 NOTE: Preventing Aircraft Mishaps Due to Spatial Disorientation. Refer to AFMAN
11-217, Volume 1 Instrument Flight Procedures, for a discussion on preventing aircraft mishaps
due to spatial disorientation.

12.15. Overconfidence in NVG’s. It is important that aircrew members not become over
confident in the capabilities of NVGs. Goggles are only one tool used during night flight, and
many situations can degrade or eliminate their effectiveness. Aircrews need to be cognizant of
NVG limitations and prepared to transition to other flight aids, primarily aircraft instrumentation.
Remember that NVGs do not turn night into day. After your initial NVG flying experience, there
may be a natural tendency to be overly confident in your abilities. While, over time, there will
undoubtedly be an increase in your skill level, it is not enough to compensate for the multiple
variables in the night environment. The complacent mind-set could be a setup for a mishap.

12.16. Other Night Vision Device Systems. FLIR technology is based on the fact that all
objects warmer than absolute zero emit heat. FLIR can discriminate between objects with a
temperature of less than one-degree difference, or of the same temperature if they emit heat at
different rates. The rate of emission depends upon composition of individual objects. FLIR
sensors detect the differences in the thermal properties of these materials and creates an image on
either a head up or head down display. This process, called thermal imaging, is presented as a
monochromatic image for the aircrew that can be gray or green depending on the display.

12.16.1. Comparison of FLIR and NVG (Table 12.1). NVGs and FLIR systems are
complementary sensors and can aid mission accomplishment through their integration.

                                  OCEANIC NAVIGATION

13.1. Introduction.

13.1.1. This chapter is informational and is intended as a starting point for preparing for
operating oceanic, also referred to Class II airspace. Class II airspace is defined as long-range
navigation beyond the limits of the operational service volume of ground-based NAVAIDS
(formerly known as a Category I route). It is also provided in an effort to reduce Gross
Navigational Errors (GNEs). A GNE occurs when an aircraft drifts more than 25 miles from the
cleared route, is off assigned altitude by more than 300 feet, or an ETA difference of 3 minitues
or more (erosion of longitudinal separation) is experienced exiting oceanic airspace.
Unfortunately, the majority of incidents involving a GNE are normally the result of aircrew
error.

13.1.2. Aircraft separation and air traffic procedures are standardized by ICAO in international
oceanic airspace (defined as 12 miles off coastline). The responsibility for Air Traffic Services
(ATS) in oceanic airspace is delegated to the various ICAO member states according to
geographic proximity and availability of the required resources. Regulatory guidance for aircraft
operations in oceanic airspace are contained in relevant ICAO Annexes, PANS/ATM (Doc.
4444), Regional Supplementary Procedures (Doc. 7030), State AIPs and current NOTAMs.
Procedures are extracted from those sources and written into AFIs and FLIP for Air Force
aircrews to follow as regulatory. Therefore, all planning for flight in oceanic airspace by Air
Force aircrews should include a thorough review of the AFI 11-3MDS Volume 3 and applicable
FLIP. A review of General Planning (GP), the Flight Information Handbook (FIH), Area
Planning (AP), Enroute Supplement(s), and ICAO North Atlantic MNPS Airspace Operations
Manual begin the planning process. Further information may be obtained at the sources listed in

13.2. Oceanic Flight. The current oceanic ATC system is procedural in nature, using pre-
coordinated flight routing and position reports to track an aircraft’s progress and ensure
separation is maintained. Deficiencies in communications, navigation, and radar surveillance
necessitate large horizontal separation minima. The progress of aircraft is monitored by ATC
using position reports sent by the aircraft over HF radio or data link. Position reports are
infrequent (approximately one report per hour in the Atlantic and 1 hour 20 minutes in the
Pacific), and the accuracy of these reports depends on the accuracy of the aircraft’s on-board
navigation system and timing. HF communication is subject to interferences, disruptions, and
delays due to weather phenomena, sunspot activity, and requires that radio operators relay
messages between pilots and controllers.

13.2.1. North Atlantic Ocean (NAT Tracks).

13.2.1.1. With an ever increasing flow of traffic from North America to Europe and back, a
system of non-radar control has been developed (since radar is only effective for about 250 NM)
to maintain positive separation for the hundreds of airline, private jets and military flights that
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             175

move across the North Atlantic daily (referred to as the North Atlantic Track, NAT). This feat is
accomplished by the use of an Organized Track System (OTS) that is developed daily for east
and westbound flights.

13.2.1.2. The airlines/private jets/military that cross the Atlantic using the NAT system must
meet many operating standards and procedures must be adhered to. Not only should pilots
understand the standards and procedures for operating in the NAT systems, the aircraft is
required to meet unique certification specifications to fly in it. The rules that govern this
airspace are called Minimum Navigational Performance Specification Airspace (MNPSA). The
vertical dimension of the MNPSA is between FL285 and FL410 (i.e. in terms of normally used
cruising levels, from FL290 to FL410 inclusive). Specific lateral dimensions for the separate
oceanic Control Areas (CTAs) are found in the ICAO Regional Supplementary Procedures (Doc
7030). This document and other information concerning MNPSA is available at
http://www.nat-pco.org/.

13.2.1.3. Two primary oceanic centers are responsible for the two CTAs, Gander Center and
Shanwick Center, one on each side of the Atlantic. These two oceanic centers are responsible for
creating the daily tracks. Since the major traffic flow between North America and Europe takes
place in two distinct time periods during the course of a 24-hour cycle, Gander Centre creates
eastbound “night-time” tracks which are centered around 0400 UTC at 30°W and Shanwick
Center creates westbound “day-time” tracks which are centered around 1500 UTC at 30°W.

13.2.1.4. Due to the major flow of eastbound flights from North America in the evening hours
and an almost equal flow of westbound flights from Europe in the morning, the NAT airspace
can become quite congested at peak hours. With the ever-changing nature of the North Atlantic
weather patterns, including the presence of jet streams, eastbound and westbound tracks are
seldom identical. In short, the NAT airspace is very congested and the actual track location
change daily based on weather and forecasted winds. To produce the track system, a computer
takes into account a variety of information (e.g., weather on the NAT, location of the jet stream,
number of flights expected); then, based on the results, controllers will formulate the track
system for use during a particular period.

13.2.1.5. To ensure a smooth transition from night to day organized track systems and vice-
versa, a period of several hours is spaced between the termination of one track system and the
commencement of the next.

13.2.1.6. Gander Oceanic control and Shanwick Oceanic control use 30°W as their dividing line
for control transfer point. High Frequency (HF) radios are used to transmit position reports to the
IFSS (International Flight Service Station) operators at both Oceanic Centers. This information is
passed onto the controllers working the assigned Tracks for the day or night periods.

13.2.2. The following (see figure 13.1) is an example of one entry from a daily NAT message
for east and westbound flights. The tracks are lettered A (the northernmost track) to K for
westbound tracks and U (the northernmost track) to Z for eastbound travel.

13.2.2.1. For each route, there will be a route identifier followed a coast-out fix and routing, 4 or
more latitude/longitude points of the track itself and then a coast-in fix on the other side.
Available flight levels for direction of flight are also given along with joining routes that can be
filed from the coast in fix(s).

13.2.2.2. The North American Routes (NAR) System interfaces with the NAT Oceanic and
Domestic Airspace, and is used by air traffic transiting the North Atlantic. NARs extend to/from
established oceanic coastal fixes to major airports throughout Canada and the U. S. These routes
allow controllers to help keep the flow of east/west bound flights to/from the NATs organized
and allows aircraft operators, in some cases, expedited routing. The NAR's will be based on
either inland fixes to coastal fixes or vise-versa. Explanations and descriptions of NAR routes
can be found in the Canadian Forces Flight Supplement.

13.2.2.3. Other organized track systems (OTS) exists for other parts of the world, but they all
work in similar fashion. Examples of other track systems are listed here:

13.2.2.3.1. PACOTS. Traffic on the Pacific Organized Track System (PACOTS) flows between
North America and Hawaii to Asia and Australia. The flexible tracks are developed twice daily
by the Oakland ARTCC Traffic Management Unit (TMU) and Tokyo Area Control Center to
take maximum advantage of changing wind forecasts.

13.2.2.3.2. NOPAC. The Northern Pacific (NOPAC) Composite Route System (CRS) consists
of five fixed tracks and nine transition routes from Alaska to the Asian and Pacific rim nations.
The long distances involved between city pairs on these routes make wind optimized routing and
flight profiles for fuel economy a high priority to users. Westbound routes from New York to
Tokyo compete for northern routes which, although slightly longer, may save significant time by
avoiding the jet stream.

13.2.2.3.3. CEP. The Central East Pacific (CEP) CRS connects the U.S. Central West Coast to
Hawaii. It consists of a set of five interior unidirectional tracks that are generally dense with
traffic, and two exterior bi-directional fixed tracks.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                177

13.2.2.3.4. CENPAC. The Central Pacific (CENPAC) traffic region consists of PACOTS traffic
between Hawaii and Japan, and Japan to the U.S. West Coast. This region is characterized by
long stage length tracks and complex weather situations. Also in this region, the Pacific
Northwest to Hawaii fixed tracks cross the U.S. to Japan PACOTS routes, creating additional
complications for controllers.


13.2.2.3.5. SOPAC. The traffic flow between Hawaii and the South Pacific (SOPAC) utilizes
fixed tracks and random tracks. SOPAC traffic is also characterized by long stage length tracks.
It includes the PACOTS tracks from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Sydney and Auckland.

13.2.2.3.6. Guam. The area around Guam contains the traffic flow from the Orient to the South
Pacific. Most aircraft in this region use fixed tracks. Traffic is characterized as predominantly
one-way, converging, and dense, with some opposite direction traffic. The north-south flow is
crossed by traffic from the Far East to Hawaii and by the PACOTS tracks.

13.3. Oceanic Navigational Errors. Oceanic navigation errors reported by ATC are
overwhelmingly caused by aircrew improperly handling an in flight re-route (i.e. not inserting
the new clearance’s waypoints into the Long Range Navigation System (LRNS) and cross-
checking the new clearance). Basic human factor mistakes by aircrew negatively impact ATC
efforts to reduce separation standards. Complacency in relying on technology, waypoint
insertion errors, and flying the flight plan instead of the clearance are errors that can be resolved
by simply applying “common sense checks” in monitoring the flight path of the aircraft. The
following information not only provides ICAO Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) common
to all oceanic regions, but also incorporates recommended steps to help mitigate the common
errors described.

13.4. Oceanic Checklist. The following generic oceanic flight checklist was derived from
multiple sources including ICAO North Atlantic Working Groups composed of industry, ATC
and state regulators. Specific region procedures and NOTAMs should be reviewed for unique or
temporary applications. Units without an oceanic checklist are encouraged to use this sample
and tailor it to their specific requirements. This checklist provides an orderly planning and in-
flight flow and contains methods to reduce oceanic navigational errors. HQ AFFSA maintains
some oceanic flight and training information on its website. Aircrews should also review the
expanded checklist and the Oceanic Errors Safety Bulletin (OESB) found at www.nat-pco.org.

13.5. Flight Planning.

13.5.1. Plotting Chart. A plotting chart of appropriate scale should be used for all remote
oceanic operations. This includes using a plotting chart for published oceanic routes and tracks.
ICAO groups who review oceanic errors have determined that the routine use of a plotting chart
is an excellent aid to reduce lateral errors. A plotting chart can also serve as a critical aid in case
of partial or total navigation failure. It should be noted that the pilot should read from the plotting
chart back to the master CFP when verifying data. To read from the Master CFP to the plotting
chart is a human factor’s issue that has lead to errors based on seeing what we expect to see.

13.5.2. Equal Time Point (ETP). ETPs should be computed for contingencies such as medical
divert, engine loss or rapid depressurization. A simultaneous engine loss and rapid
depressurization should also be considered. It is advisable to note the ETPs on the plotting chart.
Crewmembers should review with each other the appropriate diversion airport(s) when crossing
ETPs. Pilot procedures should also include a manual method for computing ETPs. The ETP is
the point along the extended overwater leg from which it takes the same amount of time to return
to departure (or the last suitable airfield prior to beginning the overwater leg of the mission) as it
would to continue to destination (or the first suitable airfield for landing). The ETP is not
necessarily the midpoint in time from departure to destination. Its location is somewhere near
the midpoint of the route (between suitable airfields), and it is dependent upon the wind factors
(aircraft groundspeed). An ETP can be computed using the formula outlined in Figure 13.3.
                       Figure 13.3. Equal Time Point (ETP) Calculation.
        ETP (in NM) =           TD x GS return
                            GS return + GS continue

       Where: TD = Total Route Distance between suitable airfields.
              GS return = Groundspeed Returning to suitable landing field
              GS continue = Groundspeed Continuing to destination (or diversion) field

   Note: The resultant ETP (in NM) is measured from the “return” field or one behind the
   aircraft, not from the airfield in front of the aircraft.

   Note: Groundspeed is TAS minus headwind (plus tailwind). Consider more than one ETP
   computation – one based on winds at your cruising level, and one or more based on forecasted
   winds at 10,000 feet. An ETP at 10,000 feet will differ significantly from the one at cruising
   altitude, and will provide you important information in the event of cabin decompression or
   engine loss. Remember to consider TAS and Fuel Flow differences at the lower altitude.

13.5.3. Track Message. Crews must have a current track message even if filed for a random
route. Reviewing the date, effective Zulu time and Track Message Identifier (TMI) ensures
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             181

having a current track message on board. The TMI is the Julian Date. Aircrew must also ensure
their flight planning and operational control process notify crewmembers in a timely manner of
any amendments to the daily track message. Plotting tracks near the assigned route can help
situational awareness in case the crew needs to execute a contingency. Track messages for both
the North Atlantic and Pacific regions may be found under the “Advanced NOTAM Functions”
section at: https://www.notams.jcs.mil/ or from the FAA at the following link:
https://pilotweb.nas.faa.gov/distribution/atcscc.html .

13.5.4. Altitude Reservation (ALTRV). Altitude Reservations are normally employed for the
mass movement of aircraft or special missions that cannot be accomplished otherwise using
standard air traffic control (ATC) separation. ALTRVs are designated as moving or stationary.
A moving ALTRV normally includes the enroute and arrival phases of flight up to and including
the initial approach fix serving the airport of intended landing, it may also include the departure
phase of flight as well. A stationary ALTRV normally is defined by a fixed airspace area and
altitude block to be used for a specified amount of time. An altitude reservation approval is
authorization by ATC to use the airspace under prescribed conditions. An ALTRV APVL is pre-
coordinated ATC clearance and will be followed. Deviation from an ALTRV APVL, except in
the interest of flight safety, must be cleared through the controlling ATC facility and may result
in the cancellation of the entire ALTRV. An ALTRV, unless otherwise coordinated, starts at the
first cruising altitude or entry altitude and within the time window identified in the ALTRV
APVL message. If the mission requires an ALTRV, the C2 agency will normally request it from
the appropriate Central Altitude Reservation Facility (CARF) of the nation in which the ALTRV
originates. ALTRV requests (APREQ) and approvals normally occur via message traffic. The
crew should ensure they are in possession of their mission-specific ALTRV APPVL (Approval)
message, vice the APREQ (ALTRV Request) message, as the CARF may change the requested
routing and altitudes. Normally, your DD1801 flight plan will reflect the ALTRV routing and
altitudes as specified in the ALTRV APPVL message. Consult FAAO Joint Order 7610.4 and
your MAJCOM for more information on ALTRVs.

13.6. Review Coast-Out Positional Accuracy. It is good practice to discuss in advance a
primary and secondary ground based navigational aid that will be used to verify the accuracy of
the Long Range Navigation System (LRNS). This planning may help to identify intended
navigation aids that are limited or NOTAMed unusable and is helpful when departing airports
close to oceanic airspace. Examples include Shannon (EINN), Lisbon (LRRT), Los Angeles
(KLAX), etc.

13.6.1. Master Clock. Preflight procedures for oceanic operations should include a UTC time
check and synchronization to the aircraft master clock. This time source, which is typically the
Flight Management System (FMS), should be used for all ETAs and ATAs. The use of multiple
time sources on the aircraft has lead to inconsistencies in reporting times to ATC and resulted in
a loss of longitudinal separation.

13.6.2. RVSM. Refer to GP, MNPS documents, and theater specific AP FLIP for RVSM
requirements/procedures. Consult your MAJCOM for current guidance. Also see expanded
information and guidance on RVSM regarding requirements and operational procedures in this
Chapter 4 of this manual.
182                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009



13.6.3. Aircraft Maintenance Forms. Before entering a special area of operation, crews should
ensure that their aircraft is properly equipped and certified for the area of operation. Check the
maintenance forms for any discrepancies that could affect communication, navigation,
surveillance or RVSM requirements. For example, if two VHF radios are required, and only one
is operational, the aircraft requires maintenance before penetrating the airspace in which the two
radios are required.

13.6.3.1. Altimeter Checks. Before taxi, crews should set their altimeters to the airport QNH.
Both primary altimeters must agree within + 75 feet of field elevation. The two primary
altimeters must also agree within the limits noted in the aircraft operating manual.

13.6.4. Computer Flight Plan (CFP). The document designated as the Master CFP should be
carefully checked for date, type aircraft, fuel load and performance requirements. Crosschecks
should also be done for routing and forecast groundspeeds. The CFP should be carefully
checked against the ICAO filed flight plan to ensure the routing is in agreement with both
documents. The enroute time on the CFP should be compared against the distance to destination
for a reasonable groundspeed. The enroute time should also be compared against the total
distance for a reasonable fuel load.

13.6.5. Wind Shear or Turbulence Forecast. The route of flight within RVSM airspace should
be reviewed for weather to include wind shear or turbulence forecasts. Forecast moderate or
greater turbulence could lead to RVSM suspension. Operators are cautioned against flight
planning through areas of forecast moderate or greater turbulence.

13.6.6. Dual Long Range NAV System (LRNS). Two operational LRNSs are required for most
remote oceanic operations. An aircraft with a single FMS may not be authorized for remote
oceanic operations. Consult your MAJCOM to determine if the aircraft is certified to fly in
remote or oceanic airspace.

13.6.7. HF check. An HF check should be conducted on the primary and secondary HF radios
in areas where dual HF radios are required. If possible, the HF checks should be done on the
ground or before entering oceanic airspace. A SELCAL check should also be accomplished, if
equipped and permitted by your MAJCOM.

13.6.8. Confirm Present Position coordinates. Both pilots (and/or navigator) should
independently verify the present position coordinates using either published ramp coordinates or
determine position from the airfield diagram. They should not rely solely on the present position
when the LRNS was shut down from a previous flight. A master source such as an enroute chart
should also be used to confirm accuracy of coordinates at the oceanic boundaries.

13.6.9. Master CFP symbols. Operators are encouraged to use consistent symbology on the
Master CFP. As technique, a circled number (O) means the second crewmember has
independently verified the coordinates entered or crosschecked by the first crewmember. A
checkmark ( ) may indicate that the track and distances have been confirmed. A diagonal line
(\) may indicate that the crew has confirmed the coordinates of the approaching and next way
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            183

point. An X-symbol (X) may indicate having flown overhead the way point. An example of this
technique is provided below (see figure 13.4).
                    Figure 13.4. Example – Use of Master CFP Symbols.




13.6.10. LRNS programming.

13.6.10.1. Check currency and software version. It is important to check the effective date of
the database. Crews should note if the database is projected to expire during their trip. Crews
are discouraged from flying with expired databases. MELs may allow relief to fly with an
expired database but require the crews to manually crosscheck all data. The software version of
the database should also be confirmed in case there has been a change.

13.6.10.2. Independent verification. As a technique, it is highly recommended that when a
crewmember manually enters a waypoint or waypoints, another crewmember should
independently verify the accuracy of the navigational data entered. It should be noted that the
pilot should read from the FMS screen back to the master CFP when verifying data. To read
from the Master CFP to the FMS is a human factor’s issue that has lead to GNEs.

13.6.10.3. Check expanded coordinates of waypoints. Most FMSs allow entering abbreviated
oceanic coordinates. There have been cases when there was an error in the expended waypoint
coordinate, but crews only checked the abbreviated coordinate. Verifying only the abbreviated
coordinate could lead to a lateral error. Flight crews should conduct a magnetic course and
distance check between waypoints to further verify waypoint coordinates.

13.6.10.4. Track and distance check. To minimize oceanic errors, it is important to conduct a
magnetic course and distance check from oceanic entry to oceanic exit. Operators should
establish a tolerance such as ± 2° and ± 2NM. The course and distance checks comparing the
Master CFP against the LRNS are critical in detecting errors that may not have been noticed by
simply checking coordinates. A difference of more than 2° between waypoints may be due to a
difference of the magnetic variation in the database versus the variation used in the Master CFP.
Any difference outside the ± 2° or ± 2NM should be rechecked and verified.
184                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

13.6.10.5. Upload winds. Some LRNS units allow the crew to upload projected winds. This
procedure allows more accurate reporting of ETAs.

13.6.10.6. Groundspeed check. The pilot/crew should confirm a groundspeed of zero (0) knots
prior to taxiing the aircraft. This procedure is a good practice to detect developing errors in the
LRNS.

13.7. Taxi and Prior to Take-Off.

13.7.1. Groundspeed check. During taxi to the active runway, pilots should ensure the
groundspeed is reasonable.

13.7.2. Present Position check. After departing the original parking location, the crew should
conduct another positional check against a know airfield location to ensure the accuracy of the
navigation system. Any out of tolerance condition or error in the LRNS should be resolved prior
to departing.

13.8. Climb Out.

13.8.1. Transition altitude. Crews should brief the transition altitude based on information from
the approach plate or from the ATIS. After climbing through the transition altitude, the
altimeters should be set according to airspace requirements.

13.8.2. Manually compute ETAs. After climbing above the sterile altitude and time permitting
crews should manually compute ETAs from departure to destination. These should be noted on
the Master CFP. This is an excellent crosscheck against ETAs computed by the LRNS.

13.9. Prior to Oceanic Entry.

13.9.1. Gross error accuracy check. Before oceanic entry, the accuracy of the LRNS should be
checked against a ground-based NAVAID. The results of the accuracy check should be recorded
with the time and position. A large difference between the ground-based NAVAID and the
LRNS may require immediate corrective action. Unless specifically stated in the aircraft
manual, crews should normally not attempt to correct an error by conducting an in-flight
alignment or by manually updating the LRNS. Research has indicated that if done incorrectly,
the possibility of a GNE increases.

13.9.2. HF checks. If the crew was unable to accomplish the HF and SELCAL checks on the
ground, these checks must be accomplished before oceanic entry.

13.9.3. Datalink Communications. Datalink communications are gradually being introduced
into the NAT environment for position reporting (via FANS 1/A ADS & CPDLC and also via
FMC WPR through ACARS) and for other air/ground ATS exchanges (using FANS 1/A
CPDLC). Operators approved to use Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC),
Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) or ACARS should log on to the appropriate FIR 15 to
45 minutes prior to the boundary.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              185



13.9.4. Obtain oceanic clearance.

13.9.4.1. The aircrew should obtain oceanic clearance from the appropriate clearance delivery.
(Clearance via voice should be at least 40 minutes prior to oceanic entry and via data link should
be 30 to 90 minutes prior to oceanic entry). It is important that aircrews to confirm the
navigational waypoints and enter oceanic airspace at the assigned altitude (this may be different
than the domestic cleared flight level). An oceanic clearance typically includes a route, flight
level and assigned MACH. Crews should include their requested flight level in their initial
clearance request. Some oceanic centers require pilots to advise them at the time of their oceanic
clearance “When Able Higher” (WAH). Crews should be confident that they are able to
maintain requested flight levels based on aircraft performance capabilities. For example,
“Global Air 543, 40 North 040 West at 1010, Flight Level 350, Estimating 40 North 050 West at
1110, 40 North 060 West Next. Able Flight Level 360 at 1035, Able Flight Level 370 at 1145,
Able Flight Level 390 at 1300.” It should be noted that ATC acknowledgement of a WAH
report (and any included requests) is NOT a clearance to change altitude.

13.9.4.2. Within RVSM Airspace greater opportunity exists for step climbs. Operators may
include step climbs in the flight plan, although each change of level during flight must be
requested from ATC by the pilot. The chance of approval of such requests will, of course, be
entirely dependent upon potential traffic conflicts. Outside the OTS there is a good likelihood of
achieving the requested profiles. However, within the prime OTS levels at peak times, ATC may
not always be able to accommodate requested flight level changes and prudent pre-flight fuel
planning should take this into consideration.

13.9.4.3. If a flight is expected to be level critical, operators should contact the initial Oceanic
Area Control Center (OAC) prior to filing of the flight plan to determine the likely availability of
specific flight levels.

13.9.5. Re-clearance. A re-clearance (that is different from the oceanic route requested with the
filed flight plan) is the primary cause upon which Gross Navigation Errors (GNEs) occur. A
crew should be very cautious when receiving a re-clearance. To mitigate a GNE occurrence
during the re-clearance process, after receiving the new routing, the aircrew should conduct
independent crosschecks after the LRNS, Master CFP and Plotting Chart are updated. It is
critical that crews check the magnetic course and distance between the new waypoints as noted
in PREFLIGHT under the paragraph “LRNS Programming.” Track and Distance charts are an
excellent resource to verify the accuracy of re-clearance waypoints inserted into the LRNS, as
the CFP may no longer be an accurate resource for this check. Track and Distance charts along
with other useful information is available at HQ AFFSA/A3ON on the Air Force Portal in the
file labeled Oceanic Navigation (under the “Communities” tab, search for HQ AFFSA/A3ON).
As a technique, a suggested checklist to use when receiving a re-clearance is provided in figure
13.5.

13.9.6. Altimeter checks. Since oceanic flight is normally conducted at RVSM altitudes (see
Chapter 4 of this manual), crews are recommended to crosscheck the two primary altimeters to
ensure they remain within T.O. tolerances (usually no more than within 200 ft of each other).
This check is conducted while at level flight. The stand-by altimeter should also be noted. The
altimeter readings should be recorded along with the time.

13.9.7. Compass heading check. It is recommended to conduct a compass heading check and
record the results. This check is particularly helpful with inertial systems. The check can also aid
in determining the most accurate compass if a problem develops over water.

13.10. After Oceanic Entry.

13.10.1. Squawk 2000. Thirty minutes after oceanic entry crews should Squawk 2000, if
applicable. Reference the Flight Information Publications, Area Planning and Enroute
Supplement for the airspace to find the specific regional differences. There may be regional
differences such as Squawking 2100 in Bermuda’s airspace or maintaining last assigned Squawk
in the West Atlantic Route System (WATRS). Crews transiting Reykjavik’s airspace must
maintain last assigned Squawk.

13.10.2. Maintain assigned Mach. Some oceanic clearances include a specific Mach. There is
no tolerance for this assigned Mach. The increased emphasis on longitudinal separation requires
crew vigilance in a separation based on assigned Mach. The requirement is to maintain the true
Mach which has been assigned by ATC. In most cases, the true Mach is the indicated Mach.
Some aircraft, however, require a correction factor.

13.10.3. VHF radios. After going beyond the range of the assigned VHF frequency, crews
should set their radios to guard frequency (121.5) and inter-plane (123.45 in most regions).

13.10.4. Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure (SLOP). This procedure is highly recommended
while operating within the organized track systems (OTS). The procedure entails either flying
the route centerline or offsetting the route by 1 NM or 2 NM to the right of centerline. Despite
existing safeguards provided by air traffic systems throughout the world, occasionally aircraft
end up at the wrong altitude or route. With the advent of highly accurate space based navigation
systems, when combined with an operational error, the risk of a midair collision increases.
SLOP allows a pilot or crew to choose an offset at random, thus, a lateral distribution of aircraft
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              187

is achieved reducing the overall risk of a midair collision along a particular route. As stated in
para 13.15.2, pilots and aircrew need to remove any lateral offset prior to reaching the “coast-in”
point when applied to oceanic navigation. Although a pilot/crew is normally required to
navigate their aircraft within 4 nm of airway centerline (sometimes higher deviations are
acceptable), due to the extreme accuracy of new navigation systems, SLOP still allows an
aircraft to remain within the permissible limits of the airway system. It also replaces the
contingency procedures developed for aircraft encountering wake turbulence. Despite its
effectiveness, depending upon winds aloft, coordination between aircraft to avoid wake
turbulence may be necessary. Aircraft that do not have an automatic offset capability (that can
be programmed in the LRNS) should fly the centerline only. See AFI 11-202 Vol 3, General
Flight Rules for additional guidance.

13.10.5. Hourly altimeter checks. Crews are required to observe the primary and stand-by
altimeters each hour. It is recommended that these hourly checks be recorded with the readings
and times. This documentation can aid crews in determining the most accurate altimeter if an
altimetry problem develops.

13.11. Approaching Waypoints.

13.11.1. Confirm next latitude/longitude. Within a few minutes of crossing an oceanic waypoint
crews should crosscheck the coordinates of that waypoint and the next waypoint. This check
should be done by comparing the coordinates against the Master CFP based on the currently
effective ATC clearance.

13.12. Overhead Waypoints.

13.12.1. Confirm aircraft transitions to next waypoint. When overhead an oceanic waypoint,
crews should check the aircraft transitions to the next leg. This is confirmed by noting the
magnetic heading and distance to the next waypoint compared against the Master CFP.

13.12.2. Confirm time to next waypoint. It is important to give ATC an accurate ETA to the
next waypoint. Since longitudinal separations have decreased in many regions, usually a change
a change of three minutes (or more depending on operational region) from the ETA requires a
notification to ATC to ensure traffic conflicts do not arise.

13.12.3. Position report. After passing over the oceanic waypoint, crews that give a position
report to ATC must use the standard format. Flights designated as meteorological (MET)
reporting flights or flights on random routes should be including in the position report additional
items such as winds and temperatures. Crews should also note and record their fuel status at
each oceanic waypoint. This is especially important if the cleared route and flight level differ
significantly from the filed flight plan.

13.13. 10-Minute Plot.

13.13.1. Record time and latitude/longitude on plotting chart. Approximately 10 minutes after
passing an oceanic waypoint, crews should plot the latitude, longitude and time on the plotting
188                                               AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

chart. It is advisable to plot the non-steering LRNS. A 10-minute plot can alert the crew to any
lateral deviation from their ATC clearance prior to it becoming a Gross Navigation Error. A
good crosscheck for the position of the 10-minute plot is that it is approximately 2° of longitude
past the oceanic waypoint at mid-latitudes on the East-West routing (e.g. at 460 knots
groundspeed at 50° latitude, 10 minutes of flight equates to 77 nm which is the distance of 2° of
longitude).

13.14. Mid-Point.

13.14.1. Midway between waypoints. It is good practice to crosscheck winds midway between
oceanic waypoints by comparing the Master CFP, LRNS and upper millibar wind chart. As noted
before, this information will be included in a position report if the flight has either been
designated as a MET reporting flight or is a flight on a random route. This crosscheck will also
aid crews in case there is a need for a contingency such as Dead Reckoning (DR).

13.14.2. Confirm time. It is recommended that during a wind check the crews also confirm the
ETA to the next waypoint noting the three (3) minute tolerance.

13.15. Coast In.

13.15.1. Compare ground based NAVAID to LRNS. When departing oceanic airspace and
acquiring ground based NAVAIDs, crews should note the accuracy of the LRNS by comparing it
to those NAVAIDs. Any discrepancy should be noted in the Maintenance Log.

13.15.2. Remove Strategic Lateral Offset. Crews using a “lateral offset” of 1NM or 2NM right
of centerline at oceanic entry should remove this “lateral offset” at coast in prior to exiting
oceanic airspace at the exit point. It is advisable to include this as a checklist item.

13.15.3. Confirm routing after oceanic exit. Before entering the domestic route structure, crews
must confirm their routing to include aircraft speed.

13.16. Descent.

13.16.1. Transition Level. During the approach briefing, crews should note the transition level
on the approach plate or verified by ATIS. Crews must be diligent when descending through the
transition level to reset the altimeters to QNH. This is particularly important when encountering
IFR, night or high terrain situations. Any confusion between a QNH setting with inches of
Mercury or hPa must be clarified.

13.17. Destination/Block-In.

13.17.1. Navigation Accuracy Check. When arriving at the destination gate, crews should note
any drift or circular error in the LRNS. A GPS Primary Means system normally should not
exceed 0.27NM for the flight. Some inertial systems may drift as much as 2NM per hour.
Because the present generation of LRNSs is highly accurate, operators should establish a drift
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                           189

tolerance which if exceeded would require a write-up in the Maintenance Log. RNP
requirements demand that drift be closely monitored.

13.17.2. RVSM write-ups. Problems noted in the altimetry system, altitude alert or altitude hold
must be noted in the Maintenance Log. The RVSM airspace is closely monitored for any Height
Deviations. An aircraft not meeting the strict RVSM standards must not be flight-planned into
RVSM airspace without corrective action.

Terms

Some terms printed here are reser ved for future use or are intende d to define a common
vocabulary for HQ AFFSA, MAJCOM, USAF aircrew and industry users of this AFMAN.

1090 ES – 1090mHz Extended Squitter: The most mature of the 3 ADS-B link options. A
“Squitter” provides a spontaneous transmission containing information about the aircraft’s
identification, position, altitude, velocity, and route of flight information. It uses the Mode S
transponders as a basis for operation.

8.33 KHz spacing – Due to frequency congestion in the 118-137 MHz range (voice
communications) in Europe, the normal spacing between frequencies (25 kHz) was further
divided into three 8.33 kHz bands.

ADS-B - Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast: Aircraft equipment that
automatically broadcasts routine messages which include its position (such as lat, long), velocity,
and altitude. Other information may also be included.

ADF – Automatic Direction Finder – An aircraft radio navigation system which senses and
indicates the direction to a L/MF nondirectional radio beacon (NDB) ground transmitter.
Direction is indicated to the pilot as a magnetic bearing or as a relative bearing to the
longitudinal axis of the aircraft depending on the type of indicator installed. In certain
applications, such as military, ADF operations may be based on airborne and ground transmitters
in the VHF/UHF frequency spectrum.

AFFSA - Air Force Flight Standards Agency: HQ USAF Field Operating Agency (FOA)
charged with the development, standardization, evaluation and certification of procedures,
equipment and standards to support global flight operations. Centrally manages ATCALS, the
AQP/SDP program, performs combat flight inspection, and instructs the Air Force Advanced
Instrument School for USAF pilots. Central agency responsible for global USAF Terminal
Instrument Procedures.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                            197

Airfield Qualification and Familiarization Program. A contractor-managed program that
supplements other USAF and MAJCOM methods to familiarize pilots with unique airports in
accordance with ICAO requirements. The published booklet or online version provides pictorial,
textual and graphical information on selected airfields (worldwide) that have been deemed to be
unique due to surrounding terrain, obstructions or complex approach and departure procedures.

Along Track Distance (LTD) - The distance measured from a point-in-space by systems using
area navigation reference capabilities that are not subject to slant range errors.

Altimeter Setting - The barometric pressure reading used to adjust a pressure altimeter for
variations in existing atmospheric pressure or to the standard altimeter setting (29.92).

Altitude - The height of a level, point, or object measured in feet Above Ground Level (AGL) or
from Mean Sea Level (MSL).

ANP – Actual Navigational Performance. A measure of the current estimated navigational
performance. Also referred to as Estimated Position Error (EPE).

ARC - The track over the ground of an aircraft flying at a constant distance from a navigational
aid by reference to distance measuring equipment (DME).

Area Navigation - Area Navigation (RNAV) provides enhanced navigational capability to the
pilot. RNAV equipment can compute the airplane position, actual track and ground speed and
then provide meaningful information relative to a route of flight selected by the pilot. Typical
equipment will provide the pilot with distance, time, bearing and crosstrack error relative to the
selected "TO" or "active" waypoint and the selected route. Several distinctly different
navigational systems with different navigational performance characteristics are capable of
providing area navigational functions.

ATC - Air Traffic Control - A service operated by appropriate authority to promote the safe,
orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic.

Aircraft Approach Category - A grouping of aircraft based on a speed of 1.3 times the stall
speed in the landing configuration at maximum gross landing weight. An aircraft must fit in only
one category. If it is necessary to maneuver at speeds in excess of the upper limit of a speed
range for a category, the minimums for the category for that speed must be used.

Aircraft Classes - For the purposes of Wake Turbulence Separation Minima, ATC classifies
aircraft as Heavy, Large, and Small as follows:

       a. Heavy- Aircraft capable of takeoff weights of more than 255,000 pounds whether or
       not they are operating at this weight during a particular phase of flight.
       b. Large- Aircraft of more than 41,000 pounds, maximum certificated takeoff weight, up
       to 255,000 pounds.
       c. Small- Aircraft of 41,000 pounds or less maximum certificated takeoff weight.
198                                              AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

Alternate Airport - An airport at which an aircraft may land if a landing at the intended airport
becomes inadvisable.

Bearing - The horizontal direction to or from any point, usually measured clockwise from true
north, magnetic north, or some other reference point through 360 degrees.

Civil Twilight. The period that begins at sunset and ends in the evening when the center of the
sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon and begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s
disk is 6 degrees below the horizon, and ends at sunrise. Use an authorized weather source, the
latest version of the Air Almanac, MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval
Observatory data to determine and calculate light and moon data.

Coastal Fix - A navigation aid or intersection where an aircraft transitions between the domestic
route structure and the oceanic route structure.

Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)—An
umbrella term used to describe the emerging avionics technologies and architecture of space and
ground-based systems designed to bring about the concept of “Free Flight.” Examples include:
RNAV/RNP, RVSM, CPDLC, ADS-B, elementary and enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, FM
Immunity, TCAS, and TAWS. Previously termed Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) by
the DoD.

CPDLC - Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications: An “email-like” data link between
pilots and ATC that will augment and may replace voice communications. The two
environments for CPDLC are currently Future Aeronautical Navigation System 1/A (FANS-1/A)
and the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).

DAP- Down link Aircraft Parameters: This is data down-linked to the ground, via the Mode S
transponder, that provides information about the aircraft operations and planned route. The three
types of DAP are “basic functionality” (flight ID, transponder capability, and flight status),
“enhanced” [EHS] and “elementary” [ELS] surveillance features also provide flight intent
information.

DA/DH -- Decision Altitude/Decision Height: As part of a precision approach (ILS, MLS or
PAR), it is the specified altitude at which a decision must be made to either continue the
approach if the pilot acquires the required visual references or execute a missed approach.  
Outside the NAS, decision altitude (DA) is referenced to mean sea level and decision height
(DH) is referenced to the threshold elevation.

Diverse Departure. If the airport has at least one published approach, the absence of any non-
standard takeoff minimums and/or IFR departure procedures for a specific runway normally
indicates that runway meets diverse departure criteria. Pilots departing a diverse runway may
climb runway heading to 400 ft. above the departure end of the runway (DER) elevation and then
turn in any direction provided the aircraft maintains a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM
until reaching the appropriate IFR altitude.

Diverse Vector Area - In a radar environment, it is that area in which a prescribed departure
route is not required as the only suitable route to avoid obstacles. It is the area in which random
radar vectors below the MVA/MIA, established in accordance with the TERPS criteria for
diverse departures, obstacles and terrain avoidance, may be issued to departing aircraft.

DoD FLIP - Department of Defense Flight Information Publications used for flight planning, en
route, and terminal operations. FLIP is produced by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency
(NIMA) for world-wide use. United States Government Flight Information Publications (en
route charts and instrument approach procedure charts) are incorporated in DoD FLIP for use in
the National Airspace System (NAS).

DP – see Instrument Departure Procedure.

EGI – Embedded GPS/INS: A military, self-contained navigation system that provides
positioning, velocity, and acceleration data for the aircraft. The EGI receives signals from the
GPS.

EHS – Enhanced Surveillance: Support of EHS consists of populating and maintaining three
Mode S transponder registers beyond those required for ELS: Selected Vertical Intention, Track
and Turn Report, and Heading and Speed Report.

ELS – Elementary Surveillance: Support of ELS consists primarily of populating and
maintaining four Mode S transponder registers: Data Link Capability Report, Common-Usage
Ground Initiated Comm B (GICB) Capability Report, Aircraft Identification (Flight ID), and
Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) resolution advisory.

Final Approach Course - A bearing/radial/track of an instrument approach leading to a runway
or an extended runway centerline all without regard to distance.

FAF - Final Approach Fix – On a IAP, it is the fix from which the final approach to an airport
is executed and which identifies the beginning of the final approach segment. It is designated on
Government charts by the Maltese Cross symbol for nonprecision approaches and the lightning
bolt symbol for precision approaches; or when ATC directs a lower-than-published
glideslope/path intercept altitude, it is the resultant actual point of the glideslope/path intercept.

FDE- Fault Detection/Exclusion: A GPS receiver capable of autonomously determining which
GPS satellite(s) is (are) causing the RAIM alert and then excluding the faulty satellite(s) from the
navigation solution. Flight in some civil airspace requires both RAIM and FDE.

Final Approach Point - The point, applicable only to a nonprecision approach with no depicted
FAF (such as an on airport VOR), where the aircraft is established inbound on the final approach
course from the procedure turn and where the final approach descent may be commenced. The
FAP serves as the FAF and identifies the beginning of the final approach segment.

Fix - A geographical position determined by visual reference to the surface, by reference to one
or more radio NAVAIDs, by celestial plotting, or by another navigational device.

system is updated with respect to position accuracy by reference to conventional navigation aids.

Free Flight - A safe and efficient operating capability under instrument flight rules in which the
pilot has the freedom to select routing, altitude, and speed in real time.

GBAS – Ground-Based Augmentation System: GBAS augments ground systems (typically at
an airport) with equipment similar in functionality to a GPS satellite. This augmentation allows
a properly equipped aircraft to increase the accuracy of the vertical/lateral GPS solution. The US
LAAS is a GBAS equivalent system.

GLS – GNSS Landing System: Hardware and software that augments the GPS SPS to provide
for precision approach and landing capability. Based on differential GPS concepts, the GLS
augments the basic GPS position data in order to increase the integrity, continuity, and accuracy
needed for a precision approach.

GMU – GPS-based Monitoring Unit: An on-board monitoring and recording unit composed
of a GPS receiver, computer and flight deck windows antennae. An alternative to the ICAO
requirement of overflying a Height Monitoring Unit (HMU) as a means to check aircraft for
RVSM compliance.

GNSS - Global Navigation Satellite System: An umbrella term adopted by ICAO to
encompass any independent satellite navigation system. GNSS provides suitably equipped
aircraft with enroute/terminal navigation with non-precision approach and precision approach
capabilities. The U.S. system is GPS.

GPS - Global Positioning System: A constellation of satellites that enables the user to receive
signals from six operational satellites nearly 100% of the time from most locations on Earth.
RAIM and FDE ensures the GPS derived solution meets the accuracy, availability, and integrity
requirements critical to flight safety

GPS-D – Differential GPS: DGPS is a GPS augmentation that uses differential corrections to
the basic satellite measurements that are performed within the receiver. DGPS is based upon
accurate knowledge of the geographic location of Earth reference stations. This knowledge is
used to compute corrections to GPS parameters, error sources, and/or resultant positions. These
differential corrections are then transmitted to GPS users, either from a ground-based station
[e.g., GBAS, LAAS] or from a satellite-based system [WAAS, EGNOS, GALILEO, etc]. GPS
receivers apply the corrections to their received GPS signals and compute a more precise
/optimum position. With differential GPS, civilian users can improve accuracy from 100 meters
to better than 10 meters. See GPS-PPS for military application.

GPS-PPS – GPS-Precise Positioning Service: The military maintains exclusive access to the
more accurate "P-code" (pseudo random code). It is much more accurate, much harder to jam
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              201

and spoof. To provide better protection to military aircraft, the DoD has encrypted the P-code to
form Y-code. Horizontal accuracy is less than ten meters.

GPS-SPS – GPS Standard Positioning Service: One of two levels of GPS service used by
both the military and civil aviation community in order to support aircraft navigation and
landing. Since a Presidential Order turned Selective Availability off, SPS horizontal accuracy is
about ten meters [vs. about 100 meters when SA is on].

minimums.

HMU - Height Monitoring Unit - A passive, ground-based system that measures the geometric
height of an aircraft for comparison with the geometric height of the flight level at which it is
being flown. The HMU calculates altimetry system error using meteorological information and
the Mode-C/S height data. Overflight of an HMU satisfies the ICAO requirement to check
aircraft for RVSM compliance. Additional information on RVSM monitoring program can be
found at: http://www.tc.faa.gov/act-500/niaab/rvsm/naarmo_intro.asp

ICAO - International Civil Aviation Organization – ICAO is a UN Specialized Agency,
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, and is the global forum for civil aviation that works to
achieve its vision of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through
cooperation amongst its member States. ICAO promotes understanding and security through
cooperative aviation regulation.

Inner Marker - A marker beacon used with an ILS (CAT II) precision approach located
between the middle marker and the end of the ILS runway, transmitting a radiation pattern keyed
at six dots per second and indicating to the pilot, both aurally and visually, that he/she is at the
designated decision height (DH), normally 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation, on the
ILS CAT II approach. It also marks progress during a CAT III approach.

INS - Inertial Navigation System: A self contained, dead reckoning system that senses the
acceleration along the three axes of the aircraft and calculates the distance traveled from a
reference point. Accuracy of the system decreases with time.

IAP - Instrument Approach Procedure - A series of predetermined maneuvers for the orderly
transfer of an aircraft under instrument flight conditions from the beginning of the initial
approach to a landing or to a point from which a landing may be made visually.

of visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for visual
meteorological conditions.

IF - Intermediate Fix - The fix that identifies the beginning of the intermediate approach
segment of an instrument approach procedure. The fix is not normally identified on the
instrument approach chart.

IFR - Instrument Flight Rules - Rules governing the procedures for conducting instrument
flight. Also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of flight plan.

LNAV- Lateral Navigation: A function of area navigation (RNAV) equipment which
calculates, displays, and provides lateral guidance to a profile or path.

Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). Procedures developed to expedite traffic flow at
civil and joint-use airports needing additional tools to increase capacity. Allows civilian aircraft
to operate on intersecting runways simultaneously.

Low Close-in Obstacles. Those obstacles within the Initial Climb Area that require an
excessive climb gradient to a climb-to-altitude of 200 feet or less above the Departure End of
Runway elevation or alternate takeoff weather minima. These obstacles are published in
NOTAMs, on the SID chart or in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure
Procedures section of the terminal procedure booklet. Typical chart notation is: “NOTE: Rwy
17L, tree 5610' from DER, 212' left of centerline, 82' AGL/2723' MSL.”

LPV- A type of approach with vertical guidance (APV) based on WAAS, published on RNAV
(GPS) approach charts. This procedure takes advantage of the precise lateral guidance available
from WAAS. The minima is published as a decision altitude (DA).

Marker Beacon - Marker beacons are identified by their modulation frequency and keying code,
and when received by compatible airborne equipment, indicate to the pilot, both aurally and
visually, that he/she is passing over the facility.
Minimum Descent Altitude - The lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to
which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution
of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided.

MMR – Multi-Mode Receiver: A radio receiver capable of processing several different
navigation and approach path functions that include Instrument Landing System (ILS), ILS
Marker Beacon, VOR, Microwave Landing System and GPS functions (such as WAAS and
LAAS).

MNPS – Minimum Navigation Performance Specification: Implemented in the North
Atlantic region between FL285-420, it specifies a number of equipment, training, and procedural
requirements. MNPS navigation accuracy is equivalent to RNP 12.6. Dual long-range
navigation systems (LRNS) and dual long-range communication systems are required. RVSM is
mandatory in MNPS airspace. Aircraft that cannot meet dual LRNS requirements may be
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             203

accommodated on special routings ("Blue Spruce" routes). Aircraft that cannot meet RVSM
requirements are excluded from MNPS airspace unless operating on an ALTRV.

Mode 4. Transponder mode established to enable IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) functions
between military aircraft or military aircraft and military ground stations. Uses classified codes,
but operates on 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz, the same frequency pair used by the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System that civil air traffic uses for Mode 3A/C, Mode S, and TCAS.
Mode 4 interrogation signals can suppress civil airborne transponders, therefore all Mode 4
operations in the NAS require prior authorization through the Air Force Frequency Management
Agency (AFFMA): affma.cc@pentagon.af.mil.

Mode 5. Mode 5 is the performance upgrade to the current Mark XII IFF transponder system.
Mode 5 provides new waveforms, new cryptography, more data, and improved radio frequency
(RF) link margin to resolve many of the deficiencies identified with Mark XII. It will eventually
replace the analog Mode 4 IFF system with digital IFF message formats which embed
unprecedented combat relevant data.

Mode S - Mode Select: The primary role of the Mode S transponder is to "selectively" respond
to interrogations [as opposed to responding to all interrogations] from a ground sensor or TCAS
to provide airborne data information including identification, equipage, and altitude.

Mountainous Terrain. Defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto
Rico. PANS-OPS defines mountainous terrain as an area over which the changes of surface
elevation exceed 900m (3,000 ft) within a distance of 18.5 km (10.0 NM), or 300 ft over a 1 NM
distance. AFFSA believes the PANS OPS definition is too restrictive, so instead chose to use the
definition from NATO’s ATP 56(B) (Part 3, Chapter 4) that defines mountainous terrain as 500
ft surface elevation change over a ½ NM distance.

National Airspace System (NAS). The NAS is the common network of United States (U.S.)
airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical
charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower and
material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military. United States, in a
geographical sense, means (1) the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
possessions, including the territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles) and (2) the airspace of
those areas. Note: IAW ICAO Article 12 and Annex 2 and 11, the United States has accepted
responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high seas beyond 12
miles from the coast (also known as international airspace). These flight information regions of
international airspace are: Oakland Oceanic, Anchorage Oceanic, Anchorage Continental,
Anchorage Arctic, Miami Oceanic, Houston Oceanic and New York Oceanic. Aircrews should
be aware that although they are being provided air traffic services by the FAA, they are operating
in international airspace and ICAO SARPS, FLIP, and AFIs are applicable. (See paragraph 1.2)

NOTAM – Notice to Airmen - A notice containing information (not known sufficiently in
advance to publicize by other means) concerning the establishment, condition, or change in any
component (facility, service, or procedure of, or hazard in the National Airspace System) the
timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.

twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.

Obstacle - An existing object, object of natural growth, or terrain at a fixed geographical
location or which may be expected at a fixed location within a prescribed area with reference to
which vertical clearance is or must be provided during flight operation.

Obstacle Climb Gradient. FLIP products often provide different climb gradients, ATC and
Obstacle. Only the obstacle climb gradient need be considered for OEI departure planning. If no
obstacle climb gradient is published, the aircraft must achieve a minimum climb gradient of 200
ft/nm, or as specified in paragraph 8.12.6. for OEI.

OCS - Obstacle Clearance Surface. The OCS is an obstacle evaluation surface associated with
each segment of an instrument procedure. The OCS can be either level or sloping. See Required
Obstacle Clearance (ROC) discussion below.

ODP – Obstacle Departure Procedure - A preplanned instrument flight rule (IFR) departure
procedure printed for pilot use in textual or graphic form to provide obstruction clearance via the
least onerous route from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure. ODPs are
recommended for obstruction clearance and may be flown without ATC clearance unless an
alternate departure procedure (SID or radar vector) has been specifically assigned by ATC.

Oceanic Airspace - Airspace over the oceans of the world, considered international airspace,
where oceanic separation and procedures per the International Civil Aviation Organization are
applied. Responsibility for the provisions of air traffic control service in this airspace is
delegated to various countries, based generally upon geographic proximity and the availability of
the required resources.

Oceanic Published Route - A route established in international airspace and charted or
described in flight information publications, such as Route Charts, DOD Enroute Charts, Chart
Supplements, NOTAMs, and Track Messages.

Organized Track System - A series of ATS routes which are fixed and charted; i.e., CEP,
NOPAC, or flexible and described by NOTAM; i.e., NAT TRACK MESSAGE.

Oceanic Transition Route - An ATS route established for the purpose of transitioning aircraft
to/from an organized track system.

One Engine Inoperative (OEI). Multi-engine aircraft are typically certified as airworthy after
demonstrating satisfactory control authority and climb capability after suffering the loss of one
engine at the most critical moment on takeoff. USAF multi-engine aircraft must be operated so
the aircraft is capable of experiencing such an event and still vertically clear all departure path
obstacles (even at night or while IMC). Therefore, using civilian “see and avoid” rules is
prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/CC or as published in a Special
MAJCOM Certification procedure.
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              205



OROCA. An off-route altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000 ft. buffer in
non-mountainous terrain areas and a 2,000 ft. buffer in designated mountainous areas within the
United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational
aids, air traffic control radar, or communications coverage.

ORTCA. An off-route altitude that provides terrain clearance with a 3,000 ft. buffer from
terrain. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational aids, air
traffic control radar, or communications coverage. This altitude is used on en route charts
covering those areas outside the United States.

Outer Marker - A marker beacon at or near the glideslope intercept altitude of an ILS approach.

PANS-OPS. ICAO documents detailing specific procedures for the safety of air traffic
navigation agreed to by ICAO signatories.

P-RAIM – Predictive RAIM: Using a standard set of algorithms, the availability of RAIM may
be determined based on the satellite coverage expected at an aircraft’s ETA. Due to terrain
masking and other factors (e.g. satellite fails after RAIM prediction made), P-RAIM does not
guarantee there will actually be sufficient satellite coverage on arrival. P-RAIM does not have
to reside in the GPS receiver. It can be provided by FAA Flight Service (US NAS only) and
other ground based RAIM algorithms.

PRM Approach. An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to parallel runways
whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300 ft. and the parallel runways have a
Precision Radar Monitoring (PRM) system that permits simultaneous independent ILS
approaches. See: http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm/.

electronic glideslope/glidepath is provided; e.g., ILS, MLS, and PAR.

Procedure Turn - The maneuver prescribed when it is necessary to reverse direction to establish
an aircraft on the intermediate approach segment or final approach course. The outbound course,
direction of turn, distance within which the turn must be completed, and minimum altitude are
specified in the procedure. However, unless otherwise restricted, the point at which the turn may
be commenced and the type and rate of turn are left to the discretion of the pilot.

QNE - The barometric pressure used for the standard altimeter setting (29.92 inches Hg.).

QNH - The barometric pressure as reported by a particular station.

RADAR – A device which, by measuring the time interval between transmission and reception

azimuth and/or elevation, provides information on range, azimuth, and/or elevation of objects in
the path of the transmitted pulses.
206                                                AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009

Radar Required. This note on an instrument procedure indicates aircraft using the procedure
will be monitored by ATC radar during a particular phase of flight or throughout the entire
procedure, as applicable. Coordination with air traffic is necessary to ensure ATC capability and
agreement to provide these services before adding the note to any instrument procedure. Note:
Instrument procedures with radar requirements should be avoided whenever possible.

RAIM - Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring: RAIM is a two-step process used to
assess the integrity of the GPS signals in the receiver. First, the GPS receiver determines if five
or more working satellites are above the horizon and in the proper geometry to make RAIM
available. Second, based upon the range solutions from those satellites it must determine if the
RAIM algorithm indicates a potential navigation error. Flight in some civil airspace requires
RAIM and FDE.

Reduced Same Runway Separation. Allows reduction of the normal ATC aircraft separation
standards during landing/touch-and-go and restricted low approach operations to increase the
airport/runway capacity.

Remote/Island Destination. Any aerodrome that, due to its unique geographic location, offers
no suitable alternate (civil or military) within two (2) hours flying time.

Reporting Point – A geographical location in relation to which the position of an aircraft can be
reported.

RMI - Radio Magnetic Indicator - An aircraft navigational instrument coupled with a gyro
compass or similar compass that indicates the direction of a selected NAVAID and indicates
bearing with respect to the heading of the aircraft.

RNP - Required Navigation Performance: Prescribes the system performance necessary for
operation in a specified airspace, based on its required accuracy (RNP value). The basic
accuracy requirement for RNP-X airspace is for the aircraft to remain within X nautical miles of
the cleared position for 95% of the time in RNP airspace.

RNAV – Area Navigation: Rather than fly established airways from one ground NAVAID to
another, RNAV permits suitably equipped aircraft to operate on any desired course between
virtual waypoints.

RNAV Approach - An instrument approach procedure which relies on aircraft area navigation
equipment for navigational guidance.

ROC - Required Obstacle Clearance - ROC is the minimum measure of obstacle clearance
considered to supply a satisfactory level of vertical protection. The ROC is added to the OCS.
The level of vertical protection provided is based on variety of factors. First, the aircraft meets
required performance standards based on the certification process. Second, the pilot operates the
aircraft IAW procedures outlined in the T.O. Additionally, it is predicated on all aircraft systems
functioning normally, required NAVAIDS are performing within flight inspection parameters,
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                             207

and the pilot is conducting instrument operations in accordance with directives. ROC is
provided through application of either a level or sloping ROC.

Runway Environment. The runway environment consists of one or more of the following
elements: The approach light system (except that the pilot may not descend below 100 ft. above
the Touch Down Zone Elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red
termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable), the threshold,
threshold markings or threshold lights, the runway end identifier lights, the touchdown zone
lights, the runway or runway markings, the runway lights, the visual approach slope indicator.
For more information, refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.

RVR - Runway Visual Range - The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or landing at
which the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position
above a specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of
pilots at touch down. This value is normally determined by instruments located alongside and
about 14 ft. above the runway and calibrated with reference to the high-intensity runway lights.

RVSM - Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum - Reduces the vertical separation between
properly equipped and certified aircraft to 1000 ft in special qualification airspace, normally
between FL290-410 inclusive.

SDP - Special Departure Procedure - A procedure designed to allow a safe takeoff for multi-
engine aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the minimum climb gradient
requirement. The runway and all obstacles along a chosen takeoff path are analyzed and
compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb performance. The procedure provides a
maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given performance conditions that ensure vertical
and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The minimum allowable gross and net climb
gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS standards. Unlike TERPS, the takeoff path is
selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles within the lateral
limits of the chosen flight path are considered. The term SDP encompasses both the use of the
textual obstacle data table information and the graphical departure procedures.

Single Medium Display - A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down
Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) presenting flight instrumentation on a
single display such as a HUD combiner, a “glass” multifunction display, or a helmet visor.

Simplified Directional Facility - A NAVAID used for nonprecision instrument approaches. The
final approach course is similar to that of an ILS localizer except that the SDF course may be
offset from the runway, generally not more than 3 degrees, and the course may be wider than the
localizer, resulting in a lower degree of accuracy.

SID - Standard Instrument Departure - A preplanned instrument flight rule (IFR) air traffic
control (ATC) departure procedure printed for pilot/controller use in graphic form to provide
obstacle clearance and a transition from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure.

Standard Rate Turn – A turn of three degrees per second.

Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) - A preplanned instrument flight rule (IFR) air traffic
control arrival procedure published for pilot use in graphic and/or textual from. STARs provide
transition from the en route structure to an outer fix or an instrument approach fix/arrival
waypoint in the terminal area.

Stepdown Fix – A fix permitting additional descent within a segment of an instrument approach
procedure by identifying a point at which a controlling obstacle has been safely overflown.

TACAN – An ultra-high frequency electronic air navigation aid which provides suitably
equipped aircraft a continuous indication of bearing and distance to a TACAN station.

TAWS - Terrain Alert Warning System - Generic term for any on-board system taking inputs
from terrain databases, radar altimeter, aircraft position sensors, etc. to activate a Ground
Proximity Warning System (GPWS) or Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System
(AGCAS). Developed to help prevent Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) mishaps.

TCAS - Traffic Collision Avoidance System - An airborne system that functions independently
of the ground-based radar to provide collision avoidance protection between suitably equipped
aircraft. TCAS I provides proximity warnings to pilots in the form of traffic advisories (TAs).

radio signals from interrogators on the ground, and selectively replies with a specific reply pulse
or pulse group only to those interrogations being received on the mode to which it is set to
respond.

TCH - Threshold Crossing Height – The theoretical height above the runway threshold at
which the aircraft’s glideslope antenna would be if the aircraft maintains the trajectory
established by the mean ILS glideslope of MLS glidepath.

Terminal Area – A general term used to describe airspace in which approach control service or
airport traffic control service is provided.

Unmonitored Navigational Aid - Most NAVAIDs have internal monitoring systems that
provide automatic shutdown or notification when a malfunction occurs. Unmonitored
NAVAIDs lack the ability to immediately notify ATC when a malfunction occurs. The pilot
may still use the NAVAID for all types of navigation, including instrument approaches, but must
AFMAN11-217V3 23 FEBRUARY 2009                                                              209

monitor the NAVAID for a loss of identification since no prior warning of operation may be
available from ATC.

VHF – Very High Frequency - The frequency band between 30 and 300 MHz. Portions of this
band, 108 to 118 MHz, are used for certain NAVAIDs; 118 to 136 MHz are used for civil
air/ground voice communications.

VDP – Visual Descent Point - A defined point on the final approach course of a nonprecision
straight-in approach procedure from which normal descent from the MDA to the runway
touchdown point may be commenced, provided the approach threshold of that runway, or
approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the approach end of that runway are clearly
visible to the pilot.

VMC - Visual Meteorological Conditions - Meteorological conditions in which visual flight
rules may be used; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from
clouds along the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological
conditions prevail and instrument flight rules must be followed.

Vortices - Circular patterns of air created by the movement of an airfoil through the air when
generating lift. As an airfoil moves through the atmosphere in sustained flight, an area of area of
low pressure is created above it. The air flowing from the high pressure area to the low pressure
area around and about the tips of the airfoil tends to roll up into two rapidly rotating vortices,
cylindrical in shape. These vortices are the most predominant parts of aircraft wake turbulence
and their rotational force is dependent upon the wing loading, gross weight, and speed of the
generating aircraft. The vortices from medium to heavy aircraft can be of extremely high
velocity and hazardous to smaller aircraft.

VNAV- Vertical Navigation. A function of area navigation (RNAV) equipment which
calculates, displays, and provides vertical guidance to a profile or path. Also used as a term that
describes using GPS lateral and vertical guidance to define the minimums for a GPS non-
precision or precision approach.

Wake Turbulence - Phenomena resulting from the passage of an aircraft through the
atmosphere. The term includes vortices, thrust stream turbulence, jet blast, jet wash, propeller
wash, and rotor wash both on the ground and in the air.

WGS-84. World Geodetic Survey-1984: Developed by the U.S. for world mapping, WGS 84 is
an earth fixed global reference frame. It is the ICAO standard.
