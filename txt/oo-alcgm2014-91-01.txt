MEMORANDUM FOR OO-ALC

FROM: OO-ALC/DV

SUBJECT: Ogden Air Logistics Complex (OO-ALC) Guidance Memorandum (GM) for
           Workplace Food and Drink

ACCESSIBILITY: Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-
publishing website at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.

RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

1. By Order of the Ogden Air Logistics Complex Commander, this GM immediately
implements OO-ALCGM2014-91-01, Workplace Food and Drink. Compliance with this GM is
mandatory. To the extent its direction is inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the
information herein prevails, in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-360,
Publications and Forms Management.

2. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, a toxic chemical/material
is “any substance which may be harmful to the environment or hazardous to your health if
inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin.” Reference
http://chemistry.about.com/od/toxicchemicals/f/What-Is-A-Toxic-Chemical.htm. Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states “Hazardous and toxic substances are defined as
those chemicals present in the workplace which are capable of causing harm. In this definition,
the term chemical includes dusts, mixtures, and common materials such as paints, fuels, and
solvents.” Reference https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/hazardoustoxicsubstances/index.html.

3. OSHA Standard 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.141, Sanitation, stipulates: “No
employee shall be allowed to consume beverage in any area exposed to a toxic material.” Areas
where chemicals or substances may be in concentrations at a level near or above a permissible
exposure limit (PEL) are designated as restricted areas, therefore food/drink are not allowed.

4. Clearly marked and designated areas that are free from toxic substances (e.g. break rooms,
lunch rooms, etc.) are established throughout the OO-ALC where consumption of food/drink are
allowed. Reference Hill Air Force Base Instruction (HAFBI) 48-107, Control of Thermal Stress;
OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1025, Lead; OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1026, Chromium (VI);
and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910. 1027, Cadmium.

earlier.

                    Additional OO-ALC Local Guidance and Instructions
PURPOSE
The OO-ALC is committed to improving and sustaining employee health and well-being. All
employees are highly encouraged to remain hydrated at all times. Good sanitation practices are
essential to a healthy workforce. Constant vigilance must be maintained when working in
industrial areas containing potential chemical hazards. It is highly encouraged that employees
thoroughly wash hands before consuming food and beverages, or using tobacco products after
performing work in an industrial area. Washing of hands prior to consuming food and
beverages, or using tobacco products after performing work in a regulated area is mandatory.
1. General Information. Within industrial areas, the consumption of food and beverages is
approved in designated break areas, enclosed administrative areas, and enclosed shop floor
modular office areas/buildings. Personnel transporting food through any facility to one of the
authorized areas mentioned above shall ensure that food remains sealed or covered until reaching
their destination (i.e. transporting food or beverages from snack bar or approved refrigerator to
authorized area).
1.1. Some maintenance production areas in the OO-ALC expose personnel to toxic materials or
substances. As a result, consumption of beverages is not authorized in areas recognized as
“regulated” areas in the associated industrial hygiene assessments and are delineated with
controlled entry areas.
1.2. In an effort to afford personnel an opportunity to consume beverages (e.g. stay hydrated,
enjoy a soda or a cup of coffee, sip on a Gatorade, etc.) while in exposed environments that are
below a PEL and not included in paragraph 1.4., the following provisions will apply:
1.2.1. If an area is exposed to toxics below the PEL and not included in paragraph 1.4.,
beverages may be consumed if the beverage container:
1.2.1.1. Is not a safety or FOD hazard in any way.
1.2.1.2. Does not interfere with the task or operation.
1.2.1.3. Is authorized to be in the area by the site supervisor.
1.2.1.4. Is completely contained in unbreakable and re-sealable container (examples include
plastic bottles with screw caps, coffee mugs with sealed drinking spouts, camelbacks with straw
caps, etc.).
1.2.1.5. Is only opened immediately prior to and closed immediately after consumption.
1.2.1.6. Drinking orifice is covered when closed.
1.3. If supervisors consider allowing beverages into an area exposed to toxics below a PEL (with
the exception of areas identified in paragraph 1.4.), the following stipulations apply:
1.3.1. Decision must be documented and coordinated with 75th Bioenvironmental Engineering
(75 AMDS/SGPB) and OO-ALC Safety (OO-ALC/SE).
1.3.2. This GM policy must be briefed to all personnel and the briefing documented on Air
Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Form 316, Supervisor Safety Meeting Minutes.
1.3.3. Supervisors must include this decision in the Job Hazard Analysis.
