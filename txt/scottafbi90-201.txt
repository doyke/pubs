   1.1. The Wing Exercise and Evaluation Team (EET) Program is designed to help
   commanders lead their units to sustained excellence, compliance, and readiness during
   emergency contingency operations and Operation Plan (OPLAN) taskings. The EET
   Program provides guidance on managing and conducting locally devised exercises. It also
   gives feedback to commanders on mission areas that need additional training or oversight, as
   well as identifies outstanding processes and performers. It is a comprehensive tool for
   commanders at all levels to ensure compliance with regulatory guidance, find and document
   deviations from the guidance, and make lasting corrections if/when deviations are
   discovered.
   1.2. The 375 AMW must be prepared to respond to any emergency operation, to include
   deployments, major accidents, natural disasters, severe weather, enemy attack, terrorist
   events involving weapons of mass destruction, and security incidents. Units must train,
   exercise, and be evaluated against specific standards. EET members will use Major
   Command (MAJCOM) Inspector General (IG) standardized exercise evaluation criteria,
   OPLAN taskings, and functional area directives to evaluate unit procedures and provide
   feedback to their commanders.
2. Program Management.
   2.1. The 375 AMW Commander provides overall program oversight for the EET.
   2.2. The 375 AMW EET is functionally aligned under Wing Plans (375 AMW/XP).
   2.3. The Chief, Exercise Evaluation Team (375 AMW/XPI) manages all operational aspects
   of the EET.
   2.4. The EET Chief will identify, plan, conduct, and critique all required wing exercises.
   2.5. The 375 AMW Commander will direct the times and types of exercises to be conducted.
   2.6. Safety and security will be emphasized during all exercises.
   2.7. Group commanders, unit commanders, and staff agency chiefs must appoint program
   managers and monitors within their units to comply with the requirements of this instruction.
   Ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the group and squadron EET programs rests with the
   unit commander.

 6                                                            SCOTTAFBI90-201 16 MAY 2012


        5.1.1. These Point of Contacts (POCs) will be the Unit commander’s “Trusted Agents”
        to plan no-notice exercises/scheduled exercises as required and will interact directly with
        375 AMW/XPI in the primary planning process. Trusted agents will not discuss those
        parts of the exercise deemed “close hold info” by the EET Chief with anyone to ensure a
        true assessment of capabilities.
        5.1.2. These POCs/planners will also be fully qualified as EET members. As such, they
        must be functional experts, exhibit a high degree of maturity, and must be a company
        grade officer and/or technical sergeant and above who possess a 7–level skill proficiency
        (as a minimum), unless waived by the EET Chief or their respective group commander.
        This skill level waiver should only be approved in exceptional situations in order to
        maintain highly skilled and experienced EET personnel.
        5.1.3. Ensure EET members properly document evaluations and units take corrective
        actions on exercise discrepancies by using Attachment 4.
        5.1.4. Ensure EET members requested by 375 AMW/XPI are available for all planning
        sessions prior to all exercises. Failure to have representatives in attendance will result in
        notification to the commander.
     5.2. Ensure enough EET members are appointed and trained to ensure 24-hour coverage of
     unit functions during exercises. Once assigned, changes to the team must be kept at a
     minimum to ensure valuable experience and continuity is not lost. Once assigned, EET
     members should remain on the team for a minimum of 24 months. EET assignment becomes
     the EET member’s primary duty during exercises until released by the EET Chief.
     5.3. Confer with their EET POCs, planners, and exercise evaluators to determine specific
     exercise requirements for their units or functional area. Review required exercise objectives
     annually as a minimum and submit updated listing to the EET Chief.
     5.4. Ensure a unit/functional POC takes corrective actions on exercise discrepancies. It is
     not the EET representative’s duties to correct any discrepancies they discover during
     exercises, as this is counter-productive to documenting discrepancies.
6. Unit EET Team Chief (POCs) will:
     6.1. Keep their commander/director of staff informed of all EET activities unless directed
     otherwise by the EET Chief (375 AMW/XPI). This may occur when the wing commander
     wants to initiate a “cold start/no notice” inspection/evaluation exercise.
     6.2. Assist their commander/director of staff to formulate a planned exercise program and
     objectives that meet group, squadron, and staff agency training and exercise requirements.
     6.3. Review group and subordinate squadron training objectives annually as a minimum and
     submit updated requirements to the EET Chief. Submit as a signed memorandum for record
     from the commander/agency chief.
     6.4. Coordinate and screen all unit exercise inputs (exercise scenarios, discrepancy, and
     corrective actions) for the commander/director of staff’s review prior to submission to the
     EET Chief.
     6.5. Attend applicable EET training classes, exercise planning, and debriefing meetings.
SCOTTAFBI90-201 16 MAY 2012                                                                     7


  6.6. Develop and maintain a unit EET program continuity book IAW Attachment 2. As a
  minimum, it must include the following items; a copy of the EET appointment letter, roster
  of all unit EET evaluators, 375 AMW EET Handbook, copy of Scott AFB Instruction 90-101
  Severe Weather Operations, copies of previous exercise reports for the current and previous
  year, copies of unit inputs provided for the current and previous year, copy of all unit
  exercise corrective action, and a copy of the most current Scott AFB exercise schedule.
  6.7. Identify specific wartime functions/operations that require continuous practice in order
  to maintain proficiency.
  6.8. Ensure unit METLs are tested in local exercises when possible.
  6.9. Establish the desired frequency of unit functional activities to ensure required levels of
  proficiency in wartime skills.
  6.10. Brief their group commanders on the readiness status of their units at least once
  quarterly. These briefings will include practice events held, deficiencies noted and corrective
  actions taken.
  6.11. Evaluate and validate unit deployment manager, contingency work-center positions,
  and unit control centers are manned with fully-trained individuals.
  6.12. Evaluate training records ensuring deploying personnel are fully trained in ATSO
  procedures, receive annual refresher training as well as encourage ATSO practice sessions to
  deploying personnel.
  6.13. Accomplish 100 percent review of AMC Instruction 10-403, Air Mobility Command
  (AMC) Force Deployment, requirements.
  6.14. EET members will emphasize SAFETY during all exercise operations.
  6.15. Ensure their units develop supporting plans detailing training and practice programs,
  and task qualification training, to include POC, responsibilities, and how they will ensure
  competency in required wartime and contingency skills. Retain these plans to meet Air
  Force/AMC reporting requirements.
  6.16. Ensure specific shortfalls, and limiting factors are reported IAW current procedures.
  6.17. Through their EET members, identify limitations in supporting provisions of this
  directive and the ability to participate in specific exercises.
  6.18. Ensure deployable units under their command develop internal checklists to evaluate
  practice events.
  6.19. Build checklists from AMC METLs specific to the units’ unit training codes.
  6.20. Ensure participating agencies listed in exercise reports as having deficiencies will
  monitor and document corrective actions as part of the unit’s SIP. Send a reply of corrective
  action for deficiencies identified in written reports to the EET chief and an information copy
  to the readiness flight.
  6.21. Appoint personnel to assist with the management of the EET munitions account.

Section C—Exercise Procedures

11. EET Procedures.
SCOTTAFBI90-201 16 MAY 2012                                                                     9


  11.1. Unless directed otherwise by the 375 AMW/CC, the EET Chief will announce in
  advance all exercises as early as possible in order to maximize training/participation and
  minimize unit, customer, or patient inconvenience. Coordination is required with tenants to
  maximize their training opportunity.
  11.2. Prior to each exercise, the EET Chief will coordinate with the group EET POCs to
  develop the exercise objectives, scenario, ground rules, security, and safety items.
     11.2.1. Example of the form used for approved exercise simulations for each exercise
     type is located at Attachment 6. These simulations require no additional approval and
     will be incorporated into all exercise scenarios.
  11.3. Groups may submit additional exercise requirements for review and approval by the
  375 AMW/CC.
  11.4. All exercise messages (verbal and written) will state, “This is an exercise” or
  “Exercise Input” before and after the main text. Any exercise communication required to
  off-base agencies or headquarters not participating in the exercise will be simulated by
  contacting the EET Chief or a duly appointed representative, unless briefed prior to the event.
  11.5. Closure of active runways and taxiways during exercises will be at the discretion of the
  wing commander and coordinated with 375th Operations Support Squadron Base Operations
  (OSS/OSAA).
  11.6. When an exercise requires an area/facility evacuation, commanders and supervisors
  must take immediate steps to evacuate their personnel. If classified materials can be secured,
  then all personnel will evacuate; if not, one custodian must remain to safeguard the material.
  Custodial control will be maintained over all money collection/storage areas.
  Commanders/supervisors will pre-determine the minimum personnel required to maintain
  effective control of the activity; all other personnel are to evacuate.
     11.6.1. Certain key facilities and work areas are critical to the safe operations of the base
     and must remain functional and therefore are exempt from evacuations. Restrict entry
     into facilities exempt from total evacuation to essential personnel and people having
     legitimate business within the facility. Personnel who were conducting business inside
     these facilities when an evacuation was directed may continue their business but must
     remain inside the facility until the evacuation portion of the exercise is over. EET
     members will check the evacuation plans of exempted facilities and question assigned
     personnel to make sure they know how to evacuate.
  11.7. During an exercise, the Incident Commander (IC) will be required to demonstrate
  actual cordon requirements. After cordon capability has been properly demonstrated, and
  after consultation with the senior EET representative on scene, the cordon may be reduced
  using the approved MAJCOM 10 percent rule. This will minimize interference with other
  on-base activities. If a reduced cordon is approved and established, the IC will brief the EET
  on all appropriate entry control points, traffic control points, and access routes for the
  originally required cordon.
  11.8. Exercises will be terminated by the wing commander or EET Chief. Any EET
  member observing an unsafe condition will use the code words “KNOCK OFF” to freeze
  activities in the affected area until steps are taken to correct the unsafe condition and, if
 10                                                       SCOTTAFBI90-201 16 MAY 2012


   necessary, may place the exercise on temporary “hold” until the unsafe conditions have been
   eliminated. Safety deviations will be included in exercise reports. Realistic exercises are
   essential to good training; therefore, simulated actions will be minimized. The term
   “KNOCK OFF” is a specific radio call over the EET net only. This is only used by EET
   members to alert all EET members that a situation has occurred that requires the exercise to
   be placed on temporary hold or terminated immediately. EET members will respond to the
   area, assess the situation and make a determination to place the exercise on hold or to
   terminate based on events.
   11.9. All evaluating EET members will wear specific EET items identifying them as
   evaluators during exercises. EET members wearing flight suits must wear the approved
   black EET baseball hat, approved EET reflective belt (yellow), and the EET identification
   badge. EET personnel wearing airman battle uniforms may not wear the EET baseball hat
   but will wear the EET belt (yellow) and badge. Exception: EET personnel performing as a
   role player will not wear visible EET identification items.
12. Reports.
   12.1. EET members will document exercise discrepancies, observations, outstanding
   performers and recommended corrective actions.
   12.2. The wing commander will receive a formal debriefing of exercise results, noted
   problem areas, and announce outstanding performers (if any) as soon as possible after
   exercise termination. The briefing will be conducted with group, squadron commanders,
   staff agency chiefs, and other invited participants.
   12.3. The EET Chief will prepare a written report for each exercise conducted. The report
   will include the exercise’s objectives, scenario, exercise results, and any recommended
   actions. The EET Chief will establish an OPR for all discrepancies or other problem areas.
   The after action report will be signed by the EET Chief.
   12.4. Group/unit commanders and/or staff agency chiefs who have identified deficiencies
   will provide corrective actions as part of the unit’s self-inspection program. Corrective
   action will be updated every 30 days until all deficiencies have been corrected and closed.
13. EET Training Requirements.
   13.1. Initial training. All 375 AMW EET personnel must attend an initial training class
   within 60 days of being assigned to the EET. The prerequisites to attend the class are the
   completion of the Advanced Distance Learning System (ADLS) EET Course, Unit Control
   Center Course, and Air Force Emergency Response Operations (AERO) Command and
   Control (C2) Course. Course completion certificates must be provided to XPI prior to the
   attending the class.
   13.2. Refresher EET training is required every 20 months for the following training:
      13.2.1. Initial/Refresher EET training class.
      13.2.2. ADLS EET Course.
