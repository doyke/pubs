Chapter 1           Introduction to the Facility Maintenance
                    Element
1.1   Organization and          Volume 3, Facility Maintenance, is a guide to the mission,
      Function                  objectives, and management of the Facility Maintenance
                                Element of the Operations Flight. The pamphlet offers
                                guidance by suggesting options and tools to successfully
                                perform the mission. Successful alternatives to these sug-
                                gestions are encouraged and authorized.

                                The Operations Flight is responsible for all activities re-
                                quired to operate, maintain, repair, and construct installa-
                                tion real property. The flight is composed of five elements
                                to process requirements in an efficient and timely manner.
                                These elements are Maintenance Engineering, Facility
                                Maintenance, Material Acquisition, Infrastructure Support,
                                and Heavy Repair.

1.2   Mission                   The mission of the Facility Maintenance Element of the
                                Operations Fight, as referenced from AFI 32-1001, Opera-
                                tions Management, is:

                                Facility Maintenance Work Centers' mission is to estab-
                                lish all recurring work, minor maintenance and repair, and
                                selected work orders. Because the facility maintenance
                                manager controls the people and resources within the work
                                centers, they can work directly with the customer to exe-
                                cute work. The facility maintenance manager meets with
                                facility managers during periodic visits and records minor
                                maintenance and repair requirements on AF Form 1219,
                                BCE Multi-Craft Job Order or direct scheduled work order
                                (DSWO). Work beyond work center capability or approval
                                is forwarded to the next approval level. Large work order
                                requirements are considered by the Work Request Review
                                Board (WWRB) who determines the priority of execution
                                and method of accomplishment.

1.3   Objectives                The Element has four overall objectives:
                                (1)    provide single-point customer support;
                                (2)    establish periodic facility reviews;
                                (3)    maintain, repair, and modify real property; and
                                (4)    perform the recurring work program.
                                The following is a brief review of these objectives. Chap-
                                ters 2 through 5 are an in-depth look at each, providing

                                   guidance and offering tools and suggestions that can be
                                   used to meet the objectives; thus, fulfilling the mission of
                                   the Facility Maintenance Element.

1.3.1 Single-point Customer        The work center customer service unit (CSU) is the pri-
      Service                      mary interface between the Civil Engineer (CE) and the
                                   base customers. The facility maintenance managers control
                                   the resources within their particular work center. As a re-
                                   sult, the facility maintenance manager can schedule and
                                   execute work requirements based upon verbal or written
                                   guidance directly from the customer. Facility maintenance
                                   managers should establish a working relationship with the
                                   facility managers and meet with them frequently.

                                   Facility maintenance managers are also responsible for the
                                   training of building managers or custodians. The facility
                                   maintenance manager controls the resources within the
                                   work center, establishes periodic facility visits and reviews,
                                   and works with the building mangers to establish sched-
                                   ules. Building managers are encouraged to be good stew-
                                   ards by performing those minor maintenance tasks that do
                                   not require specialized crafts. Training is necessary to pro-
                                   vide instructions on who to call in CE, when they should
                                   call, and the proper procedures for submitting work re-
                                   quests.

1.3.2 Facility Reviews             The facility maintenance manager should attempt to sched-
                                   ule facility visits based on 30- to 90- day cycles, or as re-
                                   quired, and accomplish all recurring work, minor mainte-
                                   nance and repair, and selected work orders. Facility reviews
                                   performed by the building manager/custodian and the civil
                                   engineer personnel foster a sense of ownership and stew-
                                   ardship. This reinforces our commitment to providing cus-
                                   tomer service.

1.3.3 Maintain, Repair, and        The periodic facility visits are used to validate and record
      Modify Real Property         minor maintenance and repair requirements on an Air Force
                                   Form 1219, BCE Multi-Craft Job Order, a direct scheduled
                                   work order or an AF Form 332, BCE Work Request. Minor
                                   modifications to real property can be accomplished within
                                   the work center based on available manpower, man-hours,
                                   and skill level capabilities on a direct scheduled work or-
                                   der. These modifications would not normally result in a
                                   change to the facility configuration or require capitaliza-
                                   tion. When such modifications are necessary, the work
                                   center CSU will assist the customer in the development of
                                   planned work orders and provide feedback on the method

                                of accomplishment and status updates. The CE personnel
                                and the customers work as a team to share the responsibili-
                                ties associated with good stewardship and maximizing re-
                                sources.

1.3.4 Recurring Work            After emergency and urgent requirements, the facility
      Program (RWP)             maintenance manager ensures recurring work is accom-
                                plished by reserving hours for this work scheduling before
                                other routine requirements. For the most efficient use of
                                available resources and time management, the RWP should
                                be established so the majority of the requirements are
                                scheduled and accomplished during the facility review cy-
                                cles.

1.4   Manpower                  Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 44EO, Operations
                                Flight details the manning for the Operations Flight. Using
                                the detailed formulas and determining the applicable man-
                                power ranges, manpower managers can consult the pro-
                                vided Standard Manpower Tables to identify the manning
                                of the Facility Maintenance Element needs.

                                While some command and base variations may make man-
                                ning requirements unique, the Civil Engineer formed the
                                original, typical Objective Squadron, Facility Maintenance

                                bers and types of Air Force specialties (AFS) authorized. A
                                senior, non-commissioned officer or civilian was desig-
                                nated to be the chief or manager. Civilians and enlisted

                                3E3X1, 3E4X1, and 3E6X1 may be selected to fill the Fa-
                                cility Maintenance Element manpower positions.

1.4.1 Training                  The appropriate training prior to assignment is essential for
                                acceptable work performance.

1.4.2 Enlisted Workforce        The requirement for having a military workforce is to meet
                                the wartime contingency taskings. Each Major Command
                                (MAJCOM) has a military strength distributed to each in-
                                stallation. There is some flexibility in the overall military-
                                to-civilian mix based on the core AFS requirements (Ap-
                                pendix B). Assistance in determining the right mix and
                                numbers required to meet specific base needs can be ob-
                                tained through coordination with the MAJCOM and Re-

                                   geant is earned in lieu of a SMSgt. These positions are nec-
                                   essary to provide the breadth of experience to the Opera-
                                   tions Flight and engineers. This position is used as the
                                   Element chief/manager or, in some cases, the work center
                                   superintendent position.

1.4.3 Civilian Workforce           The Facility Maintenance Element is comprised of a civil-
                                   ian work force, which augments the military forces to ac-
                                   complish maintenance and repair, recurring work, and
                                   modifications to real property. This civilian work force:
                                   (1)    provides a higher level of career field knowledge to
                                          supplement the senior enlisted force;
                                   (2)    provides continuity and stability at the installation
                                          during contingency exercises and deployments of
                                          military personnel;
                                   (3)    has specific duties and responsibilities during base
                                          exercises, military deployments, and natural disas-
                                          ters/emergencies; and
                                   (4)    provides training to enlisted and other civilian per-
                                          sonnel.
                                   The local Consolidated Personnel Center and Labor Man-
                                   agement Agreement can give specific criteria for each of
                                   these instances. Most civilians hired are at the Journeyman
                                   level.

1.4.4 Multi-craft/Multi-           The multi-crafting and multi-skilling initiatives were estab-
      skilling Initiative          lished as part of the DMRD 967. The purpose was to en-
                                   hance the organization by gaining efficiency and produc-
                                   tivity. The intent of multi-crafting was to create teams of
                                   skilled craftsmen with the purpose of quickly completing
                                   work assignments. Both multi-skilling and multi-crafting
                                   included using military and civilian personnel.

1.4.5 Matrixing                    Productivity gains are achieved through matrixing. Ma-
                                   trixing is the movement of personnel within an element to
                                   support an identified shortage in a skill level, AFS, or spe-
                                   cialized work task. Inspection of specialized service con-
                                   tracts is one example where craftsmen are used to augment
                                   quality assurance evaluators (QAEs) in the Maintenance
                                   Engineering Element.

Chapter 2           Single-point Customer Service
2.1   Objective and             Facility Maintenance provides single-point customer serv-
      Purpose                   ice and support. The work centers, the first contact point for
                                any customer service request, act as the central clearing
                                point for all customer contacts in CE. Providing this service
                                requires an understanding of customers and establishing an
                                open communications line.

                                Customer service is more than just answering questions. It
                                means establishing a working relationship. The customer
                                and Facility Maintenance work as a team to identify, pre-
                                pare, coordinate, and execute work the customer needs.
                                Anyone who comes in direct contact with the customer is a
                                public relations specialist and must be given training in
                                customer service as part of the overall training program.

                                The functions and roles of customer service providers are:
                                (1)    communicating customer needs,
                                (2)    providing a problem-solving service,
                                (3)    developing a cooperative working relationship,
                                (4)    coordinating and monitoring customer needs,
                                (5)    instilling cooperative management, and
                                (6)    ensuring a professional performance.

                                There are two primary methods for identification of re-
                                quirements and initiation of service requests. The most ef-
                                ficient method is for the customer to call or come into the
                                work center. The second method is the establishment of a
                                scheduled facility visit program. This, ultimately, reduces
                                the number of walk-ins and telephone calls for routine
                                work by letting the customer know when and why service
                                is scheduled. The objective is to get as close to this cus-
                                tomer-friendly environment as possible.

                                Communication between the customer and the CE repre-
                                sentative is key to developing a successful relationship that
                                meets the customer’s need. Visiting with the customer to
                                have a visual look at what the customer really wants and
                                asking the necessary questions are essential to having a
                                good understanding of the requirements. Communications
                                also means telling the customer about potential problems
                                that may affect the requested requirement. Issues, such as

                                   material shortfalls, long lead times, man-hour availability,
                                   and specialty crafts or skill level concerns brought to the
                                   attention of the customer early in the planning or program-
                                   ming phases will reduce complaints and dissatisfaction af-
                                   ter the task or project is started or completed.

                                   Continuous feedback to the customer ensures a solid
                                   working relationship. The day-to-day interaction that oc-
                                   curs between the customer service provider and the cus-
                                   tomer builds a relationship of trust and cooperation. Noti-
                                   fying the customer on current project or material status is
                                   just as important as providing feedback as problems occur.
                                   Keeping customers informed before problems arise or
                                   calling them to provide information before they call to re-
                                   quest it, results in demonstrating a true customer service
                                   oriented organization.

                                   Commitment is a matter of pride and the quality of that
                                   commitment to the CE mission is at the center of pride.
                                   Without it, efforts become routine and lack energy. The
                                   need for enthusiasm and drive in order to instill a sense of
                                   pride must be demonstrated daily. This is achieved by ap-
                                   proaching assigned tasks assertively; being prepared to ac-
                                   cept responsibility; and by dedication to the development of
                                   skills. Only then can anyone begin to understand the en-
                                   joyment of doing a job well. That feeling is called pride.

                                   To meet these tasks requires field experience and a long-
                                   term relationship with the base customers. Training and
                                   continuous contact with the customer helps in the develop-
                                   ment of these skills and the establishment of this process.

2.2   Work Center                  Establishing some type of regular and consistent agenda
      Coordination                 helps the customer develop a sense of trust and knowledge
                                   the CE shares their level of concern about the facilities.
                                   This can be accomplished through:
                                   (1)    meeting regularly, formally and informally, with
                                          building managers and commanders to discuss pro-
                                          gram consideration;
                                   (2)    discussing work orders in the planning stage and in
                                          progress, engineering projects, and work center
                                          concerns; and
                                   (3)    establishing a regular agenda to discuss these issues
                                          (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually).
                                   Commanders and building managers play a vital role in
                                   determining what work should be accomplished and in
                                   what order. By establishing a structured approach to work

                                force and available resources are dedicated to work consid-
                                ered essential to the base mission. Because the work center
                                superintendent manages the resources within that work
                                center, coordination with the customer will result in exe-
                                cuting the required work when the customer needs it. This
                                objective demonstrates CEs are working with the concerns
                                and mission priorities of customers.

2.3   Building Managers         The Facility Maintenance Element is responsible for the
      Program                   building managers program. Building managers are the
                                primary contact for the CE personnel executing work re-
                                quirements. Under guidelines established by the Air Force
                                Real Property Management, each organization commander
                                is responsible for the care, custody, and protection of as-
                                signed real property. Building managers are the command-
                                ers’ representatives who contact CE when work is required
                                in a facility.

                                Each facility maintenance manager is responsible for pro-
                                viding training to all building managers within their work
                                centers. (A copy of the Building Manager's Handbook is
                                included in this volume as Attachment 3.) When a building
                                manager is first assigned, someone from the work centers
                                should brief the building managers on their duties and re-
                                sponsibilities. They should also receive an annual refresher
                                briefing announcing any changes in CE operations that may
                                affect them. Training should include the submission of
                                work requests for maintenance, repair, minor construction,
                                all project or major work, and procedures for control of
                                keys to the facility. Self-help work should be discussed in
                                detail; as well as, alternative methods of finding materials,
                                funding, and BCE support.

                                Organizations can contribute to the overall maintenance
                                and repair to their facilities through the self-help program.
                                Detailed information on the self-help program can be found
                                in AFPAM 32-1098, Base Civil Engineer Self-Help Guide.

                                When minor maintenance and repair requirements can be-
                                come the responsibility of the custodians of the facility, the
                                work centers can then attend to more critical and complex
                                requirements. A good working relationship with base cus-
                                tomers benefits the facility maintenance manager, crafts-
                                men, the engineer, and the organization in achieving all
                                other objectives and is the cornerstone of the Facility
                                Maintenance mission.

      Work Requirements            quirements and facility work execution is one of the Facil-
                                   ity Maintenance Element’s most important processes. The
      Schedule
                                   schedules provide direct contact between the customer and
                                   CE to discuss facility requirements and resolve issues and
                                   concerns on a coordinated cycle of visits. An effective
                                   schedule helps reduce the number of calls by customers for
                                   routine work. A facility schedule also helps reduce routine
                                   backlogs of work, allowing a systematic approach to work
                                   management.

                                   Historically, the development of these schedules is the re-
                                   sponsibility of installation representatives and there are no
                                   established criteria for the frequency of visits to each facil-
                                   ity. Section 3.2 provides some guidance which can be help-
                                   ful in determining what to consider in making that decision.

                                   The number of work centers is not as important in schedule
                                   development as is the number of facilities assigned to each
                                   work center. The more facilities within a work center, the
                                   more complex it becomes to establish a program that will
                                   allow for all, or most, of those facilities to receive at least a
                                   twice-a-year work execution.

3.2   Frequency                    Typical schedules should be based on a 30- to 90-day cycle
      Guidelines                   unless the age, condition, or use of the facility requires a
                                   unique cycle. It is important the established schedule is rea-
                                   sonable and achievable to both the engineer and the cus-
                                   tomer.

                                   A source of information is the Work Information Manage-
                                   ment System (WIMS). Historical records can help deter-
                                   mine the appropriate cycles for specific or special case fa-
                                   cilities. A facility that has a history of high maintenance
                                   requirements may initially be placed on a 30-day cycle and
                                   later, as maintenance requirements subside, the cycle may
                                   extend to 60 days and, eventually, to 90 days. Historical
                                   records may help identify facilities with high maintenance
                                   trends such as air conditioning, plumbing, or electrical
                                   problems. This information can be used to assist the work
                                   center personnel in determining potential maintenance
                                   problems.

                                The Maintenance Engineering Element can provide engi-
                                neering assistance to providing a solution to these prob-
                                lems.

                                Another source of information to aid in determining fre-
                                quency is the base facility priority plan, which is available
                                within each CE organization.

                                Certain mission areas require a higher level of support.
                                When considering this category, issues such as computer
                                and environment controls, computer rooms, Command and
                                Control areas, and command areas can be significant fac-
                                tors.

                                In the housing category, dormitories, temporary lodging
                                quarters (TLQs), and significant military family housing,
                                general officers quarters or senior officers quarters (GOQs
                                and SOQs) should be included if applicable. Many installa-
                                tions have contracted out this requirement, in part or whole.
                                It is important to review all facility maintenance require-
                                ments and contracts so as not to leave out an important re-
                                quirement or facility.

                                Any facility that is visited frequently by the base populace
                                is a high-use facility. Special attention to these facilities is
                                necessary to ensure facility standards and appearances are
                                adequately maintained. Examples of high-use facilities in-
                                clude community activities centers, bowling centers, officer
                                and enlisted clubs, and AAFES facilities.

                                Other facilities to consider in scheduling could include air-
                                craft hangars and minimal-use type facilities. These types
                                of facilities may not require the same frequency of mainte-
                                nance as other facilities.

                                          and maximize the use of residual material.
4.2   Work Center                  Meeting the tasks that fulfill the mission of the Facility
      Coordination                 Maintenance Element requires time and experience in the
                                   field and a good relationship between the base customers,

                                (2)     develop documentation,
                                (3)     classify work,
                                (4)     strive to develop a good relationship with custom-
                                        ers, and
                                (5)     ensure craftsmen are properly and adequately
                                        trained.
4.2.1 Meet Regularly            Facility Maintenance personnel should meet regularly with
                                building managers, commanders, senior planners, mainte-
                                nance engineers, and craftsmen. These opportunities to dis-
                                cuss program considerations, quality of workmanship, work
                                orders in planning and in progress, engineering projects,
                                organizational objectives, and work center concerns will
                                benefit all parties and strengthen the Facility Maintenance
                                mission.

4.2.2 Documentation             Customer requirements are received either verbally or in
                                writing. Customer service personnel within the work cen-
                                ters will determine the necessary documentation and estab-
                                lish the appropriate type of work order (Direct Scheduled
                                or Planned Work). Routine work that cannot be accom-
                                plished by the building custodian and is not considered ur-
                                gent enough to be accomplished as essential work should
                                be referenced on an AF Form 1219 and accomplished dur-
                                ing a regular facility visit. If the work could result in possi-
                                ble facility deterioration or pose a health or safety hazard,
                                the requirement should be referenced on an AF Form 332
                                and accomplished as a direct scheduled work order.

4.2.2.1 Direct Scheduled        Direct Scheduled Work, previously referred to as job or-
        Work                    ders, is work that generally does not require detailed plan-
                                ning. These work orders are small and require less than 50
                                man-hours. Direct scheduled work is immediate or routine
                                and can be maintenance, repair, or minor construction not
                                requiring capitalization.

4.2.2.2 Emergency and           An immediate work order includes emergency and urgent
        Urgent Work             direct scheduled work. Emergency work is work required
                                to correct an emergency condition that is detrimental to the
                                mission or reduces operational effectiveness. It should be
                                completed within 24 hours of notification. An emergency
                                condition is one that, if not corrected immediately, could
                                result in a major compromise of the mission. An emergency
                                will always include, but is not limited to, failure of any
                                utility, fire protection, environmental control, or security
                                alarm system. After duty hours service call desk operations

                                   ans, housing occupants, or any one who may have a need to
                                   report an emergency.

                                   Work that is not an emergency, but must be responded to
                                   and completed within five workdays of receipt or within
                                   five workdays after receipt of material is classified as ur-
                                   gent. Urgent work is usually done as a direct scheduled
                                   work order. The work center CSU will determine whether
                                   the work can be completed without a formal written re-
                                   quest, special planning, or material support. If possible, the
                                   technician will classify a request as urgent if the work
                                   meets the requirements for this classification. If a request
                                   does not warrant urgent support, it is routine and will be
                                   processed for accomplishment on a 1219. Urgent requests
                                   might include broken windowpanes, inoperative faucets,
                                   missing roof shingles, or inoperative light switches.

4.2.2.3 Routine Work               Routine work is work that does not qualify as emergency or
                                   urgent work, but cannot be done by the building custodian
                                   or should be done to maintain the standards of an installa-
                                   tion. Routine work should be completed within 30 calendar
                                   days or during the next scheduled cycle visit to the facility,
                                   unless materials are required. When practical, all routine
                                   requirements for a facility should be consolidated and
                                   grouped into a single work package, placed on an AF Form
                                   1219, and performed during the next scheduled facility
                                   visit. Examples of routine work include loose or missing
                                   floor tiles, a commode or urinal inoperative when more
                                   than one is available, replacing wall switches or outlet cov-
                                   ers, or corroded or broken water handles.

4.2.3 Work Classification          Maintenance and repair (M&R) projects are funded from
                                   operation and maintenance (O&M) funds. The MAJCOMs
                                   approval authority for maintenance is unlimited. Repair ap-
                                   proval authority is limited to $5 million as long as the com-
                                   bined cost of all proposed work for a facility does not ex-
                                   ceed 70 percent of its replacement value. Work required to
                                   preserve or restore an existing facility is categorized as
                                   maintenance and repair work. Examples of M&R are re-
                                   painting, replacing floor tile or light fixtures, and repairing
                                   heating systems. The regularly scheduled facility visits are
                                   used to check the condition of the utilities, floors, support
                                   structures, or various areas of a building. Detailed pro-
                                   gramming information is available from the Engineering

                                Minor construction means building a new facility or modi-
                                fying, adding to, or otherwise altering an existing building.
                                Some examples are installing new walls or lighting, relo-
                                cating existing walls or real property installed equipment
                                (RPIE) and cutting doorways. These projects are funded
                                from operations and maintenance funds. The law limits mi-
                                nor construction (MC) projects to $500,000.

                                Conjunctive projects combine MC and M&R. The MC
                                portion must be identified separately. For both MC and
                                M&R, the building manager should initiate the project by
                                submitting an AF Form 332, BCE Work Request.

                                An AF Form 332 requesting a facility requiring new con-
                                struction must be reviewed by the building manager and
                                signed by the unit commander. The AF Form 332 comes in
                                a four-part set. The reverse of the form contains instruc-
                                tions for preparation, which must be read carefully and
                                followed completely. The work should be described and
                                sketches or diagrams included showing the exact electrical
                                requirements for new equipment. Explain why the work is
                                necessary and when it should be done. The requested work
                                will compete with other work and the priority assigned to it
                                may depend on the justification for that work. The use of
                                clear justification is very important.

                                Civil engineering will assign one of the following priorities
                                to the work request, consistent with guidance in the Facility
                                Investment Metric (FIM):
                                (1)    Mission — Work in direct support of the overall
                                       base or tenant unit mission that, if not done, would
                                       reduce operational effectiveness.
                                (2)    Safeguard Life and Property — Work needed to
                                       give adequate security to areas subject to compro-
                                       mise; eliminate health, fire, or safety hazards; or
                                       protect valuable property or equipment. Energy
                                       conservation work is also included.
                                (3)    Support — Work that supports the mission or pre-
                                       vents a breakdown of essential operating or house-
                                       keeping functions.
                                (4)    Necessary — Not qualifying for higher priority.
                                Once a work request is completed, an original and two
                                copies are sent to the work center CSU or work center point
                                of contact (POC). They will process a request as soon as
                                possible; however, construction work often requires more
                                review, planning, and scheduling than maintenance and re-

                                   erly, planners must develop a detailed plan and list of mate-
                                   rials. Depending upon the request, prior coordination with
                                   the fire department for fire hazards, the base
                                   bio-environmental engineer (BEE) for health or environ-
                                   mental hazards, the safety officer for safety hazards, or
                                   communications for telephone service will speed the proc-
                                   ess. The coordination must be completed before the AF
                                   Form 332 goes to CE. The CSU or work center POC will
                                   provide assistance with regard to who should be included in
                                   the coordination effort.

                                                              Note
                                     Some installations perform the coordinations as part of
                                     the CE responsibilities.

                                   CE will review the AF Form 332 for completeness, and if
                                   validated, assign a control number. The work center CSU
                                   will return one copy of the form that shows this number in
                                   Item 4, with a cover letter stating approved or disapproved.

                                   Work requiring detailed planning or capitalization of the
                                   real property records is categorized as planned work. This
                                   type of work is usually submitted on an Air Force Form
                                   332, BCE Work Request. The work center crafts people are
                                   responsible for planning work that will be accomplished
                                   within their work center. Comprehensive planning and es-
                                   timating determines scope, method, and types and quanti-
                                   ties of resources. Estimating determines the quantity of re-
                                   sources. Engineering Performance Standards (EPS) provide
                                   a tool to produce reliable standard-hour estimates. This
                                   level of planning may be accomplished by the Vertical Re-
                                   pair section of Heavy Repair or through the Maintenance
                                   Engineering Element. The Objective Squadron does not
                                   identify a separate planning section. Planners are earned
                                   and authorized as part of the Journeyman-level crafts posi-
                                   tion description. Some CE squadrons have a formal plan-
                                   ning section located in either the Heavy Repair or Mainte-
                                   nance Engineer Elements with the manning taken from
                                   within current authorizations. (Figure 1, Direct Scheduled

4.3   Coordination                 The requester must coordinate with the appropriate agen-
      Requirements                 cies on work that requires CE action to eliminate or correct

                                cies, regulations, and criteria.

                                Fire hazards are coordinated through the Fire Protection
                                Flight for assignment of a Fire Safety Deficiency Code
                                (FSDC). Fire protection must coordinate on all requested
                                work when either life or safety of personnel is involved.
                                This includes rating of materials, fire protection access to
                                an area or facility, or fire protection criteria affected by the
                                proposed work such as personnel emergency egress, fire
                                alarms, or suppression systems.

                                Health and environmental hazards requiring the assignment
                                of a Risk Assessment Code (RAC) are coordinated through
                                the Base Environmental Engineer (BEE) who is usually
                                assigned to the base hospital. Safety hazards are coordi-
                                nated through the base safety office for RAC assignment.

                                The requested work may have an environmental impact and
                                the Environmental Management Flight should be consulted
                                to determine if work qualifies for a categorical exclusion
                                (CATEX) from environmental analysis. An AF Form 813,
                                Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, will accom-
                                pany the AF Form 332, BCE Work Request, and be for-
                                warded to the Environmental Flight.

4.4   Work Order                The Facility Maintenance involvement in the work order
                                process includes the review process, evaluation of work
                                orders, managing work orders, and tracking of requests.

4.5   Review Process            A customer notifies the appropriate work center service
                                desk of a work requirement. The facility maintenance man-
                                ager and supervisor determine whether the requirement can
                                be accomplished via direct scheduled work on the next
                                scheduled visit or to establish a planned work order.

                                   Work orders go to the appropriate work center-of-execution
                                   for initial evaluation and rough estimate. The Heavy Repair
                                   Element manager is usually the focal point for the Work
                                   Request Review Board and manages the work orders. If the
                                   work order affects the base infrastructure (and almost all
                                   do), Maintenance Engineering and Infrastructure Support
                                   should evaluate the work order and recommend action.
                                   Following the Maintenance Engineering evaluation, the
                                   work order should go to the WRRB for final evaluation and
                                   approval or disapproval.

4.5.1 Work Order                   Work orders go through a basic evaluation process upon
      Evaluations                  receipt.
                                   (1)    Is this what they want? Is this work requested
                                          needed? Frequently, the customer requests work
                                          based on the desired outcome, rather than what
                                          needs to be done to achieve that outcome. For ex-
                                          ample, a customer requests more fluorescent fix-
                                          tures in a dropped ceiling. What the customer really
                                          wants is more desk lighting. The best solution may
                                          be to move the existing fluorescent fixtures above
                                          the desks, install task lighting above the desks, or
                                          use natural light. The facility maintenance manager
                                          and the customer should discuss the request and
                                          visit the site to determine what is really needed and
                                          how to accomplish it.
                                   (2)    Is this work consistent with long range plans?
                                          What effect will the work have on the infrastructure
                                          program? Energy costs, additional HVAC load, roof
                                          penetrations, and pavement integrity are usually not
                                          priorities for the customer. If the proposed work
                                          will affect the infrastructure program, the facility
                                          maintenance manager or an engineer should note it,
                                          discuss the impact (with costs if necessary), and
                                          discuss alternatives with more favorable impact.
                                          The engineer may advise disapproval due to the ad-
                                          verse impact.
                                   (3)    Is it redundant? Is the work duplicating or negat-
                                          ing other planned work, especially the work in the
                                          long-range plans? The engineers and facility
                                          maintenance managers should examine projects in
                                          their long-range plans to identify duplicate work. If
                                          the work affects a portion of a programmed project,
                                          the engineer should note it, discuss the work order
                                          impact on the long-term project, and provide a rec-

                                       and is advantageous to the program.
                                (4)    How should the work be executed? Is it an in-
                                       house work order, a contract project, an IDIQ proj-
                                       ect, a Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering
                                       Requirements (SABER) project, or a small purchase
                                       effort? The cost estimate and type of work will im-
                                       pact this evaluation.
                                (5)    Approve/disapprove? Is the work valid? The engi-
                                       neer and facility maintenance manager should rec-
                                       ommend approval or disapproval. The decision to
                                       approve or disapprove should be made as soon as
                                       possible. The engineer spends more time evaluating
                                       the effort than the WRRB approval authority and
                                       should provide the benefit of that evaluation in a
                                       professional recommendation.

                                  The work center chief should not recommend disap-
                                  proval without first discussing with the Facility Main-
                                  tenance manager and the customer the concerns driv-
                                  ing this recommendation. Often, customers facing sen-
                                  sible concerns over their work request will re-examine
                                  it and even withdraw it.

                                Following the program engineer review, the Maintenance
                                Engineer should review the work order with the same
                                questions in mind. Most Maintenance Engineers sit on the
                                WRRB and may face questions concerning their engineers’
                                evaluations. The Maintenance Engineer should develop a
                                recommendation for approval or disapproval. With this co-
                                ordination, the work order returns to the review process and
                                proceeds to the WRRB.

4.5.2 Work Order                Over the years, Base Engineers have looked for more effi-
      Management                cient and effective procedures and programs to better man-
                                age the work order business. In some cases it was noted
                                that file cabinets full of work requests were maintained,
                                some over three years old! In today’s CE environment,
                                these file cabinets of tremendous backlogs of work are too
                                costly. A more business-like approach has been taken to
                                work management. Some MAJCOMs and installations
                                have already successfully adopted some of the following
                                programs to manage work orders.

                                For many years customers believed CE worked only their
                                own priorities and not the customers. The customers some-

                                   times did not realize that all work CE accomplishes is to
                                   maintain, repair, or modify and alter their facilities, as well
                                   as, perform maintenance to RPIE. Through the years this
                                   perception began to change. BCEs began consulting with
                                   their customers to find out what is important to them, es-
                                   tablishing regular meetings with the customers, and making
                                   them part of the CE community.

                                   Several MAJCOMs have established a means of prioritiz-
                                   ing work through work allocation programs. These pro-
                                   grams use commanders’ input to determine what work CE
                                   should accomplish and in what order. The work is accom-
                                   plished either through a checkbook of available hours or a
                                   number of work orders per month by unit or organization.
                                   Regardless of the method used, work order programs have
                                   helped CE and the base customers in determining what is
                                   important, what needs to be accomplished and when, and
                                   reducing the excessive backlog of work that CE cannot ac-
                                   complish. The vehicle for accomplishing this work is either
                                   in-house or contracts.

                                   Civil Engineers began looking for alternative methods to
                                   satisfy customer requirements to improve the relationship
                                   between CE and the base customers. Historically, answers
                                   to customers were usually: "the request is in planning,"
                                   "awaiting materials," or "awaiting scheduling." These ex-
                                   cuses were no longer being accepted by the customers.
                                   There had to be a more customer-oriented approach to sup-
                                   port the customers needs. With the adoption of the Objec-
                                   tive Wing and Objective CE Squadron, a change in phi-
                                   losophy and culture was established. Decentralization of
                                   the work force required a change to the way business was
                                   conducted. The primary purpose of this work order re-
                                   structuring was to counter manpower reductions; budget
                                   constraints; loss of control of the old system, too many ac-
                                   tive work orders and inactive work orders in the system,
                                   and misunderstanding of the priority system.

                                   There are many methods of establishing and executing
                                   work order programs. These programs were developed and
                                   intended:
                                   (1)    to provide equitable support to all base customers,
                                   (2)    implement and execute dedicated commitment
                                          dates,
                                   (3)    work commanders’ priorities, and
                                   (4)    properly manage the workforce.

                                A sound program improves the management of all CE re-
                                sources.

                                The following is an example of how such a program could
                                work:
                                (1)    group commanders meet with squadron command-
                                       ers to identify and establish priorities;
                                (2)    CE meets with group commanders and reviews AF
                                       332s to determine method of accomplishment
                                       (SABER contract, in-house);
                                (3)    CE and Group CCs establish priority sequence of
                                       accomplishment;
                                (4)    CE processes AF 332 and commits funds and man-
                                       power when complete; and
                                (5)    priority work is then completed.
                                This process, as shown in Figure 2, Flow of a Work Order
                                Program, is important to facility maintenance managers
                                who have work order programs in place. In some instances,
                                work orders are not accepted unless they have the organi-
                                zation commander’s signature with priority assigned. Work
                                is not accepted if the organization’s priority allocations are
                                filled; however, exceptions are made for emergencies. The
                                facility maintenance managers must be well versed on how
                                these programs work and be able to provide status and up-
                                dates to their customers.

4.5.3 Requirement               As a CE community, the need to identify requirements re-
      Identification            mains, regardless of what type of work order program is in
                                place. Discussion continues on the need to maintain a list-
                                ing of all requirements and, whether or not, to maintain
                                hard copies. One effective program, using the WIMS sys-
                                tem, requires the establishment of an active and inactive
                                file. Active files, designated by an "A," are work orders in
                                the priority work order program. They have received a
                                commander’s authorization and an allocation of funds and
                                manpower. This category of work is based on the author-
                                ized allocation checkbook of man-hours for that unit or or-
                                ganization. These work orders are work the BCE and
                                Group CCs have requested and fall within the allocation
                                program for accomplishment. All other work orders should
                                be input into the WIMS with a "D" designator. "D" indi-
                                cates the work is in an inactive file or dummy loaded into
                                WIMS. No hard copy of the AF 332 is retained, except by
                                the requester. Once a work order is approved, the hard copy
                                work request is forwarded to the work center for processing
                                and transferred from the "D" log to the "A" (active files)

                                     tive work requests for programming and funding priorities.

Chapter 5           Recurring Work Program Support
5.1   Work Program              The recurring work program is a mission shared by all sec-
                                tions in the Operations Flight. The Facility Maintenance
                                Element work centers manage and execute the day-to-day
                                program. Material Acquisition maintains the appropriate
                                stock (either in the CE supply store or forward stores/shop
                                stocks) to support the program. Maintenance Engineering
                                oversees the development of the program and periodic as-
                                sessments of its elements by periodically reviewing the re-
                                quirements of the recurring work program and making rec-
                                ommendations to improve its effectiveness, efficiency, and
                                manpower requirements. Figure 3, Recurring Work Pro-
                                gram Review, illustrates this process for real property in-
                                stalled equipment.

                                The recurring work program applies to all routine, redun-
                                dant, recurring work involving real property, real property
                                installed equipment, or systems and other equipment
                                maintained by CE. By definition, its scope and frequency is
                                well known, locations are well established, materials are
                                available or not required, or it’s a recurring service. Work
                                includes operations, service work, and preventative mainte-
                                nance. The scope and level of effort is known.

5.2   Work Analysis             Some RWP will be service- or operations-related. Other
                                work, such as flightline sweeping or snow removal, is a
                                service provided by the horizontal work center of Heavy
                                Repair and typically listed as a work item in the RWP.
                                However, most RWP will be preventative maintenance
                                work, such as periodically replacing belts and filters on
                                HVAC equipment. This type of RWP often requires Main-
                                tenance Engineering analysis support and, therefore, a close
                                working relationship among all Elements of the Operations
                                Flight is desired. For additional discussion on analysis of
                                the recurring work program see Vol. 2 Maintenance Engi-

                                to annual rent or alterations, improvements, and repairs
                                to leased buildings.
cession --                      Ceding or yielding by a state of its legislative
                                jurisdiction over government-controlled real property
                                to the federal government.
clearance easement --           The right to remove or prevent obstructions rising into
                                the airspace. Examples are easements over areas
                                beyond the ends of an airfield runway (approach or
                                departure clearance zones). Also, easements adjacent to
                                the sides of the runway (transition zones), clearance for
                                approach lighting sites, communication sites, etc. A
                                clearance easement, specifically, does not include the
                                right of aircraft passage over the land, so the landowner
                                may separately recover for loss of value to his or her
                                land due to low and frequent flights of aircraft.
commercial facilities           Air Force-owned and -operated facilities housing a
(industrial-type) --            function that could be done by private industry, such as
                                motor repair work centers, laundries, bakeries, ice
                                cream manufacturing plants. (Exceptions are base
                                exchanges, commissaries, and other non-appropriated
                                fund activities.)

condemnation --                    A judicial proceeding started by the government
                                   through the Department of Justice for the purpose of
                                   exercising its right of eminent domain. Condemnation
                                   results in passage of title and land to the government
                                   with or without the consent of the landowner, but with
                                   just compensation paid to him or her.
consideration --                   Compensation or an equivalent (such as money,
                                   material, or services) that is given for something
                                   acquired or promised. This may be the appraised fair
                                   market value of the real property or may include
                                   protection of the real property against loss by fire,
                                   water, or other causes, or any mutually agreeable
                                   arrangement that does not conflict with governing
                                   statutory limitations.
core requirements --               Process oriented descriptions which describe the tasks
                                   needed to support Maintenance Engineering.
declaration of taking --           A pleading filed with a federal court of law in a real
                                   property condemnation proceeding whereby, on filing
                                   the pleading, together with deposit of estimated "just
                                   compensation" in the court, the real estate interest is
                                   vested in the government.
declaration of excess --           A narrative description of real property that is no
                                   longer required for foreseeable Air Force missions. The
                                   declaration contains an identification of the land, type
                                   of governmental real estate interest, facility inventory
                                   information, recommended disposal dates, re-use
                                   rights, and services, obligations, and outgrants
                                   outstanding (see AFI 32-9004).
direct scheduled work order --     Emergency or essential work generally not requiring
                                   detailed planning, also known as job orders.
direct digital control --          Any control system (HVAC, alarms, lighting, or
                                   otherwise) using entirely solid-state (digital)
                                   components.
District Engineer --               One of the several Division Engineers, US Army Corps
                                   of Engineers, who supervise the activities of certain
                                   District Engineers and are the intervening management
                                   level between the Chief of Engineers and District
                                   Engineers (e.g., US Army Engineer Division, North
                                   Atlantic, CENAD).

easement --                        The right to use the land of another for a specified
                                   purpose. Usually, the owners of the land continue in
                                   possession and may use it as long as such use does not
                                   interfere with the purpose for which the easement was
                                   granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific
                                   term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
                                   license because: the privilege granted usually cannot be
                                   withdrawn during its term and it is considered to be a
                                   permanent interest in the property if the term exceeds
                                   one year.
emergency work --                  Work that must be accomplished immediately.
eminent domain --                  The right of the government to take private property for
                                   public use upon payment of just compensation.
Energy Conservation Investment     A Military Construction (MILCON)-funded program
Program (ECIP) --                  primarily intended for accomplishing energy
                                   conservation retrofits of existing buildings. It includes
                                   construction of new, high-efficiency energy systems
                                   and modernization of existing systems. ECIP is an
                                   OSD centrally-managed program.
Energy Savings Performance         Contracting with a private sector company for
Contract (ESPC) --                 completion of energy audits and installation of energy
                                   conservation projects. This provides a method to
                                   acquire energy conservation projects with no AF
                                   resources and without payment if savings do not result.
Energy Management Control System   The civil engineer energy control system that
(EMCS) --                          historically manages heating, ventilation, and air
                                   conditioning (HVAC) systems. It differs from direct
                                   digital control in that it includes both solid state
                                   systems and the older pneumatic systems.
engineers --                       Any engineer in Civil Engineer units to include the
                                   Base Civil Engineer, the Maintenance Engineer,
                                   program engineers, and project engineers.
environmental assessment --        A document, occurring early in the planning process,
                                   for evaluating the potential environmental impact of a
                                   proposed action. An assessment covers the same
                                   topical areas as an environmental impact statement
                                   (EIS), but with less detail. An assessment results in a
                                   decision that an EIS is necessary, or that the proposed
                                   action will have no significant effect, therefore, a
                                   finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made
                                   (AFI 32-7004).

environmental impact statement --     A detailed full-disclosure report which, pursuant to the
                                      National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,
                                      (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), identifies and analyzes the
                                      anticipated environmental impact of a proposed Air
                                      Force action and discusses how the adverse effects of
                                      the proposal will be mitigated. It is prepared in two
                                      stages: a draft statement which is filed with the
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and made
                                      available to the public for comment and a final
                                      statement which is revised to reflect comments made
                                      on the draft EIS (AFI 32-7004).
essential work --                     Work that cannot wait for the next 1219 visit.
expanded clear zone easement --       The right to prohibit all uses of land, within 3,000 feet
                                      of the runway threshold and extending 1,000 to 1,500
                                      feet on each side of the runway center line extended,
                                      that are incompatible with or could impede, aircraft
                                      operations. For additional guidance see AFI 32-7003.
facility investment metric (FIM) --   An Air Force facilities requirements identification
                                      program to assess facilities based on mission priority;
                                      used to develop funding priorities.
Federal Energy Management             An OSD, centrally-managed program for projects less
Program (FEMP) --                     than $300K. Projects accomplish energy conservation
                                      retrofits of existing buildings or new construction plus
                                      energy audits, designs and metering programs. It
                                      includes construction of new, high-efficiency energy
                                      systems and modernization of existing systems.
fee ownership --                      Title to real property belonging to a person or the
                                      government where full and unconditional ownership
                                      exists. Such ownership does not necessarily include
                                      mineral rights.
floodplain --                         The 100-year floodplain is the lowland area adjoining
                                      inland and coastal waters, including flood prone areas
                                      of offshore islands that would be inundated by the base
                                      flood. The critical actions (or 500-year) floodplain is
                                      the area that would be inundated by a 500-year flood.
                                      (See AFI 32-7003.)
functional squadron --                Pre-1992 squadron structure, functionally oriented, it

value (current, fair, and estimated) --   As used in this regulation, these terms mean current
                                          fair market value or current fair market rental value, as
                                          appropriate. Fair market value is the amount in cash, or
                                          on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
                                          property would be sold by an owner, willing but not
                                          obliged to sell, to a purchaser who desires, but is not
                                          obliged, to buy. Fair market rental value of a property
                                          is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
                                          well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a
                                          well-informed lessor would accept for the use and
                                          occupancy of the property for a particular term.

                                          Comprehensive Plan drawings, so termed because
                                          many bases originally stored these drawings in a vault
                                          for physical security.
wetlands --                               Areas that are inundated by surface or ground water
                                          with a frequency sufficient to support, and under
                                          normal circumstances do or would support, a
                                          prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires
                                          saturated or seasonally-saturated soil conditions for
                                          growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include
                                          swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas such as mud
                                          flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs,
                                          and wet meadows. Wetlands may be, but are not
                                          necessarily, located in floodplains (AFI 32-7005).
withdrawn land --                         Public land that has been set aside or designated for a
                                          specific public purpose, such as a national park,
                                          wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                                          public lands generally has the effect of segregating
                                          such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other
                                          dispositions under the public land laws.
work centers --                           Civil Engineering Operations maintenance teams
                                          organized to maintain and repair base facilities and
                                          infrastructure systems. Depending on the installation,
                                          these Centers can be classified as either shops, zones or
                                          a combination of both..

Attachment 3 Building Manager's Handbook
This document is designed to be a handy reference guide to help you perform your duties as
building manager. It gives procedures to follow in executing daily duties and should be made
available for quick reference. Refer to it often.

1.     Orientation

Your organization commander is responsible for the care, custody, and protection of assigned
real property. As the building manager, you are their representative and official contact when-
ever your building needs base civil engineering (BCE) work. You should be briefed by someone
in BCE on your duties and responsibilities when you are first assigned as a building manager.
Thereafter, you should receive an annual refresher briefing announcing any changes in BCE op-
erations which may affect you. This handbook provides guidance only and is designed to make
your job easier. If you would rather devise another way to accomplish the same result, do so.

2.     Assignment

All facilities at this installation are assigned to individual unit commanders, typically by action
of an installation-level Facilities Board or Space Resources Allocation Panel. The unit com-
mander assumes the responsibility for all facilities assigned to the organization and the Real
Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) therein.

a.       The unit commander designates, in writing, an officer, senior noncommissioned officer,
or civilian of equal rank as primary and alternate building manager for each facility assigned to
the organization. Building managers should have at least 18 months retainability at the time of
appointment to lessen the impact of changes on all affected personnel.

b.      In multipurpose facilities, the major user should be assigned as the primary building
manager. Any other organization using a portion of a multipurpose facility will be allowed to
appoint an alternate building manager for its area. Alternates can process actions with the BCE,
but should coordinate with the primary building manager. By doing this, the primary building
manager will be able to keep track of what is planned and being accomplished in the building or
buildings. If you are the building manager of a tenant organization on your base, the local BCE
provides your support. In your case, a copy of the host-tenant agreement with the BCE should
be on file in the organization. If you cannot find a copy, call the BCE Real Property section for
assistance. The host-tenant agreement will tell you about support you can expect from civil en-
gineering. Talk to people in the Customer Service Unit (CSU) if you have any questions or
problems.

3.       Civil Engineering Overview

a.       Civil Engineering is essentially a service organization. Its primary purpose is to:
(1)      Support the mission by providing utilities, maintenance, and repairs.
(2)      Make alterations to existing facilities.
(3)      Construct new facilities.
(4)      Provide fire protection.
b.      Keep in mind, however, that while the MISSION always comes first, PEOPLE are a most
important ingredient to accomplish this mission. Civil engineering will always try to be respon-
sive to your requirements. There are two major ways that work is accomplished in your build-
ing; by a contractor or by the BCE. Although you will be most involved with the work that is
accomplished by the BCE a brief discussion of contract work methods is presented here.

4.       Contract Funding Avenues

The law requires the BCE to use different funding categories for construction, repair, and main-
tenance; each with its own requirements and restrictions. The first two, minor construction and
maintenance and repair, are controlled no higher than major command (MAJCOM) and done
rather quickly. The Military Construction Program, Emergency Construction, and foreign con-
struction programs require a much longer lead time than locally controlled programs but provide
much greater funding and construction flexibility. In all cases, you, the building manager, iden-
tify the work required; civil engineers will identify the appropriate funding source. For contract
work, the base facility committees review the projects and set overall priority. You need to make
sure your members on the committees know the requirement for your project. The BCE will
prepare any additional paperwork required (DD Form 1391, FY - Military Construction Project
Data) to request approval for contract work and design the project. Make sure you or another
expert from your organization attend the design review conference to verify the plans entail the
facility work you requested.

a.       Minor Construction (MC). These projects are funded from operations and maintenance
(O&M) funds. The law limits MC Projects to $500,000. These funds must be used to alter fa-
cilities, whether moving a structural wall, adding on to the building, extending the utility lines, or
adding a driveway.

b.      Maintenance and Repair (M&R). These projects are funded from O&M funds. The MA-
JCOM's approval authority for maintenance is unlimited. Repair approval authority is limited to
$3 million as long as the combined cost of all construction proposed for a facility does not ex-
ceed 70 percent of its replacement value.
                                            NOTE
     Conjunctive projects, combining MC and M&R are possible but identify the MC portion
     separately. For both MC and M&R, the building manager should initiate the project by
     submitting an AF Form 332, BCE Work Request.

c.      Military Construction Program (MILCON). Construction projects over $500,000 or large
maintenance and repair projects ($3 million or greater) are funded through MILCON. You must
identify to Congress where every dollar is going to be spent before your project can be approved
and funded.

d.      As the building manager, you will deal with various BCE functions: CSU, Service Call,
Fire Protection, Energy Management, Engineering, and Real Property. Of most importance to
you is the CSU, the single point of contact between you and the BCE. The CSU is also the func-
tion that reviews and processes your work requirements and helps you monitor the progress of
work being done on your building. Not all bases have a central CSU, however. Some civil en-
gineering squadrons work under a "zonal" maintenance concept where the base is divided into
several zones. Each zone has a team of craftsmen capable of handling your requirements. You
will be given a point of contact (POC) on the zonal team based on which zone your building is
in. If you are not sure who your contact is, call the operations branch in civil engineering.

e.     In your capacity as building manager you may need to order new or replacement equip-
ment. Before doing either, check with the CSU or your zonal POC. In some cases, work must
be done by the BCE BEFORE appliances or equipment can be installed.

f.       Learn to plan ahead. For example, request major changes in heating, storm windows,
etc., in early spring. Request changes in air-conditioning equipment in late fall to make sure
work is completed by early spring. Take into consideration the lead time to procure materials
and size of the job when asking for a completion date.

g.    Think about major and minor changes someone may want to make to your building. In
some cases, commanders or others may want these changes because of personal reasons. You
may want to discuss the possibility of a faster, less expensive, or better way to handle this re-
quirement,

h.     Due to personnel rotations and mission changes, some requirements may not be neces-
sary by the time work is actually approved and started. Constant communication is necessary to
preclude unnecessary work and expenditure of funds.

i.    The better you understand BCE and the way they work, the easier your job will become.
BCE personnel will be pleased to answer any questions you have about their operation.

5.     Service Call

The Base Civil Engineer maintains a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week capability to respond to
emergency conditions:

a.       Emergencies. An emergency condition is one detrimental to your mission. If the condi-
tion is not corrected immediately, it could result in a major breakdown of the mission with a rea-
sonable expectancy of reducing operational effectiveness. Emergency work is required to pro-
vide adequate security to areas subject to compromise, eliminate serious health hazards, prevent
serious fire or safety hazards, or protect valuable property and equipment. An emergency will
always include, but is not limited to, failure of any utility, fire protection, environmental control,
or security alarm system. If your building has loss of heat, steam, gas, liquid fuels, water, or

48                                                                  Volume 3 Facility Maintenance
                                                                                     Attachment 3
AFPAM32-1004V3 1 SEPTEMBER 1998                                  Working in the Operations Flight

clogged plumbing (when the entire system is affected), it might be designated an emergency.
Failure of a critical air-conditioning system, power failure, or faulty electrical systems are emer-
gencies. If you are not sure if you have an emergency condition ask someone in the Service Call
function. The Service Call function will accept notification that an emergency condition exists
from ANYONE having knowledge of the condition.

b.      Less Than Emergency Situations. The CSU provides a means for processing many re-
quirements that are not classified as a emergency. YOU should be the only one submitting those
requirements. If you believe you have an urgent requirement, call the CSU. They will determine
whether the work can be completed without a formal written request, special planning, or mate-
rial support. If possible, the technician will assign your requirement to URGENT service. If
your request does not warrant urgent support, it will be assigned ROUTINE processing.

                                              NOTE
     Whenever you use the Service Call function, CSU, or your zonal POC, always obtain a
     control number. Record this number on a log to help monitor work and follow-ups (see
     paragraph 7.e).

6.       Maintenance and Repair (Routine Work)

a.      Work required to preserve or restore an existing facility is categorized as maintenance
and repair work. Some examples are: repainting, replacing floor tile or light fixtures, and re-
pairing heating systems. Identify these requirements by conducting regular monthly inspections
of your building and its RPIE.

b.      You will periodically receive a call from the BCE to schedule facility inspections. Use
these regularly scheduled visits to check the condition of the utilities, floors, support structures,
or various areas of your building. Use these inspections and early identification of deficiencies
to keep your building in good condition. You should accompany civil engineering personnel
during these inspections. They will show you what to look for and how to identify work re-
quirements.

c.       When you request maintenance or repair items (there may be more than one item), fill out
AF Form 332. Describe each item of work to be done. If necessary, include sketches or dia-
grams. A single item of maintenance or repair that does not need a detailed sketch should be
called in to the CSU or your zonal POC. As building manager, you will review and coordinate
on the request. Send the original and two copies to civil engineering. Keep the customer's copy
for your file. After BCE makes a decision about the work you have requested, they will return
the status copy of the AF Form 332 and tell you the disposition or status of each maintenance or
repair item with a work order number or control number assigned.

d.      Use these assigned work order or control numbers for follow-up actions. Note all actions
pertaining to your AF Forms 332, from submittal through job completion, in your Building Man-
ager's log. If an occupant of your building has initiated the request for work, please keep that
person informed on the latest status.

7.     New Construction

a.      New construction means building an entire new facility, or modifying, adding to, or oth-
erwise altering an existing building. Some examples are installing new walls or lighting, relo-
cating existing walls or RPIE, cutting doorways, etc.

b.      If someone else fills out the AF Form 332 when a facility requires new construction, the
building manager must review and the unit commander must sign the form. The AF Form 332
comes in a four part set. The reverse of the form contains instructions for preparation. Read the
instructions carefully and follow them completely. Describe the work to be done and include
sketches or diagrams and the exact electrical requirements for new equipment. Explain why the
work is necessary and when it should be done. The requested work will have to compete with
other work and the priority assigned to your request may depend on your justification. The use
of "strongly-worded justification" cannot be overemphasized.

c.     The BCE will assign one of the following priorities to the work request:
(1)    I. Mission. Work in direct support of the overall base or tenant unit mission that if not
       done would reduce operational effectiveness;
(2)    II. Safeguard Life and Property. Work needed to give adequate security to areas sub-
       ject to compromise; to eliminate health, fire, or safety hazards; or to protect valuable
       property or equipment. Also include energy conservation work;
(3)    III. Support. Work. which supports the mission or prevents a breakdown of essential
       operating or housekeeping functions; or
(4)    IV. Necessary. Not qualifying for higher priority.
d.      Once you complete and coordinate the work request, send the original and two copies to
the CSU or your zonal POC. They will process your request as soon as possible; however, con-
struction work requires more review than maintenance and repair work. Depending upon your
request, prior coordination with the fire department for fire hazards, the base bioenvironmental

engineer for health or environmental hazards, the safety officer for safety hazards, or communi-
cations for telephone service will speed the process. Remember to complete this coordination
BEFORE your AF Form 332 goes to the BCE. If you are not sure who should coordinate, call
your CSU or zonal POC. A properly completed form will save you and the BCE valuable time
in accomplishing the job.

e.      The BCE will review the AF Form 332 for completeness. If validated, it will be assigned
a control number. They will return one copy of the form that shows this number in Item 4, with
a cover letter that tells you if the request has been approved or disapproved. Record this number
and all actions that pertain to your work request, from original submittal to job completion on AF
Form 3132, General Purpose, used as your Building Manager's log. Typical headings on the
form would include: Control #; Urgency; Date; Description; AF Form 332 Date; Work Com-
plete Date; and Remarks. From then on, use this number when you make work request follow-
up calls.

                                                                                  Attachment 3

8.       Self-help Work

a.      Self-help is an excellent way to do some important "people projects" that would normally
receive a lower work request priority than you would like. Personnel assigned to your building
must be made aware that they MUST OBTAIN BCE approval BEFORE starting self-help proj-
ects.

b.       This rule applies even if they supply ALL their own labor and materials. The BCE wants
to make sure the work is completed properly. It is costly to tear down a wall or newly paneled
area if it creates some type of fire or safety hazard.

c.      To receive permission to do self-help projects in your building, fill out an AF Form 332.
Describe work to be done and include sketches or diagrams. Item 10 of the form gives you a
place to list donated resources. Your Self-help Center can assist or direct you on the procedures
that are required to obtain materials for self-help.

9.       Space Management

If you are the building manager of a complex of shops and offices that belong to several units,
this subject should be stressed to all occupants. Any time someone wants to move an office or
“swap" areas between two or more units, notify the Civil Engineering Real Property office. You
should do this BEFORE any moves are begun because you need the approval of the Space Re-
sources Allocation Panel. Each installation will normally establish a panel or committee so that
it may convene periodically for such purposes. Also, upon vacating a building or space, notify
the BCE in order to have a joint inspection arranged. Someone from the Real Property office
will assist in this inspection. At the time of the inspection, turn in all appropriate keys to the
Real Property Manager.

                                              NOTE
     To make space management easier, ask for a floor plan of your building. Include in the plan
     which units occupy what space and keep the plan current.

10.      Custodial Services

If there is a contractor who performs custodial services in your building, you could be assigned
to monitor the services. Someone from the BCE will be assigned to actually monitor the con-
tract, but they may need you to assist by calling their attention to tasks not properly done or
missed, or work done especially well. You, as building manager, are in the best position to know
what happens in your building. Make sure building occupants report to you, first, before going
directly to the BCE or base contracting with complaints about custodial services.

11.      Air Force Suggestion Program

As building manager, any AF Form 1000, Suggestion, that proposes minor building improve-
ments to your facility must be routed through you for approval. Where building modification is
involved, the BCE is the implementing office of primary responsibility. You will need to pre-
pare the necessary work request documents if the suggestion receives approval; see AFI 38-401,

Volume 3 Facility Maintenance                                                                   51

The Air Force Innovative Development Employment Awareness (IDEA) Program (10/1/97) for
additional guidance).

12.    Energy Management

a.     As building manager, you are responsible for energy management within your building.

b.     The Department of Defense has designated FY 85 as the "base line" for computing na-
tionwide energy conservation requirements. All government agencies are directed to reduce en-
ergy usage.

c.      Your Base Energy Manager can tell you the reduction percentage for your base and ex-
plain your role in helping with energy reduction goals. They can also provide information, rec-
ommendations, and answers to your questions on how to carry out this responsibility.

d.      Your Base Energy Plan and your local Base Energy regulations set procedures you
should follow for utilities management and energy management. Be familiar with the base
regulations because you are responsible for implementing the energy program they set forth.
Your responsibilities should include, but are not limited to:
(1)    assisting the Base Energy Manager by implementing base programs and policies in your
       building;
(2)    promoting a positive attitude for energy management practices in your building;
(3)    making sure thermostats are set at correct temperatures during the heating or cooling sea-
       son;
(4)    making sure all-windows and doors are closed when the building is being heated or
       cooled;
(5)    making sure inside lights are turned off when not in use during duty hours and after duty
       hours;
(6)    making sure outside lights are turned off during daylight and that they are not used in ex-
       cess or beyond a requirement to provide safety or security during darkness;
(7)    making sure equipment in the building is turned off during extended nonuse periods dur-
       ing duty hours and after duty hours unless the equipment must stay on for technical or
       practical reasons;
(8)    making sure plumbing fixtures, especially hot water, are not leaking;
(9)    making a periodic walk-through of the facility to make sure energy management is prac-
       ticed by noting items listed above; and
(10)   notifying civil engineering promptly when discovering an energy wasteful condition that
       needs their support to correct.
e.      You are the person with the most direct influence in helping the base meet its energy re-
duction goals. Your actions will save the base thousands of dollars in energy costs each year and
allow those savings to be used for needed, basewide, facility improvements.

13.    Fire Protection

a.      As building manager you are responsible to your unit commander for the fire safe condi-
tion of your facility.


52                                                               Volume 3 Facility Maintenance
                                                                                  Attachment 3
AFPAM32-1004V3 1 SEPTEMBER 1998                                  Working in the Operations Flight

b.      You or your alternate should accompany the fire inspector during scheduled fire preven-
tion inspections. Throughout these inspections, the fire inspectors will note fire hazards and de-
ficiencies. They will explain your duties and responsibilities for the maintenance of a fire safe
building and will give you instructions for required corrective actions. If you do not receive this
information during the inspection or in a follow-up report, contact the base fire department for
assistance.

c. The fire prevention inspection is the quality control element of a unit's fire prevention pro-
gram. During inspections, fire prevention inspectors pay particular attention to:
(1)       the occupant's knowledge of fire reporting, evacuating, and first-aid firefighting;
(2)       the adequacy and condition of fire suppressants, detectors, alarms, and protective systems
          and devices;
(3)       the adequacy and condition of devices and building features, (fire doors, walls, draft
          stops, etc.) to segregate and separate special fire hazard occupancy areas;
(4)       the condition of heating, fuel handling, and similar devices or equipment which can be-
          come hazardous if neglected;
(5)       the adequacy of safe practices to prevent fires;
          the control of smoking and the proper disposal of smoking materials;
(6)       the condition of electrical equipment and connections;
(7)       all housekeeping practices;
(8)       the adequacy, condition, and accessibility of fire exits;
(9)       any evidence of self-help projects not approved by civil engineering, such as installed
          wood paneling or false ceilings; and
(10)      the adequacy, condition, location, and accessibility of portable fire extinguishers.
d.     Correct fire hazards and deficiencies in a prompt manner. If necessary, ask your fire in-
spector for advice.

e.        As the building manager, you should make sure these actions are completed if a fire

occurs:
(1)       make sure a fire alarm is given;
(2)       evacuate the building or area;
(3)       notify the fire department;
(4)       use portable fire fighting equipment (extinguishers, standpipe hose, etc.) to extinguish a
          fire if it’s discovered in its early stages; and
(5)       meet the fire vehicles and direct the fire fighters to the fire.
14.       Building Security

a.     Building security is another responsibility of the building manager. Establish a standard
procedure for making sure your facility is secure from illegal entry at all times. Double check all
doors and windows when closing the building and be sure all locks are in good working order,

b.       Security Police law enforcement patrols conduct regular security checks on base facili-
ties. If your building is not secure, you will need to respond immediately to lock doors or close



Volume 3 Facility Maintenance                                                                       53
Attachment 3

windows. A follow-up DD Form 1569, Incident/Complaint Report, will then be sent to your unit
commander for action. Insecure buildings are a command interest item at many staff meetings.

c.      Impress upon all personnel the importance of building security. Without cooperation,
your job as building manager will become much more difficult. Regardless of who is responsi-
ble for a break in building security, YOU are the one who has to correct it.

d.     If you have questions concerning building security, contact the Security Police Crime
Prevention Section, the Resources Protection Section, or the Law Enforcement Desk.

15.    Key Control

a.     As building manager, you are responsible for the security of all basic keys that service
your building. You should establish security procedures to make sure there is NO duplication of
keys without your personal knowledge or official written approval.

b.      You are NOT responsible for keys that control specialized areas in your facility. These
are areas that organizations use for safeguarding their specialized equipment, sensitive docu-
ments, personal tool kits, etc.

c.      You should repossess all keys from personnel who are going to a permanent change of
station, who have been discharged, or whose employment has been terminated. Keys issued to
personnel going on extended leave or on a temporary duty assignment for over 30 days should be
held for safekeeping. Upon vacating a building or any assigned space, be sure the appropriate
keys are returned to the appropriate BCE office.

d.     All requests for keys should be made by letter to the BCE. This letter should include:
building number; room number, if applicable; duty telephone number; and complete justification
for your requirement.

a.      For other than normal wear and tear, replacement keys should be the monetary responsi-
bility of the individual to whom the keys are issued. Check with the CSU to determine local
procedures for key replacement.

f.      The BCE will provide additional keys if justification is sufficient and with an approved
request. Civil engineering will issue master keys to the using organization when the building
lock system is "rekeyed' or if the locks are replaced. There will be no approval of requests for
master keys without the concurrence of your unit commander and the BCE. Record all actions
involving key control on AF Form 3126, General Purpose, used as your key control register.

16.    Records

a.     The records you keep will give the BCE a chronological history of your building. They
provide trends in maintenance and repair requirements and identify potential problem areas so
they can be corrected before they become major problems. They also tell when it is time to start
thinking about new construction, rather than maintenance and repair. Your records file may
contain:

(1)    your local regulations,
(2)    this handbook,
(3)    building Manager’s log, and
(4)    the key Control Register.
b.     Important telephone numbers should be readily available, including:
(1)    Production Control Center (or zonal point of contact),
(2)    Customer Service Unit (CSU),
(3)    Service Call Desk,
(4)    Real Property office,
(5)    Self-help Store,
(6)    Energy Management,
(7)    Fire Department Technical Services,
(8)    Safety Office,
(9)    Bioenvironmental Engineer, and
(10)   Security Police.
c.      Building management is most often an additional duty, so we recommend you keep a
continuity binder or set of binders. These binders are especially critical when the building re-
sponsibility moves frequently from person to person (for example, at a short-tour location). We
recommend you include any letters designating you the building manager, applicable publica-
tions, work orders, notes on local procedures, and any applicable meeting minutes.
