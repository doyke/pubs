                                               Chapter 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. General. Sound management of limited resources is essential to maximize operational and training
effectiveness of an organization. Sound management of the scheduling process begins with the carefully
developed Yearly Operations Plan (YOP). The YOP serves as the basis of monthly and weekly schedul-
ing activities to ensure yearly training objectives are met. All training and operational requirements for
the next year should be included in the YOP.
    1.1.1. The YOP is the basis for all plans and schedules produced throughout the year. It is updated
    quarterly in the Quarterly Operations Plan (QOP). The QOP is updated monthly and published as the
    Monthly Operations Plan (MOP). When deviations from the YOP are required, the quarterly and
    weekly schedules are adjusted and taskings kept within unit capabilities. OSS and LSS scheduling
    must work closely together keeping each other informed of taskings that affect the use of aircrews and
    aircraft.
    1.1.2. The objective of the scheduling process is to safely and efficiently maximize the use of the
    wing's resources. In developing a viable schedule to support the wing’s mission, operational require-
    ments, allocated flying time, and maintenance capability must be considered. The degree of accuracy
    in the planning process will vary depending on mission taskings, resources available, and geographic
    location. Resources, such as aircraft, flying hours, aircrews, equipment, parts, and maintenance man-
    power, determine the unit’s ability to meet operational and training requirements. If a lack of
    resources is identified for an operational tasking from the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC),
    wing resources will be identified to satisfy taskings in the following sequence: standby alert, higher
    headquarters taskings, and training sorties.
    1.1.3. OSOR/OSOK will document all deviations to the printed schedule and analyze them with the
    goal of reducing excessive deviations.
    1.1.4. The scheduling process is directly tied to both the wing and group’s strategic quality plan.
    Through the policies established in this instruction, OSO and LGLS directly support the following
    Wing and Group Goals:
       1.1.4.1. Wing.
           1.1.4.1.1. Achieve the highest state of readiness.
           1.1.4.1.2. Meet our air refueling and airlift customers’ requirements in a safe and reliable
           manner.
           1.1.4.1.3. Constantly improve our capability to operate and live safely.
       1.1.4.2. Operations Group.
           1.1.4.2.1. Provide the most responsive, reliable, and safe air mobility in the world.
           1.1.4.2.2. Achieve and maintain the highest level of readiness for aircrew and operations sup-
           port.
           1.1.4.2.3. Constantly improve our capability to operate and live safely.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                             5


           1.1.4.2.4. Ensure Fairchild AFB aircraft flow seamlessly from local to national and interna-
           tional airspace and back without undue burden to our co-users, controllers, and neighboring
           community.
       1.1.4.3. Logistics Group.
           1.1.4.3.1. Ensure all aircraft are properly configured and mission ready within the prescribed
           time limits.
           1.1.4.3.2. Launch properly configured aircraft safely and on time.
           1.1.4.3.3. Recover and return aircraft to mission-ready status in minimal time.
   1.1.5. Through this effort of tying the wing and group objectives to our fundamental operating
   instruction, we strive to provide the best air mobility for America through reliable air refueling and
   airlift--worldwide!

1.2. Responsibility:
   1.2.1. Commanders and supervisory personnel at all levels are responsible for compliance with the
   provisions of this instruction. The development of accurate schedules and adhering to them with min-
   imum changes is essential for optimum aircrew and aircraft use. Commanders at all levels must resist
   the natural urge to make minor changes to plans and schedules. Even minor changes can cause
   far-reaching consequences, schedule instability, and the possible failure to achieve wing goals.
   1.2.2. Successful mission accomplishment depends on fully manned, trained, and experienced sched-
   uling staffs. Each squadron commander, along with OG/CC and LG/CC, must ensure all scheduling
   staffs are fully manned and working closely together to provide the best support for the wing’s mis-
   sion.
   1.2.3. Operations requirements and logistics capabilities must be carefully considered to provide safe,
   reliable aircraft to meet mission needs. Commanders must be alert to the detrimental effects of mis-
   matches between operations requirements and logistics capabilities. When less than 100 percent of
   requested flying hours are funded, careful use of available resources is necessary to maximize training
   and operational capability
   1.2.4. The OSO is the focal point for coordinating directly with operations squadrons, maintenance
   squadrons, operations group, logistics group, wing, TACC, and all subordinate agencies for all sched-
   uling issues.

1.3. Maximizing Sortie Production. Several scheduling techniques, such as quick turns (see Attachment
1) and establishing appropriate launch and recovery blocks, are used to provide the greatest number of
sorties.

OGT refers to 92 OGT Operations Group Training
    1.4.1. AMC Deployment Analysis System (ADANS). The air refueling component of this database is
    one part of AMC's integrated mobility and scheduling system.
    1.4.2. Attrition Sorties. Sorties added by maintenance scheduling that compensate for actual losses
    due to maintenance considerations, weather, operational considerations, Federal Aviation Administra-
    tion (FAA) restrictions, etc. These sorties ensure maintenance provides the number of sorties speci-
    fied in the sortie contract. They reflect seasonal and experience variations. NOTE: The number of
    attrition sorties is based on an analysis of historical data adjusted for the conditions expected for the
    period being scheduled. The monthly schedule will clearly identify attrition sorties. If attrition is dif-
    ferent than planned, adjustments to the schedule will be made to prevent exceeding maintenance capa-
    bilities.
    1.4.3. Block scheduling. A system of aircraft scheduling that coordinates takeoff and landing times
    with maintenance work shifts.
       1.4.3.1. Command and Control Information Processing System (C2IPS). AMC’s unit command
       and control system. Links command and control data from multiple functional areas.
    1.4.4. Dead Shift. Normally minimum manned maintenance shift between 0000L-0700L.
    1.4.5. First Sortie after Major Maintenance (FSAMM). The first sortie flown after Isochronal Inspec-
    tion or a refurb.
    1.4.6. Global Decision Support System (GDSS). AMC's worldwide network of command and control
    computers.
    1.4.7. Ground Alert Aircraft. Any aircraft designated as part of the ground alert force (see Standby
    Ground Alert, 1.4.17.).
    1.4.8. Military Airspace Management System (MASMS). An airspace management computer located
    at Offutt AFB that allows units assigned air refueling tracks and areas to manage their airspace
    requirements.
    1.4.9. Modular Training. Ground training that is accomplished in a specified block of time.
    1.4.10. Required Sorties. The minimum number of sorties required for a crew member to remain Mis-
    sion Ready. The number of sorties varies by crew position and experience.
    1.4.11. Scheduling Deviations. Changes to the printed weekly flying schedule that occur after the
    daily change sheet is published. Scheduling deviations are categorized as follows:
       1.4.11.1. Cancellation: A sortie on the printed flying schedule that does not take off within 3
       hours after the printed takeoff time. The termination of a scheduled sortie will be classified as
       either a ground abort, mission canceled prior to takeoff, or air abort, mission canceled after take-
       off.
       1.4.11.2. Addition. A sortie flown that was not printed on the weekly flying schedule. NOTE: If
       an aircraft takes off 3 hours after it’s printed takeoff time, it is shown as both a canceled and added
       sortie.
       1.4.11.3. Early/Late Takeoff. This occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes airborne more than 20
       minutes early or 14 minutes late. When a sortie takes off or lands outside of this window, OSOR
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                              7


     investigates the reason in coordination with maintenance analysis and reports its findings to the
     OG/CC, LG/CC, and AMC/MRO.
     1.4.11.4. Other. Any other changes made to the printed schedule (e.g., crew members, fuel loads,
     etc.).
  1.4.12. Departure Reliability Delay Factors. When a schedule deviation occurs, it is important to
  identify the root causes to help improve future plans. Delay Factors are categorized as follows:
     1.4.12.1. Weather. A delay caused by inclement weather including takeoff delays caused by
     adjusting flight plans for actual winds, thunderstorms, reduced visibility or runway/taxiway snow
     removal.
     1.4.12.2. FAA. A delay caused by FAA direction or restrictions.
     1.4.12.3. Higher Headquarters. A delay caused by specific direction or taskings from HQ AMC
     TACC, 15 AF or any other execution authority.
     1.4.12.4. Sympathetic For Receiver. A delay caused by the receiver.
     1.4.12.5. Scheduling. Any delay caused by a scheduling error.
     1.4.12.6. Maintenance. Delays caused by maintenance’s inability to accomplish required actions
     in preparation for flight or an aircraft system failure requiring maintenance on the equipment.
     1.4.12.7. Other. Delays that aren’t covered by the above categories. This category includes delays
     for flight lunches, cargo/passenger support, base operations, weather briefing, or crew communi-
     cations.
  1.4.13. Scheduled Sortie. An aircraft scheduled for a flight by tail number on the weekly flying
  schedule and confirmed on the daily flying schedule change sheet. Functional check flights (FCF) and
  alert launches are excluded.
  1.4.14. Sortie. The flight of a single aircraft from takeoff until landing, as determined in AFI 11-401.
     1.4.14.1. Quick Turn (QT). A procedure used to re-launch aircraft with minimum ground time
     and minimum maintenance. Attachment 1 provides additional details.
     1.4.14.2. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). A procedure used to turn aircraft with engines
     running and minimum ground time. Attachment 1 provides additional details.
     1.4.14.3. Thru-flight Sortie. A sortie flown with an aircraft that has landed and takes off again
     within the valid ground preflight period. There must be no fuel onloaded and the aircraft cannot
     have maintenance problems preventing the subsequent mission for this sortie to be accomplished.
     Must meet either ERCC or QT requirements.
  1.4.15. Sortie Contract. The QOP is a written agreement between operations and maintenance speci-
  fying the number of sorties and hours to be flown during the next quarter. This contract resolves any
  shortfalls between operations requirements and maintenance capabilities.
  1.4.16. Spare Aircraft. Additional aircraft designated on the flying schedule to back up one or more
  scheduled sorties. Each spare aircraft will be preflighted by maintenance prior to the crew showing for
  the first sortie of the day. Spares will be designated as follows:
     1.4.16.1. One spare for each sortie with priority code 1A(x) and 1B(x).

                                     AIRCREW SCHEDULING

2.1. General. Aircrew training/operational requirements directly influence the scheduling process for
both operations and maintenance.
   2.1.1. Squadron Scheduling Offices:
       2.1.1.1. OSS/OSO will maintain two offices (OSOX and OSOK) to serve the group and wing
       scheduling functions.
           2.1.1.1.1. OSOX is responsible for developing the YOP, QOP, MOP and actively managing
           the wing’s flying hour program. OSOX will be manned with a minimum of two highly quali-
           fied schedulers. The Chief of OSOX will be the Deputy OSO and act as the Flight Commander
           in the OSO’s absence.
           2.1.1.1.2. OSOK is responsible for developing the weekly schedule based on the MOP devel-
           oped by OSOX. OSOK develops the weekly schedule using a scheduling program accessible
           to all scheduling agencies via the Local Area Network (LAN). OSOK will be manned with
           five schedulers and a Chief of Short Range Scheduling. The Chief should have previous
           OSOK scheduling experience. The five OSOK schedulers will be assigned to OSOK for a
           15-month tour.
       2.1.1.2. Operational Squadrons: The four operational squadrons must establish a scheduling
       office manned with a minimum of three individuals. These schedulers report directly to the Oper-
       ations Officer for scheduling issues. Scheduling is a very time consuming and significant duty.
       Consequently, scheduling will be the only significant additional duty for these individuals. Squad-
       ron schedulers fill assigned sorties provided by OSOK with crew members to fill training and
       operational requirements. Each unit will also appoint a person to serve as a modular training focal
       point.

2.2. Aircrew Scheduler Training:
   2.2.1. The OSO will establish an aircrew scheduler training program. A scheduling continuity book
   will be developed and maintained by OSOK to provide training and operating guidance.
   2.2.2. OSOX will be the focal point of the squadron scheduler orientation class. This class will be
   offered on a quarterly basis and all schedulers should attend within 3 months of starting scheduling
   duties.

2.3. Aircrew Scheduler Retainability. To provide continuity and effectiveness, individuals assigned to
aircrew scheduling should have 12 to 18 months retainability.

2.4. Responsibilities:
   2.4.1. OSO will identify and elevate through TACC any training requirements/taskings that can not
   be met within the allocated flying hours or logistics capabilities.
   2.4.2. OSOF is responsible for the submission of Daily Tanker Activity Reports and collection of
   SORTS data for the Group.

     2.4.3. Group Training (OGT) will develop qualification/upgrade training plans designed to meet
     wing training objectives within the allocated flying time.
        2.4.3.1. Each squadron will develop operations plans (YOP, QOP, and MOP) and program each
        crew/individual to fly sufficient numbers and types of missions necessary to meet the following
        requirements:
        2.4.3.2. Initial/upgrade/requalification/difference training.
        2.4.3.3. Mission Qualification Training.
        2.4.3.4. Continuation Training.
        2.4.3.5. Wing Directed Training.
        2.4.3.6. Higher Headquarters directed missions.
        2.4.3.7. Initial/recurring academic and training device requirements.

2.5. Programs and Charts. Scheduling programs and charts should be accessible to aircrews and may be
located on any media (e.g., computer printouts, three ring binders, etc.). Optimally, the crews should have
real time access to the latest schedule change via information on each squadron’s LAN. If this is imprac-
tical, squadron schedulers will ensure the latest changes are posted in the squadron in a timely fashion.

2.6. Communications. The OG/LG will determine what communications systems are required for each
scheduling agency. Wing schedulers are authorized, but not limited to, cellular phone (duty scheduler),
base pager (duty scheduler), two-way radios, laptop computers, answering machines, and DSN access
from off base locations.

2.7. Description of the Monthly Operations Plans. There are four types of monthly plans: Initial, Work-
ing, Semi-final, and Final. Each of these plans is a refinement of the one preceding it.
     2.7.1. The Initial Plan: One of 12 monthly operations plans contained in the YOP. All other opera-
     tions plans are refinements of this plan. The initial plan must include:
        2.7.1.1. Proposed ground events (MOD training, dental appointments, etc.).
        2.7.1.2. Proposed exercises, squadron training days, and Wing Goal Days.
        2.7.1.3. Proposed leave schedule.
        2.7.1.4. Proposed/known TDYs. (ITUDs, SOS, CFIC, PUP, Business efforts, etc.).
        2.7.1.5. Proposed standby alert schedule.
        2.7.1.6. Proposed sorties, hours, training, and checkride activity.
        2.7.1.7. Other known requirements.
     2.7.2. The Working Plan. This represents the current month of the QOP and basically consists of
     updated, initial plan information. The working plan must include:
        2.7.2.1. Firm exercises, Wing goal days, and Squadron Training days.
        2.7.2.2. Proposed fly days for each crew/crew member.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                                11


  2.7.3. The Semi-final Plan. This represents the 2d month of the rolling 3-month QOP period. The
  semi-final plan is developed from the working plan and must include the following refinements:
     2.7.3.1. Firm leave schedule.
     2.7.3.2. Other known training/operational requirements.
  2.7.4. The Final Plan. This represents the 1st month of the 3-month QOP period and is a refinement
  of the semi-final plan. It will include all known activity for crews, crew members, initial quals/
  upgrades, and assigned/attached staff flyers. It will count in those items that are difficult to project for
  more than 1 month. As a minimum, the final plan will include the following additions/refinements:
     2.7.4.1. Firm ground events.
     2.7.4.2. Specific dates for mission planning.
     2.7.4.3. Attrition sorties identified (if needed).
     2.7.4.4. A firm standby and flying schedule.
     2.7.4.5. Firm training and check ride activity.

                                                   Chapter 3

                                         AIRCRAFT SCHEDULING

3.1. General. This chapter provides uniform, objective guidelines for the development of schedules and
establishes policies and procedures applicable to maintenance organizations.
     3.1.1. Aircraft scheduling is a key element of a unit's planning process, influencing the entire mainte-
     nance and operations community. A well developed plan/schedule is a basic element of mission suc-
     cess. Aircraft scheduling is the responsibility of the LG.
     3.1.2. Maintenance manpower authorizations are normally not sufficient for 24 hour per day mainte-
     nance coverage. Therefore, schedules should allow most of the maintenance effort to be accomplished
     in 2 daily work shifts.
     3.1.3. Maintenance scheduling will consider attrition when planning the flying schedule. Historical
     data must be analyzed and attrition factors updated to reflect unit seasonal and experience variations.
     Attrition factors are applied by maintenance to determine the number of extra sorties that must be
     planned to ensure the number of contracted sorties are provided. The QOP and monthly maintenance
     plan will identify attrition sorties based on aircrew and aircraft availability in addition to all other sor-
     ties. An attrition sortie will not be assigned to a specific aircrew until a required sortie is lost.

3.2. Goals and Policies. All actions are accomplished to attain established goals and are planned and
scheduled according to specific policies. Goals must be stated in relation to specific policies (what is
desired/required, who is responsible, how often is the activity scheduled, etc.). Figure 3.1. and Figure
3.2. are minimum scheduling goals and policies

Figure 3.1. Scheduling Goals.
GOALS & POLICY
GOAL: To accomplish unit training and maintain readiness, using existing resources, while maintaining
quality of life work standards.
POLICY: Distribute flying activities equitably throughout the AGS organizational structure. This pro-
vides an equitable number of preflight, launch, and recovery actions in each SGF. It allows each flight
chief to better predict requirements and obtain maximum utilization of assigned personnel.
GOAL: Equalize the operational hour distribution as uniformly as possible throughout the month, utilize
the maintenance force without resorting to overtime.
POLICY: Consider both operational and maintenance requirements when preparing the operational
schedule. Maintenance capability must be given prime consideration. If maintenance capability is
exceeded for extended periods, maintenance quality will suffer, and ultimately, mission requirements will
not be met.
GOAL: Minimize "peaks and valleys" maintenance workloads.
POLICY: Evenly distribute sorties through the month; spread the workload throughout the entire aircraft/
fleet work force.
GOAL: Maintain inspection dock flow.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                               13


POLICY: Isochronal inspections are forecast for a minimum 3-month periods. Forecasts are adjusted
monthly. Minimal changes should be made to the monthly forecast since time change components requi-
sitions are submitted based on the monthly schedule.
POLICY: Pre-inspection meetings should be conducted prior to input.
POLICY: Plan inspections to minimize NMCM status over weekends and holidays.
POLICY: Scheduling TCTOs in conjunction with Isochronal inspection is desired.

3.3. Scheduling Process:
   3.3.1. Quarterly Planning. Maintenance scheduling is required to maintain a quarterly forecast (QOP)
   of maintenance requirements for each sortie generation flight. The forecast for the 2d and 3d months
   will contain known requirements, e.g., PDM, alert cycles, TDY, Isochronal Inspection, Equipment
   Excellence Program (Refurb), aircraft wash, Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), special
   inspections, and any other known requirements/commitments. Even though each of the preceding
   items may change, quarterly planning is essential to prepare for more detailed monthly and weekly
   schedules. The selection of aircraft serial numbers for standby alert and TDY deployment will be
   based on a thorough evaluation of the past performance of the aircraft and its systems. The foundation
   for quarterly planning is described in paragraph 4.5. of this instruction. Isochronal inspections and air-
   craft refurbishment will be forecasted as far into the future as possible to support tasked ITUD com-
   mitments.
   3.3.2. Monthly Planning. Monthly maintenance plans are the first refinement to the maintenance
   QOP. The QOP shows known scheduling requirements, e.g., PDM, standby alert, TDY, and special
   inspections. To develop a monthly maintenance plan, use this data plus any required attrition sorties
   and known calendar and hourly inspections occurring during the applicable month. All PDM inputs,
   scheduled transfers, aircraft training requirements, and special activities are integrated with extracts
   from the GO81 data base for -6 inspection requirements, time change/special inspections, and work-
   able TCTOs. Review the plan for balance and flow. If any overall activity reveals peaks and valleys,
   adjust the schedule to distribute evenly that activity over the complete month. All known require-
   ments, including utilization of aircraft and final adjustments to the schedule, will be published in the
   Monthly Maintenance Plan. Figure 3.2. portrays a typical monthly schedule and includes those
   requirements that must be included in every sortie generation flight (SGF) maintenance plan.
   3.3.3. Weekly Utilization and Maintenance Planning:
       3.3.3.1. Short-range planning. Aircraft schedulers must continuously refine and provide addi-
       tional details for weekly and daily planning. The quarterly/monthly plans are used as guides in
       planning and scheduling maintenance. With a better long-range plan, fewer changes will need to
       be made. The purpose of the weekly maintenance and utilization plan is to refine the monthly
       maintenance plan and provide additional details (Figure 3.3.). Adjustments to the plan are made
       to accommodate unforeseen operations and maintenance problems, such as missions added by
       higher headquarters, cancellations due to bad weather, and attrition factors. Once published, the
       weekly schedule provides the final contract for both operations and maintenance. Deviations from
       the schedule should be held to an absolute minimum. All aircraft and equipment should be
       required to meet the schedule and all planned maintenance should be accomplished as specified.
       3.3.3.2. The development process. Extract all known maintenance requirements not requiring
       change or update from the current monthly maintenance plan. The current monthly maintenance
14                                                                     FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998


        plan is the basic source document used in the development of the weekly plan. These requirements
        include dock inputs and completion times, PDM input/output, washes, aircraft maintenance train-
        ing requirements, and other scheduled maintenance activities. Coordinate with documentation for
        changes to attrition, inspection schedules, time changes, TCTOs, document reviews, etc., and with
        aircraft systems analysis.
        3.3.3.3. Operational requirements. Before computing maintenance support requirements, opera-
        tions requirements must be known. The working schedule will show takeoff and landing times,
        flight duration, fuel loads, equipment configurations, and aircrew training requirements. It is
        extremely important schedulers familiarize themselves with crew training requirements to provide
        maximum utilization of the aircraft. After receiving the operations requirements, extract the tail
        numbers selected to fly during the coming week from the monthly maintenance plan. It is the
        scheduler's responsibility to decide whether maintenance can support the proposed operational
        schedule without exceeding maintenance resources. Coordination with SGF production superin-
        tendent is necessary.
        3.3.3.4. Adjustments to The Weekly Schedule. Schedulers must be constantly aware of the loca-
        tion and status of aircraft and equipment, because schedule changes can occur at any time. These
        changes occur because of short-notice missions added by TACC, failure of the aircraft or equip-
        ment to perform its assigned mission, component or system failure, or non-availability of flight
        crews. After a change is directed, the scheduler must base his/her solution on the aircraft's capabil-
        ity, maintenance status, configuration, and most importantly, the impact on the long range plan.
        Schedulers will ensure all changes are made per paragraph 4.7. of this instruction and that proper
        coordination and notification of all affected work centers is accomplished.

3.4. Minimizing Deviations. Selection of the proper aircraft to fly specific missions can spell the differ-
ence between mission accomplishment and failure. Therefore, all schedules should be developed with the
utmost care. If the schedule is prepared properly, all the scheduler needs to do is to add the necessary
details to keep deviations to a minimum. There are no set rules for this process, but there are certain fac-
tors that must be considered in making the selection.
     3.4.1. Utilization schedules to which only minor changes are required are those that were carefully
     prepared initially. Proper selection of the best aircraft for the requested sortie is dependent upon
     awareness of the current circumstances, aircraft status, and sortie type to be flown. Good long range
     planning directly affects good short range planning. Ideally, the weekly schedule should be an extract
     from the monthly schedule. However, adjustments normally must be made when developing the
     weekly schedule. Specific mission requirements can affect the tail number selection. Selection of an
     alternate aircraft over the original preference should be one that causes the least disruption to the over-
     all plan. To do this, coordinate with the production supervisors, the crew chiefs, and the shop chiefs.
     3.4.2. Determine which of those aircraft scheduled to fly on the monthly plan are actually capable of
     performing this mission. This information can usually be obtained from the operations scheduler or
     production supervisors.
     3.4.3. Determine which aircraft are in commission. If six sorties are required and only five of the air-
     craft are FMC, check with the production supervisor for the latest estimated time in commission
     (ETIC). If the ETIC suggests the aircraft will not be able to fulfill the sortie requirement, select a
     replacement aircraft that will cause the least disruption to the weekly schedule.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                              15


       3.4.3.1. Ensure the aircraft are properly configured. Indiscriminately downloading and uploading
       aircraft with primary and alternate mission equipment can waste many maintenance man-hours. If
       a continuing requirement exists for a certain number of aircraft in a particular configuration,
       choose the aircraft carefully for maximum utilization in their current configuration.
   3.4.4. Determine the impact on the long-range plan if one aircraft is chosen versus another. Selecting
   a certain aircraft to fly a given sortie is one of the most important decisions an aircraft scheduler
   makes.

3.5. Analysis of Adverse Trends/Deviations. When adverse trends and deviations (late takeoffs, cancella-
tions, etc.) become excessive, Plans, Scheduling, and Documentation must work closely with mainte-
nance systems analysis to identify the cause and make recommendations to the LG. Additionally, OSOR
should be contacted for possible discussion of trends at the monthly Mission Reliability Panel (MRP).
The root cause of adverse trends and deviations may lie in one, or a combination of reasons. For example,
a significant increase in late takeoffs may be the result of inadequate scheduling techniques or a specific
material deficiency, or both.

3.6. Unit Capabilities. To meet mission requirements, maintenance managers are provided manpower,
equipment, and financial resources. The effective use of these resources is a primary concern of all
assigned personnel. Effective employment of resources is directly related to the ability to efficiently plan
how the resources will be used and to ensure the plans are met. The LG and other maintenance managers
must know the capabilities and performance of manpower and equipment.

                                                Chapter 4

                                      THE PLANNING PROCESS

4.1. General. The planning process involves six closely related but separate phases: YOP development,
quarterly air refueling conferences, QOP development, weekly schedule development, daily change sheet
development, and review/feedback (Figure 4.1. through Figure 4.5.). Each phase is the result of detailed
effort that balances the requirements and capabilities of both maintenance and operations. The YOP gives
the wing commander the direction and foundation for achieving objectives. Wing objectives and goals
must be monitored for deviations. The quarterly air refueling conference, QOP, and weekly plans are
refinements of the YOP. Daily adjustments followed by review/feedback are the final steps in achieving
wing objectives.

4.2. Operational Planning Data. The planning process starts upon receipt of the first information affecting
the wing for the upcoming fiscal year. OSOX normally receives this information in June. Through a con-
tinuing process of increasing detail and refinement in coordination with the wing's maintenance staff, this
information is translated into a final YOP. OSOX bases the YOP on the following information:
     4.2.1. Known ITUD commitments.
     4.2.2. Allocated flying time.
     4.2.3. Higher headquarters and local exercises.
     4.2.4. Standby commitments.
     4.2.5. Quarterly air refueling schedule and any additional higher headquarters commitments.

4.3. Yearly Operations Planning. The YOP is the first and most important step in maximizing stable and
equitable workloads, quality aircrew and maintenance training; mission readiness, and satisfied custom-
ers. All other plans are refinements of the YOP. The YOP must be continually revised, updated, and mon-
itored to ensure wing objectives are achieved. Adjustments to planned activity should be made only to
accommodate unforeseen operations and maintenance requirements.

4.4. Quarterly Air Refueling Conference Planning. The quarterly air refueling conference is the key to an
effective wing flying schedule. It is at this time that launch/recovery blocks, sortie flow timing, etc., are
established based on air refueling and higher headquarters commitments. Operations and maintenance
schedulers must recognize the importance of detailed planning 6 months out to ensure that the framework
for an effective QOP and weekly schedule are established. OSOX will gather data from all concerned
staff agencies (ARW, LG, OG, squadrons, and HQ AMC/TACC) prior to attending the conference.
OSOX will develop a tentative quarterly requirements list to satisfy at the conference.
     4.4.1. Using the annual flying hour allocation, OSOX provides LGLS and all ARS’s with the follow-
     ing requirements not later than 1st workday of 4th month before the target quarter:
        4.4.1.1. Required flying hours and sorties in monthly increments.
        4.4.1.2. Flying days in each month.
        4.4.1.3. Aircraft/aircrew standby requirements.
        4.4.1.4. Known and projected TDY and special mission requirements.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                              19


   4.4.2. LGLS must compute the capability of maintenance to support operational requirements. No
   later than the 1st workday of 3d month before the target quarter, LGLS must provide OSOX the fol-
   lowing planning factors:
       4.4.2.1. Estimated number of aircraft available by day and a projected airframe capability state-
       ment, forecasted personnel capability, and the number of sorties that can be supported.
       4.4.2.2. Recommended block scheduling patterns to meet operational requirements.
       4.4.2.3. Statement of limitations in meeting the operational requirements.
   4.4.3. OSOX will make every effort to obtain sorties that takeoff and land outside the Fog and Bird
   Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) critical time periods. When able, work with receiver units to move air
   refueling control times or tracks to accomplish this goal at the quarterly air refueling conference.

4.5. Quarterly Operations Planning:
   4.5.1. The QOP is the primary tool for finalizing and coordinating all maintenance and operations
   activities. It serves as the formal operations/maintenance sortie contract. The QOP is updated quar-
   terly and provides a relatively firm 3-month plan. The monthly updates will not require OG/CC, LG/
   CC, and ARW/CC approval but will provide the updated information required to plan for the next
   month. Before the QOP is formalized, the following actions are required:
       4.5.1.1. Not later than 1600L the 15th day of the month before the target QOP, OSOX will pro-
       vide operations squadrons and LGLS any necessary adjustments/updates to the next month's oper-
       ational requirements. As a minimum, the following information is provided:
          4.5.1.1.1. Sorties required by day, estimated takeoff time, duration, estimated downtime, and
          estimated fuel loads.
          4.5.1.1.2. Home station sorties by type and flying hours.
          4.5.1.1.3. Known or anticipated TDYs and scheduled exercises. Known sorties and flying
          hours required to be flown while TDY.
          4.5.1.1.4. Alert/standby requirements.
   4.5.2. Not later than 1600L Thursday of second full week of the month before the target QOP, LGLS
   will:
       4.5.2.1. Determine the attrition factor using historical sortie attrition factors from Maintenance
       Systems Analysis and the factors provided by operations. Factors will be tempered with sound
       judgment and adjusted to the expected environment for the coming months.
       4.5.2.2. Compute the total number of sorties that must be scheduled to meet the sortie contract.
       When scheduling sorties to fulfill the mission commitment, the scheduler must consider attrition
       factors that will influence the ability of maintenance to provide the required number of sorties.
       Attrition is the reduction or loss of sorties due to weather, operations, and maintenance or mate-
       riel. To allow for this attrition, the maintenance scheduler schedules, in the monthly maintenance
       plan, the contracted sorties plus the number of sorties indicated by the attrition factor percentage.
       EXAMPLE: A unit is committed to fly 81 seven-hour sorties, or 567 hours. Historical data reveals

Maintenance, Supply, etc.)


TOTAL ATTRITION                          10%

        In order to fly required sorties, we must plan to over schedule our commitment by 10%. To do this
        subtract 10% from 100% which leaves us with 90%. Therefore, 81 committed sorties represent
        only 90% of the sorties we must schedule. To find out how many sorties to schedule we divide 81
        by 0.9 (90%).
        Eighty-one required sorties contracted divided by 0.9 equals 90 required sorties for maintenance
        to plan to prepare. Round to the next whole mission or sortie.
        We arrive at planning figure of 90 sorties. If attrition is normal, nine sorties will be lost. The result
        will be 81 sorties planned plus nine attrition sorties.
        4.5.2.3. Confirm the most desirable block scheduling patterns considering all restrictions to meet
        operational requirements.
        4.5.2.4. Make a draft tail number schedule using the SGF Monthly Maintenance Plan (Figure
        3.2.). As a minimum show:
            4.5.2.4.1. Projected major maintenance requirements. Isochronal inspections, refurbs,
            TCTOs, major maintenance, etc.
            4.5.2.4.2. Known airframe requirements. Alert standby, PDM, aircraft maintenance training,
            FTD requirements, depot schedule, etc.
            4.5.2.4.3. Flying days.
            4.5.2.4.4. Days where there are no flying activities planned.
     4.5.3. Not later than 1600L Thursday of the second full week of the month before the beginning of
     the target QOP, LGLS provides OSOX:
        4.5.3.1. The maintenance capability to meet operational requirements.
        4.5.3.2. The number of attrition sorties required to meet the sortie contract.
        4.5.3.3. When limitations exist or adjustments are needed, OG and LG will make every effort to
        arrive at an equitable monthly plan considering the requirements and limitations of both opera-
        tions and maintenance. In addition, the OG and LG, using the sortie contract, will agree upon the
        total sorties to be scheduled using the forecasted attrition factors. When flying time limitations
        occur, it is important that aircrew training schedules be oriented toward early accomplishment of
        high priority and hard-to-get training activities.
     4.5.4. The three QOP’s (JAN-MAR, APR-JUN, JUL-SEP), signed by the OG, LG, and Wing CC,
     will be distributed no later than the 1st day of the upcoming 3-month cycle. All other monthly updates
     will be distributed no later than the 1st day of the upcoming month.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                               21


       4.5.4.1. When the proposed QOP has been agreed to and approved by the Wing Commander, it
       becomes the official wing plan.
       4.5.4.2. Prepare the QOP according to the guidance contained in Attachment 2.

4.6. Weekly Planning. The wing weekly flying schedule, signed by the OG and LG, refines the QOP. It
normally covers the period from 0000L Monday to 2359L Sunday and shows operational and mainte-
nance requirements in detail.
   4.6.1. The following procedures apply to ensure that effective weekly aircrew flying and aircraft
   maintenance schedules are produced (See Figure 4.4.). In the event the LAN is down information nor-
   mally received via the LAN will be transmitted by paper copy versions.
       4.6.1.1. As soon as possible, but NLT 1600L each Friday, OSOK will ensure the following infor-
       mation is available on the LAN to give LGLS and operations squadrons access to the working
       schedule for the subject week:
          4.6.1.1.1. Number and duration of sorties required.
          4.6.1.1.2. Requested takeoff and landing times for each sortie giving careful consideration to
          the critical time period for heightened bird activity (+/- 1 hour of sunrise/sunset) and historical
          fog periods.
          4.6.1.1.3. Configuration requirements and fuel loads.
          4.6.1.1.4. Special mission support equipment required.
          4.6.1.1.5. Special requirements such as exercises or missions that impact the schedule.
       4.6.1.2. Receiver units must finalize air refueling requirements by Tuesday, 1200L, for the fol-
       lowing week (for tanker unit concerned) per FAA 7610.4H (paragraph 1055C).
       4.6.1.3. As soon as possible after receipt of operations requirements but NLT 1000L each
       Wednesday, LGLS must provide the OSOK:
          4.6.1.3.1. Tail numbers of the aircraft to fill operational requirements, loaded on the schedule
          via the LAN.
          4.6.1.3.2. Weekly aircraft utilization/ maintenance schedules. NOTE: the monthly mainte-
          nance plan will be published as an annex to the weekly schedule one week prior to the affected
          month.
   4.6.2. The OSO is responsible for the preparation/publication of the Weekly Aircrew/Aircraft Flying
   Schedule. OSOK will ensure schedule is published for the following week by 1600L on Thursday.
   4.6.3. The OG/LG or their alternate senior officer representative will each conduct their own weekly
   pre 60-2 meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to review and finalize the details of the weekly
   aircrew flying and aircraft maintenance schedules. As a minimum, the following agencies must
   attend:
   4.6.4. If OG or LG alternate representatives attend the pre 60-2 meeting; those representatives will
   brief the OG and/or LG before the 60-2 meeting.

     Operations Officer, or Scheduler

     4.6.5. OSOK and LGLS will, before the weekly scheduling meeting, discuss weekly requirements
     and arrive at a coordinated schedule.
     4.6.6. The weekly 60-2 meeting will be held no later than Thursday of each week. Both operations
     and maintenance should make status and situation presentations with emphasis on mission success
     data, trends and limitations, if any. Changes to the schedule can be made up until Wednesday before
     1630.
        4.6.6.1. The OSO will present:
            4.6.6.1.1. Quarterly flying hour status.
            4.6.6.1.2. Flying hours scheduled and flown the previous week
            4.6.6.1.3. Significant events impacting training/operational requirements.
            4.6.6.1.4. Departure reliability to previous week's printed schedule.
            4.6.6.1.5. A complete aircrew flying schedule for the coming week. This schedule should
            coincide with the QOP and include:
               4.6.6.1.5.1. The aircraft tail numbers agreed to at the weekly pre 60-2 meeting.
               4.6.6.1.5.2. Takeoff and landing times as previously coordinated at the pre 60-2 meeting.
               4.6.6.1.5.3. Firm requirements by sortie (type mission, primary and spare crew members,
               fuel loads, fuel on/off load, and other pertinent data including MAJCOM, MDS, home sta-
               tion, and unit of the aircraft being refueled).
               4.6.6.1.5.4. Bird strikes pose a significant hazard to low altitude flight operations, traffic
               pattern, takeoff, and landing. All wing flying squadrons will participate in the base bird/
               aircraft strike hazard (BASH) reduction program. Schedulers must be knowledgeable of
               bird hazards, impact on the mission and possible solutions when scheduling low altitude
               operations. Schedulers should be aware of peak bird activity periods and will consult the
               Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) at each location scheduled. If it is determined that the loca-
               tion is not suitable for transition during the desired time frame, a more suitable transition
               base will be coordinated. BASH Phase (I or II) and the number of takeoffs and landings
               during the critical periods will be annotated on the cover of the flying schedule.
        4.6.6.2. LGLS will present the following information. For analysis purposes, the data listed below
        will be as of the end of flying the Sunday before the 60-2 meeting:
            4.6.6.2.1. The number of contracted sorties.
FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998                                                                            23


          4.6.6.2.2. Maintenance limiting factors.
          4.6.6.2.3. How any special or unique requirements will be supported.
          4.6.6.2.4. Attrition sorties used/remaining in the month.

4.7. Changes to the Weekly Aircraft/Aircrew Schedules. The OSO is responsible for the printed weekly
schedule, and with the concurrence from LG and OG commanders, has the authority to deviate from it.
Changes that affect maintenance must be coordinated with LGLS. The OG and LG retain the authority for
sortie additions/cancellations.
   4.7.1. OSO will develop procedures to ensure that the proper agencies/individuals are notified of all
   changes.
   4.7.2. Changes to the weekly schedule will be made with discretion. If changes affecting maintenance
   become necessary, the AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination, will be used to
   obtain the needed coordination. Whether initiated by LGLS, MACC, or SGF production superinten-
   dents, complete notification of all affected agencies will be made as soon as possible after the change
   has been confirmed by OSOK.
   4.7.3. Changes to the weekly aircrew flying schedule will be reflected on the daily change sheets.
   Complete notification of all affected agencies will occur as soon as possible after the change has been
   initiated. Schedule changes will be confirmed between 1400-1500L the day before mission execution.
   Changes affecting maintenance will be coordinated with LGLS by OSOK. OSOK will e-mail or fax
   daily change sheets by 1600L. Change sheets will be distributed to ARW/CC/CV, OG/CC/CD, LG/
   CC, OSS/CC/DO, ARS, OSO, LGLS, transportation, command post, weather, Spokane Approach,
   and tower. If change sheets are not received, call the OSOK duty scheduler.
   4.7.4. Master copies of the following documents will be filed on a monthly basis and retained for 1
   year, the weekly flying schedule, AF Forms 3578 (Tanker Activity Report), and the QOP.
   4.7.5. All changes to the weekly maintenance plan/schedule will be kept with the maintenance master
   schedule. Document the reasons for changes on the schedule itself or on the respective AF Form 2407.
   Changes are accounted for and reviewed by the LGLS Superintendent for adverse trends, analyzing
   scheduling technique, aircraft selection, and operations impact.

4.8. Flying Hour Verification Procedures. The source document for flying hours is the AFTO Form 781.
Flying hours flown are reported officially to HQ AMC through GO81. Maintenance Debriefing is respon-
sible for the accuracy of flying hour data in GO81.
   4.8.1. Weekly, NLT Wednesday, Debriefing, and OSOX will verify flying hours and the accuracy of
   mission symbols for the previous week. Any discrepancies in GO81 will be corrected by maintenance
   debriefing. The applicable ARS Flight Records section will correct discrepancies noted on the AFTO
   Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
   4.8.2. Monthly, on the first Tuesday of the month, Debriefing, and OSOX will audit the previous
   month’s flying hour report to ensure complete accuracy.
   4.8.3. Maintenance Debrief will maintain the weekly/monthly flying hour reports for 1 year.
   4.8.4. OSOX and LGLS will monitor the annual flying hour program and make adjustments as
   required to remain within the funded number of flying hours.

                                     SCHEDULE EXECUTION

5.1. General. The weekly schedule, signed by the operations and logistics group commanders is a con-
tract and must be followed as amended by confirmed changes. Commitments to other units must be hon-
ored to the maximum extent possible, so those units can meet their mission objectives. Any agency that
desires a change must coordinate with OSOK.
   5.1.1. Assign tail numbers to make best use of maintenance resources.
   5.1.2. The OG/CC may establish engine start times to meet mission requirements.
   5.1.3. All commanders should evaluate how well they executed their planned flying schedule by doc-
   umenting the number of sorties scheduled and flown. Attempts to achieve high effectiveness should
   not prevent the use of sound judgment. It may be more prudent to deviate than to work personnel over-
   time or rush to produce a non-productive training sortie. Consider the impact on the remainder of the
   day's schedule and possible effect on future schedules.
   5.1.4. If a launch is delayed, the OG/CC, with OSOK’s and applicable ARS/CC or DO’s recommen-
   dation, will determine whether the sortie should be canceled or launched late. Consider the aircraft's
   and crew's next scheduled activities and the current bird condition in making the recommendation to
   the OG/LG commanders.
   5.1.5. The use of spare aircraft on the daily flying schedule is authorized. The OG/CC, in coordina-
   tion with production supervisors, the aircraft commander and MACC, will decide whether a spare
   should be used. The following factors will be considered: priority of mission, possibility of delaying
   mission, urgency of planned crew training, fuel load, configuration, and competing sorties requiring
   spare coverage.

5.2. Schedule Deviations:
   5.2.1. OSOK is responsible for documenting deviations to the weekly flying schedule and determin-
   ing their causes. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will be assigned a primary
   cause.
   5.2.2. To ensure efficient use of maintenance personnel and speed aircraft recovery, OSOK will coor-
   dinate with maintenance when aircrews plan early or late landings (greater than + or - 15 minutes).
   Every effort will be made to coordinate changes at the earliest possible time to ensure effective man-
   agement of resources. Additions will be recorded if the aircraft scheduled to fly becomes airborne
   beyond tolerances. Fuel loads, once published in the weekly schedule, should not be changed unless
   mission requirements dictate. When extenuating circumstances dictate a change that impacts mainte-
   nance, coordination is essential. Refer to AFI 21-101 and AMCI 21-101 for AF Form 2407 guidance.
   Changes arising on the flying day after the first crew ready time do not require an AF Form 2407.
30                                                                 FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998


     5.2.3. When the weekly flying schedule is disrupted due to an unannounced exercise/real world con-
     tingency, the unaccomplished portion of the flying schedule will be voided if required. Upon comple-
     tion of the exercise/contingency, a new flying schedule will be accomplished if necessary.

                              MAXIMIZING SORTIE PRODUCTION

A1.1. Quick-Turn Procedures (QT). The goal of the QT is to increase sortie production while keeping
maintenance workload to a minimum. A detailed plan and close coordination between operations and
maintenance is required for the procedure to work. Since time may limit maintenance accomplished
between sorties, some systems may be degraded. This has to be a consideration when scheduling opera-
tions training events.
   A1.1.1. When possible, the aircrew accepting the QT aircraft should obtain a post flight debriefing
   from the deplaning aircrew.
   A1.1.2. Maintenance requirements contained in the appropriate aircraft -6 inspection workcards will
   be accomplished per T.O. 00-20-5, paragraph 2-4c. Landing time for the first sortie (QT aircraft)
   should be met, so as not to impact the maintenance effort in turning the aircraft.
       A1.1.2.1. The aircraft should be scheduled for minimum ground time. Normal scheduled ground
       time between landing and takeoff for QT type sorties for the KC-135 series aircraft is 4 hours.
       A1.1.2.2. KC-135 aircraft may fly as many sorties as possible during the 72 hour pre-flight period
       using the Quick-Turn check list for KC-135's.
       A1.1.2.3. All QT sorties will be identified in the weekly 60-2 schedule.

A1.2. The Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) sortie is used to optimize aircraft use. It involves the
turnaround of an aircraft incorporating partial or full crew change between two sorties. Minimum mainte-
nance involvement should be required, i.e., chock aircraft and assist in crew change. Normal scheduled
ground time is 30 minutes.

                  DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUARTERLY OPERATIONS PLAN

A2.1. OSOX must prepare and distribute a comprehensive quarterly operations plan no later than the
15th day of the target 3-month period. Before distribution, the four Quarterly Operations Plans will be
signed by the OG & LG and, after approval, signed by the wing commander.

A2.2. Formal publication of the plan must be in the format outlined in Figure A2.1.
     A2.2.1. Basic Plan. General outline of the operations plan, training priorities, and training goals will
     be included in this section.
     A2.2.2. Section 1, Quarterly Planning Factors. Include all known Higher Headquarters’ Directed and
     business effort requirements as well as ITUD commitments.
     A2.2.3. Section 2, Flying Time Summary by Squadron. Include the quarterly flying hours forecast by
     month for the current quarter.
     A2.2.4. Section 3, Standby/Alert/Duty IP/SOF Schedule. This section includes a 3-month schedule of
     each of these commitments.
     A2.2.5. Section 4, Sortie Contract. Include each squadron sortie contract as originally published and
     distributed.

                                MISSION REVIEW PROCEDURES

A3.1. PURPOSE: Review and record pertinent sortie information on the Wing Master Schedule, and
ensure that mission paperwork is completed correctly for accurate reporting to HQ AMC.

A3.2. Each squadron will hold a squadron mission review prior to the wing meeting to ensure that all
paperwork is complete and accurate when compared to the daily change sheet. This meeting should con-
sist of a DO, ADO, or flight commander along with a squadron scheduler, and a flight records representa-
tive.
   A3.2.1. Each squadron must ensure that all mission packages for wing review are complete and
   brought to the wing’s daily mission review meeting. All data on all documents must match.
   A3.2.2. Each mission package for wing review should contain as a minimum the following docu-
   ments:
   Flight Orders
   AFTO Form 781
   AF Form 791 (If an air refueling occurred)
   AF Form 3578
   Mission Accomplishment Reports

A3.3. The daily wing mission review meeting is held Monday through Friday at 1300 at the Wing Sched-
uling Office (OSOK). Attendees must include a representative from each squadron and will be chaired by
a wing operations resource manager. The mission review meeting will accomplish the following:
   A3.3.1. Reconstruct what actually occurred on all 92 ARW flying missions and record the results on
   the wing’s master flying schedule.
   A3.3.2. Ensure mission paperwork is filled out properly and is checked against the wing’s master fly-
   ing schedule. Missing/incorrect data will be corrected not later than the next wing mission review
   meeting.
   A3.3.3. Provide feedback to squadron operations officers on the quality of mission paperwork.
   A3.3.4. Any discrepancies between the data on the master flying schedule and the mission paperwork
   must be annotated on the schedule and the reasons for the differences logged on the master change
   sheet.
   A3.3.5. All information collected will be formatted for accurate and timely transmission to HQ
   AMC.

A3.4. All squadrons deploying to a TTF location or extended TDY are required to transmit AFTO Form
781 and AF Form 3578 information to OSOX (Fax DSN 657-5991) within 24 hours of reaching final TTF
or TDY location.
34                                                                 FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998


     A3.4.1. It is the responsibility of the ITUD commander, aircraft commander or operations resource
     management specialist to relay this information. When fax services are unavailable, provide informa-
     tion in message format or as a last resort telecon is acceptable.
     A3.4.2. The ITUD commander will retain all original AFTO Form 781’s and AF Form 3578 data
     until return to home station. For deployments over 14 days, where employment sorties are chargeable
     to home unit (i.e. RED FLAG, JTFEX and Howard TTF), copies of the 781’s and 3578’s will be
     mailed to home station weekly.
     A3.4.3. TDY utilization messages are interim source documents which permit flying time to be
     entered into GO81 as well as home station flying hour database. When the unit of possession pro-
     cesses the original forms, they will supersede the TDY utilization messages as source documents.

                       ORIENTATION FLIGHTS ON MISSION AIRCRAFT

A4.1. This attachment defines guidelines to be used in the administration of orientation and familiariza-
tion flights on all 92 ARW mission aircraft. This includes, but is not limited to flights supporting Airman
Leadership School and Maintenance Qualification Training Program (MQTP) graduates, 92 ARW Com-
mand Post/Maintenance Aircraft Coordination Center personnel, FAA and military air traffic controllers
including tower personnel, 92 ARW assigned first sergeants, chaplains, and commanders etc. who are
normally assigned the status of mission essential ground personnel (MEGP), and participants in ROTC
and spouse orientation flights. Reference DoD 4515.13-R Chap 4 for additional categories and specific
program requirements of eligible passengers.

A4.2. All orientation flight requests will be submitted to the Chief, Current Operations (92 OSS/ OSO)
using the attached format. Requests should be submitted as soon as possible, preferably 30 days before the
planned flight, but in no case should the request be submitted later than 5 working days prior to the
Wednesday before the week of the desired mission. This suspense is necessary to allow for the request to
be routed to 92 ARW/CC for approval prior to being entered into the normal mission development pro-
cess.
   A4.2.1. After receiving and identifying the request, 92 OSS/OSO will forward the request to 92 OG/
   CC for approval. The request will then be sent to 92 ARW/CC for final approval. Once 92 ARW/CC
   has approved the request, it will be returned to 92 OSS/OSO where the orientation flight activity will
   be assigned to a specific mission and approved by 92 OG/CC during the normal 60-2 process.

A4.3. Orientation flight activity will not be scheduled to conflict with aircrew training/mission accom-
plishment. Touch-and-go landings will not be accomplished except with FAA and military air traffic con-
trollers/air traffic control analysis team members.
   A4.3.1. Normally, the number of passengers should be limited to six, allowing greater ease of air
   refueling observations. Requests for more than 10 passengers requires a minimum of 14 days for coor-
   dination.
   A4.3.2. All individuals approved for an orientation or familiarization flight, including MEGP's, must
   be manifested on a DD Form 96B, Passenger Manifest.
   A4.3.3. Attendance at the mission planning briefing is not mandatory but highly encouraged. This
   activity exposes the individual(s) to the amount of planning and detail required to fly a mission. Mis-
   sion planning also presents an excellent opportunity to brief the passengers on oxygen and emergency
   procedures, to receive Life Support Training, and to make arrangements for flight lunches and passen-
   ger manifests.

A4.4. Aircrews must review applicable regulations for latest restrictions and reference Air Force and
command regulations. See DoD 4515.13-R Chap. 4, AMCI 11-235, and AFI 11-401.

                                              Attachment 5

                                  OPPORTUNE AIRLIFT POLICY

A5.1. Opportune Airlift is defined as the use of training hours for the purpose of picking up or dropping
off equipment/personnel without having received a TACC tasking.

A5.2. Training hours are allocated to accomplish specific aircrew training events. Use of this time for
Opportune Airlift may detract from an effective unit training program and degrade unit readiness. How-
ever, at times, opportune airlift can be a valid by-product of a wise use of training time. Unit commanders
will ensure the following criteria are met when requesting the use of training time for opportune airlift.
   A5.2.1. The mission directly supports unit training objectives.
   A5.2.2. The opportune airlift does not degrade unit training in any way.
   A5.2.3. The travel results in negligible additional cost to the government.

A5.3. Requests for delivery of parts or equipment should be run through TACC/LOC by maintenance or
transportation personnel for coordination.

A5.4. Opportune Airlift that does not expend any flying time other than that flying time in direct support
of training requirements can be approved by the 92 ARW/CC. Any use of flying training hours to accom-
plish other than direct training requirements must be routed through 92 ARW/CC to 15 AF, via e-mail
(preferred) or fax, for approval. e-mail address: 15dovk2.hq15af1@hq15.af.mil or Fax 837-0353.
Requests must reach 15 AF NLT 20 working days prior to the planned mission.

A5.5. Opportune airlift will be identified on the weekly flying schedule.

A5.6. We must use our training hours in a manner that demonstrates good stewardship of the taxpayers’
money. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of AMC resources as well as the
perception of their misuse.
40                                                                FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998


                                            Attachment 6

                                   WILD CARD CREW POLICY

A6.1. The Wild Card crew is an initiative to minimize schedule changes generated by short-notice task-
ings from HQ AMC/TACC. 92 OG/CC approval is required for Wild Card crew usage.

A6.2. Wild Card crews are identified on the weekly schedule. Squadrons will rotate duty and changeover
takes place on Saturday at 0001L hours.

A6.3. Crews are not required to be on beepers, however, 4 hours is maximum pre-crew rest response
time. This means squadrons may be given as little as 16 hours notice to mission show time.

A6.4. Due to the variety of taskings, crew members should be mission-ready. Third Pilots and NSOs can
be used if they are qualified for overwater missions and an ARP aircraft is available.

A6.5. Crews can be scheduled for pattern only sorties, additional cell positions that can be canceled or
ground training (not to include simulators) but when directed, they will enter crew rest as required.

A6.6. The benefit of this policy will be an increased stability for squadrons to accomplish flight and
ground training during non-tasked weeks. It should decrease cancellations of committed refueling sorties
based on aircrew availability.

                                             Attachment 7

                       OFF-STATION TRAINING MISSION (OST) POLICY

A7.1. The purpose for off-station training missions is to allow 92 ARW aircrews the ability to get train-
ing which is not available through other means. Only training missions that ensure proper stewardship of
flying training hours will be approved. The type of training requirements that will qualify for OST are
outlined in 11-2KC-135 Vol 1--Continuation Flight Training Semiannual Requirements (KC-135E/R/T),
examples are the requirement for overseas mission, cargo loading, or special qualifications. OST missions
will be considered only after exhausting normal scheduling channels.
   A7.1.1. It is imperative that all personnel prevent the misuse of Air Mobility resources, including any
   perception of their misuse.

A7.2. The following individuals can request an OST: 92 ARW/CC or CV, 92 OG/CC or CD, ARS/CC or
DO, OSS/CC or DO. The air refueling and operational support squadrons will follow the sample letter
format in this attachment to request an OST. The requester must indicate the aircrew training items sched-
uled for the mission and provide a brief justification for the OST.
   A7.2.1. 92 OSS/OSOK will contact 92 LSS Plans and Scheduling to determine aircraft availability
   and 92 AGS for crew chief availability.
   A7.2.2. All OST destinations must meet criteria listed in MCI 11-235 Vol 5, Runway, Taxiway, and
   Airfield Requirements and must be military fields or joint-use fields that have military support (such
   as, an ANG base, or Coast Guard, etc.). Scheduled air refuelings are required for all missions depart-
   ing Fairchild and the mission returning to Fairchild. Missions that are primarily for overseas and cargo
   training, do not require scheduled air refuelings, but such training is highly recommended. Squadrons
   will work closely with 92 OSS/OSOK to help arrange for opportune airlift at off-station locations (this
   will help maximize cargo training). Once the OST is approved, OSOK will forward a copy of the
   planned itinerary to 15 AF/DO, AMC/DOT, and TACC/XOOM.
   A7.2.3. Any off-station transition will be IAW MCI 11-235, Vol 10, FAFB Sup 1.
   A7.2.4. Aircrew compliment will normally consist of the basic four plus the option of adding extra
   crew members for specific training requirements (overseas sorties, cargo training, boom operator
   qualifications, etc.).
   A7.2.5. Aircraft security must be maintained. Aircraft not parked on a DoD-sponsored parking ramp
   must be secured. OSTs which remain overnight at a non-DoD facility must be highlighted for specific
   92 OG/CC/CD approval. Include a description of security arrangements with the OST request.
   A7.2.6. The aircrew must make all arrangements for the storage of classified material and weapons as
   appropriate.
   A7.2.7. The aircrew should open the maximum number of available seats to passengers. If transition
   activity is planned and passengers wish to travel, a full stop taxiback landing must be accomplished to
   deplane passengers.
   A7.2.8. The 92 ARW Command Post conducts local command and control for all OSTs. Control
   passes to TACC after departure from Fairchild.
42                                                                 FAFBI11-104 4 NOVEMBER 1998


     A7.2.9. Aircrews are vulnerable for recall at any time, and must maintain a close liaison with the
     TACC.
     A7.2.10. All OSTs should be submitted in writing and approved by the 92 ARW/CC in sufficient
     time for publication into the weekly flying schedule.

A7.3. Aircrew training is the primary goal of OST activity, but associated costs and the protection of Air
Force resources are the priority.
