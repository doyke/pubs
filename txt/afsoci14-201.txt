This instruction implements Air Force Publication Directive (AFPD) 14–1, Intelligence
Applications and Requirements Planning and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14–201, Intelligence
Production and Applications. This Air Force Special Operations Command Instruction
(AFSOCI) acts as an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) supplement to AFI 14–
201 and adds collection management responsibilities which are not currently included in the Air
Force Instruction. This supplement describes AFSOC policy and guidance for submitting,
validating, and tracking intelligence Production Requirements (PR) and the process of converting
intelligence requirements into collection requirements. Ensure that all records created as a result
of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) on
the AF Portal: https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include incorporating the role of the HQ AFSOC/A2O Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance Operations Division and the 623rd Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) in
the production and collection process for AFSOC. Additionally, Section C, PR Process, was
broken out as a separate section for clarity.

Section A—General

1. Applicability. This supplement applies to all Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) units and members including all AFSOC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) units, and
all AFSOC-gained Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units.
2. Background. In accordance with AFI 14–201, AFSOC has several means of obtaining
intelligence from the Defense Information Assurance Program (DIAP):
     2.1. As a USAF MAJCOM, AFSOC may submit Requests for Information (RFI) or
     Production Requirements (PR) in support of Title X responsibilities (organize, train, and
     equip) to Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA)/ISR for
     validation. As the United States Air Force (USAF) Supporting Intelligence Center (SIC)
     (formerly known as the Validation Office (VO)), AFISRA/National Air and Space
     Intelligence Center (NASIC)/XPR works with the requesting Major Command (MAJCOM)
     to clarify the RFI/PR. Once the RFI/PR is validated, NASIC assigns the task to the
     appropriate Intelligence Analysis Center (IAC) for production.
     2.2. As the Air Force component of United States Special Operations Command
     (USSOCOM), HQ AFSOC submits operational, exercise, and other intelligence requirements
     directly supporting the unified command to USSOCOM, Intelligence Information
     Management Branch (J23 SCSO IIM), and RFIs directly supporting the theater command to
     the appropriate theater special operations command (TSOC). The SIC’s are responsible for
     validating RFIs and tasking IACs to satisfy RFIs.
     2.3. For non-CONUS based/assigned AFSOC units, RFIs supporting theater commands are
     submitted by the unit’s supporting intelligence element to the appropriate TSOC SIC. HQ
     AFSOC/A2O will be courtesy copied on all RFIs/PRs submitted by its subordinate units.

Section B—Intelligence Production and Dissemination Process

3. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs). All military consumers of intelligence, from the
smaller tactical unit to the largest military service, are responsible for requesting the specific
operational intelligence that will meet its own intelligence requirements. PIRs are those
intelligence requirements for which a commander has an anticipated and stated priority in the
task of planning and decision making. There is no Department of Defense (DOD)–established
format for PIRs, as each command, service, or defense agency utilizes its own distinct format,
albeit, with common data fields (i.e., who, what, where, etc.). AFSOC PIRs will be developed
using USSOCOM PIRs (also referred to as the commander’s top priorities) and the National
Intelligence Priority Framework.
AFSOCI14–201 18 JULY 2011                                                                        3


4. Request for Information (RFI). AFSOC units should use the Defense Intelligence Agency
(DIA)–developed Community On–Line Intelligence System for End Users and Managers
(COLISEUM) as the primary tool to research, develop, review, validate, submit, and assign
information requirements to production centers. Information requirements, sent as RFIs, should
be submitted through COLISEUM following the originators chain of command for review and
approval. Attachment 2 depicts an example RFI/PR form.

Section C—Production Requirements (PR) Process

5. Production Process. If it is determined that new, finished intelligence derived from original
research is required to satisfy all or a portion of the RFI, that need is expressed formally within
the Department of Defense Intelligence Production Program (DODIPP) as a PR. Application
centers produce or provide intelligence products, applications, and services based on
validated/approved unit-level requirements. An application center is an organization that is not
an officially recognized DODIPP producer of intelligence, but has the requisite expertise to
provide the required intelligence/information to the requester/end user. AFSOC intelligence
application centers include the Special Operations Support Squadron (SOSS) Intelligence Flight;
the AOC ISRD and Analysis, Correlation, and Fusion (ACF); and the HQ AFSOC/A2O
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Operations Cell/Branch.
6. PR Timeline. In accordance with AFI 14–201, Attachment 7, upon receipt of a validated RFI
from a subordinate unit, the application center is required to send an initial response (IR) within
five (5) working days upon receipt of the requirement back to the originator. To ensure
expedient delivery of intelligence products, the originator determines the primary means of
dissemination. This IR should be sent through COLISEUM and will include the designated
point of contact for the RFI. The application center then generates a follow-up response (FR)
within 20 working days of the RFI. Additionally, the application center generates a proposed
product response (PPR) within 45 working days after receiving the RFI which represents a
coordinated contract between the customer and the application center. The PPR contains
sufficient detail to permit customer acceptance, rejection, or modification to include estimated
production cost in the event additional funding is required. This negotiation process and any
portion of the requirement not satisfied are documented in the ―Remarks‖ section of COLISEUM
PR record.
7. PR Process Flow. The diagram below highlights the AFSOC Continental United States
(CONUS) unit PR process flow beginning with a unit-level request, through various application
centers, culminating with a response back to the unit. Of note, the diagram depict close
coordination between application centers, allows each level to provide the response, and, when
needed, permits application centers to forward the request for supplementary detail to be applied.

Section D—CM Requirements Submission Procedure

8. Background. Joint Pub 2–01 states that CM occurs at all levels of intelligence and converts
validated intelligence requirements into collection requirements. Section B (above), or section
B of Joint Pub 2–01 discusses the process for AFSOC assigned/gained units to submit
intelligence requirements. This section will describe the AFSOC CM requirements submission
procedure to include describing each unique intelligence discipline.
9. JCMRB. USSOCOM/SCSO J234 currently conducts the JCMRB to assess, synchronize,
deconflict, and prioritize collection effects at the operational and strategic level. It identifies
gaps/shortfalls, seams and friction points that remain unresolved following action officer
working groups and strives to achieve synergy across the Geographic Combatant Commander
(GCC) boundaries.
10. Human Intelligence (HUMINT). DOD HUMINT collection requirements formats
(generally referred to as an Intelligence Collection Requirement (ICR)) are divided into four
categories: HUMINT Collection Requirements (HCRs), ad-hoc HUMINT Requirements
(AHRs), Time-Sensitive Collection Requirements (TSCRs), and Source Directed Requirements
(SDRs). Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) HUMINT Manual (DIAM), Volume I (DIAM
3301.001) describes the format and tasking process for each category which are submitted via
the HUMINT Online Tasking and Reporting System (HOT–R).
11. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). SIGINT requirements will be submitted via the National
SIGINT Reporting System (NSRP).
12. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). The intelligence community is rapidly increasing
capacity for OSINT collection and analysis to capture openly available data and fuse with
―traditional‖ sources of intelligence data. OSINT requirements will be submitted via the Open
Source Collection Acquisition Requirement–Management System (OSCAR–MS).
AFSOCI14–201 18 JULY 2011                                                                       5


13. Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). GEOINT requirements are submitted via the
Geographic Information Management Systems (GIMS).
14. Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). MASINT requirements are
submitted via the National MASINT Requirements System (NMRS) and Transitional ONIR
Requirements System (TORS), whereas, Advanced Geo-Spatial Intelligence (AGI) requirement
(Multi-Spectral Imagery, Polarimetric Imagery, Coherent Change Detection, and Two-color
Multi View) are submitted via GIMS. AGI requirements for exploitation and dissemination are
submitted via AGI/MASINT Reporting and Dissemination Service (AMRDS).
