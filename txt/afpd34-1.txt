SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This policy directive has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
policy directive has been changed from focusing solely on the wartime or contingency operations
 2                                                               AFPD34-1 2 NOVEMBER 2012


of the Air Force Services community to policy to support all Services programs regarding
contingency and wartime operations, Consumer Affairs, MWR, Lodging, Child and Youth,
Family Member, Fitness and Food programs. Since the management of the force support
readiness capability is centralized, this policy directive provides the foundational guidance for
Services programs to support the garrison and deployable mission support to the Warfighter.
Services programs are part of the Force Support Squadron.
1. Overview. Services programs are designed to deliver capabilities both garrison and deployed
to support global Combatant Commanders. Programs are structured under the Agile Combat
Support structure which ensures core functions are organized, trained, equipped and resourced to
meet the mission needs for wartime, expeditionary, home station quality of life and mission
sustaining requirements.
     1.1. Services will establish and operate customer-driven MWR programs as determined by
     periodic market research for the benefit of authorized patrons.
     1.2. Services will ensure the needs and interests of consumers shall be considered and
     addressed in the formulation of policies.
     1.3. Services will have policies established to provide quality lodging facilities and services
     primarily for Air Force personnel and other authorized patrons to ensure mission readiness.
     1.4. Services will establish Child Development and Youth programs to support mission
     readiness, family readiness, retention and morale of the total force during peacetime,
     overseas, contingency operations, periods of force structure change, relocation of military
     units, base realignments and closure, crisis, and other emergency situations.
     1.5. Services will manage a high quality, cost efficient, demand driven food service program
     that emphasizes health, safety and most importantly readiness. Responsiveness to mission
     requirements and customer demands, within reasonable needs, will determine the extent of
     the program.
     1.6. Services will develop and manage programs to ensure Airman and Family Readiness.
     This program responds to the needs of Airmen and their families to ensure overall force
     preparedness. This capability also ensures critical support during Noncombatant Evacuation
     Operations as well as contingency and installation incident response. Airman and family
     readiness provides support for deployed members at forward locations.
     1.7. Services will establish Fitness programs to ensure overall force readiness and
     preparedness. Programs are driven by both market research and unit level fitness programs
     to prepare units for global contingency and wartime missions.
2. Air Force Policy.
     2.1. MWR Programs. The Air Force will provide MWR programs that are critical to the
     quality of life for Airmen and their families. It is DoD policy that the DoD Components
     establish MWR programs to maintain individual, family, and mission readiness during
     peacetime and in time of declared war or other contingencies.
        2.1.1. Services will provide MWR programs to all authorized customers without regard
        to their sex, age, national origin, disability or genetic information and not for the purpose
        of competing with commercial providers of similar services.
AFPD34-1 2 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                      3


     2.1.2. Services will provide the DoD installation community with access to programs
     similar to those available in a comparable civilian community.

     2.1.4. Services will ensure MWR programs receive funding at the same level as other
     community support programs. MWR programs shall be resourced from either
     appropriated funds, nonappropriated funds, or a combination of both consistent with DoD
     funding standards.
     2.1.5. Services shall consider the needs and interests of consumers and encourage active
     participation.

     2.3.3. Services will establish programs to provide coordinated and timely meal and
     lodging services to transient aircrews. Such services will provide adequate conditions for
     crew rest and will maintain aircrew integrity by lodging individual aircrews collectively,
     either in on-base or-off base quarters.
     2.3.4. Services, when possible, will provide separate sleeping and bathroom
     accommodations for unaccompanied males and females. However, when separate
     accommodations are not available (during contingencies, exercises, and deployments),
     mission exigencies may necessitate temporary partitions, joint use of bathrooms, or other
     privacy safeguards between males and females.
     2.3.5. Services will ensure maximum use of on-base quarters is required before using
     commercial contract quarters for official TDY military members on per diem.

     non-availability.
     2.3.6. Services will ensure temporary lodging facilities are operated primarily to provide
     temporary housing to Military members and DoD Civilians on official business (TDY or
     PCS).

  assist DoD military and civilian personnel in balancing the competing demands for the
  accomplishment of the DoD mission and family life by managing and delivering a system of
