 This is an Air Force publication immediately implementing CV-22 Operations
 Procedures. This checklist is applicable to all subordinate AFSOC flying
 units that operate the CV-22 aircraft. Aircrew will use the abbreviated
 checklists during mission planning and execution. Individuals will carry the
 applicable guides in the USAF flight crew checklist. Additional notes and
 supplemental information may be added. This checklist compliments
 AFI 11-2CV-22, Vol 3, Additional Aircraft Operations Procedures, and is
 printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper then trimmed to a unique size 4 ½
 “ x 6 ½” that will fit the standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. Ensure
 that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
 are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
 Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
 Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
 Schedule (RDS) located at
