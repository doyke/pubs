1. Responsibilities:
    1.1. The Commander, 30th Operations Group (30 OG/CC) is the final reviewing authority for Mili-
    tary Radar Unit (MRU) initial certification and annual evaluations of Area Control Center (ACC) and
    Aerospace Surveillance Officer (ASO) personnel for all operational positions.
    1.2. The Commander, 2d Range Operations Squadron (2 ROPS/CC) is the endorser for MRU initial
    certifications and annual evaluations of ACC and ASO personnel for all operational positions within
    the ACC.
    1.3. The Aerospace Surveillance Officer (ASO):
       1.3.1. 2 ROPS/DON civilians are responsible for being ASO qualified.
       1.3.2. 2 ROPS military personnel assigned to the Airspace and Offshore Management Flight (2
       ROPS/DON) are qualified after completing contractor provided training for the Surface Area Sur-
       veillance (SAS).
       1.3.3. Performs initial and annual evaluations based upon periodic observation of the controllers.
       1.3.4. May suspend or cancel controller certification if the controller is not performing at a satis-
       factory level.
    1.4. The Aeronautical Operations Control Officer/Aerospace Control Officer (AOCO/ACO) moni-
    tors and directs ACC activities during aerospace operations and launches.
    1.5. The ACC Supervisor:
       1.5.1. Establishes and maintains the training program required for certification in this instruction.

30SWI13-208 16 DECEMBER 2006                                                                              3


       1.5.3. Shall meet the certification criteria and currency requirements for all ACC positions per
       this instruction.

2. Area Control Center Positions:
   2.1. The Duty Air Controller (DAC) conducts daily coordination and control of Vandenberg restricted
   airspace and offshore warning areas and coordinates ACC activities during test operations. Augment-
   ees shall not be assigned to this position. The DAC shall be a certified Air Controller. The DAC is
   responsible for providing information to the AOCO/ACO during operations. The DAC is operation-
   ally responsible to the AOCO/ACO during aeronautical operations and missile operations.
   2.2. The Air Controller is specifically trained and certified to control aircraft by using radar and com-
   munications equipment while conforming to United States Air Force (USAF), Department of Defense
   (DoD), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, directives, and procedures. The fol-
   lowing ACC positions require certification as an Air Controller and all are responsible to the DAC:
       2.2.1. The Aircraft Controller (AC) is assigned to a manual or automated radar display, providing
       command and control directions or flight following information to aircraft.
       2.2.2. The Surveillance Controller (SC) is assigned to observe airspace using radar display sys-
       tems, or other means, to detect and track aircraft which may enter assigned airspace during an
       operation.
   2.3. The Surface Area Surveillance Controller (SASC) detects and plots surface contacts.

3. General Policies:
   3.1. DoD Directive 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base—Summary of Capability, defines
   30 SW/CC responsibilities for range clearance and surveillance. FAA Order 7610.4, Special Military
   Operations, authorizes a Military Radar Unit (MRU) to provide command and control instructions to
   participating aircraft within airspace released by the appropriate air traffic control (ATC) facility. To
   fulfill these obligations, 30 SW requires personnel who coordinate and control aircraft and ship oper-
   ations from the ACC to be properly trained and certified. Therefore, 30 SW maintains established
   standards of training and certification of ACC personnel. The 30 SW ASO will ensure compliance
   with these standards.
   3.2. The mission of the ACC is to furnish technical support and command/control actions necessary
   to ensure all uprange airspace and ocean operating area activities are coordinated. As a certified Mili-
   tary Radar Unit, this is done according to regulations, inter-agency agreements, directives, and
   instructions. The purpose of training and certification is to ensure ACC personnel are knowledgeable
   of current practices and policies and maintain a satisfactory level of proficiency.
   3.3. ACC operations performance and routine day-to-day controlling/monitoring will be provided by
   the AOCO/ACO. Evaluation of compliance with government regulations, directives, operating
   instructions, and inter-agency agreements will be monitored by the ASO.

4. Training Requirements:
   4.1. The three certified positions within the ACC are, Duty Air Controller, Air Controller, and Surface
   Area Surveillance Controller. An individual assigned to train as DAC, Air Controller, or Air Control-
4                                                                   30SWI13-208 16 DECEMBER 2006


    ler Augmentee, shall be a graduate of an appropriate civil or military air traffic control school or mil-
    itary air intercept/weapons controller school.
    4.2. Air Controller training includes:
       4.2.1. Local air traffic control (ATC) and inter-range airspace procedures.
       4.2.2. 30 SW airspace and surface procedures.
       4.2.3. Applicable USAF, 30 SW, 30 OG, 2 ROPS, and FAA regulations, instructions, and agree-
       ments required to successfully complete the assigned operational mission.
    4.3. Surface Area Surveillance Controller training requirements pertain to maritime operations.
    4.4. Duty Air Controllers must meet all training requirements for the other two ACC operational posi-
    tions.
    4.5. Personnel in training for any of the ACC operational positions must be under the direct supervi-
    sion of an individual certified for that position.

5. Certification Procedures:
    5.1. Initial certification is accomplished by:
       5.1.1. Meeting the training requirements for the ACC position as outlined in paragraph 4.
       5.1.2. Successful completion of the appropriate training within 90 days (60 day extensions may be
       requested by a memorandum to the ASO from the ACC supervisor).
       5.1.3. Successful completion of an evaluation administered by the ASO.
    5.2. The ACC supervisor will notify the ASO five duty days prior to the evaluation. The evaluation
    shall be documented on 30 SW Form 5636, Area Control Center Personnel Training and Certifi-
    cation. The ASO will assess each individual’s performance as documented in the 30 SW Form 5636
    and by personal observation. The completed form shall be forwarded to 2 ROPS/CC and 30 OG/CC
    for coordination and review.
    5.3. Annual evaluations shall be completed by the last day of the month following the anniversary
    date of the previous evaluation for the three identified ACC operational positions. The ACC supervi-
    sor will notify the ASO five duty days prior to the proposed date of the evaluation. The evaluation
    shall be documented on a 30 SW Form 5636. The ASO will assess each individual’s performance as
    documented in the 30 SW Form 5636 and by personal observation. The completed form shall be for-
    warded to 2 ROPS/CC and 30 OG/CC for review and coordination.
       5.3.1. If at any time a controller is unable to maintain a satisfactory performance level, the appli-
       cable certification will be revoked, and the controller shall accomplish training as deemed appro-
       priate by the ACC supervisor and the ASO. When retraining has been successfully completed, the
       controller will be evaluated by the ASO.
    5.4. A 30 SW Form 5636 shall be submitted semi-annually (June and December), by the ACC super-
    visor to the ASO, to ensure each individual meets minimum currency requirements as set forth in
    paragraph 6.
    5.5. All 30 SW Forms 5636s showing the number of operations performed at each position, for each
    controller, may be requested by the ASO prior to the evaluation.
30SWI13-208 16 DECEMBER 2006                                                                                 5

   actual or simulated launch operations.
   6.4. In the event minimum currency is not maintained for any of the positions listed, the individual
   shall be considered unqualified to perform the duties for that position without direct supervision. The
   individual shall be considered re-qualified upon successful completion of an evaluation which has
   been reviewed and approved by the ASO. The ACC supervisor will notify the ASO five duty days
   prior to the proposed date of the evaluation. The evaluation shall be documented on 30 SW Form
   5636. The ASO will assess each individual’s performance as documented in the 30 SW Form 5636
   and by personal observation.
