                                     COMPOSING MESSAGES

1.1. General Information. All messages will be composed using Microsoft Word. Drafter will prepare
AL 8106 ALPERSCOM, and MPFM messages in final format and send as an attachment to DPDXIA’s
DMS organizational box for transmission. Message traffic should be treated as a public release of infor-
mation. When deciding what to send via AL 8106, MPFM, or ALPERSCOM, consider that all of these
messages are available to members of the media through the Freedom of Information Act (excluding any
Privacy Act or For Official Use Only information) and are often made available to them the same day as
messages addressees receive them. If questions arise when developing message content, contact Public
Affairs for guidance.
    1.1.1. Upon completion of all coordination:
       1.1.1.1. Attach the draft message.
       1.1.1.2. Attach message coordination.
       1.1.1.3. Insert/attach name of the point of contact.
       1.1.1.4. Email the formatted message to DPDXIA Messaging organizational box for transmission.

1.2. Correct Format. If the correct format, as outlined in this document, is not adhered to, messages will
not be transmitted. Messages that do not follow the required format will be returned to the OPR for revi-
sion.

1.3. Mandatory Coordination. Coordination must be completed (all mandatory offices) prior to release
of the message. Messages that do not have the required coordination completed will be returned to the
OPR for completion.

                  MILITARY PERSONNEL FLIGHT MEMORANDUM (MPFM)

2.1. Purpose. Refer to Attachment 2. Use MPFMs to announce unclassified personnel subject matters to
include new personnel policies and procedures. Send MPFMs to all active duty MPFs, Reserve bases not
collocated on an active duty base, and Guard units. The active duty MPF ensures all organizations on
base, including tenant units, receive notification and copies of all MPFMs. All Headquarters (HQ) Num-
bered Air Force (NAF), MAJCOM, and Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PERSCO) sites
will receive their own copies. The OPR is responsible for the distribution of all other copies.

2.2. Stationary. Use AFPC letterhead for all MPFMs signed out at AFPC.

2.3. Font. Use 12-pitch, Times New Roman.

2.4. Margins. For the first page, use 1.7” top margin and 1” for left, bottom and right margins. For con-
tinuation pages, use 1” top, bottom, left and right margins.

2.5. Date. DPDXIA will insert the appropriate date and sequence number.

2.6. Memorandum for Caption. Reference “MEMORANDUM FOR ALL MPFs” in memorandum for
caption. In the first sentence of the first paragraph, specify the MPFM action offices by office symbol or
title.

2.7. Body. The OPR will add a statement above the first line of text of the MPFM if the MPFM contains
For Official Use Only (FOUO) information. Refer to DPDXID for guidance on proper FOUO statements
to use within the body of each MPFM. Refer to Public Affairs for policy guidance on the use of posting
MPFMs on the Internet. If the MPFM contains FOUO information, DPSOOC will not place the MPFM
on the Internet. If the MPFM does not contain FOUO information, DPSOOC will place the MPFM on the
Internet no later than (NLT) three duty days after the initial release. The last paragraph will include grade,
name, organization/ office symbol, and Defense Switch Network (DSN) of the action officer.

2.8. Signature Element. The command section or director will sign the MPFM. The director has delega-
tion authority to appoint a representative to sign MPFMs. Always use an authority line (FOR THE COM-
MANDER) on an MPFM unless it is signed by CC or CD.

2.9. Courtesy Copy. If sending copies to other organizations, include them in the courtesy copy (cc) ele-
ment. If the content of the memorandum impacts enlisted members, address a courtesy copy to the Com-
mand Chief Master Sergeant (CCC).

2.10. Attachments. Use Microsoft Word to create all attachments. Once all attachments are created, cut
and paste to main document and save as “one” document. Do not use Power Point, Excel, or VISIO to cre-
ate attachments.

    Air National Guard Advisors (CCR/CCG), (5) Air Force Contact Center (DPSC) and (6) Enterprise
    Information Management (DPDXI). CCR/CCG will indicate on the coordination sheet whether or not
    the MPFM is applicable to Guard and Reserve units. If the director or the chief of special staff desires
    the command section be informed, the OPR will provide a copy to CCEA for the command section
    read file.
    2.11.2. DPSOOC will indicate on the coordination sheet whether or not the MPFM requires a 48-hour
    pre-notification message prior to release to the field.
       2.11.2.1. When appropriate, DPSOOC will pre-notify Mission Support Squadron Commanders
       (MSS/CC) via email upon completion of the coordination process. This email will constitute as a
       48-hour pre-notification to allow MSS/CCs time to prepare units for the impact of the message.
       2.11.2.2. The 48-hour pre-notification will only apply to changes to or introduction of policy, pro-
       gram, and procedures. Examples include changes to the assignment system, introduction to Volun-

       board releases do not constitute a pre-notification email.
    2.11.3. The OPR will email the completed coordination sheet and the MPFM memorandum to
    DPDXIA Messaging for processing. If a 48-hour pre-notification email is required, the OPR must
    hold the completed coordination sheet and the MPFM memorandum for 48-hours to allow DPSOOC
    to contact MSS/CCs.
    2.11.4. DPDXIA will review, assign a control number, and transmit the MPFM to addressees via PC
    III within 4 hours of receipt from the OPR.
    2.11.5. Once the message is transmitted, DPDXIA will forward a copy to the originator (OPR),
    DPSOO, DPSOOC, and DPFF Web Admin.
    2.11.6. MPFMs are processed throughout the duty day (0730-1615). To transmit an MPFM after duty
    hours, contact DPDXI during duty hours for proper instructions.

2.12. Disposition. After the MPFM has been transmitted, DPDXIA will return the original, coordinated
copy, and remaining copies (if any) to the OPR for maintenance according to AFI 37-123, Management of
Records, and for disposition according to AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located within the
AFRIMS website at https://afrims.amc.af.mil.
