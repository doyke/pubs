                                       INTRODUCTION
1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make available a training aid, which will
assist Diet Therapy Technicians in developing technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks.
The tasks are broken down into teachable steps, which help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming
proficient with the tasks. The QTP will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task
certification.

2. As a trainer, direct the trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of
each module. Go through the steps in the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to
learn each step; some steps may take more time than others may. Remember that the purpose of this QTP
is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly. When the trainee receives enough training and
is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions. Conduct a feedback with the
trainee on this QTP. After you have ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the
task, a certifier should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that
will meet Air Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP). We value your expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have
suggestions for its improvement, or if you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP,
please let us know about them.

SUBJECT AREA:                               Develop operating instructions.
TASK(s):                                    Develop operating instructions.
CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):                     23.3
TRAINING REFERENCE(s):                      JCAHO Manual, Air Force Occupational Safety and
                                            Health (AFOSH) standards, Manual of Clinical
                                            Dietetics, Air Force Instructions.
EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:                         Computer with word processing capabilities.
OBJECTIVE:                                  The trainee will develop a Nutritional Medicine
                                            (NM)* operating instruction.
EVALUATION:                                 After the trainee has received instructions, evaluate
                                            the individuals’ skills in developing an operating
                                            instruction.
REMARKS/NOTES:                              Review applicable paragraphs in the AFIs.


EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks or as an end
   product evaluation. (Whichever applies.)

2. Use the checklist as a teaching tool and ensure each item is covered with the trainee.
   After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient time for completion of each
   part of the task. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without
   assistance. (i.e. Write/revise an operating instruction utilizing the information in the
   checklist.) Ensure the trainee has access to necessary resources when assigning OI
   development/revision, for example: workspace, a computer, and necessary references.

3. Use the checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are
   accomplished. If the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document
   appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the
   objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is met.

4. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial
   evaluation should be documented in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the
   trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented using AF Form
   1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved
   substitute record.




*Nutritional Medicine (NM) could be an Element, Flight or Squadron

INFORMATION FOR TRAINEE

It is important to remember that local operating instructions do not replace Air Force Instructions
(AFI) or manuals. Local operating instructions provide guidance for local procedures. Most
AFIs are very general in nature; local operating instructions provide procedures for a specific
facility. For this reason it is not a good practice to obtain operating instructions from another
facility and copy them for your facility. However, they can be used as a guide or model for
writing an operating instruction for your facility.

Operating instructions should be written in a clear concise manner using standard Air Force
terminology. They should not contain unfamiliar language or jargon.

Operating instructions must be reviewed at least annually. In addition, operating instructions
should be reviewed whenever the job or function changes.

All outdated or obsolete OIs should be destroyed as soon as no longer needed.
