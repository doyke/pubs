SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The revision of this publication is to eliminate the use of paper forms where possible and
implement the use of the electronic Management Tracking System (eMTS) as mandated by the
Air Force. The Firefighters in 341 CES/CEF are exempt from using eMTS until the system can
support their uncommon tour of duty schedules. Rivet Mile will continue to use the TAA system
supported by Hill AFB. 341MW Form 110, Time and Attendance Report, and 341MW Form
116, Work Schedule Change, have also been revised.
1. Employee Personal and Personnel Data Input:
     1.1. All new/transferring employees will in-process with the Civilian Pay Customer Service
     Representative (CSR) and their unit Time Keeper. The CSR enters/changes personal data
     into the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS) for all employees.
     1.2. The CSR is also the electronic Management Tracking System (eMTS) Data
     Administrator and enters personnel data into eMTS for all employees supported by the
     program. Firefighters and Rivet Mile employees are the only exceptions to eMTS use at this
     time.
2. eMTS Training:
     2.1. Employees, Supervisors/eMTS Certifiers, and Time Keepers must familiarize
     themselves with eMTS by viewing the web based training videos which pertain to them at
     the following link: https://eis.afspc.af.mil/unit/hq/FM/eMTS/default.aspx
     2.2. eMTS Users utilize the help button available on each eMTS screen prior to contacting
     their Time Keeper or the CSR for assistance with data input.
3. Reporting Civilian Time and Attendance:
     3.1. Employees should enter their time and attendance each day. Firefighters and Rivet Mile
     employees shall use 341 MW Form 110, Time and Attendance Report (Attachment 2). All
     other employees shall use eMTS labor entry. eMTS Users access the database at:
     https://emtsapp2.peterson.af.mil. The Malmstrom AFB eMTS database is not accessed via
     the Air Force Portal or any other search engine.
     3.2. Supervisors/Certifiers are responsible for ensuring time and attendance is entered,
     signed, and certified prior to close of business on the second Thursday of each pay period.
     3.3. Time Keepers for the Firefighters are responsible for entering time and attendance into
     DCPS and the Time Keepers for Rivet Mile are responsible for entering time and attendance
     into TAA. Data shall be entered on the second Friday of each pay period.
     3.4. Adjustments to time and attendance will be accomplished as soon as possible and
     should be no later than the following pay period cutoff.
4. Changing Civilian Employee Work Schedules:
     4.1. Supervisors will notify the unit Time Keeper when a change to an employee’s work
     schedule is required.
     4.2. Supervisors of Firefighters and Rivet Mile employees must complete 341 MW Form
     116, Work Schedule Change (Attachment 3), sign the form, and forward to the unit Time
341MWI65-103 13 MARCH 2012                                                                   3


   Keeper. The Time Keeper for Firefighters enters the information into DCPS, the time keeper
   for Rivet Mile enters the information into TAA.
   4.3. All other employees:
      4.3.1. The Time Keeper must notify the eMTS Labor Administrator (usually the CSR) if
      a change to the Alternate Work Schedule (AWS) code is necessary. The CSR will change
      the AWS code in eMTS.
      4.3.2. After the AWS code has been changed in eMTS the Time Keeper or Supervisor
      will change the employee’s work schedule in eMTS.
      4.3.3. The work schedule is also changed in the Defense Civilian Pay System (DCPS)
      Time and Attendance program by the Time Keeper. The work schedule and AWS code
      must match in eMTS and DCPS.
5. AF Form 428, Submission and Approval of Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium
Pay, and Compensatory Time:
   5.1. All commanders must submit an appointment letter designating who is authorized to
   approve overtime, holiday premium pay, and compensatory time to their unit’s Time Keeper
   who will forward the letter to the CSR. Approving authorities shall be the squadron
   commander and/or his/her designated representative.
   5.2. The eMTS Overtime Request shall be used for all overtime, holiday premium pay, and
   compensatory time except for Firefighters and Rivet Mile employees. Firefighters and Rivet
   Mile employees shall continue to use the AF 428 (Attachment 4).
   5.3. Supervisors are responsible for the timely submission of requests for overtime, holiday
   premium pay, and compensatory time. Requests must be approved prior to entry into eMTS.
   5.4. A reasonably detailed rational as to why the overtime, compensatory time, or holiday
   premium pay is/was necessary must be included in the justification block. Do not use vague
   statements such as “direct mission support.” Each occurrence must be listed by date on a
   separate line.
   5.5. The AF 428 shall be maintained for six years by the Unit Time Keeper as supporting
   documentation for the overtime, compensatory time, or holiday pay claimed on the timecard.
6. OPM Form 71, Submission and Approval of Request for Leave:
   6.1. Requests for accrued/restored/advanced annual leave, accrued sick leave, compensatory
   time off, other paid absence, or leave without pay should be submitted to the immediate
   supervisor via the eMTS Leave Request except for Firefighters and Rivet Mile employees
   who may utilize OPM 71 (Attachment 5).
   6.2. Requests for advanced sick leave, donated leave, or leave covered by the Family and
   Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be submitted to the Labor Relations Officer (LRO). OPM
   71 will be used for advanced sick leave and FMLA leave. OPM Form 630, Application to
   Become a Leave Recipient Under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (Attachment
   6), shall be used to request donated leave.
   6.3. Remarks concerning an employee’s nature of illness shall not be disclosed in eMTS or
   to any person not entitled to have knowledge of such information.
 4                                                           341MWI65-103 13 MARCH 2012


     6.4. Supervisors are responsible for the timely approval/disapproval of leave requests.
     Disapprovals require explanation and initiation of action to reschedule leave if applicable.
7. Electronic Time Card System Prescribed. The Electronic Management Tracking System is
mandated for all employees except Firefighters and Rivet Mile employees.
