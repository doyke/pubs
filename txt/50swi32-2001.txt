xxxx or 721-xxxx). If using a cell phone call 567-3911 for Schriever AFB emergency services.

  3.2. Fire Reporting and Evacuation Procedures. The following clarifies 50th Space Wing policy
on the fire reporting and evacuation of buildings in order to assist organizations in developing specific
evacuation procedures for their facilities:

       3.2.1. Fire Reporting Procedures:

               3.2.1.1. Alert everyone: Yell “Fire-Fire-Fire” to alert everyone in the immediate area
50SWI 32-2001 21 October 2008                                                                             5

and then activate the manual fire alarm pull station. This will activate the facility fire alarm system
sounding the horns/bells. If the fire is small, attempt to contain the fire using a portable fire
extinguisher after the fire alarm and building evacuation has started.

                     3.2.1.1.1. Personnel working in MODs and other areas containing critical
equipment, follow pre-established guidance set forth in your unit’s reporting procedures and checklists.

                        3.2.1.2. All personnel shall be familiar with the locations of manual pull
stations and portable fire extinguishers within their work areas.

                        3.2.1.3 Perform emergency fire evacuation procedures. Personnel shall depart
the threatened facility expeditiously via a safe exit. Unless extreme conditions exist, personnel will not
evacuate to or through any area on fire, obscured by smoke, or containing a potentially hazardous
condition.

                      3.2.1.4. Immediately upon leaving the danger area and prior to reaching the
               evacuation point, contact emergency services via 911 phone call (if using cell phone
               567-3911) and provide requested information to the operator:

                                3.2.1.4.1. Who? Provide your name and call back phone number.

                                3.2.1.4.2. What? Type of emergency, Fire-Police-Medical.

                                3.2.1.4.3. Where? Building Number-Room Number.

                                3.2.1.4.4. Actions taken? Evacuation in progress, fire knocked down
                       with extinguisher, etc.

         3.2.2. Delays in Reporting. Do not give, issue, or post any guidance that will delay
reporting a fire or other emergency.

          3.2.3. False Alarms. Do not deliberately activate a fire alarm system or intentionally call in
a false emergency when no emergency exists. Violators may be punished under the UCMJ or other
legal authority.

          3.2.4. Base/Unit Exercises. When reporting an exercise fire or other types of emergency
exercise statement, clearly state to the dispatcher “this is an exercise” before and after providing
exercise information.

                3.2.4.1. Unit level exercises requiring emergency reporting procedures shall be
coordinated prior to the event by the exercise evaluator.

   3.3. Emergency Response. Fire and emergency vehicles responding to an emergency have the
right-of-way over all other vehicles. If you encounter emergency vehicles responding to an
emergency, safely slow down and pull to the right if you are driving a vehicle. If on foot, step back
from the roadway. Do not attempt to pass or follow within 500 feet of any emergency vehicle.

        3.3.1. Off-Base Response. The SFO will determine what equipment and personnel may
6                                                                    50SWI 32-2001      21 October 2008

respond to an off-base emergency. This decision is based on the type, extent, and location of the
emergency in addition to available manpower and equipment.

      3.3.2. Emergency Access. Firefighters and emergency personnel shall be provided
immediate and unobstructed access to the scene of any emergency.

                3.3.2.1. Any emergency personnel entering a classified/restricted area shall remain in
or return to the area once the emergency has been terminated for debriefing by the local security
manager, but shall not be kept from performing their primary duties.

                3.3.2.2. No personnel other than the SFO shall give any order or directive that
interferes with the actions or operations of emergency personnel or physically hinders their actions.

4. Fire Evacuation and Egress Components.

   4.1. General. Evacuating an area that is threatened by fire or other danger is for your safety, not
inconvenience. Your personal protective measures are your ability not to panic, remaining calm,
thinking clearly, and being familiar with more than one way out of a facility. Failing to evacuate may
result in injury or death. Remember to remain calm, evacuate through the nearest exit, and help those
in need if possible without placing yourself in imminent danger. Do not use elevators when
evacuating, use the stairway. Personnel shall evacuate to their designated assembly areas as directed
by the emergency checklist procedures. Always stay clear of emergency vehicles as they are
responding.

   4.2. Building Evacuation. The following clarifies 50th Space Wing policy on the evacuation of
buildings in order to assist organizations in developing specific evacuation procedures for their
facilities:

              4.2.1.1. Close, but do not lock, all doors as you exit the facility.

              4.2.1.2. Personnel shall know two ways out of their facility.

              4.2.1.3. When directed to evacuate, personnel will not use elevators, only stairwells.

              4.2.1.4. Once you have left the facility, do not return until cleared to do so.

               4.2.1.5. The senior person, or designated individual, in each area is responsible for
ensuring all personnel have evacuated. Perform a visual scan rather than an extensive search upon
departing. Ensure accountability after departing the facility to enhance fire department search and
rescue operations.

               4.2.1.6. Personnel will immediately evacuate when hearing the fire alarm or upon
direction from Fire Department, Security Forces, Wing Command Post, other recognized competent
authority, or when a life-threatening situation exists.

              4.2.1.7. All personnel shall assist in evacuating personnel who are injured or physically
50SWI 32-2001 21 October 2008                                                                             7

challenged to safety if possible without placing yourself in imminent danger.

       heaters etc., must be plugged directly into a wall out, extension cords, powerstrips or surge
       suppressors are not permitted to extend the length of the appliance cord to reach a wall outlet.

                6.13.3.7. Do not tape down the circuit breaker switch. This will prevent the proper
