This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive 90-2, Inspector General--The Inspection System
and further clarifies Air Force Instruction 90-201, Inspector General Activities and Air Mobility Com-
mand Instruction 90-201, The Inspection System. It establishes procedures for the routing and disposition
of The Inspector General (TIG), HQ USAF, HQ AMC and 436 AW Special Interest Items (SII). It further
defines responsibilities for inspections, reports and corrective actions taken with respect to SIIs. This
instruction is applicable to all units assigned or attached to Dover Air Force Base, with the exception of
the 512th Airlift Wing, which falls under the Air Force Reserve Command IG program, unless otherwise
specified.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision restructures the Wing SII program to streamline flow of SII compliance standards and to
meet HQ AMC/IG reporting deadlines in paragraph 1.1. This revision also establishes a single Wing POC
for each active SII in paragraph 2.1.2., and permanent Group and Director of Staff (DS)-level POCs for
completing all open SIIs. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.


1. BACKGROUND.
   1.1. HQ USAF, AMC, and 436 AW SIIs provide a means to focus leadership attention, gather data,
   determine the extent and impact of known or suspected problems, identify specific deficiencies, con-
   firm if a problem has been resolved, and/or evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in
   the field. SIIs also enhance decision-making and policy adjustments by providing feedback from the
   field. The key to an effective SII program is a thorough and regular inspection of the subject areas or
   operations followed by appropriate long term corrective actions where required. SIIs are subject to
   inspection at any time, but are usually inspected during another IG-directed inspection, such as Expe-
   ditionary Operational Readiness Inspections or Unit Compliance Inspections.
