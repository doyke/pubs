4. Priority Mission Requirements. The primary mission of Radio Maintenance is to provide
communications-electronics maintenance to Eglin’s Giant Voice (GV), security forces, flying
unit’s duty communications and personal wireless communications systems. These systems
carry a high priority and have a critical impact on various missions. All outages affecting, or
potentially affecting mission effectiveness will have priority over PA support.
