SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision changes the office symbols in compliance with the Hill AFB reorganization.
Amendments were made to the references and attachments of this instruction. The title of this
instruction has also been changed to Administrative Debarment Orders.
1. Authority. Commanders of military installations may summarily debar persons, military,
civilian, contractors, or others whose presence, in their judgment, might hinder the mission or
adversely affect the health, safety, or morale of the persons assigned there. This authority is
derived from, Article 1, Section 3, and Article 2, Section 2, of the United States Constitution;
and DoDD 5200.8, Security of DoD Installations and Resources. Under Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1382, “Whoever, within the jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any
military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for
any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation; or whoever reenters or is found within any
such reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, after having been removed there
from or ordered not to reenter by any officer or person in command or charge thereof, shall be
fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.”
2. Initiation of Barment Action. OO-ALC/JA, 75 SFS, or AFOSI will initiate debarment
action.
     2.1. OO-ALC/JA will review all administrative discharge packages and court-martial
     records of trial to determine whether the discharged or court-martialed member’s presence on
     base would be prejudicial to the good order and discipline of Hill AFB. If review concludes
     debarment is warranted, OO-ALC/JA will prepare a debarment package in accordance with
     paragraph 3 of this publication.
     2.2. The Ogden Air Logistics Center Labor Relations and Employee Management (OO-
     ALC/DPCE) will review and coordinate on all debarment packages of base civilian
     employees that are being removed for cause, or who resign prior to removal action. If
     debarment is warranted, OO-ALC/JA will prepare the package in accordance with paragraph
     3 of this publication.
     2.3. The 75th Security Forces Squadron Reports and Analysis (75 SFS/S5R) will review all
     incident reports of non-base affiliated and nongovernmental subjects who have committed or
     have been involved in on-base incidents considered prejudicial to the good order and
     discipline of Hill AFB. If review concludes debarment is appropriate, 75 SFS/S5R will
     prepare the package in accordance with paragraph 3 of this publication.
        2.3.1. This provision is an exception to any conflicting requirement found in this
        publication. In those cases investigated by on-duty security forces where the flight chief
        determines immediate debarment is required, the following procedures will be followed:
HILLAFBI31-103 19 APRIL 2012                                                                        3


           2.3.1.1. The on-duty flight chief will contact OO-ALC/JA requesting legal guidance
           and then coordinate with 75th Security Forces Squadron Operations (75 SFS/S3O)
           and the Defense Force Commander (DFC).
           2.3.1.2. The 75th Mission Support Group Commander (75 MSG/CC) and 75
           ABW/CC must be notified.
           2.3.1.3. OO-ALC/JA, the on-duty flight chief, and 75 ABW/CC will conduct a
           conference call to determine if immediate debarment is warranted.
           2.3.1.4. If immediate debarment is warranted, 75 ABW/CC will authorize 75 SFS
           personnel to issue a written order of immediate debarment (Attachment 2). 75 SFS
           personnel will fill in the information on the immediate debarment order to include the
           name and social security number of the individual being debarred, and the basis for
           the debarment action. The Certificate of Service should also be completed 75 SFS
           personnel will then issue the immediate debarment order to the subject for their
           signature on the Certificate of Service. Once the individual signs the order, keep the
           original and issue a copy to the individual.
   2.4. Any special request for debarment, that does not fall within the purview of routine
   initiation by one of the agencies identified in paragraphs 2.1., 2.2., or 2.3. of this publication,
   must be forwarded to 75 SFS/S5R for evaluation and action.
3. Preparation of Debarment Package. Each debarment package will, as a minimum, consist
of the following:
   3.1. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, summarizing why debarment is warranted, with a
   recommendation.
   3.2. Evidence supporting request for debarment.
   3.3. Proposed Debarment Order.
4. Legal Review of Debarment Package. OO-ALC/JA will review all debarment packages for
legal sufficiency and make a recommendation as to whether debarment is warranted. If OO-
ALC/JA finds the debarment package to be legally sufficient and debarment is warranted,
coordination will be accomplished and the package forwarded through channels to 75 ABW/CC
for signature. If OO-ALC/JA finds the package insufficient or does not concur with the
originating agency’s recommendation, the package will be returned to originating agency for
further action.
5. Debarment Approval. After completion of the coordination cycle, 75 ABW/CC must
review the package and make the final decision on the recommended action. 75 ABW/CC will
sign all debarment orders. This authority may not be delegated to subordinates. If 75 ABW/CC
does not concur, the package will be returned for action per the 75 ABW/CC’s instructions.
   5.1. After the order has been signed, the package will be forwarded to 75 SFS/S5R for
   issuance and updating of the existing debarment list.
6. Distribution and Filing of Debarment Order. Whenever possible, the debarment order will
be personally delivered to the subject of the order by the agency that prepared the order. If the
subject is not available for personal delivery, the order must be mailed by certified mail.

     6.1. Personal Delivery. The subject will acknowledge receipt of the order by signing and
     dating the Certificate of Service, page 2 of the debarment order. All copies of the order must
     contain a signed certificate. If the subject refuses to sign the debarment order certificate, the
     issuing official must complete a Certificate of Service in accordance with AFMAN 31-201,
     Security Forces Administration and Reports, Volume 7, Attachment 36.
        6.1.1. In the event that a military member is to be debarred upon separation, the 75th
        Force Support Squadron Career Development Section (75 FSS/FSMPD) will issue the
        separating member a copy of the debarment order and have them sign the Certificate of
        Service. 75 FSS/FSMPD will then forward the debarment package with completed
        Certificate of Service to 75 SFS/S5R and provide a courtesy copy to OO-ALC/JA.
     6.2. Mailing Barment Order. If personal delivery of the debarment order is not possible, the
     order will be sent to the subject by certified mail with the envelope marked “Deliver to
     Addressee Only”. In every case of mailing, a Certificate of Service must be completed.
     When the PS Form 3811, Domestic Return Receipt, is returned to the sender and reflects
     delivery made, the PS Form 3811 will be attached (stapled) to the file copy of the debarment
     order. If PS Form 3811 is returned with the remarks “unclaimed,” a recheck for proper
     address, etc., it must be accomplished and a second mailing completed. If the second notice
     is returned “unclaimed,” both PS Forms 3811 must be attached to the original copy of the
     order and placed in the debarment package. No further attempts will be made to locate the
     subject unless new verified data becomes available. Regardless, the subject’s name will be
     added to the master debarment list for record. Should the subject attempt to enter or is
     detected on base, an apprehension must be executed and debarment order issued at that time
     by 75 SFS.
     6.3. Debarment File. 75 SFS/S5R is responsible for maintaining debarment files. When
     actions stipulated as referenced in this instruction have been completed, the originating
     agency will compile the debarment package, and forward it to 75 SFS/S5R. The debarment
     package must contain:
        6.3.1. A copy of the debarment order.
        6.3.2. Certificate of Service (if used).
        6.3.3. Certified mail receipt (if appropriate).
        6.3.4. A copy of the AF Form 1768 with all coordination and reasons for debarment.
        6.3.5. Other documentation used as a basis for debarment. Files will be maintained by
        75 SFS/S5R in accordance with AFRIMS, Records Disposition Schedule Table 031-01,
        R22.00, Barred Personnel for Active Installations.
7. Debarment Period. Debarment is for a 3-year period unless egregious acts warrant a longer
duration. In those cases, 75 SFS and OO-ALC/JA will coordinate on duration and propose such
to 75 ABW/CC. The debarment period will automatically expire when the duration runs the
length of the term.
8. Base Debarment List. All persons debarred from Hill AFB will be placed on a master base
debarment list (computerized) updated monthly by 75 SFS/S5R. Copies of this list will be
provided to OO-ALC/JA; Ogden Air Logistics Center Labor Relations and Employee
Management(OO-ALC/DPCE); Air Force Personnel Center, Ogden Operating Location,
HILLAFBI31-103 19 APRIL 2012                                                                   5

Wing System Integration & Test Branch (526 ICBMSW/ENI); 75th Security Forces Squadron
Pass and Registration (75 SFS/S5P); 75 SFS/S3O; and DFC. Recipients and users of the list are
responsible for ensuring persons thereon are not granted entry to the base unless approved by the
appropriate authority. Organizations, such as AFPC/DPIDO, must be especially alert to ensure
debarred individuals are not employed on the base unless the debarment is rescinded. The
debarment list will be coded (as applicable) to depict modified debarment and individuals that
have not been served their debarment order. An explanation of codes (when used) will be
identified on the list. The debarment list will be marked “For Official Use Only” (FOUO). Each
recipient agency must follow safeguarding and control rules for FOUO and Privacy Act
protected information.
9. Requests for Re-entry. Debarred persons may request permission to reenter Hill AFB. Such
requests will be submitted to the OO-ALC/JA in writing and sent to the Installation Commander
for approval. OO-ALC/JA is delegated the authority to administratively review and act on
requests to reenter on a limited, case-by-case basis, submitted by anyone previously and
henceforth debarred from the installation. OO-ALC/JA does not have the authority to reconsider
signed debarment orders, but is delegated the authority to consider requests for emergency and
other reentry at its own discretion.
   9.1. The Request for Re-entry package must contain:
   9.2. AF Form 1768 summarizing the request and cause for debarment.
