                                            Materiel Management/FUELS BADGES




                                                         HERALRY:
                       The falcon at the center of the badge symbolizes the Air Force. It also symbolizes the strength, dedication,
                       and devotion to duty of materiel management and fuels personnel who support the generation and
                       employment of aerospace forces across the spectrum of warfare. In its talons, the falcon is holding a key and
                       a bolt of lightning.

                       The bolt of lightning represents military strength and wartime readiness.

                       The key symbolizes the security, safekeeping, and control of supplies, in the old “Quartermaster Corps”
                       tradition.

                       The crossed key and lightning bolt indicates that military strength and wartime readiness can only be
                       achieved through the support provided by professional materiel management personnel.

                       The globe is symbolic of the extensive range of materiel management and fuels support which is worldwide.

                       The olive branch surrounding the badge symbolizes the peace aerospace forces provided through
                       professional materiel management corps.

                       The three levels of award are signified by the addition of a star centered above the falcon for the senior level
                       and a start surrounded by an olive branch for the master level.




Personnel can find specific guidance for the wear of the Supply/Fuels badge in AFI 36-2903, Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational
Badges. Enlisted materiel management personnel are awarded the basic badge after completing initial 3-level training, the senior badge after
award of the 7-level, and the master badge as a Master Sergeant or above with 5 years in the specialty from award of the 7-level.




                                                                             2

Part I

Preface

 1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training
 document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum
 core task requirements for AFSC 2S0XX. The CFETP provides personnel a clear career path to success and
 instills rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions may use
 Part II of this document to support duty position qualification training.
 2. This CFETP consists of two parts, both used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the
 career field.
 2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A explains the
 purpose and how to use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information to include duties and
 responsibilities, specialty qualifications, skill level upgrade requirements, and Community College of the Air
 Force information; Section C outlines knowledge, education, training, and other qualifications required for
 entry, award and retention of each skill level; Section D indicates resource constraints; Section E identifies
 transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
 2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS). Attachment one
 of Section A lists all tasks, core tasks, proficiency codes and technical references to support Air Education and
 Training Command (AETC) and OJT training. Additionally, attachment two of Section A identifies mandatory
 training for Materiel Management Unit Type Codes (UTC). Supervisors and Unit Training Managers must use
 this attachment to certify 2S0XX Airmen for UTC-specific training prior to deployment for contingency
 operations. Section B (Course Objective List) and Section C (Support Materials) are not used. Section D
 identifies a training course index that supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.
 Included here are both mandatory and optional courses. Section E (MAJCOM Unique Requirements) is not
 used. Section F identifies training program points of contact. Section G identifies training program regulations.
 Section H describes Materiel Management Enlisted Career Broadening Program training objectives, program
 qualifications, and program administration.
 3. Using guidance provided in this CFETP will ensure individuals in 2S0XX career field receive effective and
 efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.      At unit level, supervisors, trainers, and training
 managers use this CFETP to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this
 plan. All tasks that are trained OJT as identified by a dash (-) will be to the 3c level of proficiency. This plan
 will       enable      supervisors     to     train     today's    work      force    for      tomorrow's       jobs.

Section A-General Information

1. Purpose
This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM
Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers and certifiers to plan,
develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. Note: Air Force District of Washington
(AFDW) serves as the MFM for personnel assigned to command identification codes (CIDs) 3V and 4W and is
the responsible agency to coordinate training allocations for these personnel. This plan outlines the training
individuals in AFSC 2S0XX should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan
identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. In addition, the plan
mandates specific functional contingency training required prior to deployment. Initial skills training is the
AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty
for award of the 3-skill level. This training is conducted by AETC at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland
TX. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence
course completion requirements for award of the 3, 5, 7, and 9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual
hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training
program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance
skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected
Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training
courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the
minimum required for upgrade. Contingency training is a function of qualification training that readies
Materiel Management Airmen to perform as prescribed by the unit type codes (UTC) and mission capability
(MISCAP) statement. The CFETP has several purposes, some are:
1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. In
addition, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.
1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends
education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.
1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery
method.
1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training
process.

2. Uses
The CFETP is used by the AFCFM, MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive
training programs are available for each individual in the Materiel Management specialty.
2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training
based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP. They will also work
with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified
training.
2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, proficiency,
and contingency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract
training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for
inclusion into plan.
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The lists of
courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval
HQ AF/A4LR as the AFCFM, is the approval authority. MFMs and AETC training personnel will identify
and coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this
document with the AETC Training Manager and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy. Using the list of
courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

Information System (ALIS) experience and is awarded upon 5-skill level completion, six months of ALIS experience,
and supervisor’s recommendation. There are additional SEIs, but these are the primary codes use to identified key
materiel management skill sets.

5. Skill/Career Progression
Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level plays an
important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in
training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part
of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.
5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and knowledge training
provided in the 3-skill level resident courses at J B S A Lackland, TX. Initial skills training requirements were
identified during the 2S0XX Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) held at JBSA Lackland TX in June
2013. Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and
skills. They will utilize the 5-level Career Development Course and Task Qualification to progress in the
career field. During up-grade training to 5-skill level, 3-level assigned airmen should not be considered for
deployment with limited exceptions. Once task certified, a trainee may perform the task unsupervised. Materiel
Management trainees will be assigned to entry level Materiel Management positions. Knowledge gained while
working in these entry level positions will provide for the basis of further growth in the Materiel Management
career field.
5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Journeymen are expected to build upon the skills learned as an apprentice through
additional on-the-job training, completion of career development course and certification on core tasks. Increased
knowledge will prepare Journeymen assume higher levels of responsibility within the Materiel Management career
field.
5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Craftsman are expected to fill various supervisory and management positions
such as shift NCOIC, supervisor, and task certifier. Craftsmen will be expected to analyze the various materiel
management processes and employ problem-solving techniques to achieve resolution of problems. They must
complete the appropriate career development courses and should pursue additional Supply Chain Management and
leadership courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel. Additionally, craftsman
must be certified on designated core tasks. Continued academic education through CCAF and advanced training, to
include vocational programs, is encouraged.
5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. Superintendents are expected to fill positions such as Superintendent, Section
Chief, NCOIC and various NAF and MAJCOM staff positions. Additional training in the areas of budget,
manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education. The Logistics
Readiness SNCO Course is a mandatory requirement for 9-skill level award (upon validation by AETC).
5.5. Force Development Policy. Materiel Management SNCOs, at all levels, must ensure materiel management
personnel outside the LRS are given the opportunity to learn and perform core tasks as shown in the Materiel
Management STS. The senior enlisted materiel manager must coordinate with supervisors and commanders who
functionally control materiel management personnel outside of the LRS to rotate these Airmen back into core
materiel management processes/functions every 24 months when practical or when not restricted by personnel
policies (i.e., individuals will not PCS solely to assure their reassignment to a said squadrons). Retaining AF


                                                           12
Materiel Management Airmen outside the LRS or Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) where they are not
qualifying or retaining proficiency in core materiel management processes, adversely affects the individual’s force
development, career path, and prevents commanders from providing fully qualified Materiel Management Airmen
to combatant commands during wartime operations.

6. Training Decisions
This CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training
requirements for the Materiel Management (2S0XX) career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when,
where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce
duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach. These training decisions were made at the U&TW
conducted at JBSA Lackland in June 2013.
6.1. Initial Skills. Initial skills training provides 2S0XX trainees with knowledge and hands on experience in the
entry level materiel management processes of receiving, storage, inventory, issue processing, research, MICAP,
sourcing assets, repair cycle, deployment/contingency wartime support, stock control, equipment, document
control, and turn-in processing. Additionally, trainees would receive training in reject management, reading and
interpreting inquiries, and basic computer processing
6.2. Five Level Upgrade Requirements. Upgrade to the five-skill level will require completion of the 5-level
CDCs and certification of all 5-level core tasks. Core tasks are identified within this document and are the
minimum number of tasks that an individual must be certified on for upgrade to the higher skill level. Core
tasks are the foundational tasks all Materiel Management Airmen must be able to perform whether at home
station or deployed. Supervisors may determine additional task are required for upgrade training based on the
Airmen’s duty position. When resources are a constraining factor, and the supervisor/commander have
annotated the STS correctly, individuals will not be delayed from upgrade to the next skill level. Contac t the
Force Support Squadron for skill-level upgrade waiver guidance and the proper procedures to annotate the
individuals training record.
6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Requirements. Seven-level upgrade will be accomplished through completion of
CDCs, certification of 7-level core tasks, and supervisor’s recommendation. As mentioned in the five-level
upgrade requirements, training material will be designed to build upon foundational 5-level training and develop
a more knowledgeable, Materiel Management Airmen who are more capable to perform at home station or
deployed.
6.4. Core Task Certification. All core tasks require third party certification. The certifier must be different
than the trainer, be certified on the task being certified and possess a minimum of a 7-skill level.

7. Community College of the Air Force
7.1. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting
institutions, however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel. The college is
regionally accredited through Air University by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges
and Schools (SACS) to award AAS degrees designed for specific Air Force occupational specialties and is the largest
multi-campus community college in the world. Upon completion of basic military training and assignment to an AF
career field, all enlisted personnel are registered in a CCAF degree program and are afforded the opportunity to
obtain an Associate in Applied Science degree. In order to be awarded, degree requirements must be successfully
completed before the student separates from the Air Force, retires, or is commissioned as an officer. See the CCAF
website for details regarding the AAS degree programs at http://www.au.af.mil/au/ccaf/.

7.2. CCAF Degree Requirements. All enlisted airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF program. Prior to
completing an associate degree, the 5-level must be awarded and the following requirements must be met:

Section D-Resource Constraints

11. Purpose
This section identifies known resource constraints which preclude optimal/desired training from being
developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations of each
resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.
Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.
Unit should utilize nearest AF/ANG/AFRES installation to accomplish any training requirements that cannot be
accomplished at home station. Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually.

Part II
Section A-Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation
The implementation of this STS for technical training provided by Air Education and Training Command is
with class beginning 20140630 (2S031).

2. Purpose
2.1. Column 1 (Task, Knowledge and Technical References) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical
references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3, 5, and 7-skill level. Column 2 identifies the core
tasks that must be certified for upgrade to the next higher skill level. These are the minimum core tasks;
supervisors may assign additional core tasks, as deemed appropriate, that must be certified for upgrade to the next
higher skill level. When resources (training expertise, equipment, etc.) are not available to certify an individual
on a core task, the Commander will so annotate the STS stating that resources are not available. Upgrade
training will not be denied to individuals who, through lack of resources, cannot be core task certified. However,
every attempt to obtain the training through contractors, ANG, AFRC, etc… must be exhausted before core
task waiver requests are submitted for approval. Contact the Military Personnel Flight for guidance and the proper
procedures to annotate the individuals training record when core task training cannot be accomplished. Materiel
management personnel in outside units, i.e., maintenance, civil engineers, etc., will not use this document
exclusively when they are supported by a materiel management account. Rather, the host LRS Training Section
will be contacted for assistance. Column 3 is the administrative area for training start/stop dates, trainer, trainee
and certifier initials. Column 4 lists 3, 5, and 7-skill level training proficiency codes.
2.2. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of
training and knowledge provided by resident training, career development courses, and web-based training
course, once developed/fielded
2.3. Attachments 1 and 2 become a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF
Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and IAW AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS, the following
requirements apply:
2.3.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position requirements by
circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement. As a minimum, complete the following columns in
Part 2 of the CFETP: Training start date, Training Completed date, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, Certifier
Initials. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.
NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed
necessary for their career field.
2.3.1.1. Converting from Old Document to CFETP. Use the new CFETP to identify and certify all past and
current task qualifications. Transcribe qualifications in the following manner: For those tasks previously certified
and required in the current duty position, evaluate current qualifications and, when verified, recertify using current
date as completion date and enter trainee and supervisor’s initials. When transcribing previous certification for
tasks not required in the current duty position, carry forward only the previous completion date of certification (not
the initials of another person). If and when transcribed tasks become duty position requirements, recertify using
standard certification procedures. The person whose initials appear in the trainer or certifier block during the
transcription process must meet the requirements of their respective roles. Upon completion of the transcription
process, give the old CFETP to the member.
2.3.1.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available: the supervisor identifies STS training
references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover the
mandatory items in AFECD. For two-time CDC course exam failures: supervisors identify all STS items
corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes
evaluation by the task certifier receives certification on the STS if approved by the applicable approval
authority. NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.
2.3.1.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously
certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous certification or deletes previous



                                                         21
certification when using automated systems. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-
Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification. The individual is recertified (if
required) by both erasing the old entries and writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were
made in ink) over the previously certified entry.
2.3.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual can
perform the task without assistance, meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures.
2.3.3. Application. This STS applies to the training of the Total Force. Unit Commanders of non-LRS units with
materiel management personnel assigned coordinate training needs through the host LRS Training Section or
respective MAJCOM Functional Manager if there is no LRS on the base.                    This will ensure qualified
trainers/certifiers are available and training is accomplished on all core tasks. Waiver authority for core task
certification is the AFCFM.
2.4. Training Business Area (TBA) is the approved, mandatory method for tracking and documenting training for
the Materiel Management career field. Maintain paper copies of the master training plan (MTP) for individual
work centers IAW AFI 36-2201.
2.5. The Training Standard is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the Airman Advancement Division by
senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS
subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher
grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. WAPS is not applicable to the Air
National Guard or the Air Force Reserve.

3. Recommendations
Comments and recommendations are invited concerning quality of AETC training. Reference specific STS
paragraphs and address correspondence regarding changes to 37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1,
JBSA Lackland, TX 78236-5568. A customer service information line has been installed for the supervisor’s
convenience to identify graduates who may have received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in
this specialty training standard. For quick responses to problems, call our customer service information line, DSN
473-2917 any time day or night.

        A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to
 *      define a level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
        A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not
 **
        directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.
        This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided
  -
        in the course or CDC.
        This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due
 X
        to limitations in resources.

NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

                         Attachment 3, Contingency/Expeditionary Training Requirements
    1. Commanders and supervisors, at all levels, should establish an effective contingency/expeditionary training
    program that takes into account the normal AEF battle rhythm. The following tables prescribe the minimum
    essential training tasks Airmen require training and certification on to meet the stated capability of the Unit Type
    Code (UTC). As the minimum training requirements, commanders should use completion of training associated
    with assigned UTCs as the determination of capability readiness in the AEF Reporting Tool (ART).

    2. Ideally, Airmen/teams should begin the specified training 4-6 months before their AEF deployment. Flight
    superintendents/certifying officials will assess an Airmen’s ability to perform the task to the “Go,” “No-Go” level.
    A copy of the applicable training table, indicating completed training, should be placed in the Airman’s AF Form
    623, On-the-Job Training Record, and maintained until return from deployment.

    3. UTCs/capabilities requiring training/certifying on specialized materiel handling (i.e., all-terrain fork lift) tasks
    require a minimum of 50 percent of personnel assigned against that UTC be certified on those tasks.

    4. The MAJCOM Functional Manager is the waiver authority for required training.

9. Program Administration
9.1. The Materiel Management Career Field Manager solicits volunteers during the month of April of each year
by sending a message to all MAJCOM A4Rs and MFMs for dissemination to all field and base level
agencies. Volunteers submit a package to their organization commander, who ensures the individual meets the
mandatory requirements, endorses the approved package and forwards the package to their respective Materiel
Management MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM). The Materiel Management MFM will scrutinize the
package and if he/she concurs with the organization commander’s recommendation, the MFM will upload their
respective MAJCOM nominee(s) package to the Materiel Management Sharepoint link, free of any Personal
Identification Information.
9.2. Once all nominations are received, the AFPC Materiel Management Assignments Functional will screen
nominees for PCS eligibility. After PCS eligibility is determined, a selection panel chaired by AF Career Field
Manager will convene in July of each year. The panel will make selections based on the nominee’s
performance reports and breadth of retail supply experience. The selectees will be notified by message soon
after the selections have been made.
9.3. On average, HQ AFPC assigns six NCOs per year to the Enlisted Career Broadening Program; three per
year at the Air Logistics Complexes (ALC) within the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and three per
year at the Defense Supply Centers (DSC) within the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).
