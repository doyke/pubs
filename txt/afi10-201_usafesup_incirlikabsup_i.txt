                                              Chapter 1

                                   SORTS GENERAL POLICY

1.1. SORTS. SORTS is an internal management tool for use by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff (CJCS), Services, Unified Commands, and Combat Support Agencies. It is the single automated
reporting system within the Department of Defense (DoD) functioning as the central registry of all
operational units of the US Armed Forces and certain foreign organizations. SORTS has a threefold
purpose: it provides data critical to crisis planning, provides for the deliberate or peacetime planning
process, and is used by the Chief of Staff United States Air Force (CSAF) and subordinate
commanders in assessing their effectiveness in meeting Title 10, “United States Code,‖
responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for combatant commands. All units with a United
States Air Force (USAF) Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code will be registered in SORTS.
   1.1.1. As a monitoring system of measured units and resources, SORTS indicates the C-level
   of selected resources and training status required to undertake the full mission set for which a
   unit was organized or designed. It also collects and distributes Service-unique information
   regarding a measured unit.
   1.1.2. The Air Force (AF) uses SORTS status information in assessing readiness,
   determining budgetary allocation and management action impacts on unit level readiness,
   answering congressional inquiries, analyzing readiness trends, and supporting readiness
   decisions.
   1.1.3. SORTS provides broad bands of information on selected unit status indicators which
   include the commander’s assessment of the unit’s ability to execute the mission set for which
   it is organized or designed. Measurement criteria is designed and developed by Functional
   Area Managers (FAM) to provide valid assessments regarding unit readiness. Commanders,
   or their designated alternates, assess measurements against their mission set to determine if
   they provide a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness. It is critical that reporting
   commanders identify those areas that are rated less than desired in order to promote and
   justify corrective action (including funding, personnel and equipment allocations.).
       1.1.3.1. SORTS is not designed to function as a detailed information management
       system objectively counting all conceivable variables regarding personnel, training, and
       logistics.
       1.1.3.2. SORTS is not designed to be used as input for the performance appraisal of a
       unit or a unit commander.
           1.1.3.2.1. SORTS indicates a unit’s ability to undertake their full mission (Primary
           DOC Statement) or particular mission(s) (Secondary or Tertiary DOC Statements).
           1.1.3.2.2. SORTS may also provide indications of the efficacy of resource allocation
           decisions and the impacts of budgetary constraints on resourcing unit requirements.
       1.1.3.3. A fundamental premise of SORTS reporting is integrity. Commanders must ―tell
       it like it is‖ (in accordance with (IAW) paragraphs 1.10.7 and 1.10.8) and not allow
       masking of deficiencies to affect their ability to provide capability or other readiness
       related information. Risk must be balanced with responsibility. Effective management of
       unit resources requires accurate information at all levels.
 10                               AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   1.1.4. When deployed/employed in response to a crisis or operations order (OPORD), SORTS
   provides both an assessment of a unit’s status based on ability to execute the mission set for
   which it was organized or designed and, when appropriate, the mission against which it is
   employed.
   1.1.5. Records Maintenance. Records prescribed by this instruction will be maintained IAW Air
   Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
      1.1.6. In the event of conflict between this AFI and MAJCOM Supplements or Unit DOCs, AFI
      guidance will take precedence. Concerned parties will contact the HQ USAF/XOOA office for
      resolution.
1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual (JTF)
HQs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air National Guard,
AF Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or combatant
command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 or Volume 3 of
the USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in the ―Forces For Unified Commands‖
document. Measured units will be named on a DOC Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in
accordance with their DOCS. One exception is training units that report only Major Equipment
Location and Crew Information (MEQLOCN). Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as
possible after a unit activates and continues until the unit deactivates.
   1.2.1. Provisional and task organized combat, combat support and combat service support units are
   also designated as measured units. The Service component or Combatant Commander (CC) directing
   the establishment of a measured unit will determine the organizational reporting structure of the unit.
   1.2.2. Air Force measured units may include any units registered in SORTS. Registered units include
   PAS coded units, fragments of PAS coded units and composite units such as fleets (e.g., airlift,
   tanker, etc.). Composite reports are in addition to and do not replace normal measured unit SORTS
   reporting requirements.
   1.2.3. SORTS measurement baseline. Regardless of the source of a unit's tasking or the extent of
   unit capability tasked in OPLANS, etc., SORTS measurement is based on the unit's full wartime
   requirement for which it was organized or designed. This baseline is reflected in the definition of
   C-1. This baseline can exceed the unit's OPLAN tasking(s). To fulfill this measurement
   requirement, the unit's primary DOC Statement must include the maximum tasking(s), including
   both in-place and mobility wartime missions, the unit can simultaneously support within its
   current resource authorizations. When properly updated with a unit’s complete in-place and
   mobility tasking(s), the AFWUS is a single source reference for a unit's designed capability.
   Units are required to measure and report on all resources identified on their DOC Statement(s)
   even if the resources are not yet delivered (e.g., equipment for a newly assigned UTC) or if it is
   not possible to accomplish a task, such as small arms qualification. If required, waivers for
   SORTS reporting must to be coordinated through HQ USAF/ XOOA.
         1.2.3.1. Personnel Measurement Baseline.
             1.2.3.1.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
             measuring personnel is the unit's full wartime requirement for personnel based on either
             Unit Manning Document (UMD) authorizations or UTC requirements. See paragraph
             3.1 Training is not measured in the personnel measured area.
             1.2.3.1.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS do not report the personnel measured area.
             See Attachment 4.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                11


     1.2.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.2.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
         measuring equipment and supplies is the unit's full wartime requirement for the items
         being measured. The required numbers for the items are based on authorization
         documents such as Allowance Standards (AS), Air Staff-level functional area
         guidance, MRSP lists, equipment and supplies lists, or UTC requirements, depending
         on the unit's mission(s). See Chapter 4. Equipment condition is normally not to be
         measured in the Equipment and Supplies O/H measured area.
         1.2.3.2.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS will base the equipment and supplies O/H
         area on the unit's full wartime requirement for the equipment items and the condition
         of the items being measured. See Attachment 4.
     1.2.3.3. Equipment Condition Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.3.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The Equipment
         Condition measured area measures the condition of possessed equipment and
         supplies. See Chapter 5.
         1.2.3.3.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS include equipment condition
         measurements in the equipment and supplies O/H measured area. See Attachment 4.
     1.2.3.4. Training Measurement Baseline.
         1.2.3.4.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for
         measuring training is the personnel assigned to the unit that require the training event
         or category being measured. See Chapter 6.
         1.2.3.4.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS measure training in the training measured
         area. Measured training is based on the unit's full wartime requirement of personnel
         for the training event or category being measured. See Attachment 4.
  1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) The following USAFE Forms will be used to compile measured
  unit readiness information. These forms replace the generic worksheets, currently in use.
  Altering or tailoring these forms is not authorized. Unit monitors are to discontinue use of
  the generic worksheets and begin using the following USAFE forms, as of this supplement’s
  effective date.
     1.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Form 215A, Status of Resources and Training
     System Worksheet - Overall. Used to gather and calculate data reflecting overall unit
     category-levels (C-levels) based on the unit’s degree of readiness.

 12                              AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


       1.2.4.4. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Form 215D, Status of Resources and Training System
       Worksheet - Equipment and Supplies on Hand. Used to gather data and calculate the
       resource status of authorized equipment and supplies required to support the unit’s wartime
       mission, as identified on the unit DOC Statement.
       1.2.4.5. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Form 215E, Status of Resources and Training System
       Worksheet - Equipment Condition. Used to gather data and calculate the combat essential
       and support equipment that can be made ready within the unit’s response time to undertake
       its wartime mission, as identified on the unit DOC Statement.
       1.2.4.6. (Added-USAFE) USAFE Form 216, Nuclear Chemical Biological Defense Report
       (CBDRT) Worksheet. A separate report to be submitted concurrent with the unit’s primary
       SORTS report. Information reflected in this report is based on the unit’s ability to perform
       its wartime mission for up to 96 hours in a nuclear biological and chemical (NBC)
       environment. Note: The measured unit commander’s signature is required on Forms 215A
       and 216 prior to submission to the Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO).
1.3. Frequency of SORTS Reporting. All measured units (Active, Reserve, and Guard) will
continuously monitor changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit location.
Units must report no later than every 30 days (in order for messages to process by the mandated 31
day maximum) or when changes affect the unit’s Overall C-level, the four measured area levels,
associated reason codes, deployed reason codes, get well/get worse date changes, and when desired
by the measured unit commander. See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4, for further information.
   1.3.1. Command Reporting Organizations (CRO) submit waiver requests for reporting
   requirements or changes to reporting frequency through HQ USAF/XOOA to the Joint Staff (JS).
   Units submit their waiver requests to their CRO.
   1.3.2. Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest
   individual unit’s; Report Date of Change of Category Information (RICDA).
   1.3.3. If unit status has not changed since the last report an OVERALL set must be submitted to
   reflect an updated RICDA date and any remarks in the database will be updated with the current date.
   1.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Newly measured units must submit a SORTS report within 24
   hours after the ―Effective Date‖ of their DOC Statement in the Global Status of Resources
   and Training System (GSORTS).
       1.3.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Waivers to reporting requirements outlined in AFI 10-201
       and this supplement must be submitted to USAFE Readiness Measures for coordination
       and implementation.
   1.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Command Reporting Organization (CRO) will notify SRO when to
   increase or decrease the frequency of reporting data elements. Whenever possible, increased
   reporting will be limited to selective interest items (i.e. by selected sets, labels, fields, or
   major equipment type).
1.4. SORTS Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, ―Classified National Security
Information,‖ requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities. Also, this
EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and declassification
decisions. The procedures for classification and marking of classified documents are specified in
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                          13


DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking
Classified Documents; and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.‖
   1.4.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly
   developed material consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
   1.4.2. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry
   forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the original source.
   1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels,
   numbers used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS),
   reason codes associated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a
   minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more measured
   units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying SORTS reports must
   consider other classification guidance including OPLANS. The association of the unit with its
   OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification of the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET.
   Information that is not SORTS based and does not show a deficiency may still require
   classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit and Wing Security Managers should be
   consulted in these events.
       1.4.3.1. SORTS Worksheets/Briefing Slides reflecting measured unit data, as described
       above, will be given the same classification level as the material from which it was
       derived. Although sources (worksheets, e-mails, etc.) used to compile a unit’s SORTS
       data may be unclassified, once compiled and associated with SORTS ratings, it becomes
       classified at the highest level associated with the data (see Table 1.3).
       1.4.3.2. Aggregate SORTS data will be classified at the same or higher level as the
       highest classified component parts or segments of SORTS data. SORTS data converted to
       a new type information must be evaluated for its impact on national security if released.
       See Table 1.3 for further guidance.
       1.4.3.3. C-5 Authorization messages (giving that a unit is authorized to, not that they are
       reporting C-5) are Unclassified provided notification does not contain the unit’s current
       C-level (C1-5) or specific information, e.g., limiting factors, operational plans, etc.
   1.4.4. Classification Authority. The JS SORTS database is classified SECRET. Information
   extracted from this database is classified IAW CJCSM 3150.02, ―Global Status of Resources and
   Training System (GSORTS),‖ and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with
   DoD 5200.1R, except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when
   extracts contain exempted data. If no classified source exists, use CJCSM 3150.02 as
   classification authority. Use "Derived From: CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and
   Training System (GSORTS), Declassify On: (date)‖ to mark material when this reference is used
   as classification guidance. The date of declassification is four years from the date of the
   document for CONFIDENTIAL and eight years for SECRET. If other sources direct a
   classification higher or for a longer period, list the classification guidance as the authority and list
   the specific sources on the file copy.
       1.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Deactivating units SORTS data will remain classified until the
       original date of declassification.
       1.4.4.2. (Added-USAFE) All SORTS related documents and paperwork will be
       properly classified in accordance with AFI 10-201, paragraph 1.4.
 14                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


          1.4.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Mark/stamp all paperwork on front/back and top/bottom
          within classified binders. At an absolute minimum, the overall marking will contain
          the United States (U.S.) classification and the declassification date. Classification
          will be formatted as follows: SECRET//20230630
   1.4.5. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of SORTS data and aggregate
   information will be determined by CJCS. The HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and
   Space Operations (HQ USAF/ XO) is the authority to extend or accelerate downgrading
   classification of SORTS data following an initial determination by CJCS.
1.5. Releasing SORTS Data to Outside Agencies. CJCSI 5714.01, ―Release Procedures for
Joint Staff and Joint Papers and Information,‖ sets the policy for release of SORTS data to
agencies not on original distribution.
   1.5.1. Policy: All holders of SORTS data must take action to protect against unauthorized
   disclosure and to preserve the statutory relationship of the CJCS, as principal military
   adviser, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as military advisors to the Secretary of Defense
   (SECDEF). Authorized holders of AF SORTS data can release it only to military
   components, or assigned or apportioned units, with a valid need-to-know and appropriate
   clearance. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated through HQ USAF/XOOA.
   1.5.2. Specific policies for auditors, the Congress, and the general public: Auditors and
   inspectors of the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the Office of the DoD Inspector
   General (IG) have legal authority under Public Laws 96-226 and 97-252 for access. Only the
   President and SecDef can deny final access. Refer denial proposals to HQ USAF/XOOA for
   submission to the JS.
       1.5.2.1. Release data to Congress and its committees, staff, and investigators according
       to DoD Directive 5400.4, ―Provision of Information to the Congress.‖
       1.5.2.2. Responses to requests for SORTS data from the public under provisions of the
       Freedom of Information Act must be coordinated with HQ USAF SORTS, JS, and the
       Freedom of Information Act processing office.
       1.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Upon notification of inspection/review from any outside
       agency, other than Air Force Audit Agency, Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG), and HQ
       USAFE Readiness Measures Staff Assistance Visit (SAV), SRO’s and unit monitors will
       submit a request for disclosure to USAFE Readiness Measures. The request will include:
       Name of inspection agency, date, time, and location of inspection. USAFE Readiness
       Measures will coordinate the request with Air Staff. Upon approval, USAFE Readiness
       Measures will submit a memorandum stating approval back to the requesting unit.
   1.5.3. Preferred Methods for Release. Only the minimum amount of information will be
   released to satisfy a request. Preferred methods in rank order are:
       1.5.3.1. Access to a specific part or parts of the database in a controlled environment.
       1.5.3.2. Access to a major subset or the entire database in a controlled environment.
       1.5.3.3. Release of a specific part or parts of the database or minor subset.
       1.5.3.4. Release of a major subset of the entire database.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                    15


1.6. Information Reported in SORTS.
   1.6.1. Reported Unit Identification Code (RPTDUIC) set. This set establishes the identity of
   each individual reporting unit by their Unit Identity Code (UIC).
   1.6.2. Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) set. Set applies to all registered units, includes the
   Unit Descriptor Code (UDC), unit abbreviated name (ANAME), UTC, Unit Level Code (ULC),
   Major Command (MJCOM for BIDE) under which the unit is organized, and unit Long Name
   (LNAME). Only CROs (MAJCOM SORTS office or equivalent) report this data.
   1.6.3. Reporting Organization (RPTNORG), Losing Organization (LOSING), Gaining
   Organization (GAINING), and Transfer Status (TRANSFER) sets. The RPTNORG set includes
   each unit’s CRO (Reporting Organization UIC (RPTOR) field) and Subordinate Reporting Unit
   (SBRPT). Only CROs report LOSING, GAINING, and TRANSFER sets to manage unit
   reporting organizations.
   1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all
   registered units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with
   Operational Control (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home Geographical
   Location (HOGEO) and Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity Code (ACTIV), and
   Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs report this data with the exception of PCTEF, which is
   reported by the measured unit.
   1.6.5. Reserve Component Organization Status (RESERVES) set. Includes duty location,
   activity, mobilization or call-up date, and gaining command for units mobilized. HQ Air Force
   Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) report this data according
   to CJCSM 3150.02.
   1.6.6. Personnel Strength Status (PERSTREN) set. The Air Force reports wartime authorized,
   assigned, possessed, deployable, and tasked deployable strengths. Unit authorizations are
   maintained by the MAJCOM and in the UMD. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for units to
   identify wartime personnel authorizations. In peacetime, the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)
   reports assigned and available data. When CJCS directs an increased reporting frequency,
   measured units report personnel strength status as directed.
   1.6.7. Resources and Training Status (Type of Report (TREAD), OVERALL, PERSONNEL,
   Equipment Supplies O/H (EQSUPPLY), Equipment Condition (EQCONDN), TRAINING,
   FORECAST, Category Limit (CATLIM) and Remarks fields. Fields apply to all measured units
   that report status for one or more DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements (AF Form (AFF)
   723 or approved facsimile) summarize and provide source information for the mission(s) for
   which the unit is organized or designed. All unit SORTS data is available to all authorized Global
   Command and Control System (GCCS) GSORTS customers. While there are exceptions, Unified
   Commanders and the JS primarily look to joint data elements (Overall C-level and reason code,
   the four measured area levels and reason codes, and the associated remarks). AF FAMs look at
   detailed data, analyze information for trends, and direct appropriate actions in response to
   lowered C-levels.
      1.6.7.1. Plain language supplemental remarks can be reported for any SORTS data field that
      contains information. These remarks are a critical component of the SORTS report and are
      frequently used as a management tool.
      1.6.7.2. Remarks are allowed in the database through 3 increments of 2000 + 2000 + 1000
      characters for a maximum total of 5000 characters per remark. On rare occasions a remark may
      be limited to 2000 or less characters.
 16                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   1.6.8. Major Equipment Location and Crew Status (MEQLOCN) set. MEQLOCN is
   reported in unit SORTS reports for those units possessing major equipment (aircraft,
   missiles, etc.). This set includes major equipment (MEQPT) and crew status at a unit's
   present and deployed locations. See Attachment 5 for further guidance.
1.7. SORTS Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement (AFF 723) or approved
facsimile). CJCS SORTS policy requires a unit’s Overall C-level to be based on an assessment
of those resources and training required to undertake a unit’s wartime mission(s). The purpose
for a SORTS DOC Statement is to provide units with a single source document of the
information necessary and the location of the references specifying resources to measure and
report in SORTS. They also provide a narrative description of the unit’s wartime mission(s). All
SORTS DOC Statements will be completed on a standard or computer generated AFF 723 or an
XOOA approved facsimile.
   1.7.1. There are three types of SORTS DOC Statements. The Primary Mission DOC
   Statement must reflect the unit’s full wartime mission set (all unit wartime missions, i.e., in-
   place, mobility, Air Expeditionary Force (AEF), etc.) and is assigned DOC Number
   (DOCNR) one. Secondary Mission DOC Statements will reflect all resources necessary to
   undertake a major portion of the primary mission and are numbered sequentially using
   DOCNRs 2 through 9. Units with more than eight secondary missions will coordinate with
   HQ USAF SORTS for additional DOCNRs. Secondary DOC Statements are normally
   written for single missions such as mobility. Tertiary Mission DOC Statements will reflect all
   resources necessary to undertake ancillary missions. A Tertiary DOC Statement is normally
   given a DOC number from A-J (K-Z are reserved per HQ USAF SORTS).
   1.7.2. SORTS DOC Statements are not used to establish, organize, design, equip, or task
   units. Need statements, ASs, UMDs, OPLANs, UTCs, AFWUS, etc., serve these functions.
   1.7.3. In coordination with the CRO, FAMs must ensure SORTS DOC Statements are
   written to reflect the wartime capability units are committed to deliver at execution.
   1.7.4. SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the MAJCOM SORTS DOC Statement
   Approval Authority (e.g., ANG SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the ANG SORTS
   office (ANG/ XOOX)). DOC Statements involving multiple MAJCOMs, such as gaining unit
   issues, must be approved by all MAJCOMs involved.
   1.7.5. CROs must provide the following agencies with the SORTS DOC Statement upon
   approval by the CRO.
       1.7.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS.
       1.7.5.2. Interested MAJCOMs.
       1.7.5.3. Initial gaining MAJCOMs.
       1.7.5.4. Parent MAJCOM functional offices.
       1.7.5.5. Parent MAJCOM manpower offices.
       1.7.5.6. Subordinate reporting organizations.
   1.7.6. HQ AFRC and the NGB will provide interested parties a copy of SORTS DOC
   Statement(s) within 45 days of approval.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                    17


   1.7.7. Subordinate reporting organizations must make SORTS DOC Statements available to
   measured units, direct support units, and functional offices.
   1.7.8. Recipients at all levels must review new SORTS DOC Statements and forward any
   comments to the FAM.
   1.7.9. SORTS DOC Statements must be reviewed annually by the MAJCOM staff and the
   measured unit commander. Unit commanders must sign the unit DOC Statement upon
   assumption of command or after annual review has been completed. Signature does not
   acknowledge agreement/disagreement. Signature indicates the review has been accomplished and
   the commander and their designated alternates understand the SORTS reporting requirements in
   the DOC Statement. Current SORTS DOC Statements must be marked with the last review date
   and maintained for the duration of the initial DOC, i.e., if current DOC’s effective date is 1 Jan
   2001, and you have a SAV in Mar 2003, records must show the initial review and one annual. All
   unit commander documentation must be shown for the life of the DOC. The
   MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office is responsible for the tracking and initiation of annual
   reviews. When an annual review is conducted, notify HQ USAF SORTS of the review date via e-
   mail or the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN)/Defense Message System (DMS). When
   altered or outdated the impacted SORTS DOC Statement must be replaced or rescinded, as
   applicable. The applicable MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office will ensure that HQ USAF
   SORTS receives the current SORTS DOC Statement via electronic mail media; (e-mail or
   AUTODIN/DMS) or an automated DOC Statement system.
       1.7.9.1. Unexpected changes to unit DOC Statements must be accomplished within 60 days
       of changes in unit data, i.e., Unit & Mission Identification, Measured Resource areas
       (personnel, equipment, training), or any item that would affect unit reporting requirements.
       Expected changes must be accomplished 30 days prior to the change.
       1.7.9.2. DOC Statement pen and ink changes will only be completed for administrative
       purposes. Administrative changes include DOC effective date, spelling or grammatical
       errors, etc. All pen and ink changes will be originated by the OPR for the DOC Statement
       and submitted to all agencies that originally coordinated on the DOC undergoing the change.
       Any change to DOC content, such as Unit data, UTC identification, unit reporting
       instructions, or other material that effects the actual reporting of information requires a
       new/revised DOC Statement submitted through normal coordination channels.
       1.7.9.3. For coordination timelines and detailed instructions on preparing DOC Statements,
       see Attachment 2.
1.8. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Normally, a unit has a single SORTS DOC Statement, called the Primary Mission
DOC, which reflects all the unit assigned/tasked wartime mission(s), including the most stringent
contingency mission. The Primary DOC Statement Overall C-level for a unit is the primary
readiness indicator available to the Joint/Air Staffs and component commanders, and is based on
the capability of a unit to accomplish it’s full wartime mission set(s). DOC Statements will not
be written to only reflect an AEF steady state commitment; such commitments may be added in
the Remarks section at MAJCOM option. See Attachment 2 for details.
   1.8.1. If a unit’s total wartime mission is composed of significantly different component
   missions (mobility, generation, nuclear, conventional, etc.), the parent MAJCOM may elect
 18                               AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   to produce multiple SORTS DOC Statements for that unit. Multiple SORTS DOC Statements
   will be organized as follows:
         1.8.1.1. The primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will be assigned DOCNR 1 and
         will encompass all the missions assigned to a unit. There will be only one primary
         mission SORTS DOC Statement.
         1.8.1.2. Any major portion of a unit’s total wartime mission requiring assessment
         separate and apart from the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement is referenced in a
         secondary mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples include conventional munitions
         delivery, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, nuclear munitions delivery, mobility, in-
         place generation, etc.
         1.8.1.3. Ancillary portions of a unit’s total wartime mission that require assessment
         separate and apart from the Primary or Secondary SORTS DOC Statement are referenced
         in a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Examples would be individual UTCs,
         force protection, operational risk management, etc.
         1.8.1.4. Primary DOC Statements will only address a single set of resources listed on a
         unit’s DOC and are limited to only resources authorized to that unit or Direct Support
         Unit (DSU). A unit’s Primary DOC Statement (for SORTS C-level assessment purposes)
         must not reference resources already measured under another unit’s DOC Statement. Two
         units cannot measure the same resources, however, a unit’s Secondary or Tertiary DOC
         Statement(s) may reference the same Primary DOC resources for a secondary mission
         assessment. This does not constitute double counting of resources as this procedure is
         intended to provide a separate assessment of single missions or capabilities.
      1.8.2. Overall C-level data for the Secondary or Tertiary SORTS DOC Statement is reported in
      the Subordinate Overall (SUBOVRAL) set.
1.9. Measuring Unit Resources using DOC Response Time. Air Force units must be ready for
deployment and/or employment within a specified time, referred to as the unit’s DOC response time.
Measurement of unit resources is based on the measured resource areas expected to be mission ready
by the DOC response time and the expected Overall C-level at the DOC response time.
   1.9.1. Response Time. Resource status is a calculated forecast of a mission or alert response time
   of up to 72 hours (CJCSM 3150.02). Units with multiple missions and/or response times also
   apply these rules. Multiple response times should be applied accordingly to resources required by
   each response time. SORTS Primary DOC Statements list the shortest of multiple response times
   that all unit resources are expected to be ready or recalled.
   1.9.2. Using Response Time. Air Force units project C-level status within their response time.
   When projecting resource status, units will count all resources (as available, that are expected to
   be ready by the response time). Consider the following factors, as a minimum, when projecting
   unit resource status:
         1.9.2.1. The unit’s actual deployment posture.
         1.9.2.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
         maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift length.
         1.9.2.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change
         from current projections.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                        19


       1.9.2.4. Allocate resources to units under a parent organization based on the subordinate
       unit’s place in the deployment sequence.
1.10. Category-Levels (C-levels) and Associated Remarks. C-levels reflect the degree to which
unit resources meet prescribed levels of personnel, equipment, and training.
   1.10.1. C-1. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake the full
   wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status
   will neither limit flexibility and methods for mission accomplishment nor increase vulnerability
   of unit personnel and equipment. The unit does not require any compensation for any
   deficiencies.
   1.10.2. C-2. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the
   wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status
   may cause isolated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment, but will not
   increase the unit's vulnerability under most envisioned operational scenarios. The unit would
   require little, if any, compensation for deficiencies.
   1.10.3. C-3. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not
   all, portions of the wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and
   training area status will result in significant decrease in flexibility for mission accomplishment
   and will increase vulnerability of the unit under many, but not all, envisioned operational
   scenarios. The unit would require significant compensation for deficiencies.
   1.10.4. C-4. The unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime
   mission(s), but it may be directed to undertake portions of its wartime mission(s) with resources
   O/H.
   1.10.5. C-5. The unit is undergoing a Service-directed resource action and is not prepared, at
   this time, to undertake the mission set for which it is organized or designed. Within the CBDRT
   report, units will use C-5 to indicate when they have no NBC defense equipment or training
   requirements, See Attachment 4.
   1.10.6. C-6. The unit is not required to measure assets in a specified area. C-6 (not a rating)
   may not be used as an Overall C-level.
   1.10.7. Overall C-level. Only the commander, or officially designated representative, of the
   measured unit is authorized to assign an Overall C-level. Commanders may not modify
   calculated resource area category levels, but are expected to use judgment in the commander’s
   assessment and to raise or lower the overall category level when appropriate. Higher echelons of
   command may add remarks to a unit’s SORTS report to further explain a situation or deficiency
   but may not change subordinate unit C-levels.
   1.10.8. Assigning the Overall C-level. Based on unit readiness, unit commanders assign the
   Overall C-level each time it is reported. Normally, the lowest level of the four measured resource
   areas is reported as the Overall C-level provided it is a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness
   (based on the C-level definitions). As a reminder, the measured area data cannot be arbitrarily
   changed from calculated values (must be reported per the specified formulas and tables). If the
   lowest measured area level is not a realistic indication of the unit’s Overall C-level, commanders
   can assess the Overall C-level to a level that better indicates unit readiness. Commanders are
   expected to use their judgment during assessments and may raise or lower the overall C-
   level. At a minimum, commanders should consider the following factors when determining
   the overall unit C-level: inspection results, assistance team results, program readiness
20                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


  reviews, and the number of critical personnel in support of Small Scale Contingencies (SSC)
  deployments. Units attaining an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) or Nuclear Surety
  Inspection (NSI) Marginal or Unsatisfactory inspection result will consider lowering the Overall
  C-level and providing remarks outlining deficiencies and resource improvement timetables. The
  remarks should reflect training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to satisfactorily
  accomplish the inspection and anticipated completion dates. The commander will provide
  rationale for any assessment in a remark using the Overall Reason Organization not C-1
  (REASN) label. The following factors should also be considered:
     1.10.8.1. Personnel subjective factors:
         1.10.8.1.1. Availability of personnel who do not have the required Air Force specialty
         code (AFSC) or skill level but are able to accomplish mission tasks.
         1.10.8.1.2. Unusually high/low formal education level, morale, or unit cohesion.
         1.10.8.1.3. Personnel turnover rates that impact mission accomplishment.
         1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation
         mission.
     1.10.8.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H subjective factors:
         1.10.8.2.1. Item shortages having a larger effect than indicated by equipment fill rate.
         1.10.8.2.2. Availability of older items able to substitute functionally and inter-operate
         with required items.
         1.10.8.2.3. Status of plans to move resources from temporary peacetime locations, to
         wartime locations.
         1.10.8.2.4. Differences between standard fill rates and various assessment tools.
         1.10.8.2.5. Individual protective equipment items availability (e.g., mobility bags).
         1.10.8.2.6. The availability of special equipment that may be used to increase the chance
         for success under adverse conditions or add flexibility to mission accomplishment.
     1.10.8.3. Equipment Condition subjective factors:
         1.10.8.3.1. Demonstrated      maintenance      surge    capabilities   during    exercises,
         inspections, or operations.
         1.10.8.3.2. Depot programmed and unscheduled maintenance status probability.
         1.10.8.3.3. Status of modification programs and their impact on daily operations.
         1.10.8.3.4. Mission Ready rates.
     1.10.8.4. Training subjective factors:
         1.10.8.4.1. Availability of qualified training personnel (rated and non-rated), of
         equipment and/or facilities, and of areas, ranges, and flying hours.
         1.10.8.4.2. Major training event time lapses or a high turnover of key personnel.
         1.10.8.4.3. Completion of any specialized training that increases the chances for
         mission accomplishment.
     1.10.8.5. Other subjective factors:
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                 21


         1.10.8.5.1. The unit’s ability to operate in a nuclear, biological, and chemical
         environment, see CBDRT.
         1.10.8.5.2. Another unit’s C-level when also required for a specific mission.
         1.10.8.5.3. Host or tenant mission requirements.
         1.10.8.5.4. Ability of contractors to provide contingency or wartime services.
         1.10.8.5.5. Ability of unit assigned foreign nationals to perform assigned wartime
         tasks during contingencies or wartime.
  1.10.9. Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-level. A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5 for
  units undergoing a service-directed resource action and which are not prepared to undertake the
  mission set for which they are organized or designed. C-5 cannot be reported in any measured
  resource area and C-5 status will not exceed one year for Active Duty or three years for
  Guard/Reserve units from the designated start date of the conversion or transition. C-5 is only
  used when authorized by the parent MAJCOM and one of the following conditions exists:
     1.10.9.1. Unit Transition. Unit transitions include modernization/conversion of major
     equipment (F-4s to F-16s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment (extensive
     equipment testing/personnel user training), a change in a unit’s mission (which can be
     accomplished without changing the major equipment involved), and/or a change in a unit’s
     home station location (higher headquarters approval may be required). When a unit is
     undergoing a transition and the first measured area C-level falls to C-4, C-5 may be
     authorized. Report C-5 as the Overall C-level and report the current measured area C-levels
     until the old DOC is rescinded and the new DOC is effective. Units will continue to report
     their Overall C-level as C-5 until all measured areas (except areas authorized to report C-6)
     have improved to C-3. SORTS reports and DOC Statements are based on the wartime
     mission(s) for which the unit is organized or designed. Unit transitions are not wartime
     missions. Therefore, separate DOC Statements will not be written for transitions.
     1.10.9.2. Unit Activation or Re-activation. Activating units may be authorized to report C-5
     as their Overall C-level until all measured areas have reached a maintainable C-3 (except
     measured areas authorized to be reported as Code 6) or the end of the designated activation
     period, whichever occurs first.
     1.10.9.3. Unit Deactivation. Deactivating units will continue to report SORTS measured
     areas based on their current DOC Statement. Units may be authorized to report C-5 after the
     first measured area reaches C-4. Units must continue to report SORTS until unit deactivation
     is authorized by the publication of a command order (G-Series) at which time the SORTS
     DOC Statement(s) is/ are rescinded. Once a unit has deactivated, MAJCOMs will ensure all
     pertinent unit data is removed from the database. Necessary actions must also be undertaken
     to remove the unit from tasking documents (OPLANs, CONPLANS, service war planning
     documents such as the AFWUS, etc.).
     1.10.9.4. Units not manned or equipped but required in wartime force structure. HQ
     USAF SORTS will determine what data will be reported for any units of this type.
     1.10.9.5. Units authorized to report C-5 will continue to compute and report measured
     area C-levels at least monthly unless directed to do so more frequently by the parent
     MAJCOM.

   1.10.10. Explaining the Overall C-level. Remarks will be used to explain and amplify data
   contained in a SORTS report. All remarks must be written in plain English and clearly
   explain why the unit is less than C-1, what actions are being taken to resolve the problem,
   what resources are needed, and when the C-level will change. Acronyms may only be used if
   previously defined in the remark in which that acronym is being used. See Chapter 2 for
   further direction.

         1.11.4.7.1. Monitor SORTS information by reviewing the HQ USAF SORTS Classified
         Web Page (http://c2www.af.pentagon.smil.mil/xooa). Alternate method is to use the
         returned AUTODIN/DMS copy of their GSORTS database.
         1.11.4.7.2. Sample, review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks. Inadequate remarks
         will be challenged and corrected.
         1.11.4.7.3. Provide wing/unit technical assistance for correction of reporting problems.
         Unresolvable reporting problems forwarded to the USAF SORTS office must be
         accompanied by applicable reports, sequence numbers, date-time-groups, etc.
         1.11.4.7.4. To confirm monitor cognizance and ensure Air Staff awareness of reporting
         delay issues, all MAJCOMS will submit a daily status report to the HQ USAF SORTS
         office on all units whose SORTS database has not been updated within 35 days. Reports
         will      be       sent      to      the      HQ        USAF       SORTS      classified
         (mailto:SORTS@af.pentagon.smil.mil) or unclassified
         (mailto:SORTS@pentagon.af.mil) group e-mail addresses. The 35th day will be based
         on the current RICDA date reflected in the GSORTS Database. Status reports will
         address why the unit’s database has not been updated, and when the database is expected
         to update. Submit daily status reports using the following format Example:
  UIC #/REPORT DTG OF THE MSG THAT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED & SEQUENCE #
  OF REPORTS SUBMITTED THUS FAR, IF ANY (ATTACH A COPY OF THE
  TRANSMITTED REPORT AND ANY REPORT AND MESSAGE PROCESSOR (RAMP)
  MESSAGES RECEIVED)/ GENTEXT REMARKS EXPLAINING WHY, WHAT, AND
  WHEN. I.E. FFXXX0/011200ZJAN01 OVRRD: 001Y/REPORT AND RAMP
  ATTACHED/REPORT SUBMISSION FAILED, MAJCOM RESEARCH IN PROGRESS,
  EXPECT UPDATE WITHIN 24 HOURS.
  Report submission to HQ USAF SORTS will continue until the unit has been updated in the
  GSORTS database. Non-submission of status reports or reports exceeding 45 days may prompt
  commander notification.
         1.11.4.7.5. (Added-USAFE) Readiness Measures pulls data from the HQ AF SORTS
         Portal every duty day. We check four different categories: Outdated Reports (30+ and
         45+), Outdated Remarks (30+) and Inaccurate Forecast. When Readiness Measures finds
         expired remarks or old data errors in the database, the following actions will be taken.
         First day overdue: Readiness Measures personnel will follow-up with the SRO via voice
         or e-mail. Second day overdue: Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC),
         Readiness Measures will follow-up with the Superintendent. Third day overdue:
         NCOIC, Readiness Measures will contact the Chief of the Command Post directly and an
         e-mail will be sent to the applicable measured unit monitor and the unit commander.
         Fourth day overdue: SROs will submit a report to the Readiness Measures Branch by
         close of business. This report will be prepared according to AFI 10-201, paragraph
         1.11.4.7.4, and the applicable format, with the exception of the words ―MAJCOM
         RESEARCH IN PROGRESS‖. In addition, HQ USAFE/A3 will be notified of units who
         fall in the category of four consecutive days overdue.
            1.11.4.7.5.1. (Added-USAFE) The data that is pulled daily is averaged and
            weighted to equitably compare each wing. Readiness Measures compiles the data
            and builds the 6-month SORTS statistics. The program standings are sent to all
            Wing Commanders (Wing/CC). This data provides commanders a snapshot of
26                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


            their wings standing amongst the rest of the command and provide a competitive
            benchmark for use in individual and unit awards programs and for personal
            recognition from wing leadership and MAJCOM staff.
     1.11.4.8. Develop reporting procedures for units geographically separated from home station
     without transfer of Subordinate Reporting Organization (SRO) responsibility.
     1.11.4.9. Ensure wing/base reporting units submit SORTS reports using required software.
     AFSORTSDET will be used until replacement is developed. Download the latest
     AFSORTSDET          version     and      patch     from    either      the     classified
     (http://c2www.af.pentagon.smil.mil/xooa) or the                              unclassified
     (http://www.xo.hq.af.mil/xoo/xooa)web page.
     1.11.4.10. Monitor the reporting status of deployed units. Provide assistance as required.
     1.11.4.11. Assist in the preparation and coordination of SORTS DOC Statements ensuring

1.12. SORTS Report Error Messages and Troubleshooting Actions. Errors detected in a
unit’s SORTS report or the headquarters database must be corrected and resubmitted within 24
hours of receipt of a RAMP reporting errors or upon discovery that an error exists in the
database.
   1.12.1. If a reporting unit fails to receive a RAMP message within 72 hours of report, notify
   the parent MAJCOM as soon as possible seeking resolution. HQ USAF will assist in difficult
   or confusing cases.
   1.12.2. Reference Table 1.2, ―SORTS Joint Report AF (SORTSREPAF) Trouble-shooting,‖
   for possible corrective actions to format and logical edit errors. Table contains information
   on common errors but is not all-inclusive.
1.13. SORTS Message Sequence Counter Number.
   1.13.1. Unit SORTS and/or CBDRT reports will be sequentially numbered 001-999.
   Although transcribed in AFSORTSDET as a seemingly singular report, SORTS and CBDRT
   reports are counted separately. Counters will not be restarted for fiscal or calendar years.
       1.13.1.1. When SROs are transmitting single, multiple-part, SORTS messages, the
       counter should be bumped forward to allow the next report in the series to process to
       avoid unnecessary delays.
       1.13.1.2. Only Air Staff or MAJCOM SORTS agencies may request Defense
       Information Systems Agency (DISA) bump the GSORTS message processor counter.
       DISA will coordinate with appropriate headquarters prior to making the change. Any
       additional notifications will be made, as required.
   1.13.2. When units are experiencing difficulties with their message sequence numbers,
   CROs, may use the GSORTS OVERRIDE feature to override the normal sequencing of
   message traffic. Users are responsible for the consequences of overriding.
       1.13.2.1. OVERRIDE message numbering will be sequential (e.g., 001Y, 002Y, 003Y).
       Non-sequential OVERRIDE reporting is not authorized under any circumstance.
       1.13.2.2. Units choosing to use OVERRIDE message sequencing will take immediate
       corrective action on any errors that occur as a result of out of sequence message
       processing.

                                            Chapter 2

            REPORTING CATEGORY LEVEL (C-LEVEL) DATA ELEMENTS

Section 2A—Measured Categories and General Rules

2.1. General Resource Relationship to Unit Combat Preparedness. C-levels are developed
by the JS and derived through quantitative criteria to define in qualitative terms, the degree to
which a measured unit is capable of performing the wartime mission(s) for which it was
organized and designed. C-levels provide clarity of resource status to advise the Secretary of
Defense, unified commands, and the Services on current force readiness.
   2.1.1. C-levels collectively represent, via a five point scale, the degree to which a unit meets
   standards established within four measured resource areas: 1) personnel, 2) training, 3)
   equipment and supplies O/H, and 4) equipment condition, plus an Overall C-level assigned
   by the measured unit commander.
   2.1.2. While the JCS require only the Overall and measured area C-levels, the AF requires
   units to report actual raw data percentages in each measured area. This gives a crisis
   decision-maker and resource or training manager more detailed status than the C-levels alone
   indicate.
2.2. When To Use This Chapter. Command echelons, above measured units, use this chapter
to ensure C-level data is relayed without change or delay and to comment on its content when
appropriate. Measured units and below will use chapter sections as follows:
   2.2.1. Section 2A. Used to calculate values for C-level data elements and gather data for the
   preparation/transmission of properly formatted SORTS reports.
   2.2.2. Section 2B. Used to gather source document data (see paragraph 2.9 and Table 2.2),
   identify Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC), formulate detailed narratives and forecast changes in
   Overall C-levels, and verify correct reporting of narrative remarks.
      2.2.3. Section 2C. Used to report AF SPECAP data.
2.3. General Policy for C-level Calculations.
   2.3.1. CJCS policy requires all Active, ANG, and AF Reserve operating force and
   provisional combat, combat support, and combat service support units apportioned to or
   deployed in support of an OPLAN, CONPLAN, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03,
   or service war planning documents, e.g. WMP and AFWUS, be designated as SORTS
   reporting measured units. Unit types listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.1 through A2.4, are
   required to report SORTS. Additional unit types identified are necessary for crisis planning
   whether or not those units are currently tasked in plans. The following policy guidelines
   apply to all reporting units:
         2.3.1.1. Two units will not count the same resource as available.
         2.3.1.2. A unit’s Overall C-level will be based only on the resources and training organic
         (assigned, allocated, or direct support) to it or its parent unit. Mobile or transportable
         communications units may include those resources on loan that can be re-deployed within
         the reported unit’s SORTS DOC Statement response time.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                   51


       2.3.1.3. Units calculate and report area levels (P, S, R, and T) for all four measured
       resource areas unless exempted by Table 2.1 Use only published objective criteria for
       measurement. Do not subjectively raise or lower measured resource area levels.
       2.3.1.4. Only measured unit commanders, or their designated alternates, can assign the
       unit’s Overall C-level. Unless factors like those listed in Chapter 4, paragraph 1.10.8,
       warrant a level change, report the lowest of the four measured levels as the Overall C-
       level.
       2.3.1.5. Command echelons, above the measured unit, will not change any reported
       levels or delay the submission of a report. The command echelon may submit additional
       remarks to comment on reported levels or describe assistance actions.
       2.3.1.6. Units not reporting a C-1 in all areas must clearly indicate the reason(s). Refer to
       Section 2B, paragraph 2.11, for specific remark content requirements.
2.4. Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. CJCS policy requires unit C-level
changes to reach the National Military Command Center (NMCC) within 24 hours after a
reportable event or upon direction of the CJCS, the Services, or CRO. GSORTS is the readiness
reporting system for the NMCC. AF units will report C-level changes within 24 hours of the
change for each SORTS DOC Statement. Report when there are changes in the Overall C-level,
Overall Reason Code, measured area levels, measured area reason codes, PCTEF, D, E, F, and G
reason codes (DEFG), GWD updates, forecast dates, or when directed by the measured unit
commander. If a unit is committed to combat operations (i.e., located in a combat zone), report
C-level data as described above or at the frequency and level of detail as directed by the CJCS.
   2.4.1. SORTS measured units will verify and update data elements listed in this chapter
   every 28-30 days or more frequently if specifically directed. Unless otherwise authorized by
   HQ USAF SORTS, databases will never be older than 31 days from the last report based on
   the RICDA date. Units and/ or their designated SROs must ensure that submitted reports
   process. Units will verify GSORTS database accuracy via receiving error-free RAMP and
   subsequent SORTS Database Review messages. Units will compare reports submitted
   against their database reviews (or equivalent products), and ensure that non-receipt of a
   RAMP or review within 72 hours (since time of report transmittal) is reported to the CRO for
   assistance. Units and/or SROs failing to meet listed timing criteria are in direct violation of
   AFI 10-201 and CJCSM 3150.02.
       2.4.1.1. Units will continue to report SORTS when TDY for training, when deployed
       (e.g., Red Flag, natural disaster, crisis, OPORD, Deployment Order (DEPORD),
       Expeditionary Aerospace Force/Air Expeditionary Force (EAF/AEF), etc.), or when
       involved in local training (base phase exercises, inspections, etc.).
       2.4.1.2. Secondary and Tertiary Mission data will be reported using the same timelines
       as Primary Mission data.
       2.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. The unit
       commander is responsible for meeting the reporting timelines. Reports must also be sent,
       updating the GSORTS database within 24 hours, when the 3/6/12-month forecast
       changes, data expires, to include GWD or upon direction from USAFE Readiness
       Measures. Reports must not be held up in order to submit within the monthly USAFE
       reporting window or until a scheduled brief to wing/group commanders is conducted.
 52                                AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


         2.4.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Measured units will submit monthly SORTS reports updating all
         required unit data beginning on the 20th at 0001Z, with all reports updated in the GSORTS
         database not later than 25th at 2359Z of each month. SRO must request a waiver from the
         USAFE Readiness Measures Office prior to 2359Z if they cannot submit reports within the
         established timeline.
      2.4.2. Submit data to the appropriate labels in AFSORTSDET and a new report date in the
      RICDA field (Primary Mission) or Date of Change of Subarea Category Information (RICDF)
      (Secondary or Tertiary Missions). Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96
      hours of the oldest individual unit report RICDA.
      2.4.3. Report major equipment relocation(s) using the MEQLOCN set upon partial unit
      deployment or unit relocation. The reporting of all fields of the MEQLOCN set pertaining to
      operational ready status of aircraft and mission-ready status of crews will reflect the resources
      available within the applicable response times. See Attachment 5 for further guidance.
   2.4.4. CROs will report changes in unit location.
   2.4.5. CROs will submit waiver requests for reporting requirements or changes to reporting
   frequency through HQ USAF SORTS to the JS. Units submit their waiver requests through their
   respective MAJCOM FAM to the CRO.
   2.4.6. If there is no change to a unit’s status since their last report and a new report is due, show
   that data has been reviewed and is current by submitting a report consisting of the unit’s
   AFSORTSDET Overall Page with the RICDA and all remarks reflecting an updated date.
   2.4.7. INFO address all AUTODIN/DMS reports to ―HQ USAF SORTS REPORTS
   WASHINGTON DC//.‖ There is no requirement to submit an info copy when using File Transfer
   Protocol (FTP) to deliver messages to the GSORTS processor.
   2.4.8. CJCS policy allows assignment of overall status as of the report time or projection of
   status within the response time of up to 72 hours. Air Force units will report expected C-level
   status within the SORTS DOC Statement response time. The SORTS report will reflect the
   resources that are expected to be available within the DOC response time. Units can assume the
   following:
         2.4.8.1. The unit is in its actual deployed posture as dictated by current situation and
         existing JCS tasking orders. If committed to a smaller scale contingency, units may be
         released to refit and re-deploy to fill their full wartime mission set. Generally, units
         consider deployed resources to be available for their full wartime mission set (see para
         2.8).
         2.4.8.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled
         maintenance/routine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift
         length.
         2.4.8.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change
         from current projections.
2.5. Forecasting Overall C-level Changes. Use this set whenever the Overall C-level is not a
―1‖, is an assessed Overall C-level (C-1X), a C-level change is predicted, or when the Forecast
Date of Change (CADAT) expires. If concrete indications of an impending change in the unit’s
Overall C-level exist, forecast what C-level the unit will change to (up or down) and the date the
unit will change C-levels. Units coordinate with their MAJCOMS for any assistance needed.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                   53


  2.5.1. When a unit forecasts a change in its C-level, the unit must report both the Forecast
  Change Rating (CARAT) for Primary DOCs and the Forecast Subarea Change Rating (CARAF)
  for Secondary or Tertiary DOCs. Units must also report the estimated CADAT (Primary) and the
  Forecast Subarea Date of Change (CADAF) (Secondary or Tertiary). When a unit reports
  degraded C-levels and it is unable to forecast a change date, the responsible MAJCOM must
  provide the unit assistance to determine a best estimate forecast for insertion into the SORTS
  report. Forecasts are not required for units reporting C-1 that expect no change. If the reporting
  unit commander assesses the Overall C-level up to C-1X, the reporting unit must also report a
  CARAT and CADAT. The CARAT and CADAT fields must be updated every time a SORTS
  report is submitted.
     2.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) When unit commanders are unable to obtain a Forecast Date of
     Change (CADAT) or determine a GWD, they will ensure the responsible USAFE FAMs is
     contacted for assistance. Note: To Be Determined (TBD) and Unknown (UNK) are not to be
     used as substitutes for GWD.
  2.5.2. Forecast Remark. In addition to the CARAT and CADAT field information, a minimum of
  once every 30 days, unit commanders will provide a C-level forecast at 3, 6, and 12 months in a
  remark under the CADAT label. The remark will forecast the C-level at 3, 6, and 12-month
  points in time reflecting same number of forecasted days added to the RICDA date of the report.
  Fill in the AFSORTSDET Overall SORTS page following the example format below:
     2.5.2.1. Format the C-level forecasts as:
   (date) 3 MONTH FORECAST/2/P/P06/PERSONNEL PERMANENT
   CHANGE OF
   STATION (PCS) WITH NO REPLACEMENTS TRAINED
   6 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
   12 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
     2.5.2.2. Units desiring to report additional dates or information concerning forecasts may
     do so using a free-text remark. Remarks of this type are in addition to forecast comments
     and may be added immediately following the 12-month CADAT remark or by selecting
     the CADAT label from the remarks listing.
     2.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Commander’s Assessments will not be used in the Forecast
     Change Rating (CARAT) or in the CADAT Remark. The CARAT and the 3/6/12-month
     forecast levels need to reflect what the unit’s actual overall C-Level will be, given the
     current measured area levels and their corresponding GWDs. Forecasts must be based on
     concrete indications of an impending change in the unit’s C-level such as actual arrival
     and departure dates of personnel, or actual dates when equipment items are scheduled for
     maintenance. An explanation addressing expected shortfalls must accompany the 3/6/12-
     month forecasts. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format the CADAT Remark.
     2.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) When a unit is an overall C-1 and is forecasting less than a C-
     1 in any of the 3/6/12-month forecast, a corresponding remark is required to be submitted
     using the appropriate Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level For Personnel Not
     C-1 (PRRES), Primary Reason Equipment and Supplies On Hand Not C-1 (ESRES),
     Primary Reason Equipment Condition Category Level Not C-1 (ERRES), or Primary
     Reason Training Resource Area Not C-1 (TRRES) label.

2.6. Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC). Within the scope of SORTS reporting, remarks must be
created to address any LIMFAC (unit problem) that affects the unit’s ability to accomplish its
wartime mission. A LIMFAC is a problem, deficiency, or condition that decreases or prevents a unit
from accomplishing its wartime mission, and which usually requires assistance from higher
headquarters to resolve. Issues of LIMFAC will be reported under the Current Overall Category
Level (READY) label. In addition to the READY remark, some LIMFAC may require that they be
reported using a remark label for the SORTS area affected and considered when assigning unit C-
levels (SORTS LIMFAC). SORTS LIMFAC may be reflected in the four measured resource area C-
levels, but may be reported throughout a unit’s SORTS report. Examples of SORTS LIMFAC
include; critical AFSC and equipment shortages, problems with aircrew training, personnel
experience levels, Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and In-Place Readiness Spares
Package (IRSP) pacing item shortages, etc.
   2.6.1. Units experiencing a LIMFAC that they feel is not reportable in SORTS but requires
   higher headquarters direction will report in accordance with MAJCOM directives.
   2.6.2. LIMFAC impacting the unit’s ability to accomplish its mission(s) are classified at the
   level of the information contained per applicable directives. If no other directive governs the
   classification, the SORTS classification guidance applies.
2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field. PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of the
unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontraditional mission. When employed in support of a
nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF. PCTEF reporting is required upon receipt of
an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland Defense or Homeland Security
missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick reaction force and/or
ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement operations, humanitarian
assistance, consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil distrubance operations, and
natural disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting missions). In some cases, a unit
executing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its wartime tasks in support of that
nontraditional mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing support to a natural disaster relief
operation). In those cases, commanders will use their discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is
required.
   2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the
   unit is currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s
   assessment against this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to
   assess the unit’s ability to execute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s
   C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8).
   2.7.2. When conditions for reporting PCTEF exist, home station units (SORTS reporting
   units only), who own the deployed resource(s) will begin reporting PCTEF upon assignment
   of a mission and issuance of a deployment warning order. Regardless of order receipt,
   PCTEF reporting commences no later than the deployment date and continues until unit
   mission requirements are changed or no longer exist.
       2.7.2.1. Units with multiple tasked or assigned deployment missions will reflect PCTEF
       ratings of the lowest assessed mission accompanied by the unit commander's remarks.
       2.7.2.2. Units will not report individual (single person) deployment tasking in PCTEF.
       2.7.2.3. Use the following definitions to report the commander’s estimate of unit ability
       to undertake one or more assigned missions for which the unit must deploy:
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                   55


           2.7.2.3.1. Report a PCTEF level of 1 ('1' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake the full mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.2. Report a PCTEF level of 2 ('2' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake most of the mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.3. Report a PCTEF level of 3 ('3' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the
           required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all portions of the
           mission(s) assigned mission.
           2.7.2.3.4. Report a PCTEF level of 4 ('4' in PCTEF field) if the unit requires
           additional resources or training to undertake the current mission(s) assigned. It may
           be directed to undertake portions of the current assigned mission with resources O/H.
           2.7.2.3.5. When no other requirement exists to report data in this field enter a
           question mark "?" to completely remove a previously reported entry.
           2.7.2.3.6. (Added-USAFE) If a unit is reporting Effectiveness Percentage (PCTEF)
           (1), see Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an example of how to format the remark.
   2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain
   text under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.)
   current status, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness
   condition for assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased effectiveness
due to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking cannot be fully supported
due to shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h, equipment condition, and/or training).
To alleviate the situation on (area), the unit will (action). Get well date (gwd) is estimated to be
(date). Estimated departure/return date is (date).
2.8. Policy for Units with Deployed Resources. When assets of a measured unit are deployed
(partially deployed), the parent unit will normally report status on these resources in its C-level.
   2.8.1. When part of a unit is deployed in support of an operation you may count resources as
   available under the following conditions:
       2.8.1.1. For units with mobility only or a dual, in-place generation and mobility
       mission(s): if they are capable of being ready to redeploy from their current location
       within the DOC response time.
       2.8.1.2. For units with an in-place generation mission: if they are capable of redeploying
       to their home station and generating within response time. Generally units with in-place
       generation missions will not be able to redeploy to home station and generate within their
       response time.
       2.8.1.3. Regardless of gaining or losing resources, if the unit reports less than C-1, enter
       the reason under the SECRN label and use remarks to emphasize increase or reduction in
       required and assigned resources because of deployment to build up or augment resources.
       When resources partially deployed are counted as available (could be redeployed within
       response time), see the expanded reason codes in Table 2.6.
       2.8.1.4. Expanded reason codes D, E, F, or G (DEFG) will be used to reflect the
       commander’s assessment of the percent of unit deployable capability that is currently
 56                                AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


       deployed. This information is used to assess risk of resources not being made available to
       redeploy. Refer to Table 2.6 for an explanation of these expanded reason codes.
       2.8.1.5. Supported CCs require readiness information specific to a unit’s ability to meet
       employment tasking. Therefore, MAJCOMs must ensure their deployed units meet the
       supported commanders’ information needs through utilization of unit commander
       assessments of PCTEF.
   2.8.2. HQ USAF/XOOA, in coordination with the JS, will decide, on a case-by-case basis, the
   extent of reporting for units deployed to operate; in a stand-alone capacity; as a temporary or
   provisional unit; and units which transfer, loan, or supplement personnel or supplies (e.g.,
   resources turned in to personnel or supply system) from several units to form a temporary or
   provisional unit.

      Available (TPAVL) fields, respectively.
      2.10.2.4. Critical Personnel Required/Authorized (CPAUR), Assigned (CPASG), and
      Available (CPAVL) fields, respectively.
   2.10.3. Chapter 4, also AFMAN 23-110, ―USAF Supply Manual,‖ Volume II, Part Two,
   Chapter 26 (WRM information), use for SORTS procedures to check the Equipment and
   Supplies O/H Category Level (S-level) data elements:
      2.10.3.1. S-Level and its reason code in the Measured Resource Area Level for
      Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAT) and Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level
      for Equipment/Supplies O/H Not C-1 (ESRES) fields.
      2.10.3.2. Combat essential and support equipment O/H percentages in the Equipment
      and Supplies O/H Measured Area Combat Essential Equipment Percentage (EQSEE) and
      Support Equipment Percentage (EQSSE) fields.
      2.10.3.3. Any of the 1 through 9 subarea fields in the individual ESSA percentages.
      2.10.3.4. Aircraft units, report the Major Equipment Authorized/Required under
      (MEARD), Assigned (MEASG), and Possessed (MEPOS) fields, respectively.
   2.10.4. Chapter 5, use to check Equipment Condition Category Level (R-level) data
   elements:
 58                               AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


         2.10.4.1. R-Level and its reason code in the Measured Resource Area Level for
         Equipment Condition (ERRAT) and Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level for
         Equipment Condition Not C-1 (ERRES) fields.

         (TRSA) percentages 1 through 5 fields, as per Chapter 6.
2.11. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of SORTS and are
required whenever a measured resource subarea percentage drives a measured area level less than 1,
i.e., P-1 (Personnel), S-1 (Equipment), R-1 (Equipment Condition) or T-1 (Training)/(See Table 2.4,
Remarks Guidance Matrix). Remarks will progressively highlight problem areas for each individual
label regardless of whether the reported percentage is the actual driver of the measured area level,
e.g., a unit has equipment and supplies problems in ESSA3 and equipment condition problems
reported in ERSA2 and ERSA4. First an individual remark will be written for each one of these
labels. Then a remark, in some cases the same, will be listed in the next higher label of both areas.
IAW the above that would be the ESRES and ERRES labels. For the ESRES the same ESSA3
remark will be used. For the ERRES a combination of the ERSA2 and ERSA4 labels will be added.
Lastly, a compilation of all the labels remarked on (ESSA3, ERSA2, ERSA4, ESRES, and ERRES)
will be given in the REASN label. Remarks will be written in conjunction with the following:
   2.11.1. Use remarks to give supplemental information concerning unit Overall C-level, or
   measured area level, and SORTS LIMFAC. Remarks must be checked and verified for accuracy
   each time any portion of a report is submitted. Revise content and remark date as necessary to
   maintain validity. Remove remarks that no longer apply. If no change in content, revise the
   remark date to prevent it from exceeding 30 days from the last revision or when a full report or a
   partial report that contains remarks is submitted. Remarks will never be more than 31 days old.
         2.11.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Remarks will be used to explain deficiencies and corrective
         actions. Generic entries are not authorized. Remarks will be directly related to deficiencies
         in the UTCs and mission narrative listed in the unit’s DOC Statement. The overall purpose
         of remarks is to highlight DOC Statement capability deficiencies as well as explicit
         description of what portions of the DOC Statement mission, which the unit can accomplish,
         to include a narrative and extent of the missions able to be accomplished. Remarks
         considered by the SRO, Command Reporting Organization (CRO), or FAM as inadequate,
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                59


     ambiguous, or not in compliance with AFI 10-201 and USAFE guidance will be corrected by
     the reporting unit and resubmitted into the GSORTS database within 24 hours of notification.
     2.11.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Remarks may be used at any time to provide supplemental
     information. Do not refer to previous messages or remarks under other labels. Each
     GWD must specifically state what level that GWD is for (i.e. GWD to C-2 is 20 Jun 06,
     or GWD to P-3 is 01 Dec 06). All GWD must be in the ―DDMMMYY‖ format. All
     acronyms must be spelled out when they are first used within each remark.
     Abbreviations may not be used at anytime throughout the SORTS reports. Air Force
     Specialty Code (AFSC) listings must contain the job title of each AFSC. Remarks
     considered inadequate or ambiguous will be corrected by the reporting unit and
     resubmitted into the database within 24 hours.
  2.11.2. As previously described, progressively report on each label requiring a remark.
  SORTS customers often selectively retrieve specific pieces of data from the database and
  need to know the location of the remark that explains the data they retrieve. Write remarks in
  plain English. Acronyms must be defined in each remark area in which it is used. Additional
  uses of a defined acronym in the same remark may reflect only the acronym. As SORTS is
  dynamic and remarks may change from report to report, do not refer to previous message
  numbers. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks (e.g. See REASN remark), each
  remark must stand on its own content or it will defeat the specific data retrieval programs. In
  general, list resource types with their problems. State numbers required, assigned, and
  available, explain the cause of the problem, if known, identify previously requested
  assistance and remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required, and supply a
  date of expected change for better or worse (see 2.11.5 for GWD specifics).
  2.11.3. Remarks must contain a layperson’s explanation of the problem and its mission
  impact for customers to understand the unit's situation. Remarks must also contain a detailed
  functional explanation of the situation to provide details needed for functional management.
     2.11.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Use the Critical Personnel - Available (CPAVL) Remark to
     submit information concerning AFSC substitutions. See Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an
     example of how to format the remark.
     2.11.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Use the Aircrews Formed (CREWF) Remark to submit
     information concerning aircrew assigned but not formed. See Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an
     example of how to format the remark.
  2.11.4. Explain unit and wing actions taken to resolve shortcomings. State if, and what kind
  of, higher headquarters action is needed.
  2.11.5. Provide a realistic GWD for each shortfall or problem in each remark. Use the day,
  month and year (DDMMMYY) date format, i.e. 01JAN02. If GWD is Unknown, contact the
  applicable MAJCOM FAM for assistance in establishing a GWD.
     2.11.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Remarks must be used to detail any GWD that change from
     the previous month. Remarks will accompany the current remarks GWD and include
     rational why the GWD changed. Examples of rational are ―shipment delayed a month‖,
     ―forecasted inbound cancelled, no new inbound scheduled until 2004‖, or ―small arms
     training cancelled this month, awaiting rescheduling‖.

  2.11.6. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed. Each
  remark can be up to 5000 characters long.
     2.11.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Use Table 2.4. (Added) to format remarks. This table is not all-
     inclusive. Other remarks may be required to clarify specific deficiencies (see AFI 10-201,
     local supplement to AFI 10-201, and related guidance messages for further formatting
     instructions).
     2.11.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Before addressing an outside organization in remarks, be sure to
     coordinate the specific remark with that organization to ensure accuracy and currency of the
     remark. For example, before submitting a remark stating you are waiting for supplies on
     order or waiting for delivery of a vehicle from transportation, check with the Logistics
     Readiness Squadron (LRS) for current status.
  2.11.7. For the Personnel area, explain the following areas:
     2.11.7.1. Write a remark using the PRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Personnel Not C-1 (PRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) to
     discuss the personnel area when less then P-1.
     2.11.7.2. When directed to include DoD civilian employees (contractors will not be
     measured) in P-level measurements, report total and critical numbers authorized, assigned,
     and available in a remark using the PRRES label. When commander-assessing the Overall C-
     level, if the availability of any non-measured contract personnel or assigned DoD personnel
     are used to support that assessment, factor in the non-availability of those who are obligated
     to the reserve components during crisis or wartime. Describe the services they would have
     provided in a remark using the PRRES label. Contract employee availability due to labor
     action or failure to perform impacting mission should also be explained in detail.
     2.11.7.3. UTC/UMD mismatches exist when one or more of the following conditions occur:
     UTC requirements exceed UMD authorizations or UTC skill and/or grades cannot be
     matched after all authorized substitutions have been considered. When UTC/UMD
     mismatches reflect a shortage in any AFSC, identify shortfalls in a remark in the PRRAT
     label by listing each involved; UTC, AFSC, number of personnel required by UTC, and
     number of personnel authorized by UMD. To identify shortfalls, compare the most current
     UTC as indicated on the SORTS DOC Statement with the most current UMD authorizations.
     Compare these documents for mismatches. A comparison report is available through the
     Wing Manpower Office upon request. In the event of UTC/ UMD mismatches, see
     paragraph 3.6.1 for measurement calculation requirements.
     2.11.7.4. Regardless of P-level, if personnel shortages exist, identify them in a remark using
     the PERTP label by listing each involved; AFSC, number of personnel authorized or
     required, assigned, available, in upgrade training (UGT), the identifying personnel reason
     code (PRC), corrective actions, and a GWD for each; ―AFSC/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL
     /UGT/PRC.‖ Include a discussion of action(s) taken to resolve the problem. Use Chapter 3,
     Table 3.5, to indicate applicable PRCs.
         2.11.7.4.1. (Added-USAFE) When the Total Personnel Percentage (PERTP) label is
         used, do not completely re-list the same information under the PRRES label. The
         purpose of the PERTP Remark is to sufficiently characterize AFSC shortage numbers
         along with individual AFSC GWD.
  2.11.8. For the Equipment and Supplies O/H area, explain the following:
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                   61


     2.11.8.1. Write a remark using the ESRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Equipment and Supplies Not C-1 (ESREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions) when equipment and supplies O/H is less than S-1. Ensure each subarea field,
     reflecting a percentage of ―less than 90%,‖ is described in the associated remark label; e.g.,
     ESSA4. Ensure remarks accurately reflect the specified reason code (Table 4.5) and contain
     all pertinent details such as readiness driver national stock number (NSN), item data, get-well
     date, kit serial number (as applicable), on-hand versus authorized quantities, POC, etc.
     Remarks for each allowance standard equipment shortage resulting in a LIMFAC must
     contain the NSN, quantity short, allowance source code (ASC), equipment account number,
     and an account custodian POC.
        2.11.8.1.1. If Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) pods O/H and mission ready are
        less than 90 percent, provide a remark on ECM pod status using the ESSA4 label.
        2.11.8.1.2. The status of medical WRM project codes not reported in subareas are
        provided using the ESRES label. No remarks are required other than the project code
        and percent filled from the Stock Status Report (i.e., BA: 67%).
     2.11.8.2. Write a remark using the Major Equipment Possessed (MEPSD) label to
     account for a flying unit’s aircraft assigned but not possessed. Report the number of
     assigned backup aircraft inventory (BAI) aircraft total, the tail number and location of
     aircraft in programmed depot maintenance (PDM), on loan to or from another unit, and
     estimated return date(s).
        2.11.8.2.1. Using AFSORTSDET, format the aircraft summary narrative according to
        the example below:
        (date) AIRCRAFT SUMMARY
        AUTHORIZED 16, ASSIGNED 10, POSSESSED 7
        TAIL / LOCATION/ REASON      / ESTIMATED RETURN DATE
        00452 / MBPB   / PDM        / 23JAN03
         80217 / MBPB          / SPEEDLINE / 23SEP02


        2.11.8.2.2. In the aircraft summary, UAV units will report the number of systems
        authorized, assigned and possessed.
     2.11.8.3. In a RICDA remark, report mobility A-bags (general use) and B-bags (cold
     weather), see AFMAN 23-110 for a list of minimum compositions. Remark will be
     formatted as follows:
      (Date) MOBILITY BAGS
      TYPE           AUTH/REQ                ONHAND
      A-BAG               10                    10


        2.11.8.3.1. (Added-USAFE) In Date of Change of Category Information (RICDA)
        Remarks, report mobility A-Bags (general-use) and B-bags (cold weather) according
62                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


         to Table 2.4.1. (Added) and indicate the status of shortages. If bags are centrally
         stored in one location (i.e. LRS), then include remarks.
         2.11.8.3.2. (Added-USAFE) USAFE ground crew bags will contain the assets and
         quantities specified in AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1., Full Spectrum Threat Response
         (FSTR) Planning and Operations.
  2.11.9. For the Equipment Condition area, explain the following:
     2.11.9.1. Write a remark using the ERRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Area Level for Equipment Condition Not C-1 (ERREF) for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions) when equipment and supplies condition is less than R-1. Ensure each subarea
     field reflecting a percentage ―less than 90% ‖ status is described in the associated remark
     label; e.g., ERSA4.
     2.11.9.2. Additionally, aircraft units will provide explanatory remarks for conditions less
     than 75 percent in the ERRES label.
  2.11.10. For the Training area, identify the primary cause of training program limitations.
     2.11.10.1. Write a remark using the TRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource
     Subarea Level for Training Not C-1 (TRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when the
     training condition is less than T-1. Write remarks for each subarea reported as less than 85%;
     e.g., TRSA1 for units using Method C, Option 1 or 2.
     2.11.10.2. Regardless of training method and option, when multiple subareas are less than T-
     1, summarize problems in a remark using the TRRES and/or TRREF labels. Ensure each
     subarea field reflecting a ―less than T-1‖ status is described in an individual label remark,
     also regardless of method used.
     2.11.10.3. When current or forecast Air Education and Training Command (AETC) formal
     training school allocation deficiencies exist, write a remark using the TRRAT label. Begin
     the narrative remark with ―AETC:‖ followed by the deficiency short title, and continue with a
     detailed summary of current or future deficiency, the current status or action taken to resolve
     the deficiency, additional actions required, and the impact on the unit’s ability to undertake
     its wartime mission. Using AFSORTSDET, format the AETC formal training school
     allocation deficiency narrative according to the example below:
      (date) AETC: (list short title deficiency or future requirement)
      CURRENT STATUS/ACTION
      ADDITIONAL ACTIONS
      IMPACT ON UNIT
      FUTURE REQUIREMENT(S)
     2.11.10.4. When required, CE units report the last date the unit attended Silver Flag
     Training using the TRSA3 remark label.
  2.11.11. Overall C-level data must be explained in a REASN label remark (Overall Reason
  Unit Subarea is Not C-1 (REASF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions). The remark should
  summarize problems in sufficient detail to ascertain unit readiness and prompt review of
  specific measured area remarks. The following situational examples would require a remark:
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                   63


      2.11.11.1. Which mission(s) the unit cannot fully support or undertake when its Overall C-
      level is less than C-1.
      2.11.11.2. The commander’s rationale, supporting a subjectively assessed C-level and area(s)
      where the commander disagrees with the measured area C-level.
      2.11.11.3. The programmed or estimated date the unit will again be able to undertake its
      major wartime mission if less than C-1 or after undergoing a major equipment conversion or
      transition.
      2.11.11.4. The deactivation date planned for the unit. If within one year of deactivation, do
      not list personnel shortages unless specifically instructed to do so by the MAJCOM.
      2.11.11.5. When a unit fails an ORI or NSI, consider a commander assessed downgrade to
      the unit’s Overall C-level until the deficiency causing the unsatisfactory rating is resolved.
      Units may assume successful re-inspection; when it is required and the inspection team
      provides applicable dates. Provide remarks to explain the condition in the REASN and/or
      REASF labels.
   2.11.12. Using the RICDA label, all SORTS reporting units will include a written remark in each
   Primary, Secondary, and/or Tertiary database supplying the full rank and name of their primary
   and alternate SORTS monitors. Minimum entry will include contact telephone number(s) and e-
   mail address(s). Current DOC Statement date will be included as the final line of text.
   EXAMPLE: SORTS MONITORS FOR THE 123XFW ARE PRIMARY TSGT JOHN DOE.
   ALTERNATES SSGT JANE DOE AND A1C MAY JUNE. DSN 999-8888/ 7777. E-MAIL
   123XFW@EXAMPLE.AF.MIL. Current DOC Statement date: DDMMMYY.
2.12. Overall Reason Codes.
   2.12.1. Assigning a Primary Reason Code (PRC). Units must report a reason code against
   the Overall C-level using the reason codes in Table 2.5, unless reporting C-1. When
   partially deployed, use DEFG (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use of PRCs).
   2.12.2. Reporting a PRC. The PRC will be entered in the REASN and/or REASF fields.
      2.12.2.1. When the Overall C-Level is less than C-1, pick that resource area most
      affecting the lowered C-Level. Use P for personnel, S for equipment and supplies O/H, R
      for equipment condition, and T for training.
      2.12.2.2. If the Overall C-Level (14) is changed by commander assessment the X reason
      code will be used. See paragraph 2.13 for supporting reason codes.
          2.12.2.2.1. If the Overall C-level is based on commander assessment of partial
          deployment capability, up or down, the X reason code will be used under the REASN
          remark label and the DEFG will be placed in the SECRN field. Detailed deployment
          remarks under the REASN remark label will be included to reflect DEFG, the
          percentage of the unit’s deployable capability that is currently deployed, and the
          rationale for the commander’s change to the calculated C-Level.
          2.12.2.2.2. If the Overall C-level is based solely on measured area calculations
          (REASN not X and not C-1) and the unit is partially deployed P, S, R, or T will be
          placed in REASN and the DEFG as described below will be placed in the SECRN
          field. A detailed explanation will be included under the REASN remark label. Using
          AFSORTSDET, format the reason summary narrative according the example below:
 64                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


            (date) PARTIAL UNIT DEPLOYMENT
            REASON CODE (E)/6 F-16 DEPLOYED TO BASE X FOR OPERATION ABC; 1
            60K
            AIRCRAFT LOADER AND 2 10K ALL-TERRAIN FORKLIFTS DEPLOYED TO
            BASE Y
            FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS; 16 SECURITY PERSONNEL
            DEPLOYED TO BASE Z FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS.
       2.12.2.3. If the Overall C-Level is C-1, there is no partial deployment reflected (no
       DEFG needed), and one or more of the resource areas are not measured (reported as code
       6), the 6 reason code will be used. No remarks are required for a 6 reason code.
       2.12.2.4. If the Overall C-Level is capped by AF FAMs, (i.e., due to resource allocation)
       below C-1, enter the maximum level possible in the Category Level Limitation (LIM)
       label for primary missions (Category Level Subarea Limitation (LIMF) for secondary or
       tertiary missions) in the CATLIM set. Enter a P, S, R, or T in the Reason for Category
       Level Limitation (RLIM) label for the area most affected by the resource allocation
       (Reason for Category Level Subarea Limitation (RLIMF) label for secondary or tertiary
       missions).
2.13. Assigning a Secondary or Tertiary Reason Code. The Overall C-Level is changed by
the commander, enter X in REASN field and assign a secondary code to explain the primary
reason for the decision to change the C-level (See Table 2.7 for additional clarification on use of
secondary and tertiary reason codes).
   2.13.1. When upgrading, use the codes: PUP for personnel, SUP for equipment and supplies
   O/H, RUP for equipment condition, and TUP for training.
2.13.2. When downgrading, use the applicable reason code in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter
5, and Chapter 6. Do not use PUP, SUP, RUP, or TUP when downgrading.
   2.13.3. SECRN is mandatory if REASN equals X or if Overall is less than 1 and DEFG is
   reported in REASN and/or REASF fields.
   2.13.4. TERRN will be used if REASN equals X and SECRN equals DEFG when READY
   is less than 1 (Tertiary Reason Unit is Not C-1 (TERRF) field for Secondary or Tertiary
   Missions).

Section 2C—Air Force Unique Data

2.14. Special Mission Capability Data. Special mission capabilities are tasks, equipment, and
missions listed in Table 2.3 Generally, they add flexibility to mission accomplishment and
require specialized equipment or training. The SORTS DOC Statement will state which special
mission capabilities to include in C-Level calculations. It will also state where to report data on
up to four specific capabilities. For each special mission capability:

                                           Chapter 3

                          PERSONNEL MEASURED AREA DATA

3.1. Personnel. A critical part of SORTS readiness reporting is the status of the unit’s personnel
resources. Units compute the personnel P-level based on the percentages of total and critical
personnel available to accomplish the unit’s required wartime mission. For units with an in-place
or dual (in place and mobility) wartime mission, personnel wartime requirements are based on
authorized funded positions in their UMDs. For units with mobility only missions, the
requirements are the manpower details of their UTC(s). The following documents are used as
sources for the personnel measured area: MEML, UMD, SORTS Personnel Availability Roster,
and the MANFOR UTC Detail Report from the Manpower Personnel Module Base-Level
(MANPER-B) system. Personnel measurement is limited to US military and specified DoD
civilian personnel. Foreign national military, foreign national civilian, and contractor personnel
are not counted in the measured personnel area. Active duty units will not count ANG and
Reserve personnel unless gained by the unit as a result of mobilization.
   3.1.1. Total Personnel.
       3.1.1.1. TPAUTH for all units is based on the unit’s UMD and/or its DOC required
       UTCs.
           3.1.1.1.1. For units with an in-place generation mission or an in-place generation and
           mobility mission (see unit DOC Statement), the source document for TPAUTH is the
           unit’s UMD. MAJCOMs must provide instructions to their units on how to identify
           wartime-required and funded positions, i.e. a DOC instruction of "Measure and report
           the availability of unit personnel to fill all funded military positions in your UMD.‖
           3.1.1.1.2. For units with a mobility only mission (see unit DOC Statement),
           TPAUTH is the total of the manpower requirements identified in the deployment
           UTC(s) the unit is required to support. Contact the local manpower office for a UTC
           Manpower Detail Report for each UTC.
       3.1.1.2. TPASG is determined by counting all personnel in a unit from the time they
       arrive at the unit until they depart on a PCS, permanent change of assignment (PCA), or
       separate from the Air Force. All personnel are counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC,
       skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number. Units will use a unit
       manpower personnel roster (UMPR) or similar product provided by their CSS or Military
       Personnel Flight (MPF) to determine total assigned personnel. Before preparing the
       SORTS report, the unit SORTS monitor should coordinate with the unit CSS to ensure
       records in the Personnel System are updated and reflect the true status of unit personnel.
       3.1.1.3. TPAVL is determined by calculating the number of TPASG that are available to
       the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see
       paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance). TPAVL are counted regardless of
       AFSC, skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number.
       3.1.1.4. DoD Civilian Personnel can be included in personnel counts when they occupy
       wartime-required positions. Only Emergency Essential (EE) (IAW AFI 10-231, ―Federal
       Civilian Deployment Guide”) and ―Key‖ DoD civilians (IAW AFI 36-507, ―Mobilization
76                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


     of the Civilian Workforce”) are included in calculations in the SORTS personnel area.
     Other DoD civilian and general contractor personnel impacting a unit’s readiness may be
     reported on as part of the commander’s assessment.
         3.1.1.4.1. Do not count civilian personnel in SORTS if they have Reserve or Guard
         commitments during crisis or wartime that can make them subject to recall.
         3.1.1.4.2. MAJCOMs must mark SORTS DOC Statements to include United States
         (US) DoD civilian personnel in the personnel measurement area when they are part of
         the unit’s wartime requirement (either by occupying wartime required authorizations
         and/or as part of the unit’s deployment UTCs). A remark on SORTS DOC Statements
         should indicate if and how a civilian occupation code converts to a military AFSC.
     3.1.1.5. Foreign Local Nationals will not be counted in SORTS due to questionable
     availability during wartime contingencies.
  3.1.2. Critical Personnel.
     3.1.2.1. The reporting of critical personnel is based on the AFSC’s identified by the HQ
     USAF functional area manager as detailed in Table 3.1 Personnel with particular AFSCs
     are considered ―critical‖ if they meet the following criteria:
         3.1.2.1.1. Personnel with AFSC(s) that are essential to fulfilling the unit’s wartime
         mission tasks.
         3.1.2.1.2. Absence of personnel possessing AFSC(s) that would render the unit
         severely deficient or totally unable to execute its wartime mission.
         3.1.2.1.3. AFSC is part of a critically manned career field subject to special
         monitoring.
     3.1.2.2. Officers who have a critical AFSC as their duty or primary AFSC, or enlisted
     who have a critical AFSC as their primary or control AFSC are considered critical.
     3.1.2.3. Enlisted members who are cross training and hold a 3-level control AFSC in
     their new career field present a special circumstance. Those personnel can be counted
     against critical requirements in their former career field so long as they hold the correct
     primary or control AFSC and skill level, their grade meets or exceeds the UMD
     requirement, and their commander determines they are qualified to perform the job.
     3.1.2.4. CPAUR is determined by counting the number of TPAUTH positions that also
     match the AFSC/skill levels listed in Table 3.1.
     3.1.2.5. CPASG is determined by counting the number of critical personnel authorized
     positions that can be filled by a qualified person. To count as qualified, the person must
     have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the required skill level. An officer must have
     the correct duty AFSC and grade and enlisted personnel must have the correct control or
     primary AFSC/skill level compared to the critical position requirement. Critical
     Personnel who are surplus to the unit’s critical personnel requirement in an AFSC will
     not be counted as part of the critical personnel assignment unless they can be used to fill
     a requirement shortage IAW authorized substitutions as defined below:
         3.1.2.5.1. AFSC substitution: AFSC Substitution of critical personnel is only allowed
         when authorized by UTC MISCAP, WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or Functional AFIs.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                77


          3.1.2.5.2. Skill-level substitution: The UTC MISCAP, functional AFIs, or the USAF
          WMP-1 annexes govern authorized skill-level substitutions. Substitutions will only be
          made when authorized! IAW CJCSM 3150.02, critical personnel substitutions must
          have the required AFSC and meet or exceed the skill level required. Commanders
          should review the qualifications of any substitutes to ensure the UTC requirement is
          not degraded. Once review is made, substitutes may be included in critical
          calculations.
      3.1.2.6. CPAVL is determined by calculating the number of CPASG that are available to
      the unit within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see
      paragraph 3.2 for specific availability guidance).
      3.1.2.7. Critical Personnel overages will not be reported in the CPASG and CPAVL data
      fields but may be reported using a remark under the applicable label (CPASG or
      CPAVL).
   3.1.3. Special Provisions for Personnel Counting.
      3.1.3.1. The SORTS DOC Statement must indicate whether DSU personnel must be
      included in the count.
      3.1.3.2. Units with multiple weapon systems will allocate resources to meet the wartime
      requirements of each system.
      3.1.3.3. Personnel TDY or temporarily attached to a measured unit will not be included
      in the gaining unit’s assigned and available numbers.
      3.1.3.4. Total force organizations or units with a joint mission that have multiple service
      personnel assigned, attached or a combination of active duty and reserve component
      personnel will use their respective service or component unit UMD to determine total
      personnel requirements, e.g., a total force wing requires support from the Army, Navy,
      and Air National Guard. The Army operating location (OL) has a UMD of 20 personnel,
      the Navy OL 20 personnel, the ANG unit 100 personnel and the Active Duty unit 150
      personnel, the total requirement is 290. Critical personnel will be assessed using the same
      guidelines based on specific AFSC/MOS requirements listed in the UMD or UTCs
      required to support.
      3.1.3.5. AFRC and NGB personnel attached to an active duty unit, for training purposes,
      will not be included in personnel numbers.
      3.1.3.6. If a unit is assigned a fragmented portion of a UTC (split-tasking), report the
      UTC portion that has been assigned on the unit DOC Statement. Split-tasking will be
      reflected by using a minus sign (-) immediately after the UTC. {example: FFGK5(-)}.
      The portion of the UTC that is assigned, or is not assigned, is then spelled out within the
      Remarks section of the DOC Statement (See Attachment 2 for further DOC Statement
      guidance).
      3.1.3.7. Individual Mobility Augmentees (IMAs) will only be counted when assigned as
      part of a mobilization or Reserve Call-up. Unit’s reporting IMA numbers in their
      personnel area will explain how the IMAs are used under a PRRES label remark.
3.2. Determining Personnel Availability. Unit personnel may be considered available if they
are assigned to the unit and meet one of the following requirements:
 78                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   3.2.1. Are present at home station or can be present within the prescribed unit response time.
   3.2.2. Are at a deployed location and can be ready to redeploy within the unit response time.
   3.2.3. Are not restricted from deploying or employing with the unit (this is for units with a
   mobility mission).
   3.2.4. Are counted if their duty status/availability code(s), on a SORTS Personnel
   Availability Roster and the Duty Status Roster, match those from AFI 10-403, and the
   commander determines them available where appropriate. Personnel having a duty
   status/availability code restricting them from deployment (IAW AFI 10-403) may be
   considered available for in-place missions as determined by the commander.
   3.2.5. Use the following SORTS rules to determine personnel availability according to a
   unit’s DOC Statement Mission Title (Section 2).
      3.2.5.1. For in-place generation, alert, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03, or
      surveillance missions, count personnel available if they can be expected to return to their
      assigned duty location within response time.
      3.2.5.2. For mobility missions, count personnel available if they are expected to be ready
      to deploy from their present location within DOC response time.
      3.2.5.3. For combined in-place generation and mobility missions, allocate personnel to
      each mission and then apply the rules for each type mission.
      3.2.5.4. For security forces combined in-place generation and mobility missions DOC
      Statements, allocate all personnel required for UTC or mobility deployment and apply all
      remaining available personnel towards home station force protection.
   3.2.6. When a unit temporarily transfers (lends) personnel to another unit, the supplying
   measured unit will continue to measure and report the personnel in its SORTS unless
   otherwise directed by the MAJCOM(s) involved. Likewise a unit receiving personnel from
   another unit will not measure or count those personnel unless otherwise directed. Temporary
   assignment of personnel will not justify improved SORTS C-levels. However, support from
   other units may be factored into a commander’s assessment for the Overall C-level.
   3.2.7. MAJCOMs should provide additional guidance to assist unit commanders to
   consistently and accurately determine whether members are available and ready to deploy
   within the response time.
3.3. Total and Critical Personnel Percentage Calculation. The lower P-level from total or
critical personnel is used to determine the personnel resource area P-level.
   3.3.1. Total Personnel Percentage. Total personnel are calculated using the following rules:
      3.3.1.1. If 10 or more people are calculated, divide total personnel available by the total
      number of personnel authorized, multiply by 100 and round off to a whole number.
      3.3.1.2. If nine or less people are calculated, use Table 3.2 to derive the percentage.
      3.3.1.3. Enter the percent in the PERTP field.
   3.3.2. Critical Personnel Percentage. Units use one of two methods for computing critical
   personnel percentages; the single percentage computation method or the multiple percentage

  computation method. The method used is derived from Table 3.1 for each unit type. If the
  entries in Table 3.1, columns B and/or C are separated by commas only, the single
  percentage computation method is used. If the entries in Table 3.1, columns B and C include
  semicolons, the multiple percentage computation method is used. Calculate critical personnel
  using the following rules:
     3.3.2.1. For support, non-combat air forces (CAF) units, space, and missile units, if 10 or
     more personnel are calculated, divide the number of critical personnel available by the
     number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply the result by
     100 and round off to a whole number.
     3.3.2.2. Single percentage computation method. Total the number of personnel positions
     from TPAUTH that contain the AFSCs and skill levels identified in Table 3.1 as critical.
     This number becomes the denominator in the percentage equation.
     3.3.2.3. Multiple percentage computation method. Compute a separate percentage for
     each packet of critical personnel. See paragraph 3.5 for an explanation of packets.
     Report the lowest percentage of all of the packets in the PERTC data field.
     3.3.2.4. Percentage computations. The following applies regardless of the method used.
         3.3.2.4.1. Availability of personnel is determined using paragraph 3.2
         3.3.2.4.2. If the number in the denominator of the percentage equation is nine or less
         personnel, use Table 3.2 to derive percentage.
         3.3.2.4.3. If the personnel calculation baseline (denominator in the percentage
         equation) is 10 or more personnel , divide the number of critical personnel available
         by the number of critical personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply
         the result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
         3.3.2.4.4. Enter the percentage in the PERTC data field.
     3.3.2.5. CAF aviation units will calculate their personnel numbers using the following:
         3.3.2.5.1. See paragraph 3.3.2.3 to calculate CAF multiple percentages.
         3.3.2.5.2. Find the number of personnel available for each crew position (i.e., pilot,
         co-pilot, navigator, etc.). Calculate critical maintenance personnel as you would for
         non-combat aircraft units using paragraph 3.3.2.1 guidance.
         3.3.2.5.3. If 10 or more aircrew are calculated, divide the number aircrew available
         by the number of aircrew required for each crew position. Multiply the result by 100
         and round off to the whole number.
         3.3.2.5.4. If nine or less aircrew are calculated, find the percent using the number
         available by crew position (Reference Table 3.2).
         3.3.2.5.5. Enter the lowest percentage between aircrew personnel positions and the
         Critical Maintenance AFSCs in the PERTC field.
     3.3.2.6. Non-CAF aircraft units may elect to use CAF criteria for measuring critical
     personnel including when GTACS CAF units report via aircrew duty position method.

3.4. Personnel Reason Codes.
   3.4.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 3.5, when P-level is less than P-1.
   3.4.2. If the reason code has changed from the last reported, enter the new reason code in the
   PRRES or PRREF data fields.
3.5. Critical Personnel Packet Formulation.
   3.5.1. When a unit’s personnel resources are sufficiently diverse, measuring certain critical
   personnel by the single percentage computation method may mask shortages in critical
   AFSCs and skill levels. In these cases, HQ USAF FAMs may arrange critical AFSCs listed
   in Table 3.1, into groups called packets and separate the packets by semicolons (;). Packets
   will be reflected in the unit’s DOC Statement. Alternatively, UTCs may be substituted for
   AFSC packets when they have manpower details assigned. (Examples: 1C37X, 1C35X;
   3C072, 3C052 or UTC-QFEBA; QFEBB;). The critical personnel packets will be reported
   using the multiple percentage computation method.
   3.5.2. When packets are used, units will calculate a separate percentage for each designated
   packet listed in Table 3.1 using the procedures in paragraph 3.3.2. The lowest percentage of
   all packets will be reported in the PERTC field.
   3.5.3. MAJCOM CAF FAMs may designate non-aircrew personnel packet(s) using Table
   3.1.
3.6. Commander Assessment and Remarks. Commanders should address the following
personnel issues when submitting a unit assessment, if applicable:
   3.6.1. In the event of UMD/UTC mismatches (paragraph 2.11.7.3), personnel measurement
   calculations will be made based on the UMD requirement for the mismatched position(s).
   Commanders with UTC requirements not on the UMD (not authorized) should assess the
   Overall C-level downward to reflect the impact of the ―missing‖ manpower authorizations
   and remarks should illuminate the specific manpower authorization mismatches with the
   UTC tasked to support. See paragraph 2.11.7.4 for remark requirement.
      3.6.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Upon initial discovery of a UTC and UMD mismatch, unit
      monitors will notify the local Manpower Office and the SRO. Unit monitor will
      coordinate UTC and UMD mismatches with the local Manpower Office prior to turn in to
      the SRO for submission. A representative from the Manpower Office, who has been
      trained in SORTS reporting procedures, must initial the SORTS report next to the
      PRRAT Remark to validate and indicate notification of the UTC and UMD mismatch.
   3.6.2. Resource capabilities provided by overseas host nation or by foreign national contract
   personnel should be considered in the commander’s assessment when relevant.
   3.6.3. When non-aircrew personnel are not included in the personnel measurement, flying
   unit commanders must assess these required capabilities when assigning an Overall C-Level.

       EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON HAND (O/H) MEASURED AREA DATA

4.1. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reporting. Equipment and supplies O/H measurement is used
to indicate the resource status of authorized equipment and supplies required to support the unit’s
wartime mission(s), as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement. This measurement may indicate
budget and supply problems when details are known. Resources measured in this area are reported in
the EQSUPPLY set.
   4.1.1. Equipment and supplies O/H reporting is based on a unit’s wartime requirement.
       4.1.1.1. Units with an in-place generation or combined in-place generation and mobility
       mission, use the applicable documents (AS, Air Staff-level functional area guidance, UTC
       LOGDET, etc.) as the base line for equipment and supplies measurement as supplemented by
       Table 4.4 subareas. These subareas will normally reflect those items on the applicable
       documents that are critical to mission accomplishment.
       4.1.1.2. Units with a mobility-only mission, use LOGDET, plus any applicable Air Staff-
       level functional area guidance, as the baseline for equipment and supplies measurement as
       supplemented by Table 4.4 subareas for each UTC it is required to support.
       4.1.1.3. Units compute the equipment and supplies S-level, for combat essential and support
       equipment and supplies, based on the availability of wartime required equipment and
       supplies. Equipment and supplies items are considered available if they are assigned to the
       unit and are physically present or can be present within prescribed unit response times.
       4.1.1.4. For equipment and supplies deployed in support of Small Scale Contingencies
       (SSC), equipment and supply items may be considered available to units with mobility
       missions if unit personnel can make the equipment and supplies ready to redeploy within the
       DOC response time.
       4.1.1.5. For in-place (generation), in-place and mobility, or mobility-only missions, the full
       wartime requirement of equipment and supplies is determined by the applicable authorizing
       or requirements documents.
       4.1.1.6. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft Units (Generation and Mobility mission). Supplement
       reported UTCs as required with critical in-place assets. Units will e-mail a consolidated
       listing of the equipment used to measure each equipment subarea to Aircraft Airframe (HQ
       USAFE/A4MA), (AEF Branch (HQ USAFE/A3ZA) Readiness Measures), and the SRO
       upon receipt of a new/updated DOC Statement and when changes occur. Count only ―XF‖
       ―XD‖ ―NF‖ or ―ND‖ coded items to avoid skewing results with large number of easily
       procured expendable items. Include nomenclature, national stock number (NSN), total
       authorized, and quantity required to support the DOC Statement. Submit listings within 30
       days of receiving this supplement and when changes are made to the listing.
       4.1.1.7. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft Units (Mobility mission only). Units will submit a
       consolidated listing of the equipment used to measure each equipment subarea to HQ
       USAFE/A4MA, HQ USAFE /A3ZA Readiness Measures, and the SRO upon receipt of a
       new/updated DOC Statement and when changes occur. Count only ―XF‖ ―XD‖ ―NF‖ or
       ―ND‖ coded items to avoid skewing results with large number of easily procured
       expendable items. Include nomenclature, national stock number (NSN), total authorized,

      and quantity required to support the DOC Statement. Submit listings within 30 days of
      receiving this supplement and when changes are made to the listing.
   4.1.2. The formula for equipment and supplies computations is the number of equipment and
   supplies available divided by the wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
4.2. Equipment and Supplies Subareas (ESSAs). This measured area allows measurement of up
to nine subareas. Consider the following:
   4.2.1. In-place/Generation or Generation and Mobility Missions. Use the SORTS DOC
   Statement, LOGDET, IRSP, ASs, and Air Staff-level functional area guidance, as necessary, to
   determine equipment types and numbers authorized/required.
      4.2.1.1. For IRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid tainting results with large
      numbers of expendable items that current assessment tools cannot model their mission impact
      (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
      4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs report strategic airlift aircraft spare engines under a fleet status report.
   4.2.2. Mobility Missions. Use DOC Statement to determine the types of equipment and supplies
   to measure and use UTC LOGDET and applicable Air Staff-level functional area guidance to
   determine specific equipment and supply items required.
      4.2.2.1. If more than one UTC is measured, add their individual requirements together.
      4.2.2.2. For MRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid skewing the count with
      large numbers of expendable items whose mission impact cannot be modeled using current
      assessment tools (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
   4.2.3. Item Possession. To determine the number of items a unit will possess within it’s response
   time, the unit must have actual responsibility for the items according to applicable supply
   regulations. The following items are not considered possessed:
      4.2.3.1. Additional or BAI in excess of the number authorized or required. Include backup
      aircraft if MEASG does not exceed MEARD.
      4.2.3.2. Items in PDM or Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) depot modification.
      4.2.3.3. Items temporarily in the hands of another unit due to long term maintenance (lasting
      more than seven days or for crash or battle damage repair) are not considered possessed by
      the receiving unit. If the unit has items on loan from another unit, the items from the other
      unit will not be counted.
      4.2.3.4. Items loaned to another unit to augment their resources will be considered possessed
      by the owning unit. Receiving unit will not use these resources for SORTS reporting. Items
      will not be double-counted. Units receiving equipment on loan should consider a
      commander’s assessment of the Overall C-level based on support.
      4.2.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Use Major Equipment - Possessed (MEPSD) Remark to submit
      information identifying aircraft assigned, but not possessed by the owning unit. Include the
      number of backup aircraft inventory (BAI), number and location of aircraft in programmed
      depot maintenance (PDM), aircraft on loan to or from another unit, and estimated return
      date. Use the MEPSD example format in Table 2.4.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                              93


   4.2.4. MRSP and IRSP:
       4.2.4.1. Include XD-coded repairable items, but not XB/XF-coded expendable items.
       Large numbers of XB may mask problems with higher value XD items (BEAR base
       squadrons excluded). Include only items serviceable/repairable within the response time.
       4.2.4.2. Include the possessed primary operating stock (POS).
       4.2.4.3. Add the items O/H for each measured subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   4.2.5. Electronic Attack (EA) Pods. If Pods are O/H and mission ready, but are less than 90
   percent mission capable, provide a remark on EA Pod status using the ESSA4 label.
4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report
SORT S data against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and
report their status on the basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned.
Report using only the assets the unit is authorized. Specific equipment allowances are included
in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 ―USAF Bear Base Systems,‖ and in AS 157, 158 and 159.
   4.3.1. The following measured units report on the designated BEAR systems:
       4.3.1.1. 49 Material Maintenance Group (MMG) Holloman AFB, NM for assigned ACC
       BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.2. 609 Air Support Squadron (ASUS) Shaw AFB, SC for assigned USCENTAF
       BEAR and Harvest Falcon assets.
       4.3.1.3. 607 ASUS Osan AB, Korea for assigned PACAF Harvest Eagle, T-550, and
       BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.4. 435 Materiel Maintenance Squadron (MMS) Sembach, Germany for assigned
       USAFE BEAR assets.
       4.3.1.5. 60 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Travis AFB, CA and 305 LRS,
       McGuire AFB, NJ for assigned AMC Swift BEAR assets.
   4.3.2. BEAR base equipment is grouped by UTC and is designed to provide a functional
   capability. UTCs also include support MRSPs that are required to make UTC end items
   functional. When determining UTC capability support, MRSPs must be considered along
   with equipment items. Spare MRSPs provide repair parts and are considered separately.
   Spare MRSP will provide for 30 days of operations without re-supply. See Air Force
   Handbook (AFH) 10-222 for breakdown of BEAR Base sets and packages.
4.4. MRSP and IRSP Authorizations. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations loaded into a unit’s
Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) and requisitioned 90 days prior to authorization/activation
date are assessed beginning on the authorization date. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations start at
the same time as the unit’s specific tasking date for its wartime requirement.
   4.4.1. Revised MRSP or IRSP authorizations are provided a minimum of 30 days and a
   maximum of 60 days grace period for reporting S-levels. This includes annual MRSP
   reviews or major RSP reconfiguration changes.
   4.4.2. Report new authorizations starting 30/60 days after they are loaded into the SBSS, or
   as soon as the sorties/aircraft (for ASM or WSMIS-SAM assessed units) or the RSP percent
   filled (where ASM or WSMIS-SAM are not assessed) of revised authorizations equal or
 94                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   exceed that of outdated authorizations, whichever occurs first. Continue to report the
   assessment of the outdated authorizations until the conditions are met for the new
   authorizations, but comment on the status of the new authorizations in the remarks, e.g. new
   MRSP authorization loaded (date).
   4.4.3. Assets available in POS to fill MRSP shortages are counted as O/H in MRSP when
   computing fill percentages in SORTS.
      4.4.3.1. The MRSP percent fill is based on total authorized units, excluding
      Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) XB and XF items. The MRSP
      fill percent is computed as follows: O/H (XD) MRSP divided by (XD) MRSP
      authorization multiplied by 100 = (XD) MRSP percent fill rate.
      4.4.3.2. Assets due in from maintenance (DIFM) within DOC response time and not
      awaiting parts (AWP) are also counted as O/H. The O/H MRSP quantity is computed as
      follows: serviceable MRSP + applicable POS + Forward Supply Points (FSP) + (DIFM
      AWP) = O/H MRSP.
   4.4.4. Units with an in-place DOC have specific IRSP guidance. Each unit with an in-place
   DOC is provided a total wartime requirement.
      4.4.4.1. The total wartime requirement is computed as follows: IRSP + POS O&STQ
      (Order And Ship Time Quantities).
      4.4.4.2. The O/H IRSP quantity is computed as follows: serviceable IRSP + serviceable
      POS + O/ H repairable assets O/H repairable assets coded AWP = authorized units,
      excluding ERRC XB and XF items.
      4.4.4.3. The IRSP fill percent is computed as follows: O/H IRSP quantity divided by
      total wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
   4.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) will use Personal Computer -
   Aircraft Sustainability Model (PC-ASM) assessments for In place Readiness Package
   (IRSP)/ Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) assessment.
4.5. Subarea Percentage Calculations.
   4.5.1. Calculate the subarea percentages. If ten or more items are authorized or required
   divide the number of items possessed within the DOC response time by the number of items
   authorized or required. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the
   number of items authorized. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage and round off
   to the nearest whole number. This whole number is the subarea percentage.
   4.5.2. If nine or less items are authorized or required select appropriate percentage from
   Table 4.2, unless Table 4.4 directs otherwise. Note the derived percentages. If a percentage
   has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage under the appropriate subarea
   label from Table 4.4.
4.6. Combat Essential and Support Equipment O/H Percentage Calculations.
   4.6.1. Determine unit combat essential versus support specification using Table 4.1,
   Column A (unit type), Column B (combat essential equipment) and Column C (support
   equipment).
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                95


   4.6.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment percentage for each area use
   the following rules:
      4.6.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, use the lowest percentage found for those
      subareas.
      4.6.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate that percentage with
      the same procedure used for the subarea calculations.
   4.6.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed since the last report, enter
   the new percentage in the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and the EQSSE label
   for support equipment.
   4.6.4. Note the derived combat essential/supporting item counts. For aircraft units, if the
   item counts have changed since the last report, enter them in the following labels:
      4.6.4.1. The number authorized in the label MEARD.
      4.6.4.2. The number assigned in the label MEASG.
          4.6.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Use the Major Equipment - Assigned (MEASG)
          Remark to submit information concerning the actual number of aircraft assigned. See
          Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an example of how to format the remark.
      4.6.4.3. The number possessed in the label MEPOS.
          4.6.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Use the Major Equipment - Possessed (MEPOS)
          Remark to submit information concerning the actual number of aircraft possessed.
          See Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an example of how to format the remark.
      4.6.4.4. If MRSP fill rate was used in spares assessment, enter it in the RSP field and
      enter an X in the Spares Assessment Driver (ARUSD) field.
      4.6.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Use the Major Equipment - Mission Ready and Available
      (MEMRA) remark to submit information concerning the status of major equipment
      possessed, but cannot be made mission ready within the unit’s DOC Response Time.
   4.6.5. (Added-USAFE) For weather units with Army-provided vehicles and equipment, do
   not report status of Army-provided vehicles and equipment if these items are reported
   through SORTS via Army channels. Instead, in the ―Remarks Section‖, identify
   Modification Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE) for each supported customer and
   provide percentage filled per paragraph 4.6.2.
4.7. Equipment and Supplies O/H S-Level Calculations. To convert area percentages into an
S-level use the following rules:
   4.7.1. Aircraft units:
      4.7.1.1. Convert EQSEE field to an S-level by using Table 4.6.
      4.7.1.2. Convert EQSSE field to an S-level by using Table 4.7.
      4.7.1.3. Select the lower of EQSEE and EQSSE S-levels.
   4.7.2. Non-aircraft units:
      4.7.2.1. Select the lowest percentage value from EQSEE and EQSSE percentages.
 96                              AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


         4.7.2.2. Convert percentage into an equipment and supplies O/H S-level using Table 4.3.
   4.7.3. Note the derived equipment and supplies O/H S-level. If the S-level has changed since
   the last report, enter it in the ESRAT label. Use the Measured Resource Subarea Level for
   Equipment/Supplies O/H (ESRAF) for secondary or tertiary missions.
   4.7.4. If Table 4.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential and support equipment
   O/H percentages, report S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in ESRES.
4.8. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reason Codes. Select the most specific reason code from
Table 4.5 when the equipment and supplies O/H S-level is less than S-1. Note the selected
reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report, enter the new reason code in the
label ESRES. Use the label ESREF for secondary or tertiary missions.
4.9. Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM) and Weapon System Management Information
System Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS-SAM). When the SORTS DOC
Statement references ASM or WSMIS-SAM units must use Table 4.9 to find the spares subarea
percentage. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement if there is a major problem with the ASM
assessments. When there is a validated problem with ASM, MAJCOMs may direct the use of
WSMIS-SAM as a secondary or tertiary means of providing an assessment of capability
attributed to spare parts. The following rules apply for ASM and WSMIS-SAM:
   4.9.1. No ASM or WSMIS-SAM available. If ASM or WSMIS-SAM is not available, and
   when authorized by MAJCOM, use the RSP (XD2 only) fill rate to report, using Table 4.9,
   rules 1-4. Report percentages in the RSP and ESSA1 fields. Enter an X in the ARUSD field.
      4.9.2. For units with strategic airlift aircraft (C-17, C-5, C-141), use percent SORTIES
      achieved over 30 days (reference Table 4.9).
         4.9.2.1. Enter Y in the ARUSD field.
         4.9.2.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
         4.9.2.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
   4.9.3. All other aircraft units (non-strategic airlift) use the aircraft availability spares
   assessment method (reference Table 4.9).
         4.9.3.1. Enter Z in the ARUSD field.
         4.9.3.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9).
         4.9.3.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
   4.9.4. Guidance for specific aircraft availability (ACFTA) options to be used for each
   aircraft type is included in the notes to Table 4.9. Units will contact their MAJCOM office
   with any questions as to which ACFTA Option is appropriate.
   4.9.5. MAJCOMs will promptly notify HQ AFMC Logistics (HQ AFMC/LGXX) of specific
   modeling disconnects with ASM. Notifications should be made within 48 hours of discovery,
   but not later than 72 hours.
   4.9.6. When ASM is used spare engine assessments will be made using Table 4.8 reporting
   the percentage in the ESSA2 field. The ASM assessment does not include spare engines.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                    97


4.10. Non-Returnable Deployed Resources. Occasionally, a unit may own equipment that is
required to be left in the contingency AOR after unit personnel redeploy to their home station.
Equipment defined as non-deployable/non-returnable because of use in a particular AOR will be
immediately reported as non-available in the units SORTS report. Unit S-level will reflect the
computations derived from lack of specified equipment.
   4.10.1. MRSPs. MRSPs having SBSS MRSP details that are partially or totally transferred to
   either a MAJCOM Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) or to the deployed SBSS account are
   still the responsibility of the owning base for SORTS reporting.
   4.10.2. The owning LRS will contact the RSS or deployed account to obtain an R26 for the
   transferred items and calculate these assets as available, if they can be redeployed within the
   response time.
   4.10.3. ASM will be used in conjunction with R26 merge program to assess the deployed
   unit’s MRSP (or mission support kit, MRSK, if partially deployed) along with the MRSPs at
   the home base for SORTS.
   4.10.4. (Added-USAFE) When making these assessments include all available resources, to
   include deployed assets (Readiness Spares Package (RSP) and Minimum Spares Kit (MSK))
   located within the theater that could be redeployed within unit DOC response time. Ensure
   your parameter input images for R26 processing are correctly formatted to select satellite and
   home station data. Personal Computer - Aircraft Sustainability Model (PC-ASM)
   assessments are accomplished by LRS. Material Management (HQ USAFE/A4RMW) offers
   training in preparing PC-ASM assessments.
4.11. BEAR Base Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. Required equipment and
supplies S-levels are based on critical equipment and MRSP authorized for items identified in the
BEAR Base SORTS Critical Item List, as applicable. Authorized suitable substitutes may be
used. The BEAR Base Critical Item List is produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC)
Logistics and should be used to calculate these levels.
4.12. Aircraft Engine Computations. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104, ―Selective
Management of Selected Gas Turbine Engines‖ and must be used to determine required war
readiness engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement, must be
included in computations. All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines allocated.
The number of net serviceable spare engines will then be compared to the WRE requirement and
the reported percentage is the factor to be entered on the S-level checklist. Engines installed in or
obligated to BAI, cannibalized (CANN), and unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available
within response time, may be considered by the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-
level. This can include engines projected available through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate
maintenance, or logistics support center provided that serviceability and Ready For Issue (RFI)
requirements are met.
   4.12.1. (Added-USAFE) All Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) aircraft with engine holes
   will have serviceable/projected serviceable engines allocated. All engines (including those
   installed in or allocated to Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI), or, hangered, long-term-broke
   assigned aircraft that will be available and ready for installation within DOC Response Time,
   will be counted as serviceable spare engines for S-level computations. Use Table 4.8. of the
 98                             AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


     basic publication to determine appropriate percentage and S-level. War Reserve Material
     (WRM) and required engines are synonymous.

  NOTE: If 11 or more engines are required, compute and report the actual percentage available. This
  table is used in conjunction with Table 4.7. Units reporting at squadron level, use the number of
  engines required for the squadron. Units reporting at wing level, use the number of engines required
  for the wing. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104 and must be used to determine
  required war readiness engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement,
  must be included in computations. All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines
  allocated. The number of net serviceable spare engines will then be compared to the WRE
  requirement and the reported percentage is the factor to be entered on the Aircraft and Equipment
  and Supplies O/H S-level checklist. Engines installed in or obligated to BAI, CANN, and
  unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within the response time, may be considered by the
  unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-level. This can include engines projected available
  through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate maintenance, or a logistic support center provided that
  serviceability and RFI requirements are met.

                  EQUIPMENT CONDITION MEASURED AREA DATA

5.1. Equipment Condition Reporting. The equipment condition measured area is used to
measure the combat essential and support equipment that can be made ready within the unit’s
response time to undertake the unit’s assigned wartime mission. This measure is also used to
indicate maintenance and equipment reliability, serviceability and operational status of assets.
Units compute the equipment condition R-level for combat essential and support equipment
based on the availability of wartime required equipment. Equipment items are considered
available if they are possessed by the unit and are, or can be, made mission ready within the
prescribed unit response time. The formula for equipment condition computation is: the number
of equipment items mission ready and available divided by the number possessed (not to exceed
the wartime requirement number) multiplied by 100.
5.2. Equipment Condition Subareas (ERSAs). The equipment condition measured area
allows units to measure up to nine subareas. Consider the following for all missions:
   5.2.1. Use SORTS DOC Statements, equipment lists, Air Staff-level functional area
   guidance, LOGDET, AS’s, etc., as necessary, to determine equipment types; then measure
   the number possessed.
   5.2.2. Add number of items possessed for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
5.3. Subarea Percentage Calculations. Determine the number of items mission ready and
available for each subarea. Accomplish the following:
   5.3.1. Add number of items MRA for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   5.3.2. Forecast the number of items that could be MRA by response time.
   5.3.3. Calculate the subarea percentages:
       5.3.3.1. If there are ten or more items possessed accomplish the following:
           5.3.3.1.1. Divide the number of items MRA by the number of items possessed.
           5.3.3.1.2. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the number of
           items authorized.
           5.3.3.1.3. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
           5.3.3.1.4. Round percentage to nearest whole number (this is the subarea
           percentage.).
       5.3.3.2. If there are nine or less items possessed select the appropriate percentage from
       Table 5.2, unless Table 5.4 contains other instructions. Note the derived percentages. If a
       percentage has changed since the last report, enter the new percentage in the appropriate
       subarea label from Table 5.4.
5.4. Combat Essential and Support Equipment Condition Percentage Calculations:
   5.4.1. Find the unit type in Table 5.1, Column A. Use Column B for combat essential
   equipment and Column C for support equipment.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                  155


   5.4.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment condition percentage for
   each area accomplish the following:
      5.4.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, select the lowest percentage for those subareas.
      5.4.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate the percentage with
      the same procedure used for subarea calculations.
   5.4.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed, enter the new percentage
   in the EQREE label for combat essential equipment or EQRED label for support equipment.
   5.4.4. Note the derived number of combat essential items. For aircraft units, determine the
   number of aircraft that are mission ready and available.
      5.4.4.1. If the number of aircraft that are mission ready and available has changed since
      the last report enter the new number in the label MEMRA.
      5.4.4.2. The number of aircraft reported in the labels MEASG, MEPOS, and MEMRA
      fields will not be greater than the number reported in the label MEARD.
      5.4.4.3. The actual number of aircraft authorized, possessed, and mission-ready and
      available is reported in the MEQLOCN set.
          5.4.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) When submitting major equipment location and crew
          information (MEQLOCN) data, use a separate MEQLOCN set to report on aircraft
          and aircrews that are deployed away from home station for longer than 72 hours in
          the temporary location code (TEGEO) field. The MEQLOCN set containing the
          temporary location data must be updated or deleted within 24 hours when crews and
          aircraft return to home station.
5.5. Equipment Condition R-Level Calculations.
   5.5.1. To convert area percentages into an R-level use the following rules:
      5.5.1.1. Select the lowest percentage value from the combat essential and support
      equipment condition area percentages.
      5.5.1.2. Aircraft units use Table 5.3 to convert the combat essential equipment condition
      percentage into an R-level.
      5.5.1.3. Non-aircraft units use Table 5.6 to convert the equipment condition area
      percentage into an R-level.
   5.5.2. Note the derived equipment condition R-level. If the R-level has changed since the
   last report, enter the new R-level in the ERRAT label (Equipment Condition Measured
   Resource Area Category Subarea (ERRAF) label for secondary or tertiary missions).
   5.5.3. When an AF directed resource change depletes mission ready and available
   equipment, reference paragraph 1.10.9.
   5.5.4. If Table 5.1 lists nothing to report for the combat essential equipment condition and
   support equipment condition percentages, report R-6 in ERRAT and RNM in ERRES (see
   paragraph 4.7.4).
5.6. Equipment Condition Reason Codes.
 156                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


   5.6.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 5.5, when the equipment condition
   R-level is less than R-1.
   5.6.2. Note the selected reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report,
   enter the new reason code in the ERRES or ERREF label.
5.7. Equipment Considered Mission Ready and Available (MRA). Most equipment is
considered mission ready if the equipment is safe to use and in the condition to perform the
functions for which it was designed.
   5.7.1. Aircraft, missiles, and major weapons systems must comply with the following:
       5.7.1.1. Have a full or basic system list of items for the stated working mission
       (MAJCOMs are the authority on which system to use).
          5.7.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Ensure required systems or subsystems are operational
          using the basic systems list (BSL) of the DOC's mission essential subsystems list
          (MESL). Those units whose MESL is listed in the work unit code (WUC) format will
          use the BSLs to determine mission capable status.
          5.7.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Units assigned a conventional DOC must use any one of
          the tasked BSLs (as shown in the DOC). Units assigned a nuclear and conventional
          DOC must use any one of the tasked conventional BSLs plus nuclear BSL.
       5.7.1.2. Be configured with suspension equipment (i.e., dash 21 items and alternate
       mission equipment) that is required by the MAJCOM.
       5.7.1.3. Have all peacetime inspections or time compliance technical order actions
       completed or waived for wartime use.
   5.7.2. In-Place Generation, Alert, or Surveillance Missions. Consider items available if the
   items will be ready at their duty location within response time.
       5.7.2.1. Consider strategic air defense aircraft available when these aircraft are within the
       United States or Canada.
       5.7.2.2. Consider strategic airlift aircraft on operational missions available regardless of
       their location.
       5.7.2.3. Consider strategic tankers on operational missions available if the aircraft will be
       ready to deploy within the response time.
   5.7.3. Mobility Missions. Consider items available, regardless of location, if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time. Equipment items left in a contingency AOR,
   while personnel reconstitute or redeploy, will be reported as non-available if equipment
   condition cannot be ascertained.
   5.7.4. Combined In-place Generation and Mobility Mission. Allocate equipment to each
   mission type and apply the guidelines for each specific mission type.
   5.7.5. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 Mission. Consider items available if the items are
   expected to be ready within response time.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                             157


     5.7.6. Equipment items loaned to another unit to augment their resources. Will be
     considered possessed by the owning unit. Items will not be double counted. Receiving unit
     will not use these resources for SORTS reporting.
5.8. BEAR Base Equipment Condition Measured Area. Equipment condition R-levels are
based on fully mission capable critical equipment authorized for items identified in the BEAR
Base Critical Item List produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Logistics. Use the
standard command checklists to calculate this area.
5.9. Required Remarks for Aircraft Units. If referencing aircraft grounded for mission
capable (MICAP) parts, provide the National Stock Number (NSN), part nomenclature, and the
name of the system which needs the part. If the aircraft is unavailable due to scheduled or
unscheduled maintenance, provide the Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC). Also provide the
estimated delivery dates for aircraft undergoing programmed depot maintenance. Labels for the
remarks will be provided via MAJCOM supplement.
     5.9.1. (Added-USAFE) Use the MEMRA remark to submit information concerning the
     number of aircraft not mission ready available. See Table 2.4.1. (Added) for an example of
     how                  to                 format                  the                remark.

 NOTES:
   1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
      transmit and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
      HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios
      and be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
   2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support
      System, laser range finder, thermal imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
   3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply
      the result by 100. This must be done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine
      the support equipment condition.
   4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear
      support equipment.
   5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft;
      even if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).
   6. Rule 12 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
      transmit and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
      HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios
      and be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.

NOTES:
  1. Rule 43 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
     transmit and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
     HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios
     and be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.
  2. Rule 43 A TAC kit is MRA when the following items are MRA: TACP Close Air Support
     System, laser range finder, thermal imager/laser spot viewer, and GPS receiver.
  3. To compute percentage divide the quantity MRA by the quantity authorized and multiply
     the result by 100. This must be done for each UTC, use the lowest percentage to determine
     the support equipment condition.
  4. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear
     support equipment.
  5. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft;
     even if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP).
  6. Rule 12 To be mission ready, a communications central must have the capability to
     transmit and receive secure communications on HF/ Single Side Band (SSB), UHF/AM
     HAVE QUICK, and VHF/frequency modulation (FM) high-power pallet mounted radios
     and be mounted in a mission ready and available tactical vehicle.

  NOTES:
    1. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex,
       modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data
       using GMF SHF SATCOM.
       2. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit,
          receive, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
       3. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR
          link.
       4.     Tactical radio nets must have the capability to transmit and receive secure
            communications using high powered radios.
       5. Each SHF SATCOM and TROPO must be capable of one message circuit (AUTODIN
          or equivalent) and one Transmission Control Protocol/Information Processing Code
          (TCP/IPC) circuit.

  NOTES:
   1. Where different, values for US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) CRCs are enclosed in
      parentheses.
   2. Compute maximum number of customers that could be supported by assigned telephone
      switch(es); considering available instruments, cable, j-boxes, termination units, switch
      capacity, central processing unit (CPU) function, and any other factor impacting
      service availability.
   3. Consider ability to terminate one AUTODIN circuit (UGC-144, etc.)

   4. C2 channels require transmit and receive capability over radios in 4 OMs and external
       radios.
   5. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-
       link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-
       100A GMF SHF SATCOM hub. Numbers of carriers are TSC-100A available.
   6. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-
       link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TSC-94A
       GMF SHF SATCOM.
   7. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit,
       receive, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
   8. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR
       link.
   9. Net control requires capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control
       circuits and trunks transitioning the facility using TSQ-111 or TSQ-188.
   10. To compute multiplexing package capability divide available capability of assigned
       multiplexers (TSQ-146, FCC-100, RMC, etc.) by designed capability and multiply by
       100.
   11. Compute ERSA4 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein.
       Where a rating crosses two scores, assume higher score unless driven lower by another
       rating (e.g. 1 TSC-100A Carrier). Where no criteria exists for an area, failure to meet
       minimum criteria will drive score no lower than minimum criteria noted (e.g. no
       message traffic capability = 70 percent).

            function, and any other factors impacting service availability.
      2.     Consider ability to terminate two DMS circuits (primary and alternate) at a record
            communications facility and two TCP.IP nets (NIPRNET or SIPRNET).
      3. Operating RF Links requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of the link.
      4. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, uplink,
          downlink, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using LMST, USC-60A, or
          DDT.
      5. Need to control requires the capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control
          circuits and trunks:
               a. Systems under Note 5b fully operational and sufficient other components to support
                    TDC communication equipment as identified in the MISCAP.
               b. Facilities, processor, patch and test, timing subsystems, and
                      automatic digital test (ADT) fully operational. c. Ability
                      to manually configure, monitor, test, and control circuits
                      and trunks using other facility.
           6. Compute ERSA1, ERSA2, and ERSA3 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas
              measured herein. Where no criteria exists for an area, failure to meet minimum criteria will
              drive the score no lower than the minimum criteria notes (e.g., no RF link capability
              =70%) unless driven lower by another area.

of aircraft not mission ready available. See Table 2.4. for an example of how to format the
remark.
                                            Chapter 6

                           TRAINING MEASURED AREA DATA

6.1. Training. Training measurement is used to indicate the status of training needed to support
the mission for which a unit is designed, as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement.
Measured units will calculate a training measured area T-level using either Training Method B
(Crew Training) or Training Method C, Option 1 (Unit Training) or Option 2 (CAF Aviation
Unit Training).
   6.1.1. Option 1 is used to provide fidelity, flexibility, and a macro view of the unit’s training.
   6.1.2. Option 2 is used by CAF aviation units, command and control reporting units, and
   those assigned to a wing (89AA UTC - active duty only) with Aircrew Position Indicator
   (API) codes 1 (pilot), 2 (navigator, observer or air battle manager), and A (career enlisted
   advisor (CEA)) plus 6, or B for CEA, (attached flyer at wing level and below) and 8, or D for
   CEA, (attached flyer above wing level) used to achieve WMP-5 sortie rates (e.g. Wing
   Safety, Tactics, STANEVAL, IG, etc.).
       6.1.2.1. Wing crews with RPI 6 and 8 attached to a squadron for training and wartime
       service are normally measured in the organization of assignment when tasked against that
       unit’s requirements. Personnel resources cannot be counted against requirements in more
       than one unit.
       6.1.2.2. Weapons load crews (AFSC 2W1X1) are unique among maintenance personnel,
       in that they perform their duties as formed and certified crews with specialized
       certification requirements for each crew position. T-levels for 2W1X1 personnel,
       assigned to a weapons load crew, may be determined using Training Method B if and
       when it is allowed by current reporting structure and guidance.
6.2. Using Training Method B: Crew Training.
   6.2.1. Find the number of crews authorized or required.
       6.2.1.1. Aircraft units reporting against a mobility, SIOP, or combined in-
       place/generation and mobility mission:
           6.2.1.1.1. Check the MISCAP of the UTC listed in the SORTS DOC Statement for
           crew ratio or use crew ratio listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
           Factors, Attachment 36-1, separated by aircraft type.
           6.2.1.1.2. For each UTC, multiply the crew ratio by the primary mission aircraft
           inventory (PMAI) authorization on the SORTS DOC Statement to get the number of
           crews required. Add the separate UTC amounts together to get the total number of
           crews required.
       6.2.1.2. Aircraft units reporting against an in-place/generation or alert mission:
           6.2.1.2.1. Check AFI 65-503 to determine the crew ratio associated with the unit’s
           aircraft type.
           6.2.1.2.2. Multiply the crew ratio by the PMAI authorization on the SORTS DOC
           Statement to get the number of crews authorized.

      6.2.1.3. The AF Space Training manager in coordination with the AF Space FAM will
      ensure space operations unit crew requirements are set and based on unit DOCs.
      6.2.1.4. Aeromedical evacuation unit crew requirements are determined by adding
      together the number of crew UTCs tasked to the unit.
      6.2.1.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under
      the TCARQ label.
      6.2.1.6. Weapons load crew requirements are determined by adding the number of crews
      tasked by aviation UTCs or for SIOP generation (if applicable).
  6.2.2. Find the number of crews assigned.
      6.2.2.1. For aircraft units, use AFI 65-503 for crew composition unless modified by the
      MAJCOM because of unique mission requirements.
      6.2.2.2. All other units, use Table 6.1 for crew composition.
      6.2.2.3. Weapons load crew composition is determined IAW AFI 21-101.
      6.2.2.4. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
      Do not limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by AFI 65-503. Count
      crewmembers as assigned from when they sign in on a permanent change of station until
      they sign out.
      6.2.2.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under
      the TCRAS label. Total crews assigned may not exceed total crews authorized or
      required.
         6.2.2.5.1. Count weapons load crew members as assigned once they are designated to
         a position and have entered initial weapons load crew training.
         6.2.2.5.2. Standardized load crews (SLC), assigned to weapons standardization, will
         be apportioned equally to flying squadrons for determining assigned load crews.
  6.2.3. Count the number of crews mission ready and available.
      6.2.3.1. Count a crew mission ready and available (MRA) when all positions are filled
      with MRA crewmembers.
         6.2.3.1.1. If they meet the mission ready criteria in the training directive listed in the
         SORTS DOC Statement.
         6.2.3.1.2. Determine crewmember availability case-by-case according to paragraph
         3.2.
         6.2.3.1.3. Do not count overhead crewmembers (e.g., wing training officers, etc.).
      6.2.3.2. Enter the total of crews MRA under the TCRAV label.
      6.2.3.3. Count weapons load crews as mission ready and available when all positions are
      filled with position-certified weapons loaders IAW AFI 21-101 and the Unit Committed
      Munitions List.
  6.2.4. Calculate the training percentage.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                    245


      6.2.4.1. If ten or more crews are assigned, divide crews MRA by crews assigned.
      Multiply the result by 100 and round off to the nearest whole number.
      6.2.4.2. Table 6.3 will be used to determine the overall T-level.
      6.2.4.3. If nine or less crews are assigned use Table 6.2.
      6.2.4.4. Enter the percentage under the TRUTC label.
6.3. Using Training Method C, Option 1 - Unit Training. Use this training method to report
subareas specified on the SORTS DOC Statement for the unit types in Table 6.4.
   6.3.1. Determine the number of personnel required to have the training specified in each
   subarea. Some units may have more personnel assigned than are authorized by UMD or
   required by UTC. All individuals must be trained, but not all may be measured in the training
   measured area. Using Method C, Option 1, the number you establish as assigned requiring
   training may not exceed UMD-authorized or UTC-required total personnel.
      6.3.1.1. If a single type of training is listed, determine if everyone is required to have it.
          6.3.1.1.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the number of total
          personnel assigned as the number required to be trained.
          6.3.1.1.2. If everyone is not required to have the training, use the number of total
          personnel assigned that require the training, (e.g. 25K/40K aerial port training).
      6.3.1.2. If there is more than one type of training listed, (e.g. chemical warfare and
      weapons), determine if everyone is required to have the training.
          6.3.1.2.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the total personnel assigned
          as the number required to be trained. (Consider limitations in paragraph 6.3.1).
          6.3.1.2.2. If less than all assigned personnel are required to have each type of
          training, add together the number required for each type of training. This number
          could be more than the number of personnel requiring training.
   6.3.2. Count the personnel who have the training specified in each subarea.
      6.3.2.1. Personnel are counted as trained if they have completed, or are expected to
      complete, the required training within the response time.
      6.3.2.2. If everyone is required to have all training, count only those personnel who have
      all the training.
      6.3.2.3. If personnel are required to have each type of training, count those personnel
      who have received each type of training. In this method, you can count the same
      individual more than once. To determine the T-level, continue with paragraph 6.5.
   6.3.3. Table 6.3 will be used to determine the overall T-level.
6.4. Using Training Method C, Option 2: CAF Aviation Unit Training.
   6.4.1. Calculations by type of training and crew composition will be compared against the
   percentage conversion Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table 6.8 to derive the percentages
   reported in the specific TRSAs. The lowest of the resulting TRSAs will drive the T-level
   reported in the TRRAT label in the OVERALL set.

  6.4.2. As a minimum, the following three training events will be measured. All five subareas
  may be used depending on MAJCOM requirements. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in
  paragraph 6.5.4.
      6.4.2.1. TRSA1 - Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
      6.4.2.2. TRSA2 - Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
      6.4.2.3. TRSA3 - Special Capability (SPECAP).
  6.4.3. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember.
  However, don't limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by appropriate
  training directives for the weapon system. Count crewmembers as assigned from when they
  sign in on a permanent change of station or become attached on temporary duty until they
  sign out.
  6.4.4. Single Position Crews:
      6.4.4.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.4.1.1. Determine the number of required BMC/Mission Capable (MC) designated
         crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required
         based on non-CMR flying positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the
         BMC changes, detail the changes in a TRSA1 remark.
         6.4.4.1.2. Determine the number of required CMR/Mission Ready (MR) designated
         crew members, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required
         based on the PMAI specified by the SORTS DOC Statement.
             6.4.4.1.2.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
             6.4.4.1.2.2. Add the Squadron Commander and Director of Operations (DO)
             (ANG/ AFRC only).
             6.4.4.1.2.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
         6.4.4.1.3. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crew members,
         assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on all
         positions identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and
         ready aircrew program tasking messages that specify special capability-trained
         aircrews. Calculations will be made only on those SPECAP requirements that match
         those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs may add to this table when approved by HQ
         USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect
         his ability to undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes
         in a TRSA3 remark.
  6.4.5. Multi-Position Crews:
      6.4.5.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.5.1.1. Units with multi-position crews will perform calculations similar to single
         position crews except against each crew position individually. This is required before
         TRSA, TRUTC, and T-level percentages can be determined.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                 247


          6.4.5.1.2. Determine the number of required BMC designated crewmembers,
          assigned or attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the non-CMR flying
          positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the BMC changes, detail the
          changes in a TRSA1 remark.
          6.4.5.1.3. Determine the number of required CMR/MR designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the PMAI specified
          by the SORTS DOC Statement.
             6.4.5.1.3.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
             6.4.5.1.3.2. Add the Squadron Commander and DO (ANG/AFRC only).
             6.4.5.1.3.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
             6.4.5.1.3.4. For Air Control Squadrons, determine the number of required
             CMR/MR designated crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, in each
             position, based on the UTC manpower requirements.
          6.4.5.1.4. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crewmembers,
          assigned and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on all positions
          identified in the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and tasking
          messages that specify special capability-trained aircrews. Calculations will be made
          only on those SPECAP requirements that match those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs
          may add to this table when approved by HQ USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess
          other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect his ability to undertake his DOC mission.
          If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes in a TRSA3 remark.
6.5. Calculating and Explaining the Training T-Level.
   6.5.1. Training Method C, Option 1: Unit Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.1.1. Calculate the subarea percentage using applicable tables, as required. Otherwise:
          6.5.1.1.1. If ten or more personnel are required to have the training, divide the
          number of trained personnel by the number of assigned personnel required to have the
          training (not to exceed the wartime required number).
          6.5.1.1.2. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
          6.5.1.1.3. Round the percent to the nearest whole number.
          6.5.1.1.4. If nine or less personnel are required to have the training, use Table 6.2 to
          determine the percentage.
      6.5.1.2. Calculate the training percentage. Determine the unit type in Table 6.4 in
      column A. Across from the unit type in column B, determine whether the entry lists
      subarea labels.
          6.5.1.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, choose the lowest subarea percentage as the
          area percentage.
          6.5.1.2.2. If the entry lists types of training or another document, calculate an area
          percentage using the same procedure as for a subarea.
          6.5.1.2.3. If changed since the last report, enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
248                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


      6.5.1.3. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.3 to determine the T-
      level to be reported in the TRRAT field. Use the Measured Resource Area Level for
      Training (TRRAF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.2. Training Method B: Crew Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.2.1. If ten or more assigned, divide the number of crews mission ready and available
      by the number of assigned (not to exceed the wartime required number). Multiply the
      result by 100 and round off to a whole number.
      6.5.2.2. If nine or less assigned, use Table 6.1.
      6.5.2.3. If the percentage of crews changed since the last report, enter the change in the
      TRUTC label.
  6.5.3. Training Method C, Option 2: Single Position Crews, use the following to determine
  the T-level:
      6.5.3.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.3.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.3.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
         assigned.
      6.5.3.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training
      table (BMC/Table 6.6, CMR/ Table 6.7, and SPECAP/Table 6.8).
      6.5.3.3. Convert the column A percentage into the column B reported percentage.
      6.5.3.4. Enter percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in TRSA2;
      and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in paragraph 6.5.1.
      6.5.3.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
      6.5.3.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and
      Table 6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
      Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
  6.5.4. For Training Method C, Option 2: Multi-position crews, use the following to
  determine the T-level:
      6.5.4.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.4.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2 to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.4.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number
         assigned.
      6.5.4.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training
      table (BMC/Table 6.3, CMR/Table 6.4, and SPECAP/Table 6.5).
      6.5.4.3. Convert the corresponding percentage in column B.
      6.5.4.4. Enter the percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in
      TRSA2; and SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in 6.5.1.
      6.5.4.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                249


        6.5.4.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table
        6.8 to determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for
        Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
   6.5.5. Regardless of option used, assign training reason codes when the training T-level is
   less than T-1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 6.5 to explain it. If changed,
   enter it in label TRRES. Use TRREF for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
   6.5.6. For units that conduct required training and must use alternate workaround facilities or
   methods due to environmental restrictions on normal exercise or major training range areas,
   commanders should note this limitation through a TRRAT or TRSA remark and indicate an
   appropriate reason code from Table 6.5.

 NOTES:
   1. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NCC
      personnel who've completed the training as specified. However, if any of the
      following six categories are more than one T-level different from the combined
      average, report the lowest level of those categories.
      a. Crew Commander
       b. Operations Controller
       c. HelpDesk Technician
       d. Network Management (includes Network Services Technician and
           Infrastructure Technician crew positions).
    e. Network Administration (includes Messaging Technician, Application Services
      Technician, and Configuration Management Technician crew positions).
    f. Information Protection (includes Boundary Protection Specialist, Intrusion
      Detection Specialist, and Vulnerability Assessment Specialist crew positions).
    2. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NOSC
       personnel who've completed the training as specified. However, if any of the
       following nine categories are more than one T-level different from the combined
       average, report the lowest level of those categories.
       a. Crew Commander
       b. Operations Controller

      3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat
         Air Forces.
      4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual
         Information (VI) mobility mission, members must complete the COMCAM
         Contingency Support course at least once. Such training is considered valid as
         long as the member is assigned to subsequent COMCAM or VI units.
         Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including extended TDYs,
         short tours or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this
         training, requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/or VI unit
         commanders may, at their discretion, choose to send members to the training
         beyond the minimum requirement as readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew
         Survival Training (for appropriately qualified aircrew personnel) may
         substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the
         rules described above.
      5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general
         assessor, technical course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise
         (Hardstand) as an engineer.
      6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control
         currency requirements to include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites
         (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol 1).
      7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of
         combat mission ready JTACS broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
      8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes
         nuclear support equipment.
      9. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-
         aircraft; even if stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP)

Force personnel on duty with agencies outside the Air Force. Although not a unit for
organizational purposes, an element may function as a unit if so designated and a commissioned
officer eligible to command either assumes command or is appointed on orders as commander.
Employment—Employment involves the tactical use of aircraft in a desired area of operation. In
airlift operations it is the movement of forces into or within a combat zone or objective area,
usually in the assault phase. Also, it is the strategic, operational, or tactical use of forces and
materiel in an area or theater of operations.
Equipment—In logistics, all non-expendable items needed to outfit or equip an individual or
organization.

its authorization documents and central to its ability to undertake its mission (e.g. an F-16 to an
F-16 squadron or transportable communications equipment to a combat communications
squadron).
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)—A data system designed to
support contingency and general war planning with predefined standardized manpower and
equipment force packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment,
is composed of two subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the
Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR).
Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)—The MEFPAK component which provides:
The title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of Staff unit type code. The
capability statement containing the definition of unit capability. The manpower detail by
function, grade (officers only) and Air Force specialty code required to meet the defined
capability.

 306                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


and states the types of bases to which a unit can be deployed (i.e., BEAR base, standby
deployment base, or limited operating base).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of
competence in a unit’s primary tasked mission; a prerequisite for CMR and BMC status.
Mission Ready and Available (MRA) Aircraft—MRA aircraft have operational full system list
(FSL) or basic system list (BSL) items for the stated mission and are available within the
response time. The aircraft are configured with required suspension equipment, weapons are
uploaded, servicing is completed, and pre-flights are done. The major command determines
which list will be used, which items are required, and the aircraft configuration.
Mission Ready and Available Crews—Primary duty crews who are mission ready and
available to undertake the unit's specified wartime tasking. The measured unit commander
determines crew availability.
Mission Ready and Available Equipment—Equipment that is available and in condition to
perform the functions for which designed within the response time.

deploy to another area of operation prior to employment.
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)—An air transportable package of war reserve
materiel spares, repair parts, and related maintenance supplies required to support planned
wartime or contingency operations of a weapon or support system for a specified period of time
pending re-supply. MRSP may support aircraft, vehicles, communications systems, and other
systems as appropriate.
Notional Tasking—The condition of being prepared to execute a mission set against a planned
requirement that is in fact not tasked, but representative of a probable task in contingency or
deliberate planning actions. Units sourced to the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan against
apportioned requirements that are not currently tasked to any OPLAN, CONPLAN, or
OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03 are notionally tasked to be able to deliver their
Designed Operational Capability within their response time if allocated to a crisis or sourced to a
TPFDD.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
inherent in Combatant Command (command authority) and is the authority to perform those
functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands
and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary
to accomplish the mission.
Operating Location (OL)—Part of a unit that is geographically separated from its parent unit. It
is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit so the
command supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed. An OL has
none of the administrative attributes of a unit.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                    307


Operation Plan—A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the form of
directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting
plans and orders. The designation ―plan‖ is usually used instead of ―order‖ in preparing for
operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a prescribed time, or on
signal, and then becomes and operation order (CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and
Training System (GSORTS)). Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operational Plan
(OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03), for the conduct of military operations. Plans are
prepared by Combatant Commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements
tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans (OPLANs) are prepared in either
complete format of an OPLAN, or as a concept plan (CONPLAN).
OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for
developing an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to execute the
combatant commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the
theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in time-phased force and deployment
data (TPFDD) files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is
prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES
manuals         containing        planning       policies,       procedures,      and        formats.
CONPLAN is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable
expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the
combatant commander’s strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary
by the combatant commander to complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are
not calculated and TPFDD files are not prepared. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish
missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the
commanders of subordinate organizations; normally this authority is exercised through the
Service component commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to
organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational
control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in
and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline,
internal organization, or unit training.
Organic Equipment—Equipment authorized, required, and under the direct control of the unit.
Overhead Crew—A person or a group of people assigned or attached to the organization in a
status other than that of primary duty crew (e.g., wing training officers, safety officers,

NOT be counted in the personnel or training C-level calculations. They may be assessed
subjectively in the unit’s.
Overall C-level—Commanders of measured units and operations officers who maintain mission
ready status may be counted in the personnel and training C-level calculations.
Pacing Item—An individual line item whose shortage more closely reflects support capability
rather than overall fill rates.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft for which actual responsibility has been given to a measured unit
for operational use. Aircraft temporarily absent but remaining under the operational control
 308                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010

Registered Units—Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a CJCS
or combatant command-directed operations plan, contingency plan, Single Integrated Operations
Plan , or contingency operation. These units (which do not report SORTS) are registered in
GSORTS through the BIDE and ORGLOCN sets.
Reporting Units—All combat, combat support, and combat service support units, including
Active, National Guard or Reserve units sourced to an operations plan (OPLAN), contingency
plan (CONPLAN), the Single Integrated Operations Plan (OPERATIONS PLAN 8044
REVISION 03), or a Service war planning document, are designated as measured (reporting)
units and are required to report SORTS.

and is not a subordinate mission to the primary.
OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03 Mission—Wartime mission for which the
measured unit will normally generate and employ from its peacetime home station in support of
the Single Integrated Operational Plan. Can include both aircraft sortie generation and
deployable support/recovery teams.
SORTSREPAF—A unit GSORTS report submitted by Air Force units.
Special Mission Capability—An enhancement to mission accomplishment. It provides
opportunities for accomplishment in various situational scenarios, adds tactical flexibility to
mission accomplishment, and normally requires additional training and or specialized equipment.
Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)—A JCS controlled, automated data
system primarily created to provide to NCA and JCS with authoritative identification, location,
and resource information. It is used throughout the chain of command to measure the daily

 DESIGNED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (DOC) STATEMENT (AF FORM 723 OR
               APPROVED FACSIMILE) DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Designed Operational Capability Statements. A SORTS DOC Statement identifies a
measured unit and references the unit’s wartime mission(s). Its purpose is to provide a summary
of the mission for which a unit is organized or designed (or equipped, when tasked). The SORTS
DOC Statement is a hard copy management tool used to describe a unit’s mission and provides
details for its SORTS measurement criteria. SORTS DOC Statements are not used as a tasking
source. SORTS DOC Statements list resources and training requirements based on WMP-1, 3,
and 5, command instructions, OPLANS, CONPLANS, and other AF or MAJCOM directives.
All reporting units are provided a primary SORTS DOC Statement that is designed to assist them
to report C-level status to satisfy JCS SORTS requirements. Additionally, units may be provided
other subordinate missions on their DOC Statement, by the MAJCOM, to satisfy unique
requirements. See Chapter 1 for policy on writing SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.1.1. DOC Statements will be developed using an AFF 723 or an approved computer
   generated facsimile.
   A2.1.2. Sections of the SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723). A unit SORTS DOC
   Statement is divided into six sections: Unit Identification, Mission Identification, Measured
   Resources Areas (MSRA), Amplifying Notes, Gaining Command list, and
   Coordination/Review.
       A2.1.2.1. Section I, Unit Identification, includes the measured unit ANAME, HOGEO, a
       representative UTC of the unit type named on the DOC, and the six-character UIC. This
       section also includes the DOC Mission Title, DOCID, and Geographic Location Code
       (GEOLOC).
       A2.1.2.2. Section II, Mission Identification, includes a mission tasking narrative and
       mission specifics (i.e., response time and source, aircraft and missile mission-design-
       series (MDS), planning UTCs the unit is required to support for the unit’s mission(s),
       direct support units’ UICs, ANAME, and OPLAN(s) to which the unit is sourced to
       support). For weapon systems with a range of sortie rates and duration listed in the
       WMP-5, specify the single sortie rate and duration highlighted for planning purposes as
       the wartime flying scenario for SORTS in a unit SORTS DOC Statement, Section II, Part
       B.
       A2.1.2.3. Section III, MSRAs, will include the required measured resource areas.
          A2.1.2.3.1. Section IIIA, Personnel. MAJCOM FAMs will determine if the Total
          Personnel MSRA is determined using the UMD or only UTCs IAW paragraph 3.1
          Additionally, they provide packets for packet methodology of measuring Critical
          Personnel (included in Table 3.1). Use of the packet methodology can allow
          shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS.
          A2.1.2.3.2. Section IIIB, Equipment and Supplies O/H. The Equipment and Supplies
          O/H MSRA section lists the combat essential and/or support equipment and supplies
          that the unit is required to measure in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet
          methodology for measuring equipment and supplies O/H when included as subarea
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                315


          measurements (ESSAs) in tables listed in Chapter 4. Use of the packet methodology
          allows shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS. This section also includes space
          for additional remarks.
          A2.1.2.3.3. Section IIIC, Equipment Condition. The Equipment Condition MSRA
          section lists the combat and/or support equipment the unit is required to measure and
          report in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet methodology to measure
          equipment condition when included as subarea measurements (ERSAs) in Chapter 5
          tables. Use of the packet methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible within
          SORTS. This section also includes space for additional remarks.
          A2.1.2.3.4. Section IIID, Training. Air Force units use either Training Method B or
          C. Training Method C is comprised of two options, Option 1 and 2. Option 1 is used
          to report unit training. All Active, Reserve, and National Guard units with a CAF
          mission will use Option 2 to support the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). Method B is
          used by aviation units outside CAFs. This section also includes space for additional
          remarks.
       A2.1.2.4. Section IV of the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) provides space for
       amplifying notes. Amplifying notes further guide unit SORTS monitors and commanders
       in understanding the scope of the desired SORTS report and additional details required
       accomplishing the report.
       A2.1.2.5. Section V, Gaining Commands. Lists initial AF gaining commands if the unit
       is to be under OPCON of another command after mobilization.
       A2.1.2.6. Section VI, Coordination and Review. Coordination blocks will be used for
       initial SORTS DOC Statement issue to capture interested parties’ concurrence and the
       review blocks for annual review.
A2.2. Units Required To Have A SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Not every unit in the Air Force is required to have a SORTS DOC Statement. Units
tasked against an OPLAN, Concept Plans, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, or have standard
UTCs coded as simultaneously available for deployment under war time surge conditions (DWS
or DWX), or other tasking documents, are required to have SORTS DOC Statements. Applicable
units will report SORTS regardless of whether currently in plans or available to be included in
these plans. Provisional or task organized units will be provided a SORTS DOC Statement when
they are required to report. Aircraft/Non-Aircraft-Combat units or separately deployable DETs,
Aircraft-Combat Support Elements, Non-aircraft-Combat Support Elements, and Combat Service
Support Elements listed in Table A2.1 must possess a valid SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.2.1. Permanently separated DETs planning to be geographically separated from their
   parent unit will act as measured units and report their own C-level data. These units will have
   an independent PAS code. OLs A, B, etc. will be included in the SORTS DOC Statement and
   SORTS report of their parent unit, when appropriate.
   A2.2.2. DOC Statements must be provided to units as soon as possible after the unit is
   activated by the publication of G-series orders. Units must start reporting in conjunction with
   the effective date of the DOC Statement. The DOC Statement remains in force until the unit
   is inactivated by the publication of a G-Series order.

A2.3. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statements (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Most units will have only one SORTS DOC Statement called the Primary Mission
SORTS DOC Statement. The Primary Mission SORTS DOC Statement encompasses all
missions for which the unit is organized or designed (primary mission). MAJCOMs may elect to
have a unit report on parts of the overall mission set. If the parts of a unit’s total wartime mission
are significantly distinct, the parent MAJCOM may elect to produce multiple SORTS DOC
Statements for that unit. Any major part of the overall mission (mobility, generation, nuclear,
conventional, etc.) will be a secondary mission and be described on a Secondary Mission SORTS
DOC Statement. Any subordinate portion (UTC, section, flight, etc.) will be a tertiary mission
and be described on a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Units should not use the
SORTS mission rank ordering to prioritize training or resource allocation requirements. Do this
only when directed by the MAJCOM through the planning process.
   A2.3.1. Procedures for Secondary or Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement development
   and approval are the same as the unit’s Primary Wartime Mission SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.3.2. Some resource area P, S, R or T-levels may be the same for secondary or tertiary
   missions as for primary mission resource area Levels. SORTS DOC Statements must include
   enough information on how to measure resources that it is clearly understood.
   A2.3.3. Some units have several missions (survive to operate, Operation Security
   (OPSEC)/Communication Security (COMSEC), SABC, etc.) contained within the primary
   mission. The capability exists to measure these as elements of the primary mission. These
   ancillary missions of the primary mission are not secondary or tertiary wartime missions.
   SORTS DOC Statements are not normally required for these ancillary missions.
A2.4. Source References for SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved
facsimile). Thefollowing are examples of references, information, data, and source documents
for SORTS DOC Statements:
   A2.4.1. SORTS Files are record files for units and contain the following information:
       A2.4.1.1. The Unit BIDE. Several fields in the SORTS BIDE set contain information
       which must be used to update the unit SORTS DOC Statement. If the unit data in the
       SORTS BIDE is incorrect, MAJCOM SORTS offices are responsible for immediate
       correction.
       A2.4.1.2. The Unit’s UIC is the six-character code that identifies the unit. It is created by
       adding the letter F to the front and the number zero to the end of the last four characters
       of a unit’s PAS code. Subordinate organizations to the PAS code holding unit may be
       registered in SORTS using the ―parent‖ unit’s PAS. Adding F to the front and a unique
       letter or number at the end (A, B, 1, 2, etc.). Provisional units may be registered by
       replacing the second F with an H and the character following that reflects it relationship
       to the parent.
       A2.4.1.3. The UTC in Section I of the SORTS DOC Statement is the five-character code
       from the unit’s registration BIDE. This UTC is the unit’s Deployment Indicator (DEPID)
       Code 9 non-deployable UTC.
       A2.4.1.4. The Unit ANAME is the standardized unit abbreviation from AFPD 38-5, Unit
       Designations, if available and a unit designation (number).
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                           317


   A2.4.2. Air Staff and MAJCOM FAM Tasking Documents may be used to obtain specific
   information on tasks and UTC configurations.
   A2.4.3. USAF WMP-3 is divided into three parts and contains information on Combat
   Forces and the AFWUS. WMP-3, Part 1 identifies AF General Purpose Combat Deployable
   Forces, Part 2 identifies Combat Support Deployable Forces (LRS, medical, chaplain,
   comm., etc.), and Part 3 is a list of USAF UTCs approved for use in planning and is the
   catalog of capabilities the AF offers to the supported CCs to build OPLAN taskings. The
   AFWUS is the system of record to record the UTC taskings of wings/units and to provide AF
   planners with a list of USAF UTCs available for tasking. MAJCOMs must disseminate this
   UTC availability information to their wings/units to ensure the units know what UTCs they
   are tasked to support. The AFWUS lists which units will provide UTCs, DOC Statements
   define what UTCs units are designated to support, and the MISCAP defines what specific
   capability the UTCs can provide.
   A2.4.4. USAF WMP-5 describes basic planning factors and data used for aircraft sortie and
   flying hour data.
   A2.4.5. A current manpower detail listing (MP-4 report) from a standard MANFOR retrieval
   may be used to determine current manpower and critical AFSC configurations for tasked
   UTCs.
   A2.4.6. A current Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) extract can be used to
   list tasks in various plans.
   A2.4.7. Refer to Table A2.2 for AFI references for SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.4.8. USAF WMP I, Annex F, lists medical unit response times.
A2.5. SORTS DOC Statement Preparation.
   A2.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS Office will:
      A2.5.1.1. Forward copies of initial SORTS DOC Statements to air staff-level functional
      offices of primary responsibility, as required, for review and coordination.
      A2.5.1.2. Keep a master file of all initial and reviewed SORTS DOC Statements.
      A2.5.1.3. HQ USAF/XOO reserves the right to challenge any SORTS DOC Statement.
   A2.5.2. MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will:
      A2.5.2.1. Develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS DOC Statements. All
      MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS
      DOC Statements using prepared system software, Microsoft Word Template, JetFlow, or
      MS Access. If an AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and
      ensure alternate methods provide all information on the AFF 723, Sections I through VI.
          A2.5.2.1.1. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed SORTS DOC Statements
          with the initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.).
          A2.5.2.1.2. AFRC and ANG will suspense gaining MAJCOM DOs/XOs with a date
          45 days after gaining MAJCOM receipt of the draft SORTS DOC Statement. If no
          response is received by the suspense date, then AFRC or ANG will assume
          MAJCOM concurrence on the SORTS DOC Statement as written.
 318                           AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


          A2.5.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) AF Form 723, SORTS DOC Statement, are developed,
          managed, reviewed and revised by the responsible USAFE SORTS FAMs. The
          USAFE Readiness Measures Office provides guidance and oversight of the SORTS
          DOC Statement process. DOC Statement Creation and DOC Statement Coordination
          Checklists are provided by the USAFE Readiness Measures office to assist FAMs in
          creating and publishing DOC Statements. DOC Statements must be completed using
          DOC Statement Checklist’s within established timelines. The AEF Policy and Joint
          Exercise Division (HQ USAFE/A3Z) will send out annual DOC Statement review
          notifications to all FAMs.
       A2.5.2.2. Provide HQ USAF SORTS with copies of all DOC Statements. MAJCOMs,
       who provide DOCs via web pages, must send an electronic mail (e-mail) to HQ USAF
       SORTS informing of new or updated DOCs. MAJCOMs that do not provide access to
       DOC Statements via web page must send an e-mail with the current DOC Statements
       attached. DOCs briefed in the Air Staff JQRR will be e-mailed regardless of availability.
       A2.5.2.3. The CRO will send the approved DOC Statement to the SRO.
          A2.5.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) SROs are notified by an official e-mail message when
          a new DOC Statement or FMTL is available or when an annual review has been
          accomplished.
       A2.5.2.4. Submit requests for new DOCIDs, not listed in Table A2.3, to HQ SORTS at
       least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date. This will provide adequate
       time to update computer programs.
       A2.5.2.5. Maintain a copy of all unit SORTS DOC Statements under their command.
   A2.5.3. Measured units and subordinate reporting organizations will:
       A2.5.3.1. Maintain a copy of each unit’s SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723).
       A2.5.3.2. Make sure the unit commander reviews the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723)
       as required per paragraph 1.11.11.1.8.
A2.6. SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. MAJCOM FAMs will review their respective
SORTS DOC Statements on an annual basis and prior to the statement anniversary date. If there
are any changes, FAMs must submit a new SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) to the local
SORTS office for processing IAW paragraph A2.5 Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU will
ensure HQ SORTS, all interested MAJCOMs, and reporting units receive a SORTS DOC
Statement annual review document that lists the unit UIC, ANAME, location, and DOCID.
Discrepancies should be addressed to the SORTS office that initiated the review. All SORTS
DOC Statements, other than initial statements, must have a current review date (less than one
year old). Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU SORTS office will be responsible for tracking
annual reviews and notifying FAMs when an annual review is due.
   A2.6.1. (Added-USAFE) SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. Upon completion of
   the annual review, if the responsible FAM determines that no changes are required to the
   existing DOC Statement, the FAM will accomplish a letter, signed by the DOC Statement
   Approval Authority, indicating completion of the annual review for the DOC Statement
   (Figure A9.4. (Added)). If changes are required and/or an FMTL is in place for the unit’s
   DOC Statement, the FAMs must contact USAFE Readiness Measures to receive the DOC
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                 319


   Statement Creation and DOC Statement Coordination Checklists. At that time, USAFE
   Readiness Measures, along with the FAM will establish a timeline for publishing the DOC
   Statement. FAMs must return the DOC Statement signed by the DOC Statement Approval
   Authority for distribution.
A2.7. SORTS DOC Statement Unit Tasking Changes. As a norm, SORTS DOC Statements
must be revised at least 30 days prior to any significant expected change(s) in unit tasking to
include, but not be limited to, changes in types of major equipment, unit mission, or unit
response time. Unexpected changes that may require DOC revision must be made no later than
60 days after changes are known.
   A2.7.1. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOA, and DRU develop and coordinate changes to unit SORTS
   DOC Statements. All MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will complete an AF Form 723. If
   the AF Form 723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and provide all information
   from the AFF 723, Sections I through IV. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed
   changes to SORTS DOC Statements with initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC,
   PACAF, etc.) IAW A2.5.2.1.2.
       A2.7.1.1. (Added-USAFE) All correspondence affecting a unit’s DOC Statement must
       be kept with the affected DOC Statement. FAMs must coordinate required changes to a
       unit’s SORTS DOC Statement with USAFE Readiness Measures. All changes affecting
       a unit’s SORTS DOC Statement must be drafted in the format specified in AFI 10-201
       paragraph A2.8.
   A2.7.2. Submit one copy of each unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement to HQ USAF
   SORTS as an attachment to e-mail or DMS message. Coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS for
   points of contact and addresses (if e-mail is not possible, coordinate for an alternate means to
   submit a unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement(s).
   A2.7.3. Accomplish actions listed from paragraph A2.5.2.3 through A2.5.3.2.
A2.8. SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) Instructions. Reference Figure A2.1 through
Figure A2.8 for samples of SORTS DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements will normally be
classified according to derivative classification guidance.
   A2.8.1. Part I, Unit Identification.
       A2.8.1.1. Measured Unit. Use the abbreviated name from SORTS BIDE set, ANAME
       field, that is paired to the UIC entry.
       A2.8.1.2. Home Location. Use the home geographic name and country or state code
       from the GEONA (geographic name) and CRTCD (country code) fields in the GEOFILE
       (geographic location file).
       A2.8.1.3. To establish a UTC use one of the following methods: 1) Use the DEPID Code
       9 UTC from the UTC label in SORTS. This is a non-deployable, in-place UTC, assigned
       by HQ USAF and used by the JCS for categorization of the unit type or 2) use a UTC
       from the tasked set that is most representative of the unit mission.
       A2.8.1.4. UIC. Use the code from SORTS BIDE set, UIC field.
320                            AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


      A2.8.1.5. DOC Mission Title. Select a long mission title from Table A2.3 that best
      describes the unit mission. If no available long mission title adequately describes the unit,
      recommend a new one to HQ USAF SORTS.
         A2.8.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) DOC Statements are written in all uppercase. When
         creating a SORTS DOC Statement for a unit which previously did not exist, FAMs
         must coordinate with USAFE Readiness Measures to obtain a DOC Mission Title
         which best describes the unit.
      A2.8.1.6. GEOLOC. Use the code from SORTS in the label HOGEO.
      A2.8.1.7. DOCID. Paired with the mission title entry, select the DOCID from Table
      A2.3 that was chosen for the DOC mission title.
         A2.8.1.7.1. For new titles, use the area letter and XX99 (e.g., SX99) as an interim
         DOCID. Request a new DOCID from HQ USAF SORTS using the format in Figure
         A2.9. Interim DOCIDs are valid for 90 days.
         A2.8.1.7.2. Submit request for changes to DOCIDs not listed in Table A2.3. to HQ
         USAF SORTS at least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date to
         provide adequate time to update computer programs. Tables in this instruction will
         follow with the next update cycle.
         A2.8.1.7.3. (Added-USAFE) When creating a SORTS DOC Statement for a unit
         which previously did not exist, and no Designed Operational Capability Statement
         Identifier (DOCID) exist in Table A2.3. FAMs must contact USAFE Readiness
         Measures to obtain a DOCID, if no DOCID exist in Table A2.3. of the basic
         publication, which best describes the unit.
      A2.8.1.8. DOCNR. Only the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will use DOCNR
      1. Major portions of the unit’s mission, listed in secondary mission SORTS DOC
      Statements, will use DOCNR 2 through 9. Subordinate portions of the unit’s mission,
      listed in tertiary mission SORTS DOC Statements will use DOCNR A through J.
      A2.8.1.9. Mission Rank. Select primary, secondary or tertiary via paragraph A2.3.
  A2.8.2. Part II, Mission Identification.
      A2.8.2.1. A. Mission Tasking Narrative. Describe the unit’s wartime mission in plain
      text using missions in AF Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-1, Air Force Task List. This is a
      summary of the mission capabilities the unit brings to the tasks for which it is designed.

        A2.8.2.2.1. Response Time. Enter the response time that upon which the C-level is
        based (from OPLAN, WMP-3, UTC, etc.). Enter the shortest time in hours (01 - 72
        hours) by which all unit resources are to be generated or prepared for deployment.
        Aircraft units response time source is the WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.1. For units with alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03,
            or surveillance missions, use the time required to employ all tasked forces. For
            aircraft units, the response time source is WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.2. Units with a mobility mission will use the time to begin loading of
            common user or organic lift before deployment (i.e., ready-to-load date at origin).
            A2.8.2.2.1.3. Active duty and specifically identified Reserve and Guard SF units
            must be able to deploy within 24 hours after notification per WMP 1, Annex T.
            A2.8.2.2.1.4. Reserve and Guard units not specifically identified must be able to
            deploy within 72 hours of notification.
            A2.8.2.2.1.5. Ensure response time for Reserve and Guard units includes 24
            hours for mobilization or call-up plus time allocated for preparation once
            mobilized. SF units will comply with Attachment 2, paragraphs A2.8.2.2.1.3
            and A2.8.2.2.1.4.
            A2.8.2.2.1.6. When response times exceed 72 hours or a source reference does
            not exist, use the default time of 72 hours IAW JCS policy. Do not use this default
            time for other than SORTS reporting.
        A2.8.2.2.2. Source. List the source for the response time. When the source reference
        does not exist, exceeds the default time, or if the default time was used, list ―AFI 10-
        201‖. Indicate the paragraph number of the source used within the provided brackets,
        e.g., [3.2.1.]. When "AFI 10-201" is listed as the source, reference the source
        document and paragraph number for the response time in part IV Amplifying Notes.
        A2.8.2.2.3. MDS. Use the WMP-3, Part 1 or USAF Program Document to enter the
        number and type of major equipment and PMAI. Do not include BAI. List the MDS
        for missiles (e.g., ICBMs).
        A2.8.2.2.4. Sorties/Flying Hours (aircraft units only). Use sortie factors in WMP-5 to
        enter sortie rates and sortie duration, and rates the unit is required to perform for its
        wartime mission(s).
     A2.8.2.3. UTCs Required to Support. Enter the UTCs for force packages that the unit is
     expected to be able to simultaneously support. These UTCs are the AFWUS UTCs with a
     Nonsourced Unit Type Code (NSUTC) of ―DWS‖, ―DWX‖ (the total number of standard
     UTCs coded as ―DW_‖ (DWS and DWX) represent the maximum number of standard
     UTCs the unit can deploy simultaneously during wartime surge and any UTCs associated
     with the unit's in-place wartime mission(s). All of these UTCs must be included in Part II
     of the DOC Statement and reported in the unit's SORTS C-Level.
        A2.8.2.3.1. For alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, and surveillance
        missions, use the unit’s in-place UTC (coded as ―non-deployable‖ in AFWUS), or
        other deployable UTCs required for home station support during wartime.

             A2.8.2.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) FAMs will input ―Refer to UTC Availability
             (UTA)‖ in Section IIC of the SORTS DOC Statement versus listing each UTC
             separately. At the bottom of Section IIC FAMs will input in parenthesis ―(see
             section IV for a list of UTCs)‖.
         A2.8.2.3.2. For mobility missions, list standard, deployable UTCs (AFWUS NSUTC
         codes of ―DWS‖ and ―DWX‖ as a minimum). Since UTC detail is used for
         measuring/reporting SORTS, ensure UTC detail is complete.
         A2.8.2.3.3. Use a combination of both deployable and in-place generation UTCs for
         combined in-place generation and mobility missions. Functional managers are
         responsible for de-conflicting the UTCs and providing guidance on which UTCs a
         unit can be expected to simultaneously support. Use remarks sections to illuminate
         how each tasking should be considered in light of others that may conflict (i.e.,
         assumptions in planning may exclude one or the other tasking like Operations Plan
         8044 Revision 03 and conventional mobility).
             A2.8.2.3.3.1. Units may be resourced to be able to provide combinations of
             UTCs that would in aggregate exceed their total assets, (i.e. parent-child UTCs)
             but they must not be postured/tasked in the AFWUS or plans beyond their
             authorized resource levels. UTC combinations that cannot be de-conflicted (i.e.
             Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03/mobility) should be delineated on the AF Form
             723, Section IV, Amplifying Notes. The assumptions on which a dual tasking lies
             must be provided or referenced.
             A2.8.2.3.3.2. If a unit shares a UTC tasking with another unit (split tasking), or is
             not required to support the entire UTC, place a hyphen (-) after the applicable
             UTC, and note the details in Part IIIA, Additional Notes. All units supporting the
             tasking will list the UTC in their SORTS DOC Statement. Each SORTS DOC
             Statement will list all of the units supporting the split UTC tasking.
             A2.8.2.3.3.3. Commander assessments will be based on providing either/or
             combinations of resources, not all simultaneously in these cases. When the unit
             commander must assess specific resource combinations, they should be listed. All
             instances of Parent-Child UTCs must first be approved by the USAF War and
             Mobilization Plans Division (AF/XOXW).
      A2.8.2.4. Direct Support Units UICs. Enter direct support unit UICs and ANAMEs.
      A2.8.2.5. OPLANs (Optional). List those OPLANs and other documents that the unit is
      tasked to support. Identify plans by command and number (e.g., United States
      Commander European Command (USCOMEUR) OPLAN 4102). This will classify the
      SORTS DOC Statement IAW the OPLAN classification guidance. If no specific OPLAN
      is identified, enter Command Directed.
  A2.8.3. Part III, Measured Resource Area.
      A2.8.3.1. Personnel Measured Area. Check the applicable box(s).
         A2.8.3.1.1. Total. Place an X in this box to indicate total personnel is to be reported,
         regardless of UMD or UTC, along with critical personnel listed in Table 3.1 and
         emergency essential and Key DOD civilians.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                               323


        A2.8.3.1.2. UMD and UTC. FAMs with alert, generation, combined in-place
        generation and mobility, or surveillance units will place an X in the UMD box to tell
        the unit to use the wartime requirements described in the UMD. Missions with
        mobility only taskings will have an X placed in the UTC box to tell the unit to use
        manpower details of UTCs listed in Section IIC of the SORTS DOC Statement. Units
        with a combined generation and mobility mission will list the UMD as the source
        document. Intelligence units may use MEMLs when matched by the UMD. The
        ―civilians‖ block will be marked with an X when US emergency essential or Key
        DOD civilians are part of the unit’s wartime requirement. Add additional notes as
        required.
        A2.8.3.1.3. Critical. Place an X in this box if the unit has critical AFSCs or packets
        listed in Chapter 3, Table 3.1 Critical personnel are those identified as essential to
        the launch, recovery, or turn around of a unit’s weapon system, or the direct
        accomplishment of the unit’s specified wartime mission. They are critical because
        their absence would materially effect the mission.
            A2.8.3.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) If critical personnel are to be measured, FAMs
            must include the rule number in Section IIIA of the SORTS DOC Statement next
            to the Critical Box. SROs will mark an ―X‖ in the box, upon receipt from USAFE
            Readiness Measures.
        A2.8.3.1.4. Civilians. Place an X in this box when the unit has emergency essential
        or Key DoD civilian requirements on UTC manpower details or coded emergency
        essential positions on the UMD. This directs units to include DoD emergency
        essential and Key civilian personnel requirements in C-level reporting but not
        personnel hired by host nation or contractors. Host nation or contractor personnel
        resources should be considered in commander assessment when relevant.
        A2.8.3.1.5. Additional Notes. Use this area to amplify other personnel measured area
        entries.
            A2.8.3.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) FAMs must ensure that each note listed in the
            Additional Notes sections of the SORTS DOC Statement are numbered
            appropriately. FAMs should include information such as split UTC tasking
            details, authorization or exemption of skill level substitutions, whether or not
            critical personnel are measured, and if Emergency Essential civilian personnel are
            measured.
        A2.8.3.1.6. Split UTC tasking details (i.e. UIC, AFSCs, number of requirements,
        etc.). Include adequate details for the unit known to have resources it provides for the
        split UTC tasking and which it measures in SORTS. Also include the names and
        locations of the other unit(s) supporting the split UTC taskings.
     A2.8.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC
     Statement lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general
     categories of support equipment and supplies to be measured. For each subarea in a
     category, list equipment followed by the subarea label (e.g., vehicles (ESSA4). If no
     subareas are used, use the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and EQSSE for
324                           AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


      support equipment. Source document names can replace long lists. Add additional notes
      as needed.

         4.1, Column C and subarea equipment types in Table 4.4 for which the unit has
         equipment and supplies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 4.10.
             A2.8.3.2.2.1. Spare engines and MRSP/IRSP for Strategic airlift units will be
             reported by MAJCOM in their fleet report and will not be reported at the unit
             level. Units report nothing in fields ESSA1 and ESSA2.
             A2.8.3.2.2.2. Units will ensure engine requirements in their DOC reflect the most
             recent WRE requirements.
             A2.8.3.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The first line in Section IIIB, Support
             Equipment, should read ―EQSSE EQUALS THE LOWEST PERCENT OF
             ESSA# - ESSA#.‖ Equipment must be listed in the following format: ESSA#:
             Equipment type (i.e. ESSA6: Global Command and Control System (GCCS)

         area entries to include:
             A2.8.3.2.3.1. Spares assessment driver for aircraft units. Indicate ASM, WSMIS-
             SAM, or RSP fill rates. Continue to use ASM unless your MAJCOM has
             authorized use of the WSMIS-SAM as an interim measure for reporting the spares
             subarea percentage. ASM is the primary means of determining the spares subarea
             percentage followed by the WSMIS-SAM (if approved by MAJCOM and HQ
             USAF/XOOA), then RSP fill rate when directed by parent MAJCOM.
                A2.8.3.2.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) PC-ASM assessments will be provided to
                units by the local base LRS.
             A2.8.3.2.3.2. All units with aircraft using ASM derived percentages for spare
             assessment will report IAW Table 4.9 Use the ASM as a commander’s tool to
             assess the unit’s overall C-level (if appropriate) and then report the ASM sortie
             percentage, ASM problem parts, and parts status in the ESSA1 remark.

               BASIC IDENTITY DATA ELEMENT (BIDE) REPORTING

A3.1. Basic Identity Data Element Purpose. Data entered through the BIDE set into the
SORTS database provides users with authoritative unit identity information. The BIDE set data
enables SORTS to fill its role as the central registry for all military units of the DoD. All AF
units with a PAS will be registered in SORTS.
   A3.1.1. Units with classified PAS codes (up to an including SECRET) will be registered. If
   the unit has a PAS code, the UIC will end with a zero ―0‖. In special cases, if the unit does
   not have a PAS code, the unit is formed from the parent unit. Use the parent UIC and
   substitute the 0 with a letter (A through Z). Units cannot reuse a previously registered unique
   UIC. If a subordinate unit merges with the parent UIC, then subsequently separates from the
   parent UIC again, the previous UIC should not be used for at least two years.
   A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC
   first two digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX)
   will use the third through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth
   character that best indicates the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41
   FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW Provisional [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS
   (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional [whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units with a
   unique PAS code will be registered using the last four of that PAS for the second through
   fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit is registered, the ORGLOCN sets must be entered
   in addition to BIDE set.
A3.2. BIDE Set Usage. The BIDE set is used in the following four specific instances for
SORTS message processing:
   A3.2.1. Used by the RPTOR to initially register an organization in SORTS.
   A3.2.2. Used to change previously reported data.
   A3.2.3. Used to delete data on a unit that inactivates/deactivates or was registered in error.
   A3.2.4. Used to validate unit registration.
A3.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities.
   A3.3.1. In concert with the JS and other Services, perform a semi-annual UIC validation.
   A3.3.2. Notify RPTOR of any known database discrepancies for immediate corrective
   action.
   A3.3.3. Maintain an updated version of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities. All CROs prepare
and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active, AF
Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
   A3.4.1. RPTORs will register their units when they are listed in the PAS directory or G-
   Series orders, unless permission is granted by HQ USAF/XOOA to register them before they
   are listed. RPTORs must ensure unit registration data is kept current and available in the joint
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                              351


   database. This includes adding or deleting missing or outdated information. Periodic
   comparisons will be undertaken to align PAS and BIDE records.
   A3.4.2. Individual measured units and SROs will not be responsible for BIDE reporting.
   A3.4.3. BIDE Data Validation to JCS. Use of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool will
   suffice as HQ USAF initial validation of BIDE data to the JS.
A3.5. Unit Registration.
   A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To
   initially register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN
   sets (according to Table A3.1, Table A3.2, and Table A3.3) using the ADD transaction
   code.
   A3.5.2. Changing Unit Registration Data. Using the CHANGE transaction code, report all
   mandatory and conditional fields that have changed since the unit’s initial registration.
      A3.5.2.1. After an initial BIDE report has been submitted use the TRANSFER set to
      change the RPTOR.
      A3.5.2.2. To delete existing data on a unit or when a unit has been registered in error,
      submit the BIDE report using the DELETE transaction code.
A3.6. AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
   A3.6.1. Reports and Checklists. The AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool contains three reports
   and their associated checklists: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN. Associated checklists
   allow plain language to be entered and then automatically converted into the appropriate
   codes/formats to be transmitted to the GSORTS processor.
      A3.6.1.1. The BIDE checklist contains all the necessary data to build a complete BIDE
      set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct
      data from a list, and some data being derived.
          A3.6.1.1.1. The Basic Identity Status screen displays the current UIC in the upper
          left portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.1.2. Enter the appropriate data into the Basic Identity Status checklist and
          select the ACCEPT button.
      A3.6.1.2. The RPTNORG checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
      complete RPTNORG set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
      selecting the correct data from a list.
          A3.6.1.2.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the
          RPTNORG checklist.
          A3.6.1.2.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.2.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT
          button.
      A3.6.1.3. The ORGLOCN checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a
      complete ORGLOCN set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or
      selecting the correct data from a list.

         NUCLEAR CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE REPORT (CBDRT)

A4.1. Reporting CBDRT C-Level. An inherent part of every unit’s mission is the ability to
survive and operate in a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) contaminated environment. IAW
CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resource and Training Systems (GSORTS), all SORTS
measured units are required to provide a separate readiness assessment in a CBDRT based on the
unit’s ability to perform its wartime mission for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear,
Biological, Chemical, Conventional (NBCC) Defense Operations and Standards, in a NBC
environment. This assessment is based on measurements of MRA NBC defense equipment and
the status of individual and unit level NBCC defense training.
   A4.1.1. The separate CBDRT report will be submitted concurrent with the unit’s primary
   SORTS report. The CBDRT includes an overall C-level rating, measured area level ratings
   for (1) NBC defense equipment and supplies and (2) NBCC defense training, and
   accompanying remarks to report a unit’s capability to perform its wartime mission in NBC
   conditions. These measured area ratings are specific to the unit’s NBC defense requirements
   and are to be reported in the CBDRT TREAD report. The CBDRT report may be a factor in
   the commander’s assessment of the unit’s primary overall SORTS C-level; however,
   CBDRT-specified calculation/measurements will not be reported in the regular SORTS
   reports. Units shall use AFSORTSDET version 1.3.8.9 or later to create the CBDRT SORTS
   report.
   A4.1.2. Measured units with no NBC defense equipment or training requirements must still
   submit a CBDRT report. They should report an overall C-5 with a S-6 in the equipment and a
   T-6 in the training areas with a REASON code of ―N‖ IAW AFI 10-201, Table A4.5 Also
   see paragraphs A4.2.2 and A4.3.1.
A4.2. NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies On-Hand Rating (ESRAT). The ESRAT is
based on the percentage of wartime NBC defense equipment that is MRA divided by the quantity
of NBC equipment required. The Equipment and Supplies area of the CBDRT report is broken
down into six categories of equipment (most units will report only Category 1) as shown in
Table A4.1 Report the ESRAT IAW Table A4.3 and enter the appropriate rating (S-level),
based on the lowest calculated equipment category that applies to the unit. For a CBDRT S-level
below S-1, state the reasons in the ESRES remark field of the CBDRT. Include the applicable
supply reason code (Table 4.5). If a unit does not have a requirement for a specific category of
NBC defense equipment, then enter a ―0‖ in that CBDRT equipment category.
   A4.2.1. Reporting ESRAT Percentages. All applicable units will list percentages for each
   category listed on the AFSORTSDET CBDRT page. Once information is filled in, and
   percentages are computed and accepted, a CBDRT ESRAT Remark is automatically
   formatted. Example of an automatic ESRAT Remark follows:
        LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRAT// GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD ESRAT CBDRT
        /IPE-MRA/8/IPE-REQ/9/IPE-PCT/89             (IPE = individual protective equipment)
        /DET-MRA/0/DET-REQ/0/DET-PCT/NA             (MRA = mission ready and available)
        /DEC-MRA/0/DEC-REQ/0/DEC-PCT/NA (REQ = required)

       that is MRA)
       /MED-MRA/0/MED-REQ/0/MED-PCT/NA                     (DET = detection equipment)
       /CPS-MRA/1/CPS-REQ/1/CPS-PCT/100                    (DEC = decontamination
       equipment)
       /S07-MRA/0/S07-REQ/0/S07-PCT/NA                     (RAD = radiological detection
       equipment)
       /S08-MRA/0/S08-REQ/0/S08-PCT/NA                     (MED = medical countermeasures)
       /S09-MRA/0/S09-REQ/0/S09-PCT/NA                     (CPS = collective protection system)
       /S10-MRA/0/S10-REQ/0/S10-PCT/NA//
      A4.2.1.1. For the detection category, enter only the data for the detection group with the
      lowest percentage MRA.
      A4.2.1.2. Do not enter data in S07 through S10. These entries area generated by the
      AFSORTSDET program, but are NOT used.
  A4.2.2. Enter plain text remarks identifying deficiencies and get well actions under the
  CBDRT ESRES remark field. The following is an unclassified example of an
  AFSORTSDET formatted ESRES remark:
   LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
   GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD CATEGORY 1 SHORTAGE OF 27 C-1 MOBILITY
   BAGS.
   ADDRESSED TO MAJCOM FOR FURTHER ACTION.
   Estimated get-well date: DDMMMYY//

  A4.2.3. No Equipment Requirements. Units in a nuclear, biological, chemical, and
  conventional (NBCC) low threat area (LTA) (NBCC threat areas are explained in AFI 10-
  2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations) with only an in-
  place mission, as identified by their DOC Statement or tasking system, have no NBC defense
  equipment requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this case, the unit
  should report a ―6‖ for the Equipment and Supplies subarea in the CBDRT report and ―SNM
  ― in ESRES.
  A4.2.4. Reportable NBC Equipment. (Table A4.1 can be used by MAJCOM FAMs to
  determine what categories their units should measure and report. The FAMs should identify
  which categories units are to measure and report within the add/ remark section of the unit’s
  DOC Statement.) The specific equipment items to measure in each category are listed in
  Table A4.2. Requirements vary based on unit mission and location. For units with both an
  in-place (generation) and a mobility mission, combine the requirements for reporting.
  Baseline Equipment Data Assessment List (BEDAL) equipment for first responders to
  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) incidents is not included in the CBDRT. The six
  equipment categories and applicable clarifications follow.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                               359


     A4.2.4.1. Category 1 Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). Count the number of C-1
     and D/ D-1 bags that are MRA, divided by the number required. AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1
     lists the required contents of C-1 bags. AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS)
     Program, lists the required contents of D/D-1 bags. To be MRA, a bag must contain 100
     percent of required items and each item must be serviceable IAW the applicable technical
     guidance. This 100 percent availability criteria is only for SORTS reporting. Unit
     commanders should follow guidance in AFI 10-403 and other MAJCOM guidance in
     determining risk of deploying individuals with partial IPE. Paragraphs A4.2.4.1.1
     through A4.2.4.1.4 identify unit IPE requirements by location. Paragraphs A4.2.4.1.5
     and A4.2.4.1.7 provide specific measurement and reporting instructions.
        A4.2.4.1.1. Continental United States (CONUS) units with a mobility mission or
        dual in-place and mobility mission: unit C-1 mobility bag requirements are
        established by AFI 10-2501 and MAJCOM guidance and should provide for every
        person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIc of the DOC Statement. When
        directed by the MAJCOM, flying units must have one D-bag equivalent for each
        aircrew member assigned to UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement.
        A4.2.4.1.2. Outside CONUS (OCONUS) units in LTAs:
            A4.2.4.1.2.1. For a mobility mission, the unit must have the equivalent of one C-
            1 bag for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the
            unit’s DOC Statement. As directed by MAJCOM, flying units must also have one
            D-1 and one D-bag equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-
            301, Vol 1.
            A4.2.4.1.2.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, there are no requirements.
         A4.2.4.1.3. OCONUS units in medium threat areas (MTAs):
            A4.2.4.1.3.1. For the mobility mission, the unit has a requirement of one C-1 bag
            equivalent for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the
            unit DOC Statement.
            A4.2.4.1.3.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, a unit has a requirement of a
            C-1 mobility bag equivalent for all military and emergency essential civilian
            personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-2501.
            A4.2.4.1.3.3. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
            equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
        A4.2.4.1.4. OCONUS units in high threat areas (HTAs):
            A4.2.4.1.4.1. Units have a requirement of a C-1 bag equivalent for all military
            and emergency essential civilian personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-
            2501.
            A4.2.4.1.4.2. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag
            equivalent for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
        A4.2.4.1.5. Instructions for units that get their C-1 mobility bags from an LRS:
        MAJCOMs will provide guidance to their reporting units on how to count and report
        on centrally stored bags. Use these criteria when preparing that guidance:
360                           AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010


             A4.2.4.1.5.1. To provide consistency in reporting, the supporting LRS should
             calculate a base wide IPE availability percentage for centrally managed bags. This
             is calculated by dividing total MRA bags and bag equivalents by the total required
             (see paragraph A4.2.3.1.5.3 to establish the total centrally managed
             requirement). This percentage should be provided to all appropriate units to use in
             their CBDRT SORTS report. The supporting LRS must count the number of
             MRA tariff and individually sized bags that are or could be built up with
             resources O/H.
             A4.2.4.1.5.2. Units should report their unit IPE requirement (percentage of bags
             available) based on the LRS-provided percentage of available IPE. Units multiply
             the LRS-provided percentage by the number of bags required to determine the
             number of ―unit bags‖ to report as available/O/H.
             A4.2.4.1.5.3. Centrally managed requirements will be a sum of all unit
             requirements (as outlined in paragraphs A4.2.3.1 through A4.2.3.4) minus
             requirements for units that manage their own bags. All OCONUS units in MTAs
             and HTAs have C-1 bag requirements, but some of those units are not required to
             submit SORTS reports. Be sure to include the C-1 bag requirements for those
             units in this centrally managed total, unless those units manage their own bags.
             Per AFI 10-2501, the Installation Readiness Working Group will provide the total
             IPE requirements to the supporting LRS.
             A4.2.4.1.5.4. One bag or bag equivalent can be used to satisfy no more than one
             requirement. The total number of centrally stored bags reported available for all
             units, cannot exceed the number of complete bags (or bag equivalents) that are
             available in central storage plus the number of bags that have been issued to
             currently deployed personnel.
             A4.2.4.1.5.5. Count bags issued for real world deployments as available.
             A4.2.4.1.5.6. MAJCOMs can provide additional procedures in cases where C-1
             bag allocation is applied to priority units on a base.
         A4.2.4.1.6. Flying units must report IPE requirements for all required aircrew,
         ground crew and direct support unit personnel—not just on aircrew.
         A4.2.4.1.7. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
      A4.2.4.2. Category 2 Detection Equipment. Count the detection and monitoring
      equipment listed in Table A4.2, Column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement
      and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 bag detection items
      (i.e., M8 and M9 paper) in this category). To count as MRA, category 2 equipment must
      have enough serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H to support operations for
      up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602. Divide MRA equipment by total number required
      for each detection group in this category. Report the category status based on the
      detection group with the lowest percent available. UTC requirements are listed in
      LOGFOR, AS, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
         A4.2.4.2.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support requirements for units in
         MTAs and HTAs.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                            361


        A4.2.4.2.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.3. Category 3 Decontamination Equipment. Count decontamination equipment
     listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement and for in-
     place base support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 mobility bag detection items,
     i.e., M291 and M295 decontamination kits in this category). Divide MRA equipment by
     total number required. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF
     functional area guidance.
        A4.2.4.3.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support decontamination
        equipment requirements for units in MTAs and HTAs.
        A4.2.4.3.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.4. Category 4 Radiation, Detection, Indication, and Computation (RADIAC)
     equipment. Count RADIAC equipment listed in Table A4.2, column B, for UTCs listed
     in the unit DOC Statement and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs. Divide
     MRA by total number required. To count as available, Category 4 equipment must have
     the required serviceable batteries and support equipment O/H. UTC requirements are
     listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
        A4.2.4.4.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support equipment requirements
        for units in MTAs and HTAs.
        A4.2.4.4.2. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.5. Category 5 Medical Countermeasures. See paragraph A4.2.5.1.5.
     A4.2.4.6. Category 6 Collective Protection. Count the number of transportable collective
     protection systems, in Table A4.2, column B, that are MRA. Divide by total number
     required. To count as MRA, a collective protection system must have 100 percent of the
     critical components (those that are needed to make the system fully operational). All
     critical components must be serviceable in accordance with technical data on the report
     date. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area
     guidance. See paragraph A4.2.1 on reporting percentage information.
  A4.2.5. Reportable Medical NBC Equipment. Medical units will report their equipment
  UTCs as follows:
     A4.2.5.1. In cases of more than one item for a given field, enter the lowest percentage.
     Report only on equipment and supplies the unit is required to maintain. For units that
     possess no CBDRT material, as described below, report codes S-6 in ESRAT and SNM
     in ESRES. For categories two and three, do not report those items contained in C-1 bags.
     If the medical logistics (MEDLOG)/ defense medical logistics standard support
     (DMLSS) end-of-month (EOM) Stock Status Report reflects WRM project at zero
     percent, it represents a requirement with no material O/H and should be reported as such.
     UTCs that contain equipment in categories two, three, and four will still report their
     overall Material Availability Percentage (MAP) in the unit SORTS report in addition to
     the itemized reporting in the CBDRT portion of their SORTS report.
        A4.2.5.1.1. Category One Medical IPE Equipment. Follow guidance in A4.2.4.1.

       6665-01-133-4964 - Detection Kit, Chemical Agent, M256A1

       Detection Group C - N/A
       6665-01-494-8725 - DoD Biological Sampling Kit (Hand Held Assays)
      A4.2.5.1.3. Category Three - Medical Decontamination Equipment. Medical units
      will report the lowest total material readiness percentage of the two items (using the
      MEDLOG IWB transaction or DMLSS MTF catalogue search) as outlined below for
      the following stock numbers:
       4230-01-251-8702 - Decontaminating Apparatus, M17
       6850-01-357-8456 - Decontamination Kits, M295
      A4.2.5.1.4. Category Four - Medical RADIAC Equipment. Medical units will report
      the lowest total material readiness percentage of the four items assigned to the unit
      (using the MEDLOG IWB transaction or DMLSS MTF catalogue search) as outlined
      below for the following stock numbers:
       6665-01-320-4712 - ADM - 300, Kit A
       6665-01-426-5071 - ADM - 300, Kit B

       6665-01-426-5071 - ADM - 300, Kit E
      A4.2.5.1.5. Category 5 - Medical Countermeasures. Report the total materiel
      readiness percentage for DET A, Project Code BA as reflected on the MEDLOG
      WRM Stock Status Report or the DMLSS, Gross Readiness Percentage as reflected
      on the Assemblage Status Report. Medical countermeasures requirements are outlined
      in AFMAN 23-110, Vol 5, Air Force Medical Materiel Management System –
      General. See AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training for detailed
      measurement and reporting instructions.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                363


           A4.2.5.1.6. Category 6 - Medical Collective Protection. Medical units will calculate
           percentages for UTCs; FFCPA, FFCPB, FFCPC, FFCPD, and FFCPW, whose critical
           equipment MAPs are at 100 percent (using the MEDLOG inquire WRM balance
           (IWB) transaction or DMLSS Assemblage Status Report, Gross Readiness Percentage
           (use the ESRAT)). If the critical equipment material availability percentage is less
           than 100 percent, the equipment is not considered MRA, and will be reported at zero
           percent, regardless of how much of the other material in the UTC is O/H. Divide the
           total number of these UTCs that are MRA by the number of UTCS required, and
           multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage to be reported under the ESRAT label.
            Example Calculations:
            FFCPA Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)
            FFCPB Critical O/H = 99 percent (Not MRA, count as 0)
            FFCPW Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)


            UTCs O/H/UTCs Required = percent
              2                  3           = 67 percent (report in ESSA6)

A4.3. Individual and Unit NBCC Defense Training Rating (TRRAT). The training portion
of the CBDRT report has two categories: individual NBCC defense training and unit NBCC
defense task qualification training (TQT). Determine the percent of personnel (or crews) who are
current in each training category. Based on the category with the lowest percent available, report
NBCC defense training status IAW Table A4.4 and enter the appropriate T-level rating
(TRRAT). TRRAT is calculated IAW applicable training methods of Chapter 6, Method B
(paragraph 6.2); Method C, Option 1 (paragraph 6.3), or Method C, Option 2 (paragraph
6.4). For units measuring under Method C, Option 2, use Table 6.3 Flying units shall report
training status for all required aircrews, ground crews and direct support unit personnel. For a
CBDRT T-level below T-1, insert the applicable training reason code (from Table 6.5) in the
TRRES field and explain the reasons in TRRES remarks. If a unit does not have a requirement
for a specific category of NBCC defense training, then enter a ―0‖ in the required category.
   A4.3.1. No Training Requirements. Units in LTAs with only an in-place mission have no
   NBCC defense training requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this
   case, the unit should report a ―6‖ representing a non measured training subarea in the
   CBDRT report and TNM in TREAS.
   A4.3.2. Individual NBCC Defense Training. Count the number of military and emergency-
   essential civilian personnel who are current in individual NBCC Defense Training, divided
   by the total number of personnel assigned who are required to have the training (AFI 10-
   2501).
       A4.3.2.1. Units with a mobility mission: Every person assigned to a deployable UTC as
       listed in Part IIC of the unit’s DOC Statement is required to be current in this training.
       A4.3.2.2. Units assigned in either MTAs or HTAs: Every military and emergency-
       essential civilian assigned to the unit must be current in this training.

   A4.3.3. Unit NBCC Defense Task Qualification Training (TQT). Count the number of
   military and emergency-essential civilian personnel who are current in NBCC Defense TQT,
   divided by the total number of assigned personnel required to have the training. General
   NBCC Defense TQT requirements are listed in AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 10-2602. To be
   TQT trained, unit personnel must be task trained using the general and functional NBCC
   defense tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) listed in AFMAN 10-2602, Attachment 4,
   all published HQ USAF functional area TTPs per AFMAN 10-2602, paragraph A4.1.2, and
   all unit identified TTPs per AFI 10-2501, paragraphs 2.11.2, 9.3.5, and 9.7.8.
   A4.3.4. The lowest percentage of paragraph A4.3.2 or A4.3.3 is used to assign a training
   level (T-level) under the TRRAT field IAW Table A4.4 State the reasons for a below T-1
   status in the TRRES field and the applicable training reason code from Table 6.5.
   A4.3.5. Training Remarks. TRRAT remarks are automatically formatted by the
   AFSORTSDET CBDRT page and list number of personnel who require training, the number
   who are current in their training, and the percent of personnel complete and current for each
   training category (individual NBC defense and unit level TQT). In plain text English,
   TRRES remarks should explain deficiencies and get well actions. The following are
   examples of the AFSORTSDET formatted remarks:
     LABEL/U/A/LABEL:TRRAT//

A4.4. Special NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies Reporting Requirements. To provide
visibility to installation-wide requirements and capabilities, CE units have an additional special
CBDRT reporting requirement. MAJCOMs will specify this special reporting requirement in
Section IV of a unit’s SORTS DOC Statement.
   A4.4.1. OCONUS CE Units in NBCC MTAs and HTAs. Once each quarter (in January,
   April, July, and October), report the status of in-place collective protection assets.
        A4.4.1.1. For an in-place mission in MTAs and HTAs, list the number of collective
        protection spaces that are required and the number that are MRA. To count as MRA, the
        shelter must be fully operational (see AFMAN 10-2602). If it is not, none of the spaces in
        that shelter can count as MRA.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                                 365


       A4.4.1.2. MAJCOMs must specify in-place requirements. If theater or MAJCOM
       guidance is not provided, units should report MRA, rest and relief collective spaces for
       30 percent (assumes each space will support two people over a 24-hour period) of the in-
       place and deployed AF personnel plus the number of collective protection spaces used in
       medical, command and control, and other function-specific facilities. MAJCOMs will
       provide guidance as to how many additional spaces to include for the protection of
       transient aircrew and passengers into the collective protection calculation. Use any
       combination of Class I-IV transportable, fixed facility, or expedient collective protection
       systems to satisfy the total requirement. Do not include collective protection systems
       assigned to deployable UTCs. (See AFMAN 10-2602.)
       A4.4.1.3. In an ESRES remark, provide both the required and the MRA number of
       collective protection spaces. If reporting in-place requirements, this remark and the report
       must be classified SECRET. The following is an Unclassified example of the
       AFSORTSDET CBDRT formatted remark:
        LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
        GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD INPLACE COLLECTIVE PROTECTION SPACES /
        REQ 1300/ MRA 120//
A4.5. Overall CBDRT C-level. Unit Commanders will assign an overall CBDRT C-level
based on the lowest of the ESRAT and TRRAT. CBDRT overall C-level is assigned based on
definitions in paragraph 1.12, relevant to the unit’s ability to operate in CB conditions. An
overall C-level will be entered in the READY field under TREAD = CBDRT report. If
applicable, a primary reason (in plain text) should be stated under the CBDRT TREAD REASN
remark label, while using an applicable reason code from Table 4.5 and Table 6.5 for the area
ratings. CBDRT reports will be submitted in conjunction with the unit’s primary SORTS report.
Commander CBDRT assessments are not applicable to CBDRT reports, however the CBDRT
overall rating can be factored into commander assessments of overall unit readiness in the
primary unit SORTS reports. An example AFSORTSDET CBDRT overall set is shown below:
 OVERALL/U/A/RICDA:YYMMDD/TREAD:CBDRT/READY:3/REASN:S/-/-//
 EQSUPPLY/ ESRAT:3/ESRES:SRA//
 TRAINING/TRRAT:2/TRRES:TNB//
A4.6. CBDRT Data Requirements.Table 4.5. and Table 6.5. list applicable reason codes
for use with CBDRT. No FORECAST Set data is required. Only applicable Equipment and
Training reason codes listed in Table 4.5. and Table 6.5. will be used for CBDRT overall and
subarea level ratings (S-level, and T-level). Use the REASN code from Table A4.5. for the
CBDRT overall rating.

    MAJOR EQUIPMENT LOCATION AND CREW INFORMATION (MEQLOCN)

A5.1. MEQLOCN Description.
A5.1.1. MEQLOCN is a major equipment location set reported in SORTS for those units
possessing major equipment (aircraft, missiles, etc.).
   A5.1.2. MEQLOCN is used to report the location and status of major equipment items and
   crews authorized to the unit.
      A5.1.2.1. Includes MEQPT and crew status at a unit’s present and deployed locations.
      A5.1.2.2. Equipment and crews that will be off station for less than 72 hours (with
      response time not a key factor) are not considered deployed and do not need to be
      reported in a separate MEQLOCN set.
      A5.1.2.3. Major equipment in PDM are not reported in a separate MEQLOCN set,
      account for major equipment in PDM in a remark using the ―MEPSD‖ Label.
A5.2. Reporting Information.
   A5.2.1. MEQLOCN sets report on the type of equipment, the number of crews at a given
   location, and the location of deployed equipment and/or crews.
   A5.2.2. Total numbers, reported for unit resource data (equipment and crews), at various
   locations must equal total assigned, possessed, formed, and mission ready.
   A5.2.3. MEQLOCN sets are reported as a stand alone set of a unit’s SORTS report. A unit
   will develop and maintain their MEQLOCN set(s) using the current AFSORTSDET version.
      A5.2.3.1. Submit the MEQLOCN set on a unit authorized or possessing major
      equipment items. Submit the set for each combination of major equipment, type, and
      location to show status at all locations being occupied by the unit. There is no limit to the
      number of MEQLOCN sets a unit may report.
      A5.2.3.2. MEQLOCN sets are reported using an Add, Change or Delete set transaction
      code. The Add transaction code should ONLY be used the very first time a MEQLOCN
      set is added to the database. Any subsequent reporting of the MEQLOCN sets that are
      changing data should utilize the Change transaction. If the set is to be deleted, the Delete
      transaction code is used. If a unit continuously uses the Add transaction code, the number
      of equipment and crews will constantly double with each report, causing the unit’s
      database to have incorrect data.
      A5.2.3.3. When submitting MEQLOCN sets, units should ensure the numbers of
      deployed crews or equipment do not exceed the total number possessed, and change
      accordingly. SORTS reporting personnel must know what is in the database for the UIC
      being reported.
      A5.2.3.4. When a unit deletes the number of previously reported equipment at deployed
      locations, the system will return equipment numbers back to the home or UNIT location.
      A5.2.3.5. Units should ensure that the proper security classification value is applied to
      each MEQLOCN set every time it is reported.

           /CREWA:6/ CREWF:6/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/NEWLOC:UNIT//
          A5.2.3.6.4. Changing numbers at a unit with a Change transaction:

           MEQLOCN/U/C/MEQPT:C-130E/-/MEPSA:29/MEPSD:29/-/-/-/-
           /CREWA:29/CREWF:29//

               A5.2.3.6.5. Move all remaining numbers from the deployed location to the home
       location with the delete transaction:

           MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E/TEGEO:CNBC//
          A5.2.3.6.6. Removing the MEQLOCN record when the Aircraft Type identified in
          MEQPT is no longer in the unit’s inventory:

           MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E/-// or MEQLOCN/U/D/MEQPT:C-130E//

 TRANSPORTABLE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL DATA.
             (UTC PACKAGE DEPLOYABILITY STATUS)

A6.1. Required Actions:
   A6.1.1. Identify the package being reported on. Units may be required to provide a number
   of the same UTC packages. To uniquely identify a package, enter two secondary control
   elements according to the following:
       A6.1.1.1. Check the DOC Statement for the UTC. Enter it under the label UTC each
       time there’s a ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
       A6.1.1.2. Find the Designated Item Serial Number using the following rules and enter it
       under the Designated Item Serial Number (MESEN) label each time there’s a
       ―PACKAGE‖ transaction.
          A6.1.1.2.1. For Equipment and Personnel UTCs check for a force requirement
          number (FRN) in plan’s time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD). If there’s
          an FRN, use its first three characters as the first three characters and a sequence
          number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) as the last character of the MESEN. If there isn’t an FRN, use
          a four-digit sequence number (e.g., 0001, 0002, etc.).
          A6.1.1.2.2. For Equipment UTCs use the first four characters of the major
          equipment’s serial number as MESEN.
          A6.1.1.2.3. For Personnel UTCs use ―P‖ as the first character and a three-digit
          sequence number as the last three characters (e.g., P001, P002, etc.) of MESEN.
       A6.1.1.3. For the DOC Listed UTC(s) enter a ―Y‖ if tasked or an ―N‖ if not tasked,
       under label DTASK.
   A6.1.2. Show Major Equipment Operational Status for Specified Package. Commanders will
   select the operational status in Table A6.1, which most closely matches the current status of
   the prime equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Prime
   Equipment Operational Status (PEQS). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―prime
   equipment is fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If
   changed, enter it under label PEQFR.
   A6.1.3. Show Support Equipment Operational for Specified Package. Commanders will
   select the operational status in Table A6.2, which most closely matches the current status of
   the support equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Support
   Equipment Status (SEDY). If status is other than ‖not applicable‖ or ―support equipment is
   fully operational,‖ forecast the date the equipment will be fully operational. If changed, enter
   it under label Support Equipment Forecast Ready Date (SEQFR).
   A6.1.4. Show the Assigned Team Status for Specified Package. Commanders will select the
   team status in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the status of the personnel required
   by the specified package. If changed, enter it under the label for Assigned Team Status
   (TEDY). If status is other than ―not applicable‖ or ―assigned team status is satisfactory,‖
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                             373


  forecast the date the team will be operational. If changed, enter it under the label for Team
  Status Satisfactory Forecast Date (TEAFR).
  A6.1.5. Show the Overall Operational Condition and Deployment Status of Specified UTC
  Package. Commanders will select the overall operational condition and deployability status
  in Table A6.3, which most closely matches the current status of the specified package. If
  changed, enter it under the Expected Availability Category (EXDAC) label. If the status is:
     A6.1.5.1. UTC is redeployable, deployed, or en route, check the actual deployment date.
     If changed, enter it under the label for UTC Forecast Ready Date (UTCFR).
     A6.1.5.2. UTC is committed, forecast the deployment date. If changed, enter in UTCFR.
     A6.1.5.3. Either of the above, show status of the deployed or committed UTCs. If a UTC
     is deployed or committed to deploy, report this data depending on the status showing
     using the EXDAC field:
         A6.1.5.3.1. In the Deployment Control Number (DCN), if reporting that the UTC is
         deployed, committed, or en route, check the deployment tasking number, departure
         control number, or deployment control number issued by the MAJCOM for the
         specified UTC package movement. If the number is unknown, use ―XXXXX‖ as the
         number. If changed, enter it under label DCNDY.
         A6.1.5.3.2. For Equipment Return Date, if reporting UTC is redeployable,
         committed, deployed, or en route, forecast the date the specified package is expected
         to return from deployment. If changed, enter it under the label for Equipment Return
         Date (EQRET).
         A6.1.5.3.3. For GEOLOC Code, if reporting UTC is redeployable, committed,
         deployed, or en route, find the GEOLOC code matching the specified package’s
         present location in the GEOFILE. If changed, enter it under the label for
         Geographical Location of Equipment (GEOGR).
     A6.1.5.4. Other than those above, or if the UTC is fully operational and deployable,
     forecast the date the package will be operational and deployable. Anytime the EXDAC is
     other than ―A‖ enter it under the label UTCFR.
  A6.1.6. Prepare remarks to explain the situation. When they occur, prepare remarks to
  explain any of the situations listed below. Don’t duplicate remarks if situations have same
  explanations.
     A6.1.6.1. When specified UTCs have sub-elements deployed state which sub-elements
     are deployed, the deployment number, the estimated return date, and the UTC operational
     capability remaining. Create the remark under the label EXDAC.
     A6.1.6.2. When a unit has major equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
     deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective
     actions taken. Create the remark under the PEQS label.
     A6.1.6.3. When a unit has support equipment deficiencies explain the impact the
     deficiencies have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective
     actions taken. Create the remark under the SEDY label.

        A6.1.6.4. When a unit has personnel deficiencies explain the impact the deficiencies
        have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective actions
        taken. Create the remark under the TEDY label.
   A6.1.7. Submit ―PACKAGE‖ with the unit SORTS report. Ensure accurate data is reflected
   each time a unit SORTS report is submitted. Take add, delete, or change action as necessary.

            USAFE SORTS STAFF ASSISTANCE VISIT (SAV) PROGRAM

A8.1. (Added-USAFE) (USAFE) SORTS SAVs.
   A8.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE SORTS Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) is designed to
   assess SRO and unit reporting compliance, with baseline standards, according to AFI 10-201,
   AFI 90-201 USAFE Supplement, Inspector General Activities, and this supplement. In
   addition, provide operational requirements, training, and suggestions for improving wing
   SRO overall effectiveness.
   A8.1.2. (Added-USAFE) SAVs will be scheduled and conducted annually. The schedule
   will be transmitted to each unit and published at (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/
   EntryCop.asp?Filter=OO-OP-FE-01). A message will be sent to specific units, as applicable,
   if a date change is necessary. Note: Every effort will be made to ensure that the SAV is
   conducted prior to a Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI), Operational Readiness Inspection
   and/or Surety Inspection.
   A8.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The most current UCI report will be used as the basis of
   measurement for all SORTS programs. The most current UCI SORTS checklists will be
   located on the USAFE Portal, USAFE Publications page under the ―Checklists‖ heading.
   A8.1.4. (Added-USAFE) The SAV will be conducted in conjunction with SRO training,
   as applicable. Training will be conducted using the USAFE Command Post Master Training
   Plan (MTP), SORTS Training, attachment. The SRO (primary and alternate) appointed by
   the wing/group commander must be present for this training. Training will be documented
   and maintained according to paragraph 1.11.10.2.1.5.1. (Added) Measured unit commanders
   must ensure their SORTS representatives (measured unit monitors) are available to provide
   the SORTS program information to the SAV team members for review. In addition,
   measured unit SAVs will be scheduled by the SAV team after they arrived station, and not
   before, unless otherwise determined by USAFE Readiness Measures. SROs will notify all
   unit monitors (primary and/or alternate) to be available for the duration of the SAV. Also,
   the unit commander must inform the wing SORTS manager during coordination of the SAV,
   if they would like a one-on-one in and or outbrief.
   A8.1.5. (Added-USAFE) The SAV team will provide the Command Post (CP) with a
   message and/or e-mail confirming arrival/departure dates, team composition, Entry
   Authorization List (EAL) and in-brief/out-brief availability not later than 30 days before
   arrival. Team visits will normally be 3-5 days. The CP chief will verify if the wing
   commander/alternate desires a SAV team chief in/out-brief and coordinate, appropriately. If
   an out-brief is desired, an appointment should be made for the last duty day of the visit.
A8.2. (Added-USAFE) (USAFE) Non-compliant SAV results.
   A8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) To ensure appropriate senior leadership involvement in non-
   compliant SORTS programs, wing commanders will ensure the Subordinate Reporting
   Organization (SRO) prepares and submits a Get Well Plan to HQ USAFE/A3Z no later than
   the date indicated in the SAV report.
AFI10-201_USAFESUP_INCIRLIKABSUP_I 20 MAY 2010                                            379


   A8.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The USAFE Readiness Measures office will conduct one-on-
   one training with the primary/alternate SRO within 30 days of the SAV, if desired. Training
   is unit funded and conducted at Ramstein Air Base, GE to allow the SRO uninterrupted
   personalized training.
   A8.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The wing may request USAFE Readiness Measures personnel
   return, no earlier than 90 days from the initial SAV date, to ensure the wing program is in
   compliance according to the Unit Compliance Inspection Checklist and to provide one-on-
   one training to the SRO. The wing will fund this secondary SAV.
A8.3. (Added-USAFE) The respective HQ USAFE functional manager, and 2-letter directorate
(Security Forces (SF), Communications and Information (SC) etc.) are highly encouraged to
develop SORTS reporting guides for their responsible area. An area specific checklist/guide is
desired to identify functionally unique SORTS requirements. If developed, coordinate such
guides through USAFE Readiness Measures and HQ USAFE/IG.

INTRODUCTION
1. BACKGROUND
1.1. The Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS) was designed to provide
an Automated Data Processing (ADP) and related general support tool to the National Military
Command System (NMCS). GSORTS functions as the central registry of all Operational Units
in the US Armed Forces. It is the single, automated reporting system within the Department of
Defense that provides the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Joint Staff with accurate and
timely unit identification, location, assignment, personnel, and equipment data for the registered
units and organizations of the U.S. Armed Forces, Defense Agencies, and certain foreign and
international organizations involved in operations with the U.S. Armed Forces. GSORTS also
provides an assessment of how resources and training levels will affect a unit’s ability to
undertake its wartime mission(s).
2. REPORTING
2.1. One component of the SORTS system is the Readiness Assessment System (RAS) Input
Tool (RAS IT). It is the DoD resource-and unit-monitoring system designed to support unit
readiness reporting and assessment, crisis response, and deliberate planning information
requirements. The SORTS database reflects the current status of selected resources of a
reporting unit against that unit’s assigned wartime mission(s). The resource areas reported
through the RAS IT are personnel, training, equipment on-hand, and equipment condition.
Additionally, Overall and Chemical and Biological Data Resources and Training (CBDRT) are
measured areas and as such are an integral part of the Input Tool. However, the CBDRT does
not affect the READY level of a unit.
2.2. The RAS IT is a source and destination of information from the SORTS database. The
system uses an Internet web browser to display application Graphical User Interface (GUI)
screens to the user. By using a browser interface, the RASIT will be available to any platform
with a Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) connection. The RASIT provides
users with on-line, interactive access to enter or update data in the SORTS database. There are
two segments that make up the RASIT: the RAS Input Tool (RASIT) and the RAS Interactive
Transaction Processor (RASITP). The RASIT is the icon found on the client workstation Global
Command and Control System (GCCS) desktop; the user clicks on the icon to start the input
tool. The RASITP is a software segment that maintains an open ―gateway‖ between the SORTS
database and the client workstation.

3. Required Reading
3.1. It is important for the trainee to read and understand the usefulness of AFI 10-201 Status of
Resources and Training System and AFI 10-201 USAFE Supplement.


            TASK RM: SORTS RESPONSIBILITIES AND MEASURED AREAS
INTRODUCTION: Within the Air Force, individual wings (and sometimes squadrons) prepare
and submit their GSORTS reports directly to the Joint SORTS processor. The use of
standardized labels, fields, sets and general text remarks allows for timely extraction of
information from the database by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), warfighting
combatant commanders, Air Staff, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). The standard web-based
input tool uses RASIT.
CRITERION OBJECTIVE: Understand SORTS procedures as applicable to USAFE.
STANDARD: USAFE SORTS managers and monitors should be able to complete Task RM at a
minimum task performance level 3; minimum task knowledge level b; minimum subject
knowledge level B (ref: AFSC 1C3X1 CFETP).

TASK RC: SORTS REPORT CONSOLIDATION
INTRODUCTION: AF SORTS reporting is designed to provide a timely and accurate
assessment of the status of resources required by a measured unit to accomplish its wartime
mission(s). It also populates a database with essential resources and training management
information for MAJCOM, HQ USAF, Warfighting Combatant Commanders, and JCS use. The
National Military Command Center (NMCC) depends primarily on reports from defense
agencies and services in establishing the SORTS database.
CRITERION OBJECTIVE: Consolidate information and prepare a SORTS report.
STANDARD: USAFE SORTS managers and monitors should be able to complete Task RC at a
minimal to task performance level 3, minimum task knowledge level b, and a minimum subject
knowledge level B, with guidance from trainer (ref: AFSC 1C3X1 CFETP).

TASK SR: SUBMISSION OF UNIT SORTS REPORT
INTRODUCTION: GSORTS was designed to provide an automated data processing (ADP) and
general support to the National Military Command System (NMCS). GSORTS functions as the
Central Registry of all Operational Units in the U.S. Armed Forces. It is the single, automated
reporting system within the Department of Defense and the National Military CommandCenter
(NMCC) depends primarily on reports from defense agencies and services in establishing the
JCS SORTS database. Each USAF MAJCOM is responsible for ensuring units in their area of
responsibility (AOR) comply with the JCS-directed frequency of reporting. To accomplish this,
USAFE has established a SORTS audit program, which ensures accurate and timely reporting.
Corrective actions such as quality control and training are applied to identify units and/or areas
needing attention. Unit errors found on the HHQ audit report will be corrected within 24 hours.
CRITERION OBJECTIVE: Submit accurate, timely SORTS reports; retrieve, interpret and
correct SORTS Error Messages.
