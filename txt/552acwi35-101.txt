SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction further clarifies the number of personnel authorized during friends and family
member tours. It changes the information required by 72d Security Forces Squadron (72 SFS) on
Entry Authorization Lists (EALs) for both the restricted area and base access. A bar ( | )

1. Policy
     1.1. The 552 ACW tour program is a function of the 72 ABW Public Affairs Office in
     accordance with Memorandum of Agreement between 72d ABW and 552 ACW for Public
     Affairs support para 6.1.7. This program is designed to earn public understanding and
     acceptance of the wing’s mission and its equipment. The Public Affairs Office will oversee
     all Wing tours conducted for community groups and oversee the ―Family and Friends Tour‖
     program. Protocol will oversee all tours for distinguished visitors. Wing Plans will oversee
     tours for foreign visitors; however, the designated point of contact (POC) will handle the
     coordination, escort, etc., of said visit.
     1.2. This instruction also explains the procedures to allow friends and family members
     access to the flight line area for ―Fini‖ Flights.
2. Wing Tour Program
     2.1. Due to training and mission requirements, tours of wing static display aircraft will be
     conducted on the in-cycle dates, except when tour dates fall on holidays and wing
     productivity days. In these cases tours may be scheduled for an alternate day with the
     approval of the OG and MXG.
        2.1.1. Requests for aircraft tours on out-of-cycle days will not be scheduled, unless wing
        staff approval is granted and an aircraft is available for a tour.
        2.1.2. Requests for tours must be made in writing, e-mail or by phone. Requests must be
        received no later than three weeks prior to the requested tour date. Requests can be
        mailed to 72 ABW/PA, 7460 Arnold St., Suite 127, Tinker AFB OK 73145; faxed to
        (405) 739-2882; or e-mailed to 72abw.pa.workflow@tinker.af.mil.
            2.1.2.1. All requests must include: name of the group, number of people expected,
            age level of group members (if the group includes children 13-18 years of age),
            names of any distinguished visitors in the group, reason for the tour, date and time
            desired, alternate date and time, a point of contact, address and telephone number.
     2.2. Tour groups will be limited to no more than 40 people and no fewer than 10. However,
     if the group is larger than 40, it can be split and alternated between two or more tour areas.
        2.2.1. If the group contains children 13-16 years of age, there must be a ratio of one adult
        for every four children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 12 will not be
        allowed in the flight line area. Tour requests for children under 12 will be referred to
        other units on base or recommendations will be made to have a Speaker’s Bureau
        member visit the group at their location. Friends and Family Tours may be scheduled in
        those instances where there are children under the age of 12 and fit the criteria for a
        Friends and Family Tour.
     2.3. Wing agencies reserve the right to cancel or terminate any tour.

        ―birdcage‖ (aircraft parking area (APA)) is not permitted. The Dock Chief has final
        approval authority as to the availability of the aircraft. Coordinate with the Red and
        White Air Maintenance Unit (AMU) Pro-Supers to see if an aircraft will be in the dock
        and available for touring on the selected day. (Contact numbers for Pro-Supers: Red
        AMU – 734-9888 / White AMU – 734-8310) If you cannot make contact with either of
        the Pro-Supers, Wing Plans and Scheduling can be used as an alternate contact (734-

        tour escort is liable and responsible for all members of the party. These procedures must
        be followed each and every time a tour is requested. No photography is allowed unless
        accompanied by someone with a current photo authorization letter and permission is
        granted by senior maintenance personnel on duty.
        4.2.3. Due to safety considerations and the need to maintain a controlled environment
        within the restricted areas, escorts must complete the mandatory checklist at Attachment
        1 of the Wing Friends and Family Tour Policy Letter. This checklist ensures all relevant
        offices have been notified, and that the escort has given the required safety and security
        briefings to all members of the tour group. Failure to comply with all safety and security
        standards may result in detainment by Security Forces personnel.
        4.2.4. As directed on the checklist, a restricted area Entry Authorization List (EAL)
        memorandum must be accomplished at least 72 hours prior to the tour. This EAL must
        be signed by the requester and submitted to 552 ACW/SF and 72 SFS/S5A for approval.
        The 72 SFS/S5A will ensure the approved EAL has been forwarded to the appropriate
        Entry Control Points in the maintenance docks prior to the requested tour date. The Entry
        Controller must have the EAL in hand before a tour can take place. (All contact
        information and numbers are found on the Family and Friends Tour Authorization.)

        extended tours of duty as component members. If a foreign service component member
        wishes to conduct a Family and Friends Tour, the same procedures, as outlined above in
        Section E, will be followed.
552ACWI35-101 21 MARCH 2011                                                                        7

   5.1. Foreign nationals are permitted access to 552 ACW aircraft tours, when visiting in an
   official capacity and with the appropriate coordination/approval.
   5.2. Commanders will not invite foreign nationals on an unclassified or classified basis until

      Request. If the requestor has not gone through the proper channels, the 552 ACW/FDO
      will notify the requester to submit the request to the Air Attaché of the appropriate
      embassy in Washington, D.C., for processing through established liaison channels.
      5.3.2. Once confirmation of the Foreign National Visit Request is received, 552
      ACW/DS will forward the tour request to the designated OPR and Wing Protocol Office
      for further coordination of the visit IAW ACCI 90-110, Distinguished Visitors.
6. Distinguished Visitors
   6.1. IAW ACWI 90-1, 552 ACW/CCP, Wing Protocol, is the single point of contact for
   distinguished visitors to this wing. All DV visits will be coordinated through 552 ACW/CCP
   and other agencies, as required.
   6.2. 552 ACW/CCP will act as liaison between the OPR and other command staff agencies,
   as well as OC-ALC Protocol. Additionally, CCP will provide overall protocol guidance; e.g.,
   appropriate honors, seating, refreshments, etc.
7. FINI Flights
   7.1. In the event of a ―Fini‖ flight, friends and family members will be allowed access to the
   flight line area provided an EAL has been completed and routed. Escort will use the fini-

   7.2. Escorting member will take responsibility for friends and family members on flight line,
   especially children under the age of 12. Escort will ensure flightline clearance and photo
   authorization are obtained 72 hours prior to landing.

   safety procedures.
      8.1.1. Escorts will brief all guests on flight line security and safety procedures before
      entering the restricted area. The 72 SFS entry controller will provide the escorts the

      entering the flight line area.

      8.1.3. Before entering aircraft parking area (APA) ensure all vehicle tires have been
      checked for foreign object damage (FOD) items. Also, because the APA has been
      designated a ―no hat‖ area, instruct military members to leave their hats on the bus and
      any other small items that might be accidentally dropped. This action will lower the risk
      of FOD.
