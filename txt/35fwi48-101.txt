    areas. The area supervisor will have the individual report to BE, building 971. When
    personnel are removed from duties within the radiation areas, the supervisor will submit a
    written request to BE to discontinue dosimeter service.
    2.2. The wearing of dosimeters will be as follows:
       2.2.1. The TLD issued by BE will be worn by all workers entering a radiation area.
       Never place the TLD inside the pocket or behind cloth, cigarettes, coins, or any
       obstruction whatsoever. The following TLDs will be worn in the appropriate locations:
           2.2.1.1. Whole Body TLD: This dosimeter is clipped on the outer clothing in the
           front part of the body below the shoulders and above the hips. When worn with a
           collar dosimeter, the whole body dosimeter is always worn underneath any lead
           apron. When worn WITHOUT a collar dosimeter and a lead apron is worn, the
           whole body dosimeter is worn on the individual’s collar, outside any protective
           shielding.
           2.2.1.2. Collar TLD: This dosimeter should be worn as near to the thyroid area
           OUTSIDE ANY SHIELDED PROTECTIVE COVERING.
           2.2.1.3. Finger Ring TLD: This dosimeter is worn on the finger that will receive the
           highest dose of radiation from the source and must be oriented so that the circular
           indentation is facing the radiation source. If this dosimeter is worn with leaded
           gloves, it is worn under the shielded gloves.
       2.2.2. When TLDs are not being worn, it must be stored with the area control dosimeter.
       Never take the dosimeter out of the radiation area of operation (i.e. home, car, etc…).
       2.2.3. Supervisors or designated personnel for each work section must ensure the TLDs
       are available during the routine dosimeter exchange, usually the first day of each month
       (for monthly) or quarter (for quarterly). If not available, the individual is required to take
       the TLD(s) to Building 971 for the periodic exchange.
       2.2.4. Supervisors must ensure personnel don’t tamper with the TLDs. If these devices
       are accidentally damaged or exposed, the wearer must immediately return them to BE
       and exchange them for new ones. The wearer will provide a written explanation of the
       nature of the accident, signed by him/her and supervisor, to aid in the evaluation of the
       TLD.
       2.2.5. Personnel working with industrial x-ray equipment or adjacent to high radiation
       areas will wear two self-reading pocket dosimeters or one digital alarm dosimeter (DAD)
       as prescribed by the RSO. This will permit frequent reading of the dosimeters during
       hazardous procedures. Pocket dosimeters should be worn clipped on the breast pocket of
       the outer garment. Never place dosimeters behind dense material such as coins or other
       metallic objects in the pocket.
35FWI48-101 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   7


     2.2.6. When visitors enter a radiation area, they are required to register with the
     supervisor before entry. The supervisor will issue pocket dosimeters/DAD to the visitor
     and maintain AFTO Form 115, Pocket Dosimeter Results Log, with the visitor's name,
     address, date, time in and out, pocket dosimeter or DAD number, and the initial and final
     readings on the pocket dosimeter/DAD. The RSO will designate those areas and
     circumstances in which TLDs must be worn by visitors in addition to the pocket
     dosimeter/DAD.
  2.3. Investigation Action Levels have been established for Misawa AB and are based on
  guidance from the AFIOH’s ―Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to Ionizing Radiation‖ and
  historical dosimetry data. IALs are dose equivalent values that require further investigation
  by the IRSO when exceeded.
     2.3.1. The IALs are a guide; the IRSO can initiate further investigation anytime
     exposures occur that deviate from ALARA.
     2.3.2. Monthly IALs are 50 mREM for whole body, 150 mREM for Head/Eye, and
     1,000 mREM for Extremities/Skin.
     2.3.3. Quarterly IALs are 150 mREM for whole body, 450 mREM for Head/Eye, and
     1,500 mREM for Extremities/Skin.

  6.1. The IRSO is responsible for ensuring the proper disposal of all radioactive materials on
  the installation. The owner of the RAM is responsible for coordinating all disposal actions
  concerning radioactive materials through the IRSO. The owner of the RAM maintains
  physical accountability for the radioactive waste until written disposition instructions have
  been received from the Air Force Radioactive and Mixed Waste Office (AFRMWO at DSN
  240-3489).
  6.2. All radioactive materials no longer required should be evaluated for the recycling or to
  be transferred to an organization that may have use for it. Recycling should be coordinated
  with the Air Force Material Recovery/Recycling Office (88th ABW/EMO), Wright Patterson
  AFB OH at DSN 787-2010.
  6.3. The IRSO will coordinate the disposal of all RAM through AFRMWO and ensure to
  follow the guidelines provided by them. Upon receipt of the disposal instructions by the
  RSO, the owner of the RAM will contact the TMF office to arrange packing and shipment of
  radioactive assets for disposal.
  6.4. The owner of the RAM and IRSO will take the radioactive assets to the TMF for
  shipment. The IRSO and owner of the RAM will ensure materials are properly packed,
  weighed, marked, tested, and labeled in accordance with provisions outlined in the disposal
  instructions. The TMF representative will verify all paperwork for accuracy and make the
  necessary arrangements to have a commercial carrier pick up the radioactive waste as per
  disposal instructions.
  6.5. The IRSO will keep disposal records according to 10 CFR, Part 20.2108, Records of
  Waste Disposal, or other directives as applicable.
7. RADIATION SURVEYS
  7.1. The IRSO or delegated alternate will conduct routine surveys and schedule shielding
  surveys. The IRSO will conduct special surveys at the request of using organizations. For
  these special surveys, contact BE.
  7.2. The shielding evaluation and design review will be performed by United States Air
  Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Detachment 3 consultant before
  installing/changing x-ray equipment and for new or modified facilities.

8. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
  8.1. Emergencies include any unusual occurrences resulting in contamination of facilities or
  environment, or may result in the exposure of personnel to hazardous levels of ionizing or
  non-ionizing radiation. BE must be notified immediately of all these emergencies.
  8.2. BE will be directly involved with all investigations and reporting of accidents and
  incidents involving radioactive materials. All reporting and investigations will be per the
  applicable sections of AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program; AFI 91-
  204, Safety Investigations and Reports; AFI 40-201; and TO 00-110N-3. Reporting under
  AFI 91-204 does not negate the reporting requirements of AFI 40-201 and the NRC.
  8.3. Treat any radioactive material spill as a major spill until monitoring can be
  accomplished to determine the actual intensity of the radiation exposure.
  8.4. Fire fighting procedures where known RAM is stored are as follows:
     8.4.1. The fighting of fires, which may occur in buildings, must be accomplished in such
     a manner that exposure of personnel to radiation is held to a minimum and the spread of
     radioactive contamination is avoided.
     8.4.2. As a general rule, when using fire hoses, water fog is preferable to solid stream
     application to avoid excessive runoff of water that may spread contamination.
     8.4.3. If a fire breaks out, sound the evacuation alarm, call 911, and notify BE of its
     location. If no immediate radiation hazard exists and the potential for sustaining injuries
     is remote, combat the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher, sand, or water. If there is
     sufficient time, personnel who are using isotopes and are not in the fire area should
     quickly place their isotopes into storage containers, transport containers from the area;
     then, close the windows and doors, and shut off the ventilation system before leaving the
     area.
     8.4.4. Firefighters must wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment even though
     there is no evidence of immediate radiation danger. If possible, fire fighting should be
     conducted from the upwind side of the blaze.
  8.5. A person who ingests radioactive material should be transported immediately for
  medical treatment and BE notified of the incident.
  8.6. A person who has inhaled radioactive material should be removed to an uncontaminated
  area immediately. The patient should be transported for medical treatment and BE notified
  of the incident.
9. LASER SAFETY PROCEDURES

Terms
ALARA— As Low As Reasonable Achievable concept. ALARA is defined as that set of
management and administrative actions taken to reduce personnel ionizing radiation exposure to
as low a level as possible consistent with existing technology, costs, and operational
requirements.
Controlled area— Any area in which radioisotopes are used or stored and access to which is
controlled for the protection of individuals from exposure to radiation. In the case of non-
ionizing radiation, controlled areas are those that may be occupied by personnel who accept
potential exposure as concomitant of employment or duties; by individuals who knowingly enter
areas where levels above the permissible exposure limits (PEL), defined in AFOSHSTD 48-9,
Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Safety Program, are to be expected; and by personnel passing
through such areas.
Electromagnetic radiation— A term used to mean non-ionizing radiation in the frequency
range from about 10 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz).
35FWI48-101 17 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      15


Investigation Action Levels— A dose equivalent value or radionuclide intake activity set by the
installation RSO that requires further investigation when exceeded. Levels are normally tailored
to historical dosimetry data in order to promptly identify and correct adverse trends.
Microcuries— One-millionth of a curie. A curie is a term that designates a quantity of
radioactive material present. It is the amount of radioactive material that disintegrates at the rate
of 37 billion atoms per second.
Millirem— One-thousandth of roentgen equivalent man (rem). A rem is a unit of absorbed
radiation by man. Radiation standards are normally expressed in millirem (mrem) or rem per unit
of time.
Probe surveys— Measurements using portable survey meter to detect alpha, beta, gamma,
neutrons, or x-ray radiation.
Radiation area— An area in which an individual could receive a radiation dose to a major
portion of the body of 5 mrem or more in any one hour. Thermoluminescent badges and self-
reading pocket dosimeters will be worn in radiation areas.
Radiation dosimeter program— A program described in AFI 48-125, The US Air Force
Personnel Dosimetry Program, for routinely monitoring personnel who work with radiation
producing devices and who are likely to receive radiation doses in excess of one-tenth of the
applicable radiation standard.
RAM— Abbreviation for radioactive material.
Restricted area— An area having access limited to protect individual against undue risks from
exposure to radiation or radioactive material.
Self-reading pocket dosimeter— A radiation detection device normally worn by an individual
and designed to detect and quantitatively measure x-ray and gamma radiation. These dosimeters
are not as accurate as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), but they are read by the wearer and
give a good indication of the radiation dose received by the wearer. They are to be worn while
wearing TLDs.
Swipe samples— Samples using filter paper to detect removable radioactive material. Filter
paper is smeared across suspected contaminated areas.
TLD— A radiation detection device normally worn by an individual and designed to detect and
quantitatively measure beta, gamma, x-ray, and, if required, neutron radiation. These dosimeters
are read by the USAF Center for Radiation Dosimetry (formerly Armstrong Lab and Det 1,
HSC/OEBD) at Brooks AFB, TX.
