SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision implements additional content to paragraph 3.5. The additional content is the
following: by the command post; if the command post is not open; which include a 15 minute
waiting period after the last strike within five nautical miles (NM) or in the judgment of the
forecaster the threat is over. The forecaster may also wait longer after the 15 minute period to
rescind the warning if in their judgment a lightning threat still exists. An * indicates revision
from the previous edition.
1. Definition. Adverse weather, to include lightning and extreme temperatures, poses a
potential threat to personnel working at Eglin Field 3, (Duke Field). In our best attempt to
protect our personnel, the following steps will be taken when adverse weather threatens the Duke
Field complex. The goal of establishing these procedures is to focus information through a
chain-of-command to one point of contact at Duke Field who will then correspond with the 46
 2                                                     919SOWI10-201 17 DECEMBER 2012


Weather Squadron (WS). The term Supervisor of Flying (SOF) or Operations Duty Officer
(ODO) may be interchanged for the purposes of this instruction
2. Notification Procedures:
     2.1. The 46 WS based on Eglin AFB operates a Base Weather Station (BWS) and is the
     Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for severe weather notifications to Duke Field. The
     BWS will notify the 919 SOW Command Post (919 SOW/CP) when lightning is expected
     within 30-minutes (a Lightning Watch) and when lightning is within five nautical miles (5
     nm) (a Lightning Warning). Only the BWS has authority to issue watches and warnings.
     2.2. Any person observing or detecting lightning within 5 nm of Duke Field may supplement
     the BWS by calling the Command Post, who will in turn notify BWS of the observation.
     When the Command Post is closed and flight operations are intended, contact the SOF/ODO.
     During periods of activity at Duke Field when flight operations are not intended,
     observations should be made to the 919th Maintenance Operations Flight (919
     MOF)/Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). When these functional areas are not
     available, the senior person on scene will coordinate for weather advisories through the
     BWS.
     2.3. The 46 WS, as a courtesy, uses its systems to notify base agencies of Heat Stress
     Indexes. The 46 WS obtains wet bulb temperature indexes from 96 Aerospace Medical
     Squadron (AMDS) /SGPB
3. Weather Decision Levels:
     3.1. At the 919 SOW: The Command Post (CP) is the central point of contact for all
     information regarding adverse weather at Duke Field. Upon notification of adverse weather
     by BWS, CP personnel will disseminate information in accordance with applicable checklists
     alerting base agencies of impending weather. Upon notification of adverse weather from the
     CP, agencies will further disseminate information to their personnel.
     3.2. The 919th Operations Group (919 OG): The SOF/ODO will be the central point-of-
     contact for weather decisions during periods of flight activity when the CP is closed. The
     SOF/ODO will coordinate through BWS for activation/deactivation of weather watches and
     warnings and notify base agencies of status changes. All base functions will coordinate
     weather concerns through the SOF/ODO during these periods. The SOF/ODO will maintain
     a log to record notification of adverse weather actions.
     3.3. The 919th Maintenance Group (919 MXG): Personnel working on the flight line who
     observe lightning within 5 nm will notify a flight line expediter. Expediters will, in-turn,
     notify Debrief/Dispatch. Debrief/Dispatch will follow the adverse weather checklist to alert
     the CP and listed 919 MXG work-centers of the lightning. When the CP is closed, the
     SOF/ODO will be notified. When all are unavailable, Debrief/Dispatch will advise the BWS
     of the lightning and notify base agencies of posted watches and warnings. Debrief/Dispatch
     will maintain a log to record notification of adverse weather actions.
     3.4. When neither the 919 Operations Group (OG) nor the 919 MXG complexes are active,
     the senior person in charge of activities taking place at Duke Field will coordinate through
     BWS for adverse weather watches and warnings. The 46 WS will be contacted at 882-4800
919SOWI10-201 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                                 3


   and advised of lightning observations and coordinated with prior to issuance of back to work
   orders to ensure a lightning warning is no longer in effect.
   3.5. "Back to work" orders will only be issued by the CP after contacting BWS to confirm
   the cancellation of a lightning warning. If the command post is not open, Authority to issue
   "back to work" orders will reside in the highest level of supervision in accordance with the
   chain established in paragraphs 3.1. through 3.4. above. It should be taken into account;
   lightning is an observed phenomenon and not a forecasted one. BWS will issue and rescind
   Lightning Warnings based on current observations which include a 15 minute waiting period
   after the last strike within 5 NM or in the judgment of the forecaster the threat is over. The
   forecaster may also wait longer after the 15 minute period to rescind the warning if in their
   judgment a lightning threat still exists. Lightning Watches are customarily issued for an
   extended period of time when the potential for lightning exists. Lightning Warnings are
   issued or rescinded based on current observations within the Lightning Watch period. For
   this reason, 30-minute forecasting does not apply to Lightning Warnings.
   3.6. Building custodians will notify any contractors working outside of their building of the
   lightning advisory and recommend that they take shelter.
   3.7. Heat Stress Indexes can be obtained a number of ways. From 1 May through 1 October,
   96 AMDS/SGPB obtains readings Monday through Friday every two hours starting at 0900
   and ending at 1500. This information is provided to 46 WS who then transmits the index to
   base agencies. 919 SOW/CP is a direct recipient. They then issue the advisory for Duke
   Field. When 96 AMDS/SGPB is not providing indexes, alternate means are available. When
   96 AMDS/SGPB and 919 SOW/CP are unavailable, refer to paragraph 4.8. for methods of
   obtaining indexes and appropriate countermeasures to be applied.
4. Precautions: When notified that lightning is within 5 nm, the following procedures will be
followed:
   4.1. Fuel systems maintenance and servicing,        Liquid Oxygen (LOX) servicing, and
   munitions operations will be discontinued.
   4.2. Personnel who are on the flight line must seek shelter (as defined by Air Force
   Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) STD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line-Ground
   Operations and Activities, para 1.2.15.1.1.1 as soon as possible. The flight line expediter
   will attempt to notify all personnel working on the flight line (to include transient aircraft
   personnel) to evacuate the flight line.
   4.3. Shut down electrical power and disconnect the power cord from aircraft.
   4.4. All personnel must seek shelter. Do not remain outside or go back outdoors unless
   absolutely necessary.
   4.5. Shut down computers and unplug them from the wall; unless they are protected by
   uninterrupted power supply (UPS).
   4.6. Shut down test equipment in any building that does not have lightning protection.
   4.7. Upon notification of an approaching storm or lightning watch, all hangar doors will be
   closed. Work may continue inside of shops and hangars (with the exception of the Fuel
   Systems hangar) since these areas are considered as adequate shelters with the doors closed.

     4.8. Heat Stress Index Countermeasures: Heat Stress Index information is necessary to
     safeguard our personnel. Commanders and supervisors should seek out information needed
     to make appropriate decisions for work and rest cycles. Below are a number of sources
     available to assist in obtaining information. These are suggested sources; others not listed
     may also be available.
        4.8.1. Local phone numbers:
            4.8.1.1. Automated Biological and Environmental (BIO) 883-6463
            4.8.1.2. Eglin Weather forecaster: 882-4800
            4.8.1.3. Duke weather: 883-1232
            4.8.1.4. Hurlburt Weather forecaster: 884-7423
            4.8.1.5. Eglin Command Post: 883-4020
        4.8.2. WEB Sources: Three major weather sites are provided below. There are many,
        however, most of theses lead back to the Weather Channel.Com resources. Any
        computer with access to the internet and a search engine can obtain heat index
        information associated with a city name or a postal zip code. Heat Indexes can be
        obtained using a search engine and typing in “heat index,” then using one of the many
        calculators that come up and applying temperature and humidity numbers into the
        formula.
                WWW.WEATHER.COM
                WWW.WX.COM
            4.8.2.1. Once the heat index is obtained, apply corrective countermeasures as
            indicated in Attachment 1.
