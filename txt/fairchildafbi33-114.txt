Terms
DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process
(DITSCAP)â€”The DoD standard for certifying and accrediting information technology (IT)
systems that collect, store, transmit, or process unclassified or classified information. The
standard applies to any IT life cycle, including the development of new IT systems, incorporation
of IT systems outside the infrastructure, development of prototype IT systems, and
reconfiguration or upgrade of existing systems and legacy systems.
License Agreementâ€”A contract between the software publisher and the user which instructs
and limits how the software is to be used. When software is purchased, the purchaser acquires a
license to use it, but the publisher retains full rights to the software and can further distribute and
reproduce it. License agreements generally fall into the following categories:
Enterprise Licenseâ€”The Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI)
and the Enterprise Software Agreements (ESA) entered into by DoD components who manage
the acquisition of commercially available software at the DoD Enterprise level to reduce the cost
of acquiring and maintaining software products. By aggregating requirements and leveraging
DoDâ€™s buying power together with the buying power of related communities of interest such as
the intelligence community, the DoD is able to achieve the most favorable terms and pricing for
commercially available software and software maintenance.
Individual Licenseâ€”A license for use on a single machine only.
Network Licenseâ€”A license that allows every member of the network to access the software.
Site Licenseâ€”A license defined by a geographic restriction, such as a building, unit, wing, or
base.
