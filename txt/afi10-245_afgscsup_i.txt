SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Throughout the
document, the AT Program has been integrated with Integrated Defense (ID), Emergency
Management (EM), and Critical Asset Risk Management (CARM) programs to support Force
Protection (FP). In addition, AF functional roles and responsibilities have been updated;
requirements for AT Training have been revised; and several FPCON measures have been
revised or updated. Attachment 6—The Antiterrorism Deviation Program has been added to
establish new AF deviation procedures for AT construction standards, and Attachment 7—
Categories of Suspicious Behavior has been added to supplement guidance on eGuardian.

(AFGSC) This supplement is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
supplement has been updated to address GCC’s specific requirements which may be more
restrictive than HAF requirements, USNORTHCOM standardized methodology to sharing threat
information, imminent threat reporting and non-imminent threat reporting. It provides reference
to USNORTHCOM integrated and coordinated FP and AT approach that will include Chemical,

Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Emergency Management activities; addresses action
concerning the inability to meet minimum DoD, USNORTHCOM and HAF AT standards and
non-compliance with the GCC vulnerability assessment requirement (VA); updates procedures
on recording/tracking observations after completion of VA and ATO requirement to validate
accuracy of data in CVAMP. Other changes include meeting minutes requirements, identity
validation in the contracting process, procedures for FPCON change reporting, USNORTHCOM
waiver procedures, USNORTHCOM annual FP exercise requirements and the requirement for
commanders to document review of their AT program annually.

                                            Chapter 1

                        AIR FORCE ANTITERRORISM PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force Antiterrorism Program. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures
for the Air Force Antiterrorism Program and supports the Department of Defense AT Program.
The AT Program is a high priority, comprehensive program which focuses on defensive
measures to reduce the risk to AF personnel and property to terrorist acts. The guidance and
procedures for AT risk management provide guidance on collecting and disseminating timely
terrorist threat information, guide development and support the implementation of
comprehensive AT plans, ensure AT training and exercises for all AF members, provide
guidance for allocation and application of AT resources, and establish procedures for
comprehensive AT program reviews.
1.1. (AFGSC)Air Force Antiterrorism Program. This supplement establishes AFGSC
guidance and procedures for implementing the DOD AT Program, the HAF AT Program, the
United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) Force Protection and AT Program, and the
United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) AT Policy.
1.2. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility which must be thoroughly integrated
into every unit mission. Commanders and equivalents at all levels have the responsibility and
authority to enforce appropriate AT standards and measures. Commanders and equivalents must
be aware of evolving threats against their command and continually review their AT posture
using the Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP), to manage risk and
appropriately adjust the posture of elements and personnel subject to their control. The next
level up the chain of command must be notified and mitigate or accept any AT risk that cannot
be controlled to an acceptable level within a commander's resources.
     1.2.1. The Major Command (MAJCOM) AT Program Manager (ATPM), the Numbered Air
     Force (NAF) Antiterrorism Officer (ATO), the Installation ATO, and the Unit Antiterrorism
     Representative (ATR) are advisors to commanders at each respective level. They shall not
     assume AT responsibility but are charged with advising the commander or equivalent on AT
     issues, managing the AT Program, and coordinating implementation of the AT Program.
        1.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A7SA (ATPM) will be the primary Point of Contact
        (POC) for all AFGSC AT related issues and/or requirements levied within AFI 10-245
        and this supplement. All issues and/or concerns with Higher Headquarters (HHQ)
        directives or instructions will be worked through AFGSC.
        1.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Requirements and/or tasks for installations and wings,
        mandated by this supplement, shall flow through the respective NAF, if required.
     1.2.2. The AF Antiterrorism program is a cross-functional supported program which utilizes
     the skills and expertise of a variety of AF professionals. MAJCOM and Installation
     Commanders will identify personnel on their staff to oversee the antiterrorism program and
     act as the subject matter expert responsible for executing both DoD and AF-directed AT
     requirements across a major command or installation, and coordinates the efforts of key
     functional areas to ensure synergy on behalf of the commander. At a minimum, Security
     Forces, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Intelligence, Civil Engineers (to
     include Emergency Management, Engineering Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Fire
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            7


  Emergency Services), Force Support, Command Post, Public Affairs, Communications,
  Contracting, Operations, Public Health and Bioenvironmental Engineering (food and water),
  Judge Advocate, and Comptroller must coordinate efforts to achieve an effective AT posture.
  The installation ATO is responsible to coordinate among these key players and facilitate the
  integration and coordination of their efforts on behalf of the commander. As a sub-element
  of the overarching FP program, AT must be integrated with and complement other programs
  supporting FP.
     1.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Any reference to the duties of the installation ATO in AFI
     10-245 should also apply to the 91st Missile Wing (MW) ATO, if applicable.
     1.2.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Supplement references to installation commander and ATO
     will apply to the host installation. Reference to wing commander and ATO will apply to
     all AFGSC wings.
  1.2.3. Additionally, an effective AT program requires participation from every member of
  the force. Each individual must maintain awareness of potential terrorist threats, practice
  personal security measures, and report suspicious activity.
  1.2.4. The AT Program shall be considered when establishing and exercising support
  agreements or mutual aid agreements (MAA) with local agencies, whether CONUS or
  OCONUS. At a minimum, agreements must establish procedures for information sharing,
  must address AT capabilities and limitations, and must outline roles and responsibilities
  during response to acts of terrorism. If agreements with outside agencies do not provide
  sufficient support to the AT program, associated vulnerabilities will be entered into Core
  Vulnerability Assessment Management Program (CVAMP) explaining the lack of support.
  1.2.4. (AFGSC) Per OSD/JS and USSTRATCOM/J34, effective 1 Oct 2013, all CVAMP
  requirements shall transfer to the Mission Assurance Readiness Management System
  (MARMS). All further references to CVAMP will also apply to MARMS.
  1.2.5. Installation AT planning shall include a communications plan to inform the base
  populace through Public Affairs of the need to report suspicious activities/incidents, the
  nature of items to be reported, and how to report them.
     1.2.5.1. Eagle Eyes. The Eagle Eyes program is an Air Force AT initiative that enlists
     the eyes and ears of Air Force members, civilians, contractors, and dependants. The
     Eagle Eyes program will inform the community on how to recognize possible terrorist
     activity and how to report suspicious behavior. Armed with this information, all
     individuals can recognize elements of potential terror planning when they see it. The
     program provides a network of local, 24-hour phone numbers to call whenever a
     suspicious activity is observed. Each installation shall establish procedures to receive
     and log suspicious activity reports and suspicious incident reports (SAR/SIR) and to pass
     those reports expeditiously to their servicing AFOSI detachment for appropriate action.
     Eagle Eyes is an AFOSI-led program requiring close and continuous liaison and
     coordination between the installation Security Forces Squadron, AFOSI Detachment,
     Installation ATO, Command Post, Public Affairs office and others. This program
     implements the spirit and intent of DoDI 2000.26, Suspicious Activity Reporting. See
     Attachment 7 for the categories of suspicious activities that are required to be reported.

       1.2.5.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Security Forces (SF) (via the Base Defense Operations
       Center) and the installation ATO will be notified of suspicious incidents. However,
       all parties [SF, ATO, Public Affairs (PA) and AFOSI] must ensure a timely exchange
       of this information with one another to ensure an optimal Antiterrorism/Integrated
       Defense posture for the given installation’s Area of Responsibility (AOR). (T-1)
       1.2.5.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) To be effective, SAR/SIR must be immediately
       reported to local OSI detachments. Additionally, for the AFGSC/CC and AFGSC
       Threat Working Group (TWG) to be able to obtain an overall AT sight picture for the
       entire MAJCOM AOR, the initial notification will be required to be reported to
       AFGSC OSI, via local OSI detachment, and/or AFGSC A7SA (Antiterrorism
       Program Manager), via the wing ATO, within two hours. This initial notification
       may be completed via email or telephone. (T-1)

       HQ First Air Force (1AF) Air Forces Northern (AFNORTH) which has been assigned the
       responsibility for AF FP issues by CSAF MSG (DTG261834ZMAR09).
          1.3.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) As the service component to USNORTHCOM,
          AFNORTH has TACON for FP for all USAF Title 10 forces, installations, activities,
          and agencies within the USNORTHCOM AOR. As such, AFNORTH/A7S executes
          the AT/FP mission as directed by CDRUSNORTHCOM and CDRAFNORTH.

   Element. The detachment should provide a PDF version of the validated product to these
   units upon request. (T-1)
   2.4.3. Effective processes should be implemented to integrate and fuse all sources of
   available threat information from local, State, Federal and host nation law enforcement
   agencies; the appropriate local, State, Federal and host nation intelligence community
   activities; other local community officials and individuals; the applicable U.S. country team;
   port authority officials and husbanding contractors, as appropriate, to provide for a
   continuous analysis of threat information to support the threat warning process IAW
   Standard 2.
   2.4.4. Threat assessments are integrated into the AT risk management process as a major
   source of analysis and justification for recommendations and implementation of Random
   Antiterrorism Measures (RAMs); AT enhancements, including physical security, emergency
   management or FHP changes; program and budget requests; and when conducting AT VAs.
   2.4.5. Other targeted Threat Assessments will be reviewed by the TWG and incorporated
   into AT planning.
2.5. Standard 5: Criticality Assessment.

Industrial Material [TIC/TIM], CBRNE and DCIP assessments) to reduce the impact on
operational units.
2.6. (AFGSC)Standard 6: All local assessments shall be coordinated with the installation ATO
and considered for being conducted simultaneously to reduce the impact on the installation. The
installation ATO should be the team lead for the joint assessments. Information obtained during
the VA will be used in the ForcePRO VA, if using the automated system. When it is not
feasible to document uploads or updates of CVAMP entries, ATOs shall create a local classified
spreadsheet to track all required actions until the information can be added to CVAMP or the
new database. (T-1)
   2.6.1. DoD and COCOM benchmarks will be used to guide all AF VAs. The Installation’s
   IDRMP shall be used to focus VAs when evaluating the installation against DoD/COCOM
   benchmarks to ensure appropriate criticality and threat factors are considered, unless directed
   otherwise by the GCC.

     of 300 or more DoD personnel. Consider creating a Special Events Assessment Plan or
     Template tailored for such activities.
     2.6.2.7. AF-owned or leased off-installation housing, schools, daycare centers,
     commissaries, transportation systems and routes used by DoD personnel and their
     dependent family members when the TTL is SIGNIFICANT or higher, consistent with
     Standard 3. At locations where there are multiple DoD components or locations that are
     not AF-owned or leased, VA requirements shall be coordinated with the designated
     senior DoD Component with AT responsibility.
  2.6.3. A VA of installations or facilities with 300 personnel or more on a daily basis shall be
  conducted by a HHQ team triennially (refer to AFI 10-246 for Food and Water VA).
  2.6.4. Information derived from AT VAs shall be classified pursuant to the requirements
  outlined in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Security Classification Guide for
32                                                 AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


  Vulnerability Assessments. Information related to DCIP assets shall be classified pursuant to
  the requirements outlined in the DCIP Security Classification Guide.
  2.6.5. AT vulnerability assessments conducted by the local installation, the AF VA Team
  (AFVAT), or any other HHQ level, shall include a review of any vulnerability or concern
  identified in a previous VA (from any source/level) which remains open (i.e., not “accepted”
  or mitigated).
  2.6.6. Mitigation Plan. Within 90 days of a signed assessment report, a mitigation plan
  addressing any identified vulnerabilities will be developed and released to the first general
  officer, flag officer or civilian equivalent director in the chain of command. The mitigation
  plan shall be staffed or submitted through CVAMP and include: vulnerability identification
  and prioritization; likely threats/hazards associated with the vulnerability; impact if
  vulnerability is exploited; action plan to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level and
  the anticipated residual risk to be accepted by the commander; estimated completion date of
  the action plan; and resources required.
     2.6.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing commanders shall address procedural and low-cost
     AT/FP vulnerabilities identified during all VAs. Conversely, high cost improvements
     must be considered in context with threat and risk assessment and, if necessary, planned
     and programmed for funding.
     2.6.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Major or high risk vulnerabilities should be mitigated by
     funding decisions [Program Objective Memorandum (POM), CbT RIF, or CCIF],
     improved security tactics, techniques and procedures, risk reassessed at a lower
     acceptable level, or risk assessed and assumed by the decision-maker (commander or
     civilian equivalent director) in writing or via CVAMP. See DOD O-2000.12-H for
     discussion on strategies to mitigate major/high risk vulnerabilities. Until funding is
     approved and project completed for closure of a CVAMP entry, a temporary or long term
     mitigation must also be included in the mitigation entry in CVAMP.
     2.6.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Wing ATOs shall ensure all procedural observations are
     mitigated and closed in CVAMP within 180 days of the observation being placed into
     CVAMP. In the event a procedural observation cannot be closed during the allotted 180
     days, an update via CVAMP, with justification, will be submitted to AFGSC ATPM.
     Justification must be validated by the owning NAF.
  2.6.7. CVAMP shall be populated with all assessment results within 120 days of the signed
  assessment report (Neutral and Positive observations are not required to be loaded into
  CVAMP). Within 240 days of a signed assessment report, all observations must be updated
  with a plan of mitigation or closed with Commander's risk acceptance. When populating
  CVAMP, at a minimum attach a copy of the applicable VA outbrief and final report to the
  record created in CVAMP.
     2.6.7.1. HHQ shall take action (release or return) on appropriate observations within 30
     days of installation submittal.
     2.6.7.2. Installation ATOs, in conjunction with vulnerability/observation OPR or
     functional SME, will review and update CVAMP quarterly. The ATWG and ATEC will
     review open CVAMP vulnerabilities and concerns semi-annually.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          33


        2.6.7.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing ATOs administer CVAMP by entering, editing,
        and maintaining accuracy of data. Wing ATOs shall completely review and validate
        the accuracy of data monthly. To ensure continuity, this will be accomplished within
        the first ten workdays of each month. MAJCOM ATPM will validate the accuracy
        monthly. GCC monthly requirements are levied per NCI 10-222. In addition, the
        wing ATOs shall update CVAMP:
            2.6.7.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Upon completion of an assessment by either local
            or HHQ.         Installations must enter known vulnerabilities (versus
            observation/concerns, observations/positives) identified during VAs as identified
            in NCI 10-222.
            2.6.7.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Whenever the status of a vulnerability changes
            (e.g., vulnerability eliminated, project design status change, or project funded).
            2.6.7.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) As soon as possible after changing the FPCON.
        2.6.7.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) If the installation/facility does not have SIPRNET
        access, or otherwise does not have the capability to enter data into CVAMP, then a
        written report will be mailed by traceable means (i.e., registered mail), to the next
        higher office capable of inputting data into CVAMP. In this case, it may be difficult
        to meet the time requirements identified above; however, required data should be
        entered into CVAMP as expeditiously as possible.
        2.6.7.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM and NAF AT office monitors CVAMP
        for accuracy and timely input of data entered by the wing ATO. Additionally, the
        DOD elements may use the data to develop AT funding priorities.
     2.6.7.3. Installation Commanders may authorize Installation ATO's "Commanders
     Privileges" within CVAMP to aid in database maintenance. Such authorization will be in
     writing, and may be included on the ATO appointment letter. However, this does not
     relieve the commander from having situational awareness of the data within CVAMP.
        2.6.7.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing commanders shall review all open concerns and
        vulnerabilities within 60 days of assuming command.
        2.6.7.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Wing commanders shall conduct a review of all
        Observations (Vulnerabilities and Concerns), concur or non-concur with the wing
        ATO’s recommendations, and add a mitigation plan and release observations to the
        next level.
            2.6.7.3.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing Commanders may authorize wing ATO
            “Commander’s Privileges” within CVAMP to aid in the data base upkeep.
            However, this does not relieve the commander from having situational awareness
            of the data nor does it give the ATO authority to make commander decisions
            without the commander’s knowledge and approval.
     2.6.7.4. (Added-AFGSC) 8 AF/A7S and 20 AF/A7S shall report CVAMP
     Vulnerability/Concern and Unfunded Requirement (UFR) status and command
     observation trend analysis on a semi-annual basis to NAF leadership via the ATWG and
     ATEC.
34                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


     2.6.7.5. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A7S shall report CVAMP Vulnerability/Concern/
     UFR status and command observation trend analysis on a semi-annual basis to AFGSC
     leadership via the ATWG and ATEC.
  2.6.8. Triennial HHQ VA scheduling for AF installations or assets will be coordinated by the
  AF VAT annually. HHQ VAs will only be scheduled for the next fiscal year due to
  limitations put in place by DTRA and COCOM scheduling processes which take precedence
  over AF scheduling guidance. It is incumbent on MAJCOM ATPMs to nominate
  installations or assets that meet the criteria in para 2.6.2. through their MAJCOM IG
  Gatekeepers to the AF VAT. Nominations for the next fiscal year must be submitted to the
  AF VAT by 15 February to ensure adequate time for de-confliction and submission to DTRA
  and COCOM annual calls for nominations. Once DTRA and COCOM schedules for the next
  fiscal year are set, the AF VAT will work with the appropriate MAJCOM IG Gatekeepers
  and ATPMs to complete any HHQ VA not covered by DTRA or COCOM teams. When the
  AF VAT is available, AF VA will be conducted in conjunction with MAJCOM Phase 0
  Inspections. Since the AF VAT is a low density/high demand team, AF VA will not be
  scheduled to occur more than 6 months ahead of or behind an installation’s triennial due date
  for the sole purpose of aligning with MAJCOM inspections.
  2.6.8. (AFGSC) DTRA JSIVA and Air Force Vulnerability Assessment Teams (AFVAT)
  are the HHQ teams available to conduct assessments per Standard 6 on AFGSC installations.
  NC/J34 executes a data call six to nine months in advance of the actual assessment year.
  AFGSC ATPM shall monitor HHQ VA dates and nominate installations for JSIVA or AF
  assessments. AFGSC ATPM shall coordinate with the AFGSC IG Gatekeeper. If possible,
  the dates should be requested within the same timelines as of projected IG inspections, as
  long as the USNORTHCOM 36 month requirement is met per NCI 10-222. AFGSC ATPM
  shall make every effort to ensure HHQ VA is not conducted by the same HHQ team back to
  back. For example, this would equate to a JSIVA every sixth year and will prevent the
  appearance of parochialism in the VA process. Host installation commanders shall ensure
  integration/coordination of assigned tenant organizations into respective AT programs, and
  shall ensure the tenant’s inclusion as part of the host installation’s VA.
     2.6.8.1. The AF VAT scheduling process will incorporate AF CARM Critical Asset Risk
     Assessment (CARA) requirements. Where possible, AF CARAs and AF VAs will be
     aligned to assess an installation at the same time to produce a more comprehensive
     product and minimize impact on the installation.
     2.6.8.1. (AFGSC) Request for a CARM or CARA assessments shall be submitted to the
     AFGSC A3 CARM Program Manager. The AFGSC CARM Program Manager will
     ensure requested dates and locations are worked with AFGSC IG Gatekeeper and
     AFGSC ATPM for submission to HQ AFSFC and USSTRATCOM/ J345.
     2.6.8.2. Once a HHQ VA schedule has been published, MAJCOMs and installations
     should make every effort to abide by the schedule. Cancellations and schedule changes
     are sometimes costly and difficult to facilitate. Cancellation request procedures for
     JSIVA will be identified in the DTRA call for nominations message. Cancellations for
     COCOM/MAJCOM HHQ VA teams will be IAW COCOM/MAJCOM guidance.
     Cancellations for AF VAs require written justification from the installation Wing
     Commander through the owning MAJCOM IG to the Commander, HQ AFSFC. The
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                           35


     request should include the circumstances which require the assessment cancellation or
     schedule change and proposed alternate dates. If the AF VAT is unable to accommodate
     rescheduling the assessment, the MAJCOM is responsible for either completing the HHQ
     VA with an internal team or working with DTRA or their assigned COCOM to complete
     the assessment.
         2.6.8.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) After coordination with AFGSC IG Gatekeeper, the
         AFGSC ATPM shall nominate installations for HHQ assessments during annual
         scheduling process, working with HQ AFSFC and USSTRATCOM/J345. Once dates
         have been selected and finalized by the HHQ team, AFGSC ATPM shall advise the
         Gatekeeper.
         2.6.8.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Installation request for HHQ VA cancellation or
         schedule change and proposed dates will be submitted to AFGSC IG Gatekeeper and
         ATPM. (T-2)
         2.6.8.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Non-compliance with the HHQ 36 month requirement
         requires written notification to NC/J34 Defense Critical Infrastructure Branch stating
         the circumstances, the mitigating measures in lieu of the assessment, and the
         commander’s name that accepts the risk for non-execution. Requirement levied in
         NCI 10-222, Chapter 25, para(s) 25.2.3. and 25.2.5. (T-0)
            2.6.8.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Installation commanders shall staff a package with
            the submitted written notification through the respective NAF to AFGSC A7S
            (ATPM). ATPM will staff package for coordination through the MAJCOM.
            After final approval by AFGSC CC, ATPM will submit the notification to
            AFSFC/SFOZ, AFNORTH, and USSTRATCOM/J345. (T-0)
     2.6.8.3. HHQ VAs conducted by NAF or MAJCOM VA teams will be reported to the
     AF VAT for tracking and scheduling purposes. Additionally, VA Reports from these
     assessments will be provided to, and tracked by, the AFVAT.
     2.6.8.4. HHQ VAs will be considered complete when signed by the appropriate HHQ
     authority.
  2.6.9. MAJCOMs and AF Components to the GCC will support the GCCs in scheduling
  assessments and prescribing policies for no-notice or short-notice movements to locations
  where a VA has not been accomplished or is not current. MAJCOM ATPMs will receive
  copies of reports on all VAs completed based on Standard 6.
  2.6.9. (AFGSC) Installation ATO shall supply a digital copy of the final HHQ VA report to
  AFGSC ATPM no later than 30 days after the HHQ assessment was received. (T-2)
  2.6.10. Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC)/SFOZ (VA) shall
  provide the HAF FPWG a semi-annual vulnerability and concerns trend report based upon
  AF VAT reports. MAJCOM ATPMs shall provide units within their command a semi-
  annual vulnerability and concerns trend update based upon MAJCOM and HHQ
  Vulnerability Assessment reports. In addition, MAJCOM ATPMs shall review Installation
  CVAMP entries semi-annually.
  2.6.10. (AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM shall provide wing ATOs a copy of vulnerability and
  concerns trends following the command’s ATEC.
 36                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   2.6.11. Local vulnerability assessment team composition can be tailored to the installation
   needs. The assessment team should consist of a team chief, physical security specialist,
   structural/infrastructure engineer, terrorist operations specialist, emergency management
   specialist, medical operations specialist, communications specialist and EOD specialist, when
   appropriate. Other functional experts may augment the team as needed, depending on the
   type of assessment required (comprehensive or targeted), the nature of the installation’s
   mission, and the terrorist threat level.
      2.6.11.1. (Added-AFGSC) The installation ATO shall be responsible for selecting local
      VA team members and coordinating with selected members’ commanders.
      2.6.11.2. (Added-AFGSC) To standardize the VA process for consistency throughout
      the command, AFGSC and subordinates will use the most current guidelines and criteria
      stipulated in the DOD and AF Benchmarks.
          2.6.11.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) VAs and the results derived will be classified IAW the
          guidance provided in the DTRA Security Classification Guide for Vulnerability
          Assessments.
2.7. Standard 7: AT Plan.
   2.7.1. Installation Commanders will develop and maintain a comprehensive AT plan for all
   elements and personnel for which the AF has AT responsibility. Installation AT plans must
   be cross-referenced, compatible, and synchronized with other base plans (IDP, CEMP,
   MCRP, etc.). AT plans will not be considered complete unless signed by the commander and
   exercised. At a minimum, AT plans shall be developed for the installation (integrating
   separate/leased facilities), for AF operational deployments, training exercise deployments or
   events, and special events.
   2.7.1. (AFGSC) Wings will cross reference between existing installation/wing plans to
   eliminate conflicts of various functional responsibilities. If determined appropriate by the
   Installation Commander, the AT Plan may be included as an annex to the local IDP. The AT
   Plan may also serve as the installation-level supplement to this AFI and AFGSC Supplement.
   The AT plan should integrate all base and community actions to deter, detect, defend, and
   respond to terrorist actions. Relevant portions of existing plans may be annexed into the
   installation AT plan.
      2.7.1.1. Installation AT plans will specify requirements for unit AT plans and programs.
      Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFR) tenant units will be integrated
      into host installation AT plans, and are not required to write their own. However, they
      will develop an AT plan or instruction for their unit detailing unit procedures based on
      the host installation’s AT plan. ANG and AFR tenant units will appoint an ATR for each
      unit and will participate fully in the host installation’s AT program.
      2.7.1.2. Installation Commanders will review and sign AT plans within 60 days of taking
      command.
      2.7.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) A copy of the installation AT Plan will be forwarded to
      AFGSC ATPM within 30 days of being signed by the installation commander.
      Installation commanders shall document a review of the Installation AT Plan on an
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              37


        annual basis. Installation ATOs must maintain the commander’s review of the AT Plan.
        (T-1)
     2.7.2. AT principles are incorporated into all operational plans and risk decisions using the
     standards prescribed by this instruction as a baseline to develop and implement AT policies
     in support of the AF’s unique roles and mission requirements. Table 2.1. incorporates
     Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8, National Preparedness. The OPR will recommend the
     appropriate planning parameters regarding the scale for AF operations and civil support
     operations based on the threat. Where A7C (CE) is designated the OPR, refer to AFI 10-
     2501.

  2.7.3. Tailor AT plans to the level of command or activity for which the AT principles were
  developed. AT plans should reference (not copy) information in other base plans. At a
  minimum AT plans shall address:
  2.7.3. (AFGSC) At a minimum AT plans shall address or provide reference to the location
  of:
     2.7.3.1. The minimum essential AT program elements (AT Standard 1) and standards
     prescribed by this instruction to include:
     2.7.3.2. Risk correction or mitigation measures to establish a local baseline defensive
     posture. The local baseline defensive posture shall facilitate systematic movement to and
     from elevated security postures, including the application of RAMs.
     2.7.3.3. AT physical security measures (Standard 13). These measures, to include the
     barrier plan, will be contained within the IDP and referenced in the AT plan.
         2.7.3.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) When AT actions (i.e. barrier plans) required by AT
         plans are contained in other plans, the overall AT plan is not complete unless all
         referenced plans are current. Installation commanders must consider this when
         consolidating or referencing other plans. (T-2)
         2.7.3.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Deviation procedures for physical security requirements
         are located in attachment 6 of this AFI and supplement.

      2.8.2.2. Coordinate AT matters with local, State, Federal, Tribal, and/or host nation
      authorities pursuant to existing law, AF and DoD policy to support AT planning and
      implementation. Where support agreements such as MOUs, MOAs or MAA are needed
      to support the AT program, ensure they are reviewed annually by the ATWG for
      currency and executability, and exercised annually (all parties to the agreement should
      participate in at least one exercise annually).
      2.8.2.2. (AFGSC) Wing Commanders shall ensure all agreements for local emergency
      support (e.g., fire, police, health service support, etc.), are formally coordinated.

2.13. Standard 13: AT Physical Security Measures.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              49


  2.13.1. Principles of AFI 31-101, DoD 5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, and
  Antiterrorism Handbook, are applied and fully integrated into AT plans to ensure
  employment of a holistic security system to counter terrorist capabilities. Well-designed
  physical security measures are multi-layered and include the integration and synchronization
  of the essential elements of detection, assessment, delay or denial, communication and
  response. The development of comprehensive physical security measures requires the
  integration of facilities, physical security equipment, trained personnel, biometrics entry
  control equipment, procedures oriented at a minimum in support of perimeter and area
  security, access and egress control, protection against CBRNE attacks (including those using
  the postal system and food/water supplies), HRP protection, barrier plans, and facility
  standoff distances.
  2.13.1. (AFGSC) Additionally, Installation commanders shall ensure planning guidance
  levied in NCI 10-222, Chapter 19 are included in installation physical security plans. (T-0)
  2.13.2. Tenant unit security plans and measures, to include those of non-USAF elements,
  shall be coordinated and integrated into the host installation IDP and referenced in the AT
  plan.
  2.13.3. Security Forces employing Explosive Detection Equipment (EDE) must be trained
  on employment of EDE and ensure sufficient consumables are maintained to allow random
  or spot inspections.
     2.13.3.1. The Navy has been designated as DoD lead for the Explosive Detection
     Equipment        RDT&E         Program. Reports     can       be     accessed     at:
     https://www.us.army.mil/suite/folder/9892268. Must register for an AKO account first,
     then ask for privileges to folder.
  2.13.4. Ensure installation access control points and associated barrier plans are constructed
  and operated IAW the Antiterrorism Handbook; UFC 4-022-01, Security Engineering: Entry
  Control Facility/Access Control Points; DTM 09-012, Interim Policy Guidance for DoD
  Physical Access Control; and AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control.
     2.13.4.1. Installations will enforce proper standoff by employing UFC 4-010-01 and
     Antiterrorism Handbook recommended barriers. Where there is a threat from a moving
     vehicle and continuous operation is mission essential, or the occupants cannot be
     evacuated, the type of barrier chosen must prevent a moving vehicle from encroaching
     into the standoff area.
     2.13.4.2. Barrier plans also identify responsibility for executing the barrier plan and
     establish timelines for implementation.
         2.13.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Barrier plans shall be detailed to protect critical
         facilities from stationary vehicle attacks. The barrier plan for critical facilities must
         be created from the criticality assessment. The UFC maintains the minimum baseline
         requirements used for standoff to include barrier planning. Ensure documented
         Design Based Threat is utilized for any modifications.
         2.13.4.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) CE is the OPR, with SF and installation ATOs as
         offices of collateral responsibility, when establishing a barrier plan. Barrier plans,
         using UFC and Traffic Engineering Standards, should be formally reviewed by the
 50                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


          base IDC and/or the ATEC to ensure effectiveness, rapid deployment, and where
          necessary, proper traffic redirection is needed. (T-2)
          2.13.4.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Barrier plans shall be included in the IDP and
          referenced in the installation AT Plan.
   2.13.5. (Added-AFGSC) Attachment 6 provides guidance on requesting a Physical
   Security deviation.
2.14. Standard 14: Random Antiterrorism Measures (RAM).
   2.14.1. The RAM program is developed and implemented as an integral component of the
   overall AT program and guided by the principles outlined in the Antiterrorism Handbook.
   To maximize the effectiveness and deterrence value, RAMs should be developed to counter
   risk from threats identified in the installation Threat Assessment, and implemented without a
   set pattern, either in terms of the measure selected, time, place or other variables. Lessons
   learned have highlighted unpredictability in security activities as one of the best and most
   cost effective deterrents available to a commander. Randomly changing AT measures enable
   integrated defenses to appear formidable and prevent threats from easily discerning and
   predicting patterns or routines that are vulnerable to attack. RAMs, at a minimum, shall
   consist of the random implementation of higher FPCON measures, to include MAJCOM or
   locally developed site-specific measures. Random use of other security measures, to include
   technologies, should be used to supplement FPCON measures. The RAM program shall be
   included in AT plans.
   2.14.1. (AFGSC) Wing ATOs are responsible for managing their respective RAM Program.
   (T-1)
   2.14.2. When developing and implementing an effective installation RAM program:
      2.14.2.1. Include tenant units and organizations.
      2.14.2.2. Implement daily RAMs to include weekends and holidays. The frequency will
      be increased as the threat increases. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs
      are required daily.
      2.14.2.2. (AFGSC) Wing ATOs will be responsible for selecting RAMs and appropriate
      coordination. RAM selection can be pulled from higher DOD, USNORTHCOM, HAF or
      local FPCONs. (T-0)
      2.14.2.3. Consider implementing RAMs to mitigate and reduce risk for existing
      vulnerabilities.
      2.14.2.4. RAM implementation shall be compatible and coordinated with ongoing law
      enforcement or CI surveillance detection and ID measures. When random vehicle
      inspections (RVI) are employed as a RAM, ensure pre-coordination with the installation
      legal office. Follow existing law enforcement rules when employing RVIs as a RAM.
      2.14.2.5. Consider methods to make RAMs visible in order to confuse or expose enemy
      surveillance attempts and preoperational planning.
      2.14.2.6. Make efforts to include local, State, Federal and host nation law enforcement
      patrols and first responders, as appropriate.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                                 51


       2.14.2.7. Implement RAMs installation-wide or focused on facilities or functions
       identified as potential targets. When implementing facility-specific RAMs, consider the
       possibility increased security on a particular building may signal its importance.
       2.14.2.8. Installation RAM implementation efforts shall be monitored, tracked and
       analyzed by the installation ATO. Effectiveness of RAMs should be measured by the
       ATO and analyzed by the TWG.
       2.14.2.8. (AFGSC) RAM tracking documentation will be maintained by the wing ATO
       for a minimum of one (1) year. Effectiveness of RAMs shall be analyzed by the TWG at
       least semiannually. (T-2)
2.15. Standard 15: AT Measures for AF Off-Installation Facilities, Housing and Activities.
   2.15.1. Installations shall include specific AT measures for AF-owned or leased off-

   federal, state, local, or tribal/host nation authorities to coordinate security measures, response
   capabilities, and assistance requirements.
       2.15.3.1. Ensure such agreements are reviewed annually by the OPR, ATWG and JA for
       currency and executability. They should be exercised annually and all parties to the
       agreement should participate in at least one exercise annually.
       2.15.3.2. It is the specific responsibility of the support agreement OPR to coordinate the
       support agreement and ensure one copy is filed with the installation office of primary
       responsibility for support agreements.
       2.15.3.2. (AFGSC) It is the specific responsibility of the support agreement OPR to
       coordinate the support agreement and then ensure one copy is filed with the installation’s

   Security Engineering and Design Course to review, document and track construction projects
   for compliance with UFCs and AT Standards. Take into consideration retention and
   competence of personnel. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) security engineering
   course and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) Antiterrorism/Security
   Engineering Workshop fulfills this requirement.
2.18. Standard 18: AT Measures for Logistics and Other Contracting.
   2.18.1. AT measures shall be incorporated into the logistics and contracting processes
   (requirements development, vendor selection, award, execution and evaluation) when the
   provisions of the contract or services provided affect the security of DoD elements,
   personnel, mission-essential cargo, equipment, assets or services. When commensurate with
   risk, consider AT performance/compliance as an evaluation factor for contract award (past
   performance and proposed performance under the instant contract) and as a performance
   metric under the resultant contract.
   2.18.1. (AFGSC) During the logistics requirements and contracting processes (e.g., contract
   requirements definition, and contract award), AT measures and actions shall be considered.
   NCI 10-222 provides GCC additional guidance. Additionally, the awarding of future
   contracts should be contingent upon the application of appropriate AT measures and past AT
   performance.
      2.18.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Contracting Squadrons, in coordination with the
      installation ATO, shall develop procedures to review contracts for AT compliance and
      concerns. This process will be documented or annexed in the installation AT Plan. (T-2)
   2.18.2. All unescorted persons entering DoD installations, to include contractors, sub-
   contractors and laborers, delivery personnel and vendors, must have a valid purpose to enter,
   have their identity proofed and vetted, and be issued, or be in possession of, an authorized

   Commanders will work with local and host nation authorities to identity proof and vet
   applicants to the greatest extent practical and lawful IAW established SOFA.
      2.18.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Commanders shall ensure the minimum USNORTHCOM
      requirements for identity validation, addressed in NCI 10-222, Chapter 32, are addressed
      in the contracting process. (T-0) Requirements development teams shall work with
      installation ATOs and SF to ensure AT measures are incorporated into performance work
      statements prior to award of a contract. AT measures shall address elements such as
      background checks, base access requests, and training (as appropriate) prior to allowing
      contractor employees access to the installations. (T-2)
   2.18.3. Site-specific risk mitigation measures shall be developed and implemented to
   maintain positive control of DoD contractor and sub-contractor access to and movement
   within installations, sensitive facilities and classified areas.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                             55


       2.18.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Installations should refer to DTM (I) 09-012 and DODI

       Contractor Access to Air Force Installations, clauses are incorporated into all
       construction and services solicitations and contracts, as well as ensure requirements have
       been reviewed by the ATO.
       2.18.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Assigned trusted agents and quality assurance evaluators to
       each contract shall ensure contractor and sub-contractor compliance with the
       implementation of appropriate AT measures to include higher FPCONs as outlined in the
       performance work statements. (T-2)
   2.18.4. Site-specific risk mitigation measures shall be developed and implemented to screen
   contractor or sub-contractor transportation conveyances for explosive hazards before entry
   into or adjacent to areas with DoD personnel and mission-essential assets.
   2.18.5. Contracts shall comply with the AT clauses of the DFARS.
   2.18.6. Contracts shall incorporate Level I - AT Awareness Training requirements (Standard
   25).
2.19. Standard 19: AT Measures for Critical Asset Security.
   2.19.1. IAW AFI 31-101, risk management measures shall be developed to reduce the risk of
   loss to DoD assets assessed as critical in Standard 5, to include distributive information or
   computer-based systems and networks. Integrate these measures into overall AT program
   efforts.
   2.19.2. AFOSI and the DFC will coordinate with appropriate local, State, and Federal or
   tribal/host nation authorities responsible for the security of non-DoD assets deemed essential
   to the functioning of DoD assets assessed as critical.
   2.19.3. Criticality assessments should be coordinated with affected DCIP and Air Force
   CARM, and conducted IAW the principles in DoDD 3020.40, AFPD 10-24, and identify
   defense critical infrastructure and critical assets.
2.20. Standard 20: Terrorism Incident Response Measures.
   2.20.1. Incident response measures shall be developed consistent with the principles outlined
   in DoD 5200.08-R, DoDI 6055.17, and AFI 10-2501 and referenced in the overall AT plan.
   These measures shall include procedures for determining the nature and scope of incident
   response (including incidents with a CBRNE component); procedures for coordinating
   security, fire, medical, hazardous material and other emergency responder capabilities; and
   steps to recover from the incident while continuing essential operations. Appropriate
   reference will be made in the AT plan referencing the CEMP 10-2 for emergency response
   procedures.
   2.20.2. AF Components to a GCC or GCCs prepare incident response measures for their
   AOR. AFOSI and Force Protection Detachments should be included in contingency
   planning for in-transit units.

   2.20.3. (Added-AFGSC) Commanders shall ensure GCC requirements levied in NCI 10-
   222 are reviewed when developing incident response measures consistent with the principles
   outlined in DoD 5200.08-R, DoDI 6055.17, and AFI 10-2501. (T-0)
   2.20.4. (Added-AFGSC) Commanders shall conduct drills to familiarize personnel with
   individual responsibilities during building evacuations or shelter-in-place contingencies. (T-
   0)
2.21. Standard 21: Terrorism Consequence Management Measures.
   2.21.1. Consequence management, CBRNE and public health emergency preparedness, and
   emergency response measures are included in AT Plans to complement and support the
   overall AT plan and installation emergency management plans. For the AF these measures
   are found in the CEMP 10-2, MCRP, AT, or IDP. Related contents of other plans should be
   referenced in the AT plan. These measures shall focus on mitigating vulnerabilities of
   personnel, families, facilities and materiel to terrorist use of CBRNE weapons, as well as
   overall disaster planning and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack. These measures
   shall include integration with DoD emergency responder guidelines provided in DoDI
   6055.17, AFI 10-2501, and mass notification system standards under UFC 4-021-01, Design
   and O&M: Mass Notification Systems; establishment of medical surveillance systems
   consistent with DoDD 6490.02E, Comprehensive Health Surveillance and AFI 10-2604,
   Disease Containment Planning; deployment of CBRNE sensors and detectors; providing
   collective protection when available in High Threat Areas as defined in AFI 10-2501; and
   providing personal protective equipment (PPE) or individual protective equipment (IPE) in
   the following priority and IAW AFI 10-2501:
   2.21.1. (AFGSC) Commanders shall ensure GCC requirements levied in NCI 10-222 are
   reviewed when developing terrorist consequence management measures. (T-0)
      2.21.1.1. First Responders and Emergency Responders. Personnel responding to known
      or suspected CBRNE hazards, as determined by incident commander, shall be provided
      protection needed to perform their duties in an unknown hazard environment.
      Responders should use the maximum possible protection until determined otherwise by
      competent authority.
      2.21.1.2. Critical Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of critical
      military missions (whether military, civilian, contractor, host nation personnel or third
      country nationals), such as critical personnel assigned to mission essential functions
      (MEFs) described in AFI 10-208, Continuity of Operations (COOP) Program, shall be
      provided an appropriate level of protection to support continuity of those critical military
      missions. Since critical missions should be continued without interruption, collective or
      individual protection may be necessary to sustain them.
      2.21.1.3. Essential Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of
      essential military operations (whether military, civilian, contractor, host nation personnel
      or third country nationals) shall be provided an appropriate level of protection to support
      continuity for those essential military operations. Since essential operations may be
      interrupted for relatively short periods (e.g., hours to days), appropriate protection may be
      necessary to sustain essential operations (i.e., escape, survive and restore essential
      operations).
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              57


      2.21.1.4. Other Personnel. For all other persons not in the above categories, the
      objective will be to provide the procedures or protection necessary to safely survive an
      incident, e.g., shelter-in-place or evacuation procedures may fulfill this requirement.
      2.21.1.5. Included as part of the above categories are those who work or live on DoD
      installations worldwide, family members authorized overseas and DoD contractors if
      designated in contract agreements and designated as essential to perform critical DoD
      missions. The contract Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement must specify
      if PPE will be government or contractor provided.
   2.21.2. Site-specific C-CBRN preparedness and emergency response measures are
   developed and coordinated through the Emergency Management Flight and base medical
   personnel. These measures are implemented and synchronized with a corresponding FPCON
   measure for CBRNE-specific threats.
   2.21.3. Support agreements (i.e., MOU, MOA, MAA) or other similarly constructed
   protocols will be established with the appropriate local, State, Federal or tribal/host nation
   authorities to support AT plan execution and augment incident response and post-incident
   consequence management activities.
   2.21.3. (AFGSC) In order to support terrorist incident response measures, installation
   commanders shall ensure key functional personnel coordinate efforts with community and
   other federal agencies and shall ensure support agreements are produced and documented to
   leverage and such support. These documents must contain specific details of what support
   will be provided or received. Copies of support agreements shall be provided to the
   installation ATO upon request.
   2.21.4. The installation shall maintain mass warning and notification capabilities to warn all
   personnel immediately, but not longer than 10 minutes after incident notification and
   verification. The mass warning and notification must give response direction using
   intelligible voice communication, visible signals, text, text messaging, computer notification,
   tactile, or other communication methods.
   2.21.5. Installation public health emergency response measures that are synchronized with
   FPCON levels shall be developed and implemented.
      2.21.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) SG is responsible for preparing and coordinating installation
      public health emergency response measures and for coordinating with the ATO to
      synchronize those measures with FPCON levels.
   2.21.6. (Added-AFGSC) As dictated by the incident, the installation ATO should be
   included in the Crisis Action Team functioning as an advisor to the Commander.
2.22. Standard 22: Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Measures.
   2.22.1. The GCC is responsible for establishing the baseline FPCON for their AOR and
   procedures to ensure that FPCON measures are uniformly disseminated and implemented.
   The AF Component to the GCC is typically delegated to manage this task for the GCC. See
   Attachment 2 for a detailed listing of FPCON measures.
   2.22.1. (AFGSC) USNORTHCOM sets the baseline FPCON for the USNORTHCOM
   AOR and relays this through AFNORTH.      The commanders of USSTRATCOM,
   AFNORTH, AFGSC, NAFs, and installation commanders can adjust FPCONs within their
58                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


  geographic areas and personnel/assets; however, adjustments must not be less than the
  established USNORTHCOM's FPCON baseline or HHQ add-ons.
     2.22.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) FPCON change reports are not required based on
     implementation of RAM. Implementation of RAM does not constitute a baseline change
     to an established FPCON.
     2.22.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Any change, at any level, to the USNORTHCOM FPCON
     baseline will be reported IAW NCI 10-222, Chapter 10. (T-0)
         2.22.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) FPCON change reports are required for all FPCON
         changes as described in NCI 10-222, para 10.1.4. All reports will be rendered to the
         N2C2 through the DoD elements’ chains of command within the timelines and
         methods described in NCI 10-222, Chapters 10 and 15.
  2.22.2. Installation commanders with AT responsibility and higher shall:
     2.22.2.1. Determine an appropriate FPCON level for those personnel and assets for
     which they have AT responsibility. Subordinate commanders (to include GSUs and
     elements ‘off-site’) may raise a higher-level commander’s FPCON level, but they shall
     not lower the FPCON level without the higher-level commander’s written concurrence.
         2.22.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Installation command posts will ensure proper
         OPREP-3 reporting procedures and will inform the Tyndall-AFNORTH Command
         Center and the AFNORTH Force Protection (FP) Watch (AFNORTH A7S OMB) of
         any FPCON changes. (T-1)
         2.22.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Non-AFGSC tenant organizations               on    AFGSC
         installations must comply with local AT programs. (T-1)
     2.22.2.2. Classify site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to a
     FPCON as “CONFIDENTIAL.” When separated from the AT plan, specific AT
     measures linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to
     ”FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,” IAW DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program.
     2.22.2.3. Notify their next higher level commander of any FPCON measures the
     installation is unable to fully implement or if it does not apply. The notification will
     include rationale, corrective action or mitigation, ECD for full implementation, and
     installation OPR.
         2.22.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) FPCON Measure Deviations: The inability to meet
         minimum DOD, GCC, and AF installation AT requirements results in a higher force
         protection program risk. If it is determined certain mandated FPCON measures are
         inappropriate for current operations or negatively impact threat mitigation efforts,
         wing commanders shall request a waiver in writing through their respective chain of
         command to the respective FPCON declaring authority. USNORTHCOM waivers
         procedures are levied in NCI 10-222, Chapter 15. (T-0)
             2.22.2.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Per NCI 10-222 all waiver requests will address
             the name/location of installation or activity; date and timeframe waiver to be in
             effect; specific FPCON measure(s) in question and/or not being implemented;
             rationale for not implementing the measure; mitigating measures or actions to be
             implemented in lieu of waived measure(s); and operational impacts if not
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                           59


            approved.
            2.22.2.3.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure proper classification requirements are
            met. Approval can only be granted by the declaration authority, unless delegated.
            Deviations must be staffed through AFGSC A7S via ATPM.
            2.22.2.3.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Approved waivers, to include the name/title of
            the approving authority, must be forwarded to USNORTHCOM via AFNORTH
            within 24 hours of approval.
            2.22.2.3.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Tenants on AFGSC installations and facilities
            shall submit requests for FPCON waivers to the host installation. (T-0)
        2.22.2.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) CDRUSNORTHCOM withdrew AFNORTH waiver
        authority for FPCON Measure Bravo 12 (Verify identity of visitors to the installation
        and randomly inspect their suitcases, parcels and other containers) with the release of
        the NC/AFNORTH directives on FPCON Waiver Authority. Under this waiver
        process, if an installation is unable to meet requirements associated with FPCON
        measure Bravo 12, (where an EAL is not feasible) the installation CC must submit an
        FPCON Bravo 12 waiver request through their NAF to MAJCOM to AFNORTH and
        USNORTHCOM 90 days prior to the event. Each installation shall submit their
        Bravo 12 waiver requests to AFGSC ATPM at a minimum, 120 days prior to the
        event start date. USNORTHCOM requires wet signatures on the waiver request from
        the installation and MAJCOM commander. (T-0)
     2.22.2.4. Establish a review mechanism to ensure locally changed FPCON levels are
     commensurate with changing threats and the principles of risk management. This is
     essential because implementation of FPCON measures at elevated FPCON levels for an
     extended duration can be counterproductive to effective security and overall mission
     accomplishment. In some circumstances, based upon local conditions and the threat
     environment, commanders should consider requesting HHQ approval to implement a
     lower-level FPCON and supplement with other local security measures and RAMs as an
     effective alternative to executing the higher-level FPCON measures.
        2.22.2.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing ATOs shall report real world FPCON and/or
        additional measure changes to AFGSC ATPM as soon as practical upon the wing
        commander directing or wing implementation. Included in the report shall be the
        change, the intelligence driving the change, and the level at which the change was
        dictated. Report will be sent via NIPR or SIPR, based upon classification of material.
        2.22.2.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM will provide AFNORTH with
        telephonic notification as soon as practicable upon directing or implementing any
        FPCON and/or additional measure changes at any level.
        2.22.2.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Per NCI 10-222, USNORTHCOM requires record
        message traffic within four hours of any FPCON and/or additional measure changes
        at any level.
     2.22.2.5. Develop and implement site-specific FPCON measures for AF installations and
     separate facilities to supplement the FPCON measures and actions enumerated for each
     FPCON level. In addition to establishing procedures for raising FPCON levels, ensure
 60                                                 AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


      procedures are developed for stepping back down from higher FPCONs. Consult GCC
      supplementary FPCON guidance for in-transit forces. The development of site-specific
      FPCON measures must permit sufficient time and space to determine hostile intent, while
      fully considering constraints imposed by standing rules of engagement in CJCSI
      3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules For the Use of Force For U.S.
      Forces, and rules of force under AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
      Personnel. Organic intelligence, CI and law enforcement resources, institutional
      knowledge of the area and comprehensive understanding of organic capabilities,
      supported by national and AOR assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON
      measures to be implemented at specific sites.
          2.22.2.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) HHQ FPCON measures are not all inclusive and some
          may not be practical for a specific situation. Each installation AT Plan will
          incorporate existing FPCON measures and any additional measures (location
          specific) that enhance the security of personnel, families, and facilities. (T-0)
          2.22.2.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Installation specific FPCON checklists will be revised
          as necessary within 60 days of any changes to DOD, GCC, AF, MAJCOM and/or
          local guidance changes. (T-2)
      2.22.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Additional commander responsibilities levied by NCI 10-
      222.
          2.22.2.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Disseminate and implement of FPCON measures.
          2.22.2.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Establish a review mechanism for assessing long-term
          FPCON deviations every 90 days and lowering of FPCON levels as soon as the threat
          environment permits.
          2.22.2.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Publish          guidance     outlining    procedures     for
          implementing the FPCON system.
2.23. Standard 23: AT Training and Exercises.
   2.23.1. All elements of the AT program shall be integrated into training and exercises related
   to Force Protection. AT lessons learned and the AT risk assessment (derived from the
   IDRMP) should guide the focus of training and exercises to ensure activities are supported by
   relevant threat, vulnerability, and criticality information.
   2.23.2. Elements of the AT plan shall be exercised annually and synchronized with other ID,
   EM, COOP and CARM program requirements. The installation shall coordinate with the
   installation EET to develop a comprehensive annual exercise program which provides for
   individual and collective AT proficiency training and realistic AT exercise scenarios. The
   AT focus of exercises will be on the identification of vulnerabilities and AT program
   shortfalls which could contribute to the risk of terrorist attack against DoD personnel and
   assets. Scenarios must, at a minimum, exercise terrorist threat assessment and planning,
   mitigation and response to a terrorist incident (to include AT-specific MOA/MOU/MAAs
   and participation by local support elements), and consequence management measures
   following a terrorist incident. Site-specific FPCON measures from current FPCON through
   FPCON CHARLIE must also be exercised annually at all AF installations and separate
   facilities.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            61


     2.23.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) The installation ATO shall coordinate with the Wing
     Inspection Team to develop a comprehensive exercise program. Installations will
     conduct a minimum of one AT exercise incorporating some aspect of CBRNE
     preparedness annually. This combined AT/CBRNE exercise can be conducted separately
     or in conjunction with annual AT exercise requirement. Exercises should incorporate the
     most recent and/or likely terrorist threat scenarios currently in existence.
     2.23.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Installation commanders shall ensure annual AT exercise
     training encompasses all aspects of AT and validates the standard physical security
     measures, emergency management, terrorist incident responses, and FPCON measures.
     (T-0)
     2.23.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Site-specific FPCON measures from current FPCON
     through FPCON DELTA must also be exercised annually at all installations and separate
     facilities. (T-0)
     2.23.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) AT exercises shall incorporate maximum participation by
     all base units and tenant units with minimum simulation. Wings should make every
     effort to use local community first responders for the exercises. AT exercise scenarios
     may be held in conjunction with other AF required exercises (e.g., HAZMAT, Force-on-
     Force, Mass Casualty, etc.) to meet various AFI requirements. Each AT exercise will be
     conducted and documented by the Wing Inspection Team, providing a critique with
     findings, observations, and lessons learned. The exercise should incorporate the most
     recent and/or likely terrorist threat scenarios currently in existence. Additional
     requirements are levied in NCI 10-222, Chapter 27.
  2.23.3. AT exercise documentation shall be maintained for no less than two years by
  Installation EET. Identified exercise findings will be presented to the ATWG and
  tracked/managed by installation EET until corrected or closed. AT lessons learned must be
  incorporated into appropriate plans and programs and submitted into the Joint Lessons
  Learned Information System (JLLIS) at https://www.jllis.mil. AT training shall also be
  incorporated into pre-deployment training and exercises as required by the GCC. Pre-
  deployment AT training exercises should include terrorism scenarios specific to the deployed
  location and based on current enemy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Refer to
  paragraph 2.7.2 for a list of AT threat planning scenarios to assist in exercise development.
  Units will ensure they allow for a local Table and Rule within their respective file plans to
  maintain this reference data for unit continuity and action as required.
  2.23.3. (AFGSC) AT lessons learned will be validated by AFGSC ATPM prior to
  submission. Once approved, the Wing Inspection Team shall submit lessons learned through

          Defense Combating Terrorism Exhibits POM.
      2.30.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) AT/FP projects will be incorporated into the wing IPL for
      funding consideration. Wing leadership must emphasize appropriate prioritization for the
      program.
2.31. Standard 31: Comprehensive AT Program Review.
   2.31.1. Comprehensive AT program reviews are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and
   adequacy of AT program implementation. The evaluation shall include an assessment of the
   degree to which Air Force AT programs comply with the standards prescribed in this
   Instruction. AT program reviews shall evaluate all mandatory AT program elements
   (Standard 1) and assess the viability of AT plans (Standard 7) in view of local operational
   environment constraints and conditions. The DoD Antiterrorism Handbook provides
   procedures and recommendations to conduct comprehensive AT Program reviews. Other
   procedures include reviewing AT programs based on DoD, GCC, and AF VAT AT
   benchmarks.
   2.31.2. Comprehensive AT program reviews shall be conducted at least annually by all
   commanders required to establish AT programs and may be conducted in conjunction with
   annual VAs.
      2.31.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) PRs and the results derived will be classified IAW the
      guidance provided in the DTRA Security Classification Guide for Vulnerability
      Assessments.

     2.31.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) The wing commander shall review the wing’s AT program
     and plans at least annually to ensure compliance with directives and to continuously
     improve the AT program. (T-1) The wing commander will sign and the wing ATO shall
     forward the annual AT PR to AFGSC ATPM via NIPR or SIPRNET within 30 days of
     being signed. (T-1) It is recommended the wing level PR be conducted in conjunction
     with local VA.
         2.31.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) USNORTHCOM levies the requirement for
         commanders, at all levels, to conduct a documented compliance review of AT
         Program and plans of their immediate subordinates in the chain of command at least
         annually per NCI 10-222, Chapter 26.
  2.31.3. Pre-deployment AT program reviews shall be conducted to ensure that deploying
  units have viable AT programs and executable AT plans for transit to, from, and during

  significant changes in threat, vulnerabilities or asset criticality.
  2.31.5. MAJCOMs shall ensure subordinate commands undergo a HHQ AT program review
  at least once every 3 years. The ultimate outcome of triennial AT program reviews is the
  identification of AT program deficiencies that may be exploited by terrorists. AT program
  review teams should provide realistic solutions aimed at improving AT program
  implementation and risk mitigation strategies.
  2.31.5. (AFGSC) NAF will track and ensure HHQ PRs are scheduled for subordinate wings
  once every 36 months (GCC requirement).
     2.31.5.1. Triennial AT program reviews conducted in conjunction with a HHQ VAs or
     JSIVAs satisfy the requirement for an annual AT program review.
     2.31.5.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM and IG Gatekeeper will ensure AFVAT and JSIVAs
     complete PRs during the HHQ VAs. AFGSC IG Consolidated Unit Inspections will not
     be counted as a HHQ AT PR unless required Benchmarks are used by the IG and AT
     Standard 32 requirements are met.
         2.31.5.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Whenever possible, the AFGSC ATPM will be an
         AFGSC observer as an over-the-shoulder for JSIVA or AFVA with the intent of
         supporting the wing and installation. AFGSC ATPM will pre-coordinate with the
         HHQ VA team leader and installation commander.
         2.31.5.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM will validate with NAFs and
         installation ATOs annually (October – November timeframe) to ensure each
         installation is scheduled for and undergoes an external AT program review at least
         once every 36 months.
     2.31.5.2. In addition to providing an assessment of compliance with the AT Standards, a
     HHQ VA or JSIVA shall assess and evaluate the viability of a headquarter’s AT policies,
     subordinate AT program implementation, the methodology for addressing resource
     shortfalls, inter-organization coordination and synchronization of AT program elements.
  2.31.6. Tenant commands and units located on AF installations shall be included in
  comprehensive AT program reviews.

Terms
Active Defense—The employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a
contested area or position to the enemy.
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions
of the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources and (3) continue, sustain and restore combat and combat support operational capability
in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil support
operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DoD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is managed by the
Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces.

for subordinates. An AT plan contains command-specific guidance for the establishment of an
AT program and the implementation of the AT Standards.
AT Program—One of several security-related programs that fall under the overarching
combating terrorism and FP programs. The AT program is a collective, proactive effort focused
on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DoD personnel and their families,
facilities, installations and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment as well as the
preparation to defend against and planning for the response to the consequences of terrorist
incidents. Although not elements of AT, plans for terrorism consequence management
preparedness and response measures as well as plans for continuing essential military operations
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              85


are important adjuncts to an effective AT program. The minimum elements of an AT program
are AT risk management, planning, training and exercises, resource application and program
reviews.
AT Program Review—The systematic assessment of the AT program against the AT Standards.
AT Resource Application—The process of applying risk management to vulnerabilities and
where the resultant risk is not acceptable after applying mitigation measures, elevating the
vulnerability with a resource request using the existing PPB&E system, the CCIF, the Physical
Security Program and other funding mechanisms. Central to success in resource application is
tracking and ensuring sufficient funding for identified AT program life-cycle costs and assessed
shortfalls to mitigate risk associated with terrorist capabilities.
AT Risk Management—The process of systematically identifying, assessing and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance possible adverse
outcomes with mission benefits. The end products of the AT program risk management process
shall be the identification of DoD elements and personnel that are vulnerable to the identified
threat attack means. From the assessment of risk based upon the three critical components of AT
risk management (threat assessment, criticality assessment and vulnerability assessment), the
commander must determine which DoD elements and personnel are at greatest risk and how best
to employ given resources and FP measures to deter, mitigate or prepare for a terrorist incident.
AT Training and Exercises—The process of developing individual, leader and collective skills
and of conducting comprehensive exercises to validate plans for AT incident response,
consequence management and continuity of essential military operations.
Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT)—Biological agents and toxins that present a high
bioterrorism risk to national security and have the greatest potential for adverse public health
impact with mass casualties of humans and/or animals or that pose a severe threat to plant health

consequences of a CBRNE situation. For domestic consequence management, the primary
authority rests with the States to respond. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) is the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) for domestic consequence management and the
Department of State (DoS) is the LFA for foreign consequence management.
Coordination—The necessary action to ensure adequate exchange of information to integrate,
synchronize and deconflict operations between separate organizations. Coordination is not
necessarily a process of gaining approval, but is most often used for mutual exchange of
information. Normally used between functions of a supporting staff. Direct liaison authorized
(DIRLAUTH) is used to coordinate with an organization outside of the immediate staff or
organization.

                                         Attachment 2
               FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION (FPCON) MEASURES

A2.1. General. The DoD FPCON System describes the progressive level of protective
measures that are implemented by all the DoD Components in anticipation of or in response to a
terrorist threat or attack. The FPCON System is the principal means through which commanders
apply an operational decision on how to best guard against the terrorist threat. The protective
measures identified in the FPCON System assist commanders in reducing the risks of terrorist
attacks and other security threats to DoD personnel, units and activities. The measures below are
derived from DoD AT Standard 22 (DODI 2000.16, Enclosure 4, DoD FPCON) and include AF
modifications. Commanders will ensure these measures and developed measures address local
and operational risks. Commanders must consider GCC policies, local laws, mutual support
agreements and/or the SOFA. Air Force commanders are responsible for implementing FPCON
measures.
A2.1. (AFGSC)General. GCC guidance for FPCON Measures is contained in NCI 10-222. As
the service component to USNORTHCOM, AFNORTH has TACON for FP for all USAF Title
10 forces, installations, activities, and agencies within the USNORTHCOM AOR. As such,
AFNORTH/A7S executes the AT/FP program/mission as directed by CDRUSNORTHCOM and
CDRAFNORTH. AF added measures will not be implied when an AFNORTH FPCON baseline
change is done. All AFNORTH FPCON changes will state specific AF added measures, if
deemed necessary. However, if a HHQ FPCON measure has an associate AF modified measure,
it will be implemented; even if not specifically stated in the AFNORTH FP Directive.
   A2.1.1. Commanders shall ensure the following when implementing FPCON measures:
       A2.1.1.1. Ensure there is an effective AT plan and the plan is widely known and
       practiced in order to use every airman as a sensor.
       A2.1.1.2. Analyze the threat and plan courses of action to defeat those threats. Detailed
       planning against plausible enemy courses of action will often point to vulnerabilities
       which can be mitigated through adjustments to TTPs and further mitigated through
       innovation and programming.
       A2.1.1.3. Consider force-on-force, “red team,” or intruder exercises to test COAs.
       Development and implementation of effective friendly COAs to counter known threats
       offers a reasonable deterrent effect and the opportunity for long-term success against
       terrorist attack.
       A2.1.1.4. Ensure personnel assigned tasks directed by FPCON measures are properly
       trained and available to carry out the tasks.
       A2.1.1.5. Based on the threat, employ sufficient patrols to deter enemy action, disrupt
       terrorist planning and respond to incidents or attacks against the installation. Patrols
       should focus protection on critical operational assets, mission support infrastructure and
       mass gathering locations.
       A2.1.1.6. Consider placing barriers to create standoff around identified critical assets,
       facilities with BSAT, restricted areas, high-occupancy facilities, flight line entry points
       and high value resource areas.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                             93


     A2.1.1.7. Review and be familiar with mutual aid and host-tenant support agreements.
     Keep law enforcement agencies (federal, state and local) appraised of the current
     situation and threat to determine the level of incident support the installation provides or
     receives.
     A2.1.1.8. Ensure the installation Disaster Response Force and its sub elements are
     trained and available for response as described in AFI 10-2501.
  A2.1.2. The DoD FPCON System consists of five progressive levels of increasing AT
  protective measures.
  A2.1.3. Site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to a FPCON, shall
  be classified CONFIDENTIAL. When separated from the AT plan, specific AT measures
  linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to FOR OFFICIAL
  USE ONLY, if appropriate.
  A2.1.4. Upon declaration of a FPCON level, all listed security measures for that FPCON
  level shall be implemented immediately unless waived in writing by the appropriate GCC or
  delegated representative. In non-DoD controlled facilities housing DoD occupants, DoD
  organizations shall implement applicable FPCON measures in space directly controlled by
  DoD to the extent possible. The supplementing RAMs and command-unique or site-specific
  measures should also be implemented to complicate a terrorist group’s operational planning
  and targeting.
     A2.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Upon notification of a higher/increased FPCON change by
     HHQ, all units will immediately report receipt of message, implement change and report
     attainment through their command centers to AFGSC Command Center and the Tyndall-
     AFNORTH Command Center.
     A2.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) TWGs at all levels should be formed immediately to
     determine if higher measures are required for their specific AORs. Notify AFGSC
     ATPM of findings and recommendations. (T-1)
         A2.1.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) If the wing determines to implement additional
         measure(s) above those identified in a HHQ baseline, which are not to be considered
         as part of a RAM program, this will change the installation’s baseline and must be
         immediately reported.
            A2.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing Command Post shall report to AFGSC
            Command Center of any increase. Wing ATOs shall report changes to AFGSC
            ATPM as soon as practical upon the wing commander directing or wing
            implementation. Included in the report to the ATPM shall be the change, the
            intelligence driving the change, and the level at which the change was dictated.
            Report will be sent via NIPR or SIPR, based upon classification of material.
            A2.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM will provide AFNORTH with
            telephonic notification as soon as practicable upon the implementation of any
            FPCON and/or additional measure changes at any level. Command Post shall
            report through normal reporting procedures.

                                         Attachment 3
                              TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A3.1. General. The standardized DoD methodology that describes the terrorist threat to DoD
personnel, facilities and interests shall be used to determine Terrorism Threat Levels (TTL). The
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DoD TTL for all countries. Terrorism threat levels
are established as the result of all-source analysis and incorporation of GCC and Military
Department input. The Joint Intelligence Task Force – Countering Terrorism coordinates
country TTLs with appropriate GCCs, Services and Defense Attaches.
   A3.1.1. DIA and the responsible GCC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
   This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn
   from available information. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in
   determining the appropriate FPCON level and measures. FPCON level declarations remain
   the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat levels are not tied to FPCON levels in
   any way and should not be confused. National-level DoD organizations cannot provide all
   intelligence that might be needed to make FPCON level determinations. Information from
   regional and tactical intelligence and local law enforcement authorities must also be
   considered.
   A3.1.2. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DoD-designated high physical threat
   countries. DoD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DoD
   Travel Security Policy.
A3.2. Terrorist Threat Levels. In assessing the terrorist threat to U.S. personnel and interests,
DoD intelligence agencies use a four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. The
following lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine
the level:
   A3.2.1. HIGH: Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and use large casualty producing
   attacks as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DoD presence and the
   operating environment favors the terrorist.
   A3.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their
   preferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks as their
   preferred method, but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
   A3.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present, but there are no indications of anti-US
   activity. The operating environment favors the host nation/US.
   A3.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.
A3.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors.
   A3.3.1. Operational Capability. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the group
   and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and ingenious
   use of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and willingness
   to conduct large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb containing
   thousands of kilograms of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at the target.
   Groups that selectively assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings causing
104                                                   AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


  limited property damage pose a decreased threat. The ability to operate on a regional or
  transnational basis and the overall professionalism of the group is also assessed.
  A3.3.2. Intentions. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against U.S.
  interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the
  conduct of operations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is
  especially true if the intentions are anti-DoD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the
  group is more focused on the host nation rather than U.S. interests is the other key
  component. Whether the group will react to high profile U.S.-led international events, such
  as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
  A3.3.3. Activity. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and
  whether that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is
  credible indications of U.S. targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final
  intelligence collection and movement of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening
  actions are contingency planning, training and logistical support. Activities that would make
  the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund raising or effective safe haven are
  considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by arrests or strikes on training
  camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
  A3.3.4. Operating Environment. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
  the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DoD interests in a given location. An
  important element of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to
  combat terrorism, its degree of cooperation with the U.S. and the quality of the reporting on
  terrorist groups in the country. A key element is whether there is a DoD presence and if so
  the type, size, location, political sensitivity and if temporary, its duration. It is also important
  to consider if the group is focused on DoD as its primary target for anti-US attacks. Another
  part of this factor is the overall political, economic and military stability of the country and
  its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

                RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCING PROCESSES

A4.1. Overview. The commander has an inherent command responsibility to reduce risks that
threaten the mission with available resources. Risk management, as described in AFPD 31-1,
aids the commander in assessing risk. If the commander cannot internally correct, mitigate or
assume risk, they must elevate these vulnerabilities and associated risk(s) through CVAMP.
CVAMP will forward the vulnerability through the chain of command to the GCC, who will
decide if the vulnerability will be reported higher.
A4.2. Resourcing. Emphasis should be placed on acquiring resources to detect, assess, warn,
defend or recover in order to prevent hostile acts or mitigate the effects. It is inherent upon the
organization to assess the resource requirement against other organizational unfunded or funded
requirements and determine if an internal reallocation of funding is appropriate and possible.
CVAMP is used to collate and track AT vulnerabilities and resourcing. The status of
vulnerabilities entered into CVAMP should be documented in CVAMP.
A4.3. AF Funding Sources.
   A4.3.1. Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPB&E). The PPB&E process
   includes requests considered during the POM funding cycle. This program is for long-term
   planning and the funds will not be available for two to five years. Information on the
   PPB&E process can be found in the DoD Management Initiative Decision 913.
   A4.3.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC ATPM will author MAJCOM POM submission for PEC 28047.
   A4.3.2. Installation and MAJCOM budget process and commander’s discretionary funds.
   A4.3.3. Many PEC and/or funding appropriations (AT, Physical Security, EM, Medical,
   Construction, Base Defense, Base Operating Support, Communications, Weapons of Mass
   Destruction Threat Response, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Program, Fire
   Emergency Services; Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (SRM), and military
   construction (MILCON), etc.) may be used to fund AT resourcing activities. Commanders
   will consider all PEC and funding appropriation sources as authorized by law and AF policy
   and guidance.
   A4.3.4. Use Antiterrorism Program Element 28047 as the primary funding source for
   manpower authorizations, antiterrorism equipment, procurement, military construction and
   the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to those resources and activities
   associated with the Air Force AT Program.
   A4.3.5. Specialized funds designed for AT and the war on terrorism.
A4.4. Combatant Commander’s Initiative Fund (CCIF). This program provides funds for
emergency or unforeseen (emergent) high priority force protection projects or equipment. It is
designed for requirements that need to be funded in the current fiscal year and provides a means
for the GCC to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in a terrorist threat, threat levels,
force protection doctrine/standards, as well as unanticipated requirements identified as a result of
VAs, tactical operations and exercising AT plans. The fund is not intended to subsidize ongoing
projects, supplement budget shortfalls, or support routine activities, which are a Service
responsibility. Requests must be submitted through the responsible MAJCOM to the AF
 106                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


Component Command which will submit to the appropriate GCC, and the GCC will prioritize
and submit to the CJCS. Submission instructions are outlined in CJCSI 7401.1.
A4.4. (AFGSC)Combatant Commander’s Initiative Fund (CCIF). AFGSC ATPM will
forward requests to USSTRATCOM for submission to Joint Staff and to AFNORTH for
submission to USNORTHCOM.
   A4.4.1. Emergency CCIF Requirement. An unanticipated requirement created by a
   combination of circumstances or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent,
   deter, or respond to a terrorist act.
   A4.4.2. Emergent CCIF Requirement. A newly-formed, unexpected requirement resulting
   from a logical consequence of unforeseen circumstances calling for prompt action.
   A4.4.3. AF Component Commands to GCCs must submit requests for CCIF funds through
   CVAMP.
   A4.4.3. (AFGSC) Wings submit CCIF request via package through the NAF to AFGSC
   ATPM. Package will be forwarded to AFNORTH and USSTRATCOM by the MAJCOM.
   A4.4.4. Emergent requirements should be less than 2 years old. The requestor must have an
   approved, executable and exercised AT plan.
A4.5. Effectively Managing the Resource Allocation Process.
   A4.5.1. Ensure you plan for training and maintenance costs into the out years.
   A4.5.2. The ATO needs to work closely with affected functional areas, installation financial
   advisors/comptroller and contracting from the beginning to address requirements. This will
   assist in identifying the appropriation sources and funding amounts.
   A4.5.2. (AFGSC) Wing ATOs must coordinate with other installation functional areas to
   ensure CVAMP and the AFGSC Unfunded AT Requirements Spreadsheet reflects the most
   current funding requirements.
   A4.5.3. Adequately articulating and justifying requirements is crucial.
   A4.5.3. (AFGSC) Information provided on the AFGSC Unfunded AT Requirements
   Spreadsheet will be used to build and validate future POM funding requirements submitted
   by AFGSC ATPM.
   A4.5.4. Determine all appropriate potential funding sources and submit requests through the
   various channels. Once a requirement is funded by a source, cancel all other requests. Note:
   The Joint Staff does not allow the same request to be submitted through both the PPB&E and
   CCIF process.
   A4.5.5. There are organizations that can aid the commander in identifying technology to
   satisfy requirements: Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG), Technical
   Support Working Group (TSWG), Joint Requirement Office for Chemical, Biological,
   Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND), and the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons
   Directorate (JNLWD). These organizations are separately funded to provide COTS
   information, rapid prototyping and research and development and/or evaluation of solutions
   for units in the field. They can provide information and research on technology and
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                        107


  equipment evaluated and deemed suitable for your purpose. Additionally, they can provide
  field assessments to assist in identifying the optimal solutions to meet your requirements.

  THE ANTITERRORISM STANDARDS FOR BUILDINGS DEVIATION PROGRAM

A6.1. Deviations to Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01 Minimum AT Standards for
Buildings. At facilities where compliance with UFC minimum AT standards for buildings
cannot be attained, or where deviation is appropriate, units will request deviation. Deviations
should not be used to avoid costs associated with compliance, but should be used where
compliance cannot be achieved.
A6.2. Overview. This program formalizes AT program risk acceptance for all facilities. The
inability to meet minimum AT standards for buildings at such facilities results in a higher AT
program risk that must be managed. Commanders must implement the AT deviation program
where resources cannot be afforded the required protection per UFC minimum AT standards for
buildings. Deviations associated with such conditions are considered permanent and require
compensatory measures.
A6.2. (AFGSC)Overview. The deviation program provides a management tool for wing
commanders and MAJCOMs to review, monitor, plan, and program corrections to deviations
from approved guidance. The ultimate goal of the program is to ensure correction of all
deviations as quickly as possible.
   A6.2.1. Applicability. This program applies to the following types of facilities as indicated.
   A6.2.1. (AFGSC) Requests for deviation for projects which have passed the planning phase
   prior to AFI 10-245 implementation will follow requirements listed in NCI 10-222.
   USNORTHCOM is the approval authority for all deviations from USNORTHCOM directed
   AT requirements to include AT design standards contained in NCI 10-222. All others use the
   established AF process with copy provided to AFNORTH to submit to USNORTHCOM.
   (T-0)
       A6.2.1.1. New Construction. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for buildings
       are required for all new facilities that enter the planning phase after this instruction goes
       into effect. Subordinate commands may issue stricter guidance that requires deviations
       for pre-existing construction through supplementation of this instruction.
       A6.2.1.2. Major Renovations. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for
       buildings are required for major renovations to existing facilities that enter the planning
       phase after this instruction goes into effect. Major renovations, modifications, repairs,
       revitalizations, and restorations are defined per UFC 4-010-01 as those whose costs
       exceed 50% of the plant replacement value of the existing building.
       A6.2.1.3. Leased Facilities. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for buildings
       are required for all leased facilities where DoD personnel occupy leased or assigned
       usable office area constituting at least 25% of the usable building area. This requirement
       applies to new and existing leases. While the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum
       dated 12 July 2011 temporarily suspended UFC 4-010-01 requirements for lease renewals
       or extensions, the memorandum did not alleviate these facilities from this requirement to
       establish deviations. This is an interim situation until comparisons between DoD
       completes its assessment of DoD and interagency standards for leased space and
       determines which standards are appropriate.
 110                                                  AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


A6.3. Categorizing Deviations. A deviation must first be categorized under either a UFC
minimum AT standard for buildings or a physical security standard. If a minimum UFC AT
standard for buildings is being deviated from, follow the review, approval and routing criteria
outlined in this instruction. If a Physical Security Standard is being deviated from, follow the
approval and routing criteria outlined in AFI 31-101, paragraph 6.8. Where the GCC with
TACON for FP prescribes procedures different from those prescribed above, follow the
procedures of the GCC.
A6.4. Compilation of Deviations. Consider all other deviations when requesting and approving
deviations to prevent a combination of deviations from creating an overall security problem.
Individual or compilation of deviations must not cause a greater security threat or vulnerability
than the problem they were originally designed to address.
A6.4. (AFGSC)Compilation of Deviations. Consider all deviations submitted by others before
creating a new AF Form 116 (example: SFS may already have a deviation for the perimeter.)
(T-2)
A6.5. Documenting Deviations. Document deviations on AF Form 116, Request for Deviation
from Security Criteria, and submit each deviation for formal approval. Based on the long-term
nature and risk-tolerance level of these deviations, they must be incorporated into the AT Plan
and assigned compensatory measures in the IDP once formal approval has been granted. Do not
apply for formal approval if the directive from which you are deviating specifically states it is
not necessary.
A6.5. (AFGSC)Documenting Deviations. Deficiencies which cannot be explained verbally
will be accompanied by photographs, maps, diagrams or other pictorial aids. All deviations must
include an estimated completion date, if known, particularly if upgrade or construction is
involved. Additionally, the projected total costs associated with closing the deficiency will be
included, if not waived. (T-2) Implement compensatory measures immediately upon detection
of a vulnerability to the greatest extent practical. Do not wait for written approval of a deviation
request. (T-1)
   A6.5.1. Completing the AF Form 116.
       A6.5.1.1. The requestor of the deviation will complete blocks 1-18. If staffed
       electronically, the coordination boxes in block 15 (if used) must be completed before the
       digital signature is affixed in block 18; once the digital signature is affixed, the
       coordination boxes become locked. Once the requestor signs block 18, the AF Form 116
       is sent to the Reviewing Official. The Reviewing Official will complete blocks 19-24. If
       staffed electronically, the coordination boxes in block 21 (if used) must be completed
       before the digital signature is affixed in block 24; once the digital signature is affixed, the
       coordination boxes become locked. Once the Reviewing Official signs block 24, the AF
       Form 116 is sent to the Approval Authority.
       A6.5.1.1. (AFGSC) All deviation requests will be routed through the appropriate NAF
       CC for coordination prior to submission to AFGSC.
           A6.5.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Deviations related to physical security requirements
           will be maintained by the installation SF unit. SF shall forward a copy of the AT
           related deviation to the installation ATO.
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                           111


         A6.5.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Deviations related to UFC standards will be authored
         and submitted by the BCE or CES designated representative to the wing for
         coordination. The requestor of the deviation may be someone other than BCE, but
         the submission must be BCE. The installation staffing package will include the
         installation ATO as a coordinating official prior to installation commander
         submission for signature. Under mitigation section, total projected costs to alleviate
         the deviation will be included. (T-2)
             A6.5.1.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) NCI 10-222 requires no deviation request for
             standoff requirements, if equivalent protection (hardening of the structure) is
             provided. See NCI 10-222 for more details.
         A6.5.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Once completed at the installation level, the
         installation ATO will forward the AF Form 116 to the NAF for coordination via SIPR
         or NIPR dependent upon classification.
     A6.5.1.2. The Approval Authority will complete blocks 25-32. If staffed electronically,
     the coordination boxes in block 29 (if used) must be completed before the digital
     signature is affixed in block 32; once the digital signature is affixed, the coordination
     boxes become locked. Any blocks that do not apply will be marked N/A.
     A6.5.1.3. Ensure that block 8 of the AF Form 116 includes the number of personnel
     impacted and the criticality of the facility or facility mission. In addition to the
     justification in block 9 of AF Form 116, provide a summary of the risk analysis
     performed that supports the deviation and the compensatory measures. Also within block
     9 include an impact statement should the deviation be denied. Within block 10 of AF
     Form 116, validate that the compensatory measures are resourced for the duration of the
     deviation. Within block 11 of AF Form 116, state if the corrective action proposed to
     resolve the deviation is budgeted.
  A6.5.2. Requesting Officials. Deviations from UFC minimum AT standards for buildings
  shall be requested by the chairperson of the installation ATEC (or equivalent).
  A6.5.3. Reviewing Officials. Reviewing Officials note whether compensatory measures are
  considered adequate and, if not, specify additional measures. Additionally, Reviewing
  Officials add pertinent information in block 20 to assist the Approval Authority in validating
  the request if necessary. Reviewing Official for minimum UFC AT standard for buildings
  deviations shall be the MAJCOM A7. MAJCOM A7C and/or A7P and MAJCOM ATPM
  will coordinate (at minimum).
     A6.5.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Any deviation requests for UFC AT standards for buildings
     will be submitted to the appropriate NAF for coordination by the installation ATO and
     then the NAF ATO will forward to AFGSC A7S. The request will then be forwarded to
     AFGSC A7P and A7C as the subject matter experts for UFC issues for coordination.
     After review and coordination the request will be returned to AFGSC A7S and ATPM for
     final coordination prior to submission to AFGSC A7 for review.
  A6.5.4. Approval Authority. The Approval Authority accepts or declines the risk involved
  in the deviation request, approves/disapproves requests, and returns them to the requester
  with rationale for the decision. The Approval Authority for deviations from minimum UFC
  AT standards for buildings shall be the MAJCOM Vice Commander. The Approval
 112                                                AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   authority for deviations from UFC AT Standards where the requester does not fall under the
   MAJCOM chain of command (DRUs, FOAs, etc.) shall be the first general officer/SES in the
   operational chain of command.
       A6.5.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) For deviations related to physical security requirements,
       per AFGSC SUP to AFI 31-101, the installation commander is the approval authority and
       will complete blocks 25-32 of the AF Form 116. NOTE: Review and approval authority
       will not be the same person. If the installation vice commander is the acting installation
       commander, delegate review authority to the group commander responsible for the area
       under consideration.
          A6.5.4.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) The installation ATO shall forward a copy of
          approved AT physical security deviations to AFGSC ATPM. Programmed corrective
          actions and compensatory measures must be addressed on the AF Form 116. Include
          the estimated completion date(s) if known. (T-2)
       A6.5.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) UFC deviation requests will be reviewed by A7C, A7P,
       A7S and ATPM for submission to A7 for consideration and approval by the AFGSC CV.
       AFGSC ATPM will provide a copy of the approved deviation to the installation ATO to
       maintain for records keeping.
A6.6. Reviewing, Approving, and Disapproving Deviations.
   A6.6.1. MAJCOMs Responsibilities. MAJCOMs are responsible for the following:
       A6.6.1.1. Address the deviation approval process in MAJCOM supplements.
       A6.6.1.2. Send deviation requests involving tenant units to the tenant’s MAJCOM
       Headquarters for coordination.
       A6.6.1.3. Ensure copies of all approved deviations from minimum UFC AT standards
       for buildings are forwarded through the responsible AT office of the AF Component
       Command to the Geographic Combatant Command (GCC) with TACON FP
       responsibility for the installation requesting the deviation. Follow GCC guidance on the
       frequency and content of reporting.
       A6.6.1.3. (AFGSC) AFGSC A7S will provide copies of approved UFC deviations to
       AFNORTH.
       A6.6.1.4. Ensure the Installation and MAJCOM ATEC (or equivalents) review all
       deviations annually.
A6.7. Exceptions to the Deviation Program.
   A6.7.1. Pre-existing Conditions. Deviations from minimum UFC AT standards for
   buildings are only required for new facilities or major renovations to existing facilities that
   enter the planning phase after this instruction goes into effect. Major renovations,
   modifications, repairs, revitalizations, and restorations are defined per UFC 4-010-01 as
   those whose costs exceed 50% of the plant replacement value of the existing building. Note
   that this pre-existing condition exception DOES NOT apply to leased facilities.
   A6.7.2. Directed by other security instructions. Deviations from standards established in
   other physical security instructions (such as AFI 31-101) shall be requested IAW procedures
AFI10-245_AFGSCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            113


   contained in that instruction. Use these procedures only for minimum AT standards for
   buildings required by UFC 4-010-01.
A6.8. Compensating for Deviations. Compensatory measures are inherently different than
security measures normally in-place. Although different, they must provide a comparable level
of security. Security measures, facilities, equipment, and procedures that are already required
are not normally adequate as compensatory measures. Instructions consisting mainly of orders to
“increase vigilance” are inadequate. Additional forces, equipment, etc., are usually necessary to
ensure comparable security. However, there are some instances when existing forces may be
used to compensate temporarily for deviations. All Integrated Defense (ID) contributors must be
aware of deviations in their assigned areas and instruct personnel on requirements.
Compensatory measures may include the following:
A6.8. (AFGSC)Compensating for Deviations. Compensatory measures shall be instituted for
each permanent deviation. If appropriate, one compensatory measure may suffice for more than
one deviation.
   A6.8.1. Equipment, such as additional locks, intrusion detection systems (IDS), lighting, and
   barricades.
   A6.8.2. Security measures that provide the same level of protection as the security standard
   being deviated from and compensated for as a minimum.
   A6.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) Implement compensatory measures immediately upon detection
   of deficiencies.

A7.1. Acquisition of Expertise. Unjustified attempts to obtain or conduct specialized training
in security concepts, military weapons or tactics, or other unusual capabilities such as specialized
transport or handling capabilities that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to
DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.1. (AFGSC)Acquisition of Expertise. Additional GCC added categories and explanations
are listed in USNORTHCOM FP Directive 11-100, Information Reporting Requirements, DTG:

person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.
A7.10. Surveillance. Monitoring the activity of DoD personnel, facilities, processes, or
systems, including showing unusual interest in a facility, infrastructure, or personnel (e.g.,

from a DoD facility or infrastructure that is related to a theft or loss associated with that facility.
A7.13. Weapons Discovery. Discovery of weapons or explosives, as defined in Section 930 of
Title 18, U.S.C. (Reference (n)). The discovery of personal weapons legally owned by DoD
civilian employees, military members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious

secure the weapon(s).
A7.14. Unexplained Absences of International Military Students. International military
students who are unexpectedly absent from scheduled activities when the absence is without
proper authorization and lasts more than 24 hours, and an appropriate official with the host DoD
