Addendum J, Unit Compliance Inspections, and ACC Instruction (ACCI) 90-202, ACC
Compliance and Standardization Requirements List (C&SRL) Program. It is used to evaluate
unit compliance with public law, executive orders, Department of Defense and Air Force
directives. This directory supports guidance contained in AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Management, COMBAT AIR FORCE (CAF) Supplemental guidance and
associated Air Force instructions and technical orders (T.O.) regarding Maintenance Weapons
Section programs, activities, and operations. This directory applies to all ACC units and Air
National Guard (ANG)/Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Associate bomber, fighter,
helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) units with Logistics Maintenance Flight
responsibilities. It applies to non-associate, ACC-Gained ANG units when an equivalent Nation
Guard Bureau-approved and published ANG C&SRL do not exist. It does not apply to AFRC
units which are not an associate program. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This is a
completely new C&SRL with numerous new and updated compliance items and individual
references to new AFI 21-101, CAF Supplement, and related publication hosting policies,
guidance and procedures governing Maintenance Weapons Section operations.
1. General.
    1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists are the primary lists used during
    HQ ACC/IG Unit Compliance Inspections (UCI) to access unit compliance with guidance
    governing each particular area of operations. Items in this C&SRL are defined by the HQ
    ACC and, as applicable ANG and AFRC (for associate units only), staffs and based upon
    existing “by-law” requirements, Executive Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC guidance,
    and mission areas deemed critical by AF, ACC and/or ANG leadership to assessing and
    assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of the C&SRL is to
    identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection
    items and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs)
    and the missions areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core
    and General Compliance Items may be stand-alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the
    UCI, it is the intent of the evaluation team to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that
    apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items listed do not limit the scope of the
    inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An area or item where unit failure to
       comply with established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or
       serious injury or significant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance
       and is important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical."
       Non-compliance would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could
       result in injury or possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to
       successful overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal
       impact on mission accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible
       litigation. GCIs are shown in sentence case format.
    1.3. Applicability to Air Reserve Component (ARC) units. Unless otherwise designated,
    all compliance items apply to ACC and ACC/ARC associated units. Those CCOs designated
    with an asterisk (*) do not apply to ACC-gained ANG units.
