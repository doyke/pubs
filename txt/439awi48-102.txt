        1.1.6. Promote the use of recommended Management Internal Control Toolset checklist
        with regards to Hazard Communication, Hazardous Material and other related checklists
        i.e. personal protective equipment, respiratory protection etc.1.2. Squadron/unit level
        commanders and supervisors will:
        1.2.1. Develop, implement, and provide general and workplace specific HAZCOM
        training per AFI 90-821 and this instruction to all work center employees prior to work
        with HAZMAT. This training program shall be reviewed by the 439 AW/SEG, 439
        MSG/CEF and 439 MSG/SGPB offices prior to implementation.
        1.2.2. Limit the use of transfer containers whenever possible; however, if transfer
        containers are used on WARB, they shall be labeled similar to the source product and
        include all mandatory information per 29 CFR 1910.1200.
        1.2.3. Prohibit the use of chemicals/HAZMAT not obtained through the authorization
        process and ensure Government Purchase Card (GPC) holders complete required

        of a GPC to purchase chemicals/HAZMAT
439AWI48-102 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  3


     1.2.4. Coordinate with the appropriate HMMP base agencies (SGPB, SEG, and CEF)
     when questions arise concerning health, safety, storage compatibility, reactivity and/or
     any other HAZCOM issues.
     1.2.5. The supervisor shall ensure that labels are available on all products and develop a
     system to label small items or containers with defaced labels.
     1.2.6. Ensure industrial work centers maintain a HAZCOM Binder to include:
         1.2.6.1. Electronic access to AFI 90-821.
         1.2.6.2. HAZMART Authorized Users List (AUL). It is recommended that the shop
         HAZMAT AUL be used as the primary inventory whenever possible; this document
         represents only those HAZMATs that have been obtained and approved through the
         HAZMAT authorization process.
         1.2.6.3. A unit/work center HAZCOM workplace specific training plan and
         associated attachments which has been approved by 439 AW/SEG, 439 MSG/SGPB
         and 439 MSG/CEF.
         1.2.6.4. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs): At a minimum, an MSDS will be
         maintained for each HAZMAT item shops/sections have on-hand. In the event of a
         change in chemical constituents, MSDS update, or a different manufacturer, a copy
         of each MSDS must be maintained. Therefore, it may be necessary to maintain
         several MSDSs for a specific item until previously existing stock is deleted and the
         newer, more recent material, solely resides within a shop. Additionally, since JP-8,
         diesel fuel and unleaded fuel are not tracked through the HAZMART; it is still
         prudent to keep copies of MSDSs for all applicable HAZMAT to which personnel are
         potentially exposed.
         1.2.6.5. Employee Information and Training: All general and workplace specific
         training shall be conducted per AFI 90-821 and 29 CFR 1901.1200, and documented
         in each individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record or similar
         electronic/computer tracking system.
         1.2.6.6. Non-Routine Tasks- A listing of non-routine tasks shall be identified
         documented and maintained in accordance with applicable directives. If a shop does
         not perform non-routine tasks, a written statement will be accomplished and
         maintained verifying the absence of non-routine tasks.
  1.3. External (non-BOS) contractors will comply with all requirements of 29 CFR
  1910.1200, and AWI 32-7003.
     1.3.1. Submit MSDSs, an original (at the start of the contract) and final (at the end of
     the contract) 439 AW Form 20, Contractor Information Sheet, for hazardous
     chemical products that they will/have utilize(d).
  1.4. Contracting officer will:
     1.4.1. Advise contractors on requirements of HAZMART program through the use of a
     pre-construction meeting.
  1.5. The HAZMART will:
 4                                                            439AWI48-102 21 AUGUST 2013


        1.5.1. Provide a copy of the MSDS to the work center with each HAZMAT issue.
        1.5.2. Participate in WARB HMP team meetings.
2. Hazardous Materials.
     2.1. Shops will request authorization from the HMMP Team each time a new chemical is
     required for the work area. This is done through use of EESOH-MIS, which is the current
     electronic request method. If the MSDS is not available through EESOH-MIS or the
     manufacturer/supplier, the supervisor and SGPB will attempt to obtain the MSDS using
     established procedures.
     2.2. The hazardous chemical inventory (shop HAZMART AUL) is produced from EESOH-
     MIS this inventory identifies a shop’s current hazardous material listing based on EESOH-
     MIS requests. SGPB will review this inventory during the routine industrial hygiene
     assessment. An updated copy of the inventory will be provided to the shop supervisor upon
     completion of the routine industrial hygiene survey/assessment.
     2.3. Due to the dynamic changes in procurement over the past several years, the majority of
     HAZMAT is purchased utilizing the GPC system. As a result, the potential for the purchase
     of HAZMAT without proper coordination through EESOH-MIS and the WARB HAZMART
     does exist. Therefore it is everyone’s responsibility to utilize correct procedures and report
     the unauthorized procurement of HAZMAT to their supervisor and the HMMP team.
     2.4. Labeling of hazardous materials shall be in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.1200. In
     addition the following specific WARB processes shall be adhered to:
        2.4.1. If the label becomes defaced in any way or the HAZMAT is transferred into
        another container for use, then a new label must be applied to the container in accordance
        with 29 CFR 1910.1200. New labels can be obtained by contacting the HAZMART.
        These labels are produced from the Hazardous Material Information System located in
        the HAZMART.
        2.4.2. Unlabelled transfer containers are prohibited from use on WARB regardless of the
        application and/or process.
        2.4.3. Small tubes/bottles containing hazardous materials may require additional labeling
        if they do not meet the minimum requirements 29 CFR 1910.1200. This can be affixed to
        the product with the use of a wire, tag or any other acceptable method that identifies
        hazards to the user.
     2.5. Non-routine tasks involving HAZMAT.
        2.5.1. Non-routine tasks are:
            2.5.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area's normal activities but performed
            infrequently; for example, fuel cell augmentee duties, cleaning a solvent tank and
            changing the solvent, or cleaning up spills.
            2.5.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
            or job series.
            2.5.1.3. Work area operating instructions must thoroughly describe non-routine tasks,
            associated hazards, and controls for the infrequent tasks performed in this work area.
439AWI48-102 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                   5


         Operating instructions are not required when Technical Orders or other official
         documents adequately describe these tasks. Workers will review these procedures
         before performing the non-routine tasks.
         2.5.1.4. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the
         supervisor of the activity will ensure these individuals receive the following training
         prior to beginning the activity:
  2.6. Training:
     2.6.1. Supplemental training and lesson plans for activities that involve the use/or
     potential exposure to HAZMAT shall be developed and must include the specific
     HAZMAT involved in the process. The major focus for all training shall be the education
     of workplace specific hazards to employees who have the potential to be exposed to said
     chemicals.
     2.6.2. It is highly recommended workplace specific HAZCOM training be provided by
     work center supervisors to their employees on an annual basis. At a minimum,
     additional/follow-up workplace specific training must be accomplished when a new
     HAZMAT is obtained for use by shop personnel or when a new process/task is assigned.
