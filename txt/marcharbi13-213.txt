                                             Chapter 1

                                            GENERAL

1.1. Applicability. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield at March ARB must be
familiar with local airfield driving procedures as outlined in this instruction, and must have a
valid Air Force Information Management Tool (AF Form) 483, Certificate of Competency,
stamped Airfield Authorized and signed by airfield management personnel.
1.2. Environment. Vehicles are required on the airfield to support operations and maintenance.
Although Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs) provide the bulk of required vehicle support,
some situations require augmentation by non-government vehicles. Vehicle traffic greatly
amplifies the potential for collisions, injury, Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, and
security incidents. Positive control of vehicles and vehicle operators is imperative.
1.3. Scope.
     1.3.1. This instruction establishes responsibilities and operating procedures for vehicle
     operations, motorized or non-motorized, on the airfield. Vehicle operation is for official use
     only, with maximum attention paid to safety and accident prevention. Operators will not
     deviate from procedures or principles set forth in this instruction except in the interest of
     safety. Airfield safety is paramount; conscientious and safe operations can prevent most
     accidents. The requirements of this instruction will be included in the unit’s self-inspection
     program, if personnel perform airfield driving duties. An Airfield Driving Program Self
     Inspection Checklist is included at Attachment 3.
     1.3.2. Vehicles on the airfield present a clear and definite danger, both to aircraft and ground
     personnel. Carelessness, haste and disregard for established safety standards are the primary
     sources of aircraft/vehicle incidents. Human beings, by nature, are creatures of habit. The
     goal of the Airfield Driving Program (ADP) is to maintain a safe flying environment by
     training all personnel to establish good/safe airfield vehicle operating habits.
     1.3.3. The standards set in this instruction apply to all owners, users and operators of
     vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) on the airfield. Only properly trained and certified
     personnel may drive on the airfield. All personnel operating a vehicle on the airfield must be

      frequency when in the CMA.
      4.1.4. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers
      when driving in the CMA.
      4.1.5. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a permanent radio
      mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the Air Traffic Control Tower. A hand-held
      radio should only be used as a backup or when communication is required outside the
      vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the airfield.
      4.1.6. Do not issue or use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when authorizing
      vehicles to enter the runway for the purpose of an airfield inspection/check or other airfield
      operation. See FAA JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, for additional information.
      4.1.7. Limit crossing the runway to vehicle operators/traffic performing mission essential
      duties and then only to an absolute minimum. Note: When crossing a runway is required
      during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
      4.1.8. Vehicle drivers and/or pedestrians operating on the CMA must use a distinct call sign
      (e.g., Airfield 3, Chief 2, Sweep23, and TA 15). Note: Do not use a call sign that is also a
      part of Air Traffic Control Tower phraseology, such as ―Taxi. See Attachment 11 see
      chart below:

  Table 4.2. example of CMA call signs.
For standardization, AM personnel will use the radio call signs listed below. Note: AM
personnel at Joint/Shared-Use and host nation airfields may use different vehicle call signs to
prevent duplication/similar call signs with local civilian airport operations personnel.

          4.1.8.1. Vehicular call signs should be approved by the AFM or Wing ADPM to ensure
          duplicate call signs are not used. (See Attachment 11 for approved vehicular call signs.)
      4.1.9. Procedures for emergency removal of a vehicles and/or pedestrians in the event of
      vehicle radio failure. At a minimum, procedures will include the following:
          4.1.9.1. Air Traffic Control Tower will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert
          vehicle operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
          requires them to immediately exit the runway.
MARCHARBI13-213 17 JULY 2014                                                                  23

           runway operations.
           4.1.9.2.2. If not able to communicate with Air Traffic Control Tower or AM via
           radio, use other means of communication such as a cellular phone (when available).
           4.1.9.2.3. Report incident to AFM immediately.       Caution: All vehicles and
           personnel must maintain a minimum of 100 feet in distance from any portion of the
           runway edge at all times, unless specifically approved by the Air Traffic Control
           Tower (radio call sign March Ground).
           4.1.9.2.4. Permission to move closer than 100 feet of the runway is not permission to
           go onto the runway. Obtain separate clearance for runway access
           4.1.9.2.5. Controlled Movement Area, require two-way radio contact with the Air
           Traffic Control Tower. Keep all nonessential vehicles outside 100 feet of the runway

   4.1.11. Use and maintain airfield driving visual aids/decals. At a minimum, all vehicles that
   operate on the airfield will contain the following AFVA/decals and diagrams: Note: Decals
   may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun
   visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for ready reference.
      4.1.11.1. AFVA 11-240. Note: The FAA Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual Aid Safety
      Placard, is the FAA equivalent to AFVA 11-240 and may be used by units located at
      shared-use airfields.
      4.1.11.2. AFVA 13-221 (optional if vehicle has an AFVA 11-240).
      4.1.11.3. AFVA 13-222.

   4.1.12. Vehicles will stop at the VFR hold lines (INST hold lines during bad weather) and
   contact the Air Traffic Control Tower for permission to enter the CMA. Vehicles will not
   enter the CMA unless absolutely necessary.
   4.1.13. Comply with Air Traffic Control Tower light gun signals. Air traffic controllers use a
   light gun as a backup system for communicating with aircraft or ground vehicles, if their
   radios stop working. When a vehicle operator experiences a radio failure on a runway or
   taxiway, they must vacate the runway as quickly and safely as possible and contact the Air

4.2. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Control and Prevention: Airfield vehicles are the major
source of foreign objects on the airfield. Debris and objects can damage aircraft if ingested or
driven over. Propeller/rotor wash and jet blast can propel debris and objects, causing damage to
other aircraft or injuring personnel. It is the responsibility of all individuals with access to the
airfield to control/remove FOD and help prevent damage and injuries. All requirements IAW
MARBI 21-104 will be followed. See AFI 21-101, Chapter 14, and AFMAN 24-306, Chapter
20, for additional information.
   4.2.1. Obey FOD checkpoint signs at designated airfield access points. FOD checks are
   required whether or not there is a FOD check sign at the location where the driver enters the
   airfield. Roll-over FOD checks (Inspection of vehicle tires to pull forward to check tire in
   contact with pavement). Please refer to AFI21-201 for details.
   4.2.2. Prior to entering the airfield, and at all FOD checkpoints, stop the vehicle and perform
   a FOD check IAW MARBI 21-204.
   4.2.3. Operators will conduct a FOD check prior to entering a taxiway or runway after using
   any airfield access roads.
   4.2.4. Traveling from an unpaved to paved surface: Any vehicle leaving a paved surface
   will adhere to the following rules before reentering a paved surface.

   4.2.5. Vehicles will proceed from the unpaved surface and stop as soon as all four wheels are
   on the paved surface.
   4.2.6. Perform a FOD check of all tires and roll over FOD check. FOD Check will include
   the vehicle body, frame, undercarriage and bumpers. Remove all debris from these areas and
   secure the FOD within a designated FOD container. Vehicles covered with excessive
   mud/debris will not enter airfield paved surfaces until they are cleaned and all the debris is
   removed. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn parts.
   A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components is secured. Secure any/all items
   loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down device loose ends such as chains, ropes,
   packaging or other item that may become dislodged during movement while on the airfield.
   4.2.7. FOD Reporting and Tracking: All FOD will be reported IAW MARBI 21-104.
4.3. Restricted Visibility, Night Operations or Inclement Weather.
   4.3.1. During periods of reduced visibility, hours of darkness and inclement weather, turn on
   vehicle headlights. Headlights will be turned on when using windshield wipers.
   4.3.2. Vehicles without properly mounted/operating headlights will not operate on the
   airfield during periods of reduced visibility and/or hours of darkness. Flashlights will not be
   used in place of headlights to operate vehicles (bicycles, utility vehicles, equipment, etc.).
   4.3.3. When lightning is within five miles, all activity (vehicle/maintenance operations, etc.)
   on the airfield will cease and personnel will take appropriate shelter indoors. Emergency and
   alert vehicles are exempt when responding to emergencies.
   4.3.4. When visibility is less than 300 feet, airfield driving restrictions will be in effect.

   4.3.7. When visibility increases to or above 300 feet, airfield driving restrictions will be
   lifted and the following agencies will be notified by Airfield Management Operations:
   4.3.8. Use flashing lights or parking lights at night when vehicles are temporarily parked on
   any part of the aircraft parking ramp. This does not apply if vehicles are parked in a
   designated area.
   4.3.9. At night or in inclement weather, the headlights of vehicles on the airfield will be
   operated on low beam and not aimed directly at moving aircraft.
   4.3.10. When encountering a taxiing aircraft at night, stop your vehicle, turn off the
   headlights, leave the parking lights on and turn on the emergency flashers to alert aircraft of
       your position and preserve the pilot’s night vision. Headlights will be turned back on
   when the aircraft is out of range.
   4.3.11. Vehicles with daytime running lights will stop and park in a safe location, turn off
   the headlights and ignition, set the parking brake and activate emergency flashers. Caution:
   Due to the various levels of fog that may exist throughout the airfield, it is the vehicle
   operator’s responsibility to ensure there is sufficient visibility to conduct safe operations,
   regardless of the measured visibility.
4.4. ATCT Blind Spots. March airfield has one reported blind spots. Air Traffic Control
Tower cannot see on the south side of March Joint Powers Authority building. When
entering/exiting the CMA from perimeter road.
4.5. Procedures for emergency responses on or near the active runway(s). At a minimum,
Crash/Fire Department, AFM and 452 SFS are considered the primary (initial) responders to all
airfield emergencies. Secondary (follow-on/support agencies) are Maintenance, TA and any
other support agencies needed to minimize the emergency. AFM will be responsible for
escorting all support agencies to and from the incident site.
   4.5.1. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to stand by in a designated area
   (e.g., ramp, taxiway, etc.) until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident/on-scene
   commander.
   4.5.2. All emergency response vehicles must have approval from the Air Traffic Control
   Tower, or authorized vehicle escort, to enter the CMA.
4.6. Vehicle Escorts and Convoys on the CMA and non-CMA.
   4.6.1. CMA drivers must be qualified to drive in the CMA by having their AF Form 483
   stamped CMA. The lead vehicle driver is responsible for all vehicles he/she is escorting.
   This driver will maintain radio contact with the Air Traffic Control Tower at all times while
   in the CMA. This driver will use his/her call sign as the lead vehicle, for example:
   Contractor 50 plus 1, or consecutive numbers, as applicable will be the way you report to Air
   Traffic Control Tower 4.6.2. Non-CMA areas. The same rules apply, but you will not have
   to report to Air Traffic Control Tower the focus will be on having the proper credentials and
   staying with the lead vehicle. In Restricted Areas, you will need 452 SFS clearance before
   entering.
4.7. Vehicles Equipped with Supplemental Traction Devices.

   4.7.1. Vehicles Equipped with Studded Tires. Vehicles equipped with studded tires are not
   permitted to operate on the airfield without prior coordination with the Airfield Manager,
   Wing Safety, Civil Engineer, Transportation and installation commander approval. Note: To
   reduce spark producing potential, only non-sparking material can be used.
   4.7.2. All vehicles are prohibited from driving over in-ground fuel pit covers.
   4.7.3. POVs, golf carts and bicycles are prohibited from operating on or within the clearance
   zone of the runways.
4.8. Restrict Smoking on the Airfield. Smoking is allowed only in designated areas. These
areas are near the buildings/hangars and are dictated by the building/hangar managers. Do not
smoke within 10 feet of these designated areas. No smoking will be allowed on the Ramps and
CMA areas.
4.9. Avoid/Use Caution in Jet Blast Areas.
   4.9.1. Jet Blast Avoidance Areas. There are specific hazards associated with taxiing, driving
   or working on an airfield. One particular hazard that is ongoing is jet blast. This can be from
   normal engine start, taxiing or run-up (to include engine runs from idle to maximum thrust).
   While on the airfield, everyone must be thoroughly cognizant of such a potential hazard. Jet
   blast avoidance areas are the areas in front of and behind an aircraft with the engines running.
   For standardization, no vehicle or pedestrian will be closer than 50 feet in front or 200 feet
   behind an aircraft with engines running (see Table 4.2). Exceptions are authorized crew
   members, maintenance personnel and troops (engine running off-/on-load). When an aircraft
   is running engines at maximum thrust, no vehicle or pedestrian will approach the aircraft
   within 1,000 feet from the rear and no closer than 50 feet from the front. Exceptions are
   authorized crew members and maintenance personnel. Maintenance directives further
   provide specific engine run procedures. Please review AFOSHSTD91-100 for details
   regarding danger zones around aircraft operations. All personnel must exercise caution while
   operating a vehicle on or near taxiways and hammerheads and remain well clear of aircraft
   jet blast. Vehicle operators must maintain the distances listed in Table 4.2 when driving
   behind aircraft with the engines running.

4.10. Lateral Distance Requirements for Mobile Obstacles on Runways/Taxiways/Aprons:
   4.10.1. An obstacle is anything that poses a threat to aircraft operations (fire bottles,
   maintenance stands, AGE, vehicles, etc.).
   4.10.2. Distances between Aircraft and Vehicles: All vehicle operators will maintain the
   following distances from aircraft with engines running, whether parked, stopped or in
   motion. These distances also apply to equipment and materials. Failure to abide by these
       requirements may result in revocation of airfield driving authorization.
      4.10.2.1. No vehicle will drive closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of an
      aircraft with engines either operating or being started; see Table 4.2 for the difference in
      aircraft criteria. Never drive between two parked aircraft next to one another and
      breaking the wing tip clearance.
      4.10.2.2. Special equipment or cargo loading vehicles may be driven closer to aircraft
      when necessary to load/unload, if safety spotter and chocks are in place, within 10 feet of
      an aircraft.
   4.10.3. Do not operate a vehicle within 200 feet in front of, or 1000 feet behind, a C-130 or
   larger aircraft during full power engine runs.
      4.10.3.1. Failure to comply with proper distances can injure personnel, damage windows,
      equipment and other aircraft.
   4.10.4. Apron clearances are established by UFC 3-260-01 Table 6-1 Item 15. Mobile or
   fixed obstacles, compute these distances by multiplying 0.5 x the wingspan of the most
   demanding aircraft that will use the apron and add the appropriate wingtip clearance
   required. Then subtract the distance from the taxi lane centerline to the apron boundary
   marking to find the required clear distance.
   4.10.5. Distance Criteria for fixed and Mobile Obstacles. Distances are set up for C5 aircraft
   at March ARB.

       4.10.5.1. Taxiways…….200feet
       4.10.5.2. Taxi lane….….25 feet plus 1/2 wing span measurement
       4.10.5.3. Runway……..1000 feet from centerline
       4.10.5.4. Aprons………Variable depending on wing span of aircraft
4.11. Close Proximity to Aircraft.
   4.11.1. Vehicle traffic on the aircraft parking ramp will follow the designated driving lanes.
   If there are none available, please drive in a straight and direct route to destination or use
   taxi-lane lines to get to your destination.
   4.11.2. Vehicle operators are expected to use sound judgment at all times, even though
   vehicle driving lanes and designated parking spots are established throughout the Protection
   Level area. (See Attachment 13).
4.12. Restricted and Controlled Areas.
   4.12.1. Enter and exit Restricted Areas at designated entry control points (ECP). (See
   Attachments 13) Restricted Area boundaries marked by red lines will not be crossed unless
   prior notification is made to the Security Forces Control Center 452 (SFS) at extension 951-
   655- 2981/2982.
4.13. Procedures for Vehicle Parking/Chocking.
   4.13.1. Operators will comply with parking requirements regardless of airfield area. Except
   for crew busses, vehicles will not be parked within Restricted Areas.
   4.13.2. All vehicles will be parked so they will not interfere with taxiing or towed aircraft, or
   potential paths of taxiing or towed aircraft.
   4.13.3. Position gear lever in “Reverse” for manual transmissions or “Park” for automatic
   transmissions.
   4.13.4. Turn the engine off.
   4.13.5. Keys will be left in the ignition and the doors unlocked. Vehicles with auto lock
   doors will have the driver’s side window rolled down to prevent locking the keys in the
   vehicle. This is so the vehicle can be moved in the event of emergencies or if the vehicle
   impedes aircraft movement. Exception: Vehicles parking in designated parking areas are
   exempt from keeping keys in the ignition with the doors unlocked.
   4.13.6. Emergency vehicles that must remain in operation at the scene of an emergency may
   park with the engine running, but must adhere to parking procedures when the driver’s seat is
   unoccupied.
   4.13.7. Park all vehicles at least 25 feet from any part of an aircraft; the only exceptions are
   vehicles performing servicing, cargo loading, fire protection or security (as necessary). Post
   a spotter when backing towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to
   prevent vehicles from backing into aircraft. Wheel direction will be set so that inadvertent
   vehicle movement will not result in a collision with the aircraft. When parking on the
   aircraft ramp, driver’s side of the vehicle will always face the aircraft.
MARCHARBI13-213 17 JULY 2014                                                                     31


   4.13.8. Apply brakes on all wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment. Chock equipment, if
   not equipped with brakes.
   4.13.9. Aircraft servicing vehicles, which use their engines as auxiliary power sources, may
   be left unattended with engine running. Applicable equipment includes vehicle-mounted
   baggage belt conveyors; water tank trucks with mounted air conditioners; fleet servicing high
   lift trucks; fuel trucks; ambulances and staircase trucks.
4.14. Speed Limits. Vehicles responding to emergencies, to include alert vehicles, will proceed
at a safe speed consistent with ramp conditions, traffic and the situation. Speed will not exceed
the driver’s ability to control the vehicle or to safely stop the vehicle. Vehicles will have
headlights, emergency flashers and beacons operating (if equipped).
   4.14.1. Vehicle Parking Areas – 5 MPH.
   4.14.2. Aircraft Parking Ramp – 15 MPH. Special purpose vehicles will not exceed 10
   MPH. The speed limit will not exceed 5 MPH within 25 feet of an aircraft.
   4.14.3. Flight Line Access Road – 15 MPH (or as posted).
   4.14.4. Taxiways – 35 MPH.
   4.14.5. Access Roads – 15 MPH.
   4.14.6. Designated Traffic Lanes on the Ramp or Taxiway in Congested Areas within 200
   Feet of Aircraft Parking Areas – 15 MPH.
   4.14.7. Runways – Unlimited
4.15. Taxiing Aircraft.
   4.15.1. Except for “Follow Me” vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or driven
   into the path of taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and its
   “Follow Me” guide. Follow Me vehicles used for guiding aircraft will be equipped with
   signs, easily visible at night, reading, “Stop” and “Follow Me.” They will be equipped with
   two-way radios for communication on Air Traffic Control Tower frequencies. When
   approaching the parking spot, the “Follow Me” vehicle operator should illuminate the “Stop”
   signal, move the vehicle from the intended path of aircraft travel and position it laterally--
   clear of the aircraft wingtip. The marshaller, who may be the vehicle operator, will then
   guide the aircraft to the parking spot by use of approved marshaller’s signals. When
   necessary to accommodate the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft, “Follow Me” vehicles
   will be permitted to exceed the normal 15 miles per hour airfield speed limit. Tugs will not
   be used as “Follow Me” vehicles at any time (AFMAN 24-306).
   4.15.2. All vehicles will yield to taxiing aircraft while operating on the taxiways and parking
   ramps. Vehicles must exit the taxiways by the shortest route. As a last resort, go at least 200
   feet onto the grass area and wait until the aircraft has passed. (See paragraph 4.18-4.20 for
   FOD procedures).
4.16. Towing Operations.
   4.16.1. Towing speed for all aircraft tows are 5 MPH or no faster than the slowest wing
   walker.
 32                                                        MARCHARBI13-213 17 JULY 2014


   4.16.2. Towing configuration and speed for AGE will be IAW prescribed technical order
   guidance, never to exceed 10 MPH.
   4.16.3. Large pieces of AGE, when towed in tandem, will not block the driver’s vision of the
   last item being towed. Use safety pins to secure pintle hooks/trailer hitches.
   4.16.4. Vehicle Malfunctions/Breakdowns: When experiencing a vehicle malfunction which
   prevents the vehicle from operating under its own power, take the following actions:
   4.16.5. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, contact the Air Traffic Control Tower or
   Airfield Management via the ramp net. State your call sign and location of the vehicle.
   4.16.6. If the radio is not keyed to the ramp net, contact your control center or duty section
   and have them contact Airfield Management immediately.
   4.16.7. If you do not have a radio, stay with the vehicle and attempt to flag other drivers for
   assistance.
   4.16.8. Cellular/Phone will be good for situations like this. Contact any base agency to
   contact AFM immediately.
   4.16.9. Activate the vehicle’s four-way flashers or approved caution flashers.
   4.16.10. If an aircraft is taxiing toward you, flash your headlights to warn the pilot.
   4.16.11. Stalled vehicles cannot remain on taxiways, runways, aprons or within wing tip
   clearance zones. If a tow cannot be dispatched immediately, push the vehicle to a safe
   location. The vehicle may be pushed off the paved surface if necessary.
   4.16.12. Leave the parking lights/approved caution flashers or vehicle hazard lights “On” if
   the malfunction occurs during hours of darkness.
4.17. Emergency Vehicle Operations.
   4.17.1. Emergency vehicles will not exceed any prescribed speed limits or the vehicles’
   capabilities.
   4.17.2. All drivers will remain safety conscious and alert for other vehicles and aircraft.
   4.17.3. Emergency vehicles will use rotating beacons and headlights when responding.
   4.17.4. Emergency vehicles will maintain normal speed limits after an emergency is
   terminated, unless proceeding directly to another emergency.
   4.17.5. Emergency vehicles will obtain approval from the Air Traffic Control Tower prior to
   entering the CMA.
   4.17.6. Multiple responding vehicles will have the lead vehicle contact the Air Traffic
   Control Tower for authorization. The lead vehicle will include the number of responding
   vehicles in the authorization request, be responsible for those vehicles while in the CMA and
   report to the Air Traffic Control Tower when those vehicles are off the runway and outside
   the CMA.
4.18. Airfield Signs. There are two categories of airfield signs, mandatory and informational
used on the airfield. Yellow backgrounds with black inscription signs are informative or black
backgrounds and yellow inscription.
MARCHARBI13-213 17 JULY 2014                                                                   33


   4.18.1. Informational Signs: Indicate a specific location or destination, or provide useful
   information, such as taxiway or ramp designations. See figure 4.7 and Attachment 12.

Figure 4.3. Mandatory and Informational Signs together.




Figure 4.4. Informational/Directional Signs.




   4.18.2. Directional Signs: A directional sign informs operators of the direction to other
   pavements or facilities. These signs indicate traveling in the direction of the arrow will take
   you to that location. Figure 4.4 indicates taxiway Delta is to the right. These signs can
   reference any area of the airfield, including aircraft parking aprons. These signs are meant to
   be informational and aid operators to know where they are and where they are going.
   4.18.3. Mandatory Signs: Will be followed regardless of the situation. These include
   instrument hold and runway signs. Mandatory signs have white inscription on a red
   background

Figure 4.5. Mandatory Runway Hold Signs

   4.18.4. Runway Hold Signs: A runway sign informs operators they are at an intersection
   with a runway. It is mandatory to stop before crossing the hold line associated with these
   signs and request authority from the Air Traffic Control Tower to enter the runway. Figure
   4.5 and Attachment 12 Runway Hold Signs

Figure 4.6. Backside of Mandatory signs.




   4.18.5. INST Hold Signs: An instrument hold sign informs operators they are at an
   intersection with a navigational equipment critical area. This sign is associated with an
   instrument hold line (Figure 4.5) and is mandatory. Failure to abide by instrument hold line
   procedures can affect the navigational capability of aircraft on approach to the runway and
   cause a flight hazard. Air Traffic Control Tower will inform you when you are expected to
   hold at this hold line, usually when weather conditions are less than a reported ceiling of 800
   feet or 2 miles visibility.
      4.18.5.1. The operator will stop at the INST hold line and ask March Air Traffic Control
      Tower for permission to proceed across designated hold line. The operator will cross the
      INST hold line only after receiving permission and reading back instructions to March
      Air Traffic Control Tower. Once crossing the initial INST hold line, you do not have to
      report across the second hold line on the same      taxiway.

Figure 4.7. INST Hold Signs.




4.19. Airfield Markings: There are numerous airfield markings, two of which complement
mandatory signs.
   4.19.1. Runway VFR Hold Position: Two solid six-inch wide yellow lines and two dashed
   six-inch wide yellow lines running across each taxiway at least 100 feet from the runway
   edge. The dashed yellow lines are on the runway side of the markings. These lines are
   outlined in black to enhance visual identification. See Attachment 12 and Attachment 13
   For example; locations of Runway VFR Hold Position.
      4.19.1.1. Vehicle Operations on Taxiway A. All vehicles must come to a complete stop
      at the vehicle stop signs (VFR hold line) located at the approach end of Runway 30, on
MARCHARBI13-213 17 JULY 2014                                                                   35


       TWY A, and contact the Air Traffic Control Tower for permission to enter the CMA.
       Once given permission to proceed, the vehicle operator must look both ways for any
       landing or low flying aircraft and then proceed with caution.
   4.19.2. INST Hold Line: Two solid yellow parallel lines with double vertical yellow stripes
   spaced two feet apart, with “INST” painted on the runway side of the line. These lines are
   outlined in black to enhance visual identification. INST hold lines are painted on taxiways at
   the edge of the ILS critical zones to prevent aircraft and vehicles from interfering     with
   signals transmitted to inbound aircraft from the Instrument Landing Systems during
   inclement weather or reduced visibility. INST hold lines are located on taxiway Alpha only.
       4.19.2.1. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas. All vehicles will contact the Air
       Traffic Control Tower prior to entering the Glide Slope and Localizer Critical Areas
       when on north perimeter road. Airfield signage depicts the locations to stop and contact
       the Air Traffic Control Tower. All vehicles and pedestrians will comply. Air Traffic
       Control Tower will inform you when you are expected to hold at this hold line, usually
       when weather conditions are less than a reported ceiling of 800 feet or 2 miles visibility.
       4.19.2.2. All personnel will coordinate with Airfield Management Operations and have
       direct radio contact with the Air Traffic Control Tower prior to entering the infield
       adjacent/near the Glide Slope and Localizer Critical Areas. Vehicles and pedestrians must
       have the capability to communicate with the Air Traffic Control Tower (Ramp Net) when
       entering the CMA.

Figure 4.8. South and North ILS Critical Areas.




4.20. Airfield Lighting:
   4.20.1. Runway Edge Lights (White and Amber) the amber portions are located on both ends
   of the runway at the first and last 2000 feet of the runway. The Air Traffic Control Tower
   will raise and lower the intensity of the runway lights (lights flashing on and off) as an
   emergency exit signal. Remember there isn’t a maximum or minimum speed limit on the
   runway (see Figure 4.9).

4.21. Radio Operations: Using proper radio communication mitigates misunderstandings
between agencies. It is up to every individual talking on the radio to ensure transmissions are
conducted in a professional manner. Slang, jargon and incorrect radio procedures can
compromise safety. One of the most important items in radio communications is to speak
clearly, distinctly and in a manner that will ensure others understand what you have said. Before
depressing the transmission button to talk, ensure someone else is not already talking on the
frequency or waiting for a response. Think about what you will say. Radio transmissions will be
brief and clear.
4.22. Phonetic Alphabet: The phonetic alphabet was developed to avoid misunderstanding
during communication. The following is the phonetic alphabet, see figure 4.12.

Host Wing Commander—the individual with ultimate responsibility for operating the airfield.
Hot Spot—a runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately—used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line—a designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in retro-

vehicles, K-Loaders, aircraft stair trucks, baggage loaders, forklifts, etc.
Taxiways—paved surface used for taxiing aircraft to and from aircraft parking areas and
runways (Includes A, B, C, D, F, G taxiways).
Unattended Vehicle—defined as no one in the driver’s seat. When the driver’s seat is vacated,
the gear shift will be placed in “Park” (automatic transmission) or “Reverse” (standard
transmission), parking brake set, engine turned off. Keys will be left in the ignition (or over the
driver’s side visor) and the doors unlocked. Vehicles with auto lock doors will have the driver’s
side window rolled down to prevent locking the keys in the vehicle. This is so the vehicle can be
moved in the event of emergencies or if it impedes aircraft movement. (Exception: Vehicles
parking in designated areas located on the east side of Flight Line Road.
Vicinity of an Aircraft—area within 25 feet in front and 200 feet to the rear of an aircraft with
engines operating or within 25 feet of an aircraft, front or back (see Table 4.5 for additional
