1. Concept of Operations.
    1.1. General. The 52d Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (52 OSS/OSW),
    located in Building 47, Room 401, on Spangdahlem Air Base, provides and arranges for
    weather support to enhance the 52d Fighter Wing’s (52 FW) mission. This instruction
    establishes the responsibilities and procedures for areas of weather support that must be
    coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
    requirements and procedures for peacetime operations. Unless superseded by Emergency
    War Orders, this instruction is followed during wartime operations.
    1.2. Alternate Operating Location. The 52 OSS/OSW Alternate Operating Location
    (AOL) is Building 690, Room 1.11, Air Mobility Command (AMC) Fire Department. When
    notified of any conditions which potentially threaten the personal safety of the occupants in
    Building 47, or would prohibit the use of the weather station (i.e., bomb threat, fire, chemical
    spill, surface winds steady at 65 knots or gusting to 75 knots, total communication outage,
    etc.), 52 OSS/OSW personnel will relocate operations to the AOL.
    1.3. 21st Operational Weather Squadron Partnership. The 52 OSS/OSW works in
    partnership with the 21st Operational Weather Squadron (21 OWS), IAW AFMAN 15-129 to
    tailor operational and strategic level weather products for the operational user and provide
    decision-grade information on weather and environmental impacts to military operations. 52
    OSS/OSW leverages support from the 21 OWS for 24-hour forecasting services,
    meteorological watch, and resource protection services. Changes to this instruction affecting
    21 OWS provided services will be coordinated between the 21 OWS and 52 OSS/OSW.
    1.4. Duty Priorities. The 52 OSS/OSW duty priorities are outlined in Table 1. The Duty
    Priorities table exists to match and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty
    priorities focus efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority
    conflicts. These duty priorities were developed IAW AFMAN 15-129. Weather operators
    will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially where there is
    imminent danger to life and/or property.

Table 1. 52 OSS/OSW Duty Priorities.
Priority   Duties

10          Produce/disseminate Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF)
11          Relay Urgent PIREPs and Special AIREPs to OWS
12          Disseminate PIREPs/AIREPs
13          Perform MISSIONWATCH activities
14          Provide flight weather briefings (i.e. DD Form 175-1)
15          Provide all other briefings (i.e. staff briefs, phone briefs, battle
            staff briefings). Prioritized by operational necessity.
16          Weather training
17          Accomplish administrative tasks
        1.4.1. Hours of Operation. The 52 OSS/OSW is a limited duty station with operating
        hours dictated by the 52 FW flying schedule. In addition to forecasters on duty during
        wing flying, weather administrative personnel are available Monday-Friday 0730-1630.
            1.4.1.1. During hours of 52 OSS/OSW closure, the 21 OWS will provide
            Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) and resource protection services for
            Spangdahlem AB. 52 OSS/OSW maintains a standby forecaster to be recalled for
            duty under circumstances outlined as standby criteria under Table 6. Upon closure,
            the closing forecaster will notify the 52 FW/CP, Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities,
            and 21 OWS to inform those agencies of a transfer of responsibility. Upon opening,
            the forecaster will call the above agencies to reclaim responsibility.
            1.4.1.2. In the event that weather criteria listed as standby criteria in Table 6 is valid
            at the scheduled time of office closure, 52 OSS/OSW will remain open until the
            weather threat has passed.
     1.5. Dissemination of Weather Information.
        1.5.1. Observations, Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), watches, warnings, and
        advisories are disseminated by the 52 OSS/OSW or the 21 OWS to the ATC facilities and
        52 FW Command Post (52 FW/CP) via Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET).
        1.5.2. Forecasted watches, warnings, and advisories (WWAs) will be issued by the 21
        OWS via the Integrated Weather Warning Coordination (IWWC) system on JET. IWWC
        is an automated phone system that will relay the conditions of each WWA by means of a
        recorded voice. Observed WWAs will be issued by the 52 OSS/OSW via IWWC during
        wing flying/normal duty hours. Outside of normal duty hours the 21 OWS will issue all
        WWAs as a part of their METWATCH and resource protection mission. Receipt
        acknowledgement of each WWA message will be tracked by the IWWC system in JET.
        1.5.3. Agencies can view this data using the 52 OSS/OSW Spangdahlem AB’s tailored
        webpage on the 21 OWS website.
        1.5.4. Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF) and other mission weather briefings are
        disseminated via the base share drive located at S:\52OSS\EXTERNAL\
        WEATHER\MEF.
        1.5.5. Alternate Operation Location (AOL) Weather Dissemination. If the 52 OSS/OSW
        must evacuate to the AOL, the technicians will notify agencies in Table 2. Standard
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                            5


     products will continue to be received through JET and the base shared drive as long as
     the systems remain operational. The on-shift forecaster will continue to perform all shift
     responsibilities from the AOL.
     1.5.6. In the event of a JET or IWWC outage, observations and WWAs will be
     disseminated locally to ATC and command post facilities via hotline. Back-up contact
     numbers can be found in Table 2. These products will be disseminated long-line by
     internet or by requesting the 21 OWS, or other alternative weather flight, to disseminate
     via their JET system.
  1.6. Weather Flight Limitations.
     1.6.1. Weather Sensor Limitations. Due to the valley on the approach end of Runway
     23, cloud bases at the pilot's decision point are often lower than those measured by the
     ceilometer located near the landing threshold. Therefore, a ceilometer has been placed in
     the valley to measure cloud bases. This becomes critical when cloud bases are less than
     1,000 feet above ground level (AGL) as the lower clouds may interfere with pilots
     visually acquiring the runway. When the Automated Meteorological Observing System
     (AMOS) is being augmented, the observer may append remarks to the surface
     observation to indicate this condition, i.e., CIG004 APCH RWY23.
     1.6.2. The official point of observation when weather personnel augment the AMOS is
     the rooftop of Building 47 (accessed from the 4th floor of the weather station). Hand-held
     sensor wind readings and visibility measurements may be hindered by the 7-story tower
     in the middle of the building, therefore the observer will observe elements from all sides
     of the rooftop as needed.
     1.6.3. The Flight Information Publication (FLIP) section for Spangdahlem AB requires
     the Runway Visual Range (RVR) to be reported by the AMOS at 370m. The AMOS will
     only allow RVR intervals of 50 meter increments up to 800 meters. The 52 OSS/OSW
     has installed 350 meters and 400 meters as reporting increments, as they are the closest
     values to the required threshold.
     1.6.4. Optimum forecast and observing support is dependent on fully operational
     communication and meteorological sensing equipment.
     1.6.5. Some services will be degraded during and after relocation to the AOL.
        1.6.5.1. If Building 690 is locked, entry is gained by requesting access through the
        fire department dispatcher. In this case, access will be delayed depending on fire
        department response time.
        1.6.5.2. Once access is gained, there are no AOL limitations unless the JET server in
        Building 47 is inoperable. In that case, FMQ-19 data will not be accessible, therefore
        official observations (using back-up procedures) will be performed using equipment
        from the unit evacuation kit. After support is re-established, the 52 OSS/OSW can
        deploy all available tactical weather equipment to replace any functional loss of the
        FMQ-19.
  1.7. Communications.
     1.7.1. Telephone. 52 OSS/OSW has multi-line phones in the operations area which are
     used to relay information. In the event of an IWWC outage, advisories, watches, and
 6                                               SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


        warnings are issued by calling the critical agencies listed in Table 2 to ensure the
        messages have been received.

        1.7.2. Table 3 lists the primary DSN phone numbers for 52 OSS/OSW. The commercial
        prefix is 06565-61 and the last four digits remain the same. During 52 FW Emergency
        Operations Center (EOC) activation, all watches, warnings, and advisories will be passed
        to the Command Post through the EOC representative. The EOC representative will brief
        the 52 FW/CC and 52 OG/CC or designated representatives on the pending WWAs and
        the impact this could have to emergency operations. The EOC representative will then
        notify Command Post for base wide dissemination according to the charts in Attachment 2.

        all aircrew that contact 52 OSS/OSW or “Spangdahlem Metro”, regardless of that
        aircraft’s home station. The 52 OSS/OSW assigned PMSV UHF frequency is 284.425
        MHz.
           1.7.3.1. The 52 OSS/OSW will solicit Pilot Reports (PIREPs) during each PMSV
           contact with aircrew. PIREPs help 52 OSS/OSW better serve pilots by enhancing
           forecasting services and flight safety.
           1.7.3.2. Long term outages of 6 hours or more will be annotated via NOTAM until
           repaired.
           1.7.3.3. Phone patch is available through 52 FW/CP at 258.7 MHz.

                           Severe Weather Criteria                           Desired Lead Time

       Tornado                                                               15 min
       Hail ≥ 1/2 inch                                                       2 hours
       Surface winds ≥ 45 knots                                                 2      hours

         2.2.2. If the senior weather forecaster on the SWAT determines it is necessary, SWAP
         will be implemented and SWAT personnel will immediately report to Building 47. ORM
         will be used when deciding to activate the SWAP. A recall will be directed for more
         personnel as the situation warrants.
     2.3. Operational Reports. IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and AFI 10-229,
     Responding to Severe Weather Events, 52 OSS/OSW will provide the Command Post with
     weather information needed to report impacts of weather to higher headquarters. The 52
     FW/CP will determine the requirement to initiate an Operational Report (OPREP-3).
         2.3.1. Contact the 52 FW/CP immediately if any of the criteria in Table 5 are met:

Table 5. Severe Weather Reporting Criteria
     Tornado
     Winds ≥ 45kts (to include gusts)
     Hail ≥ 1/2 inch
     Any damage or injury caused by weather phenomena
         2.3.2. At the conclusion of the severe weather event, 52 OSS/OSW will review and
         summarize the severe weather, then forward information to the 52 FW/CP, 21 OWS, and
         USAFE/A3W within 24 hours of the occurrence. 52 OSS/OSW leadership will provide
         or arrange delivery of hard copies of relevant forecasts, observations, watches, warnings,
         and equipment status to the 52 FW/CP, to be included in an OPREP-3.
     2.4. Stand-by Forecaster.
         2.4.1. Recall action procedures for a standby weather forecaster are in place to provide
         enhanced resource protection outside normal duty hours. This includes providing
         expanded eyes forward capability for the 21 OWS, augmenting observing equipment
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                              9


      when malfunctioning, during inclement weather, or providing mission related weather
      outside of the normal wing flying window.
      2.4.2. A certified forecaster will be on stand-by whenever wing flying is not being
      conducted. The stand-by forecaster can be contacted through 52 FW/CP. The stand-by
      person is responsible to respond to all calls from the 21 OWS, 52 FW/CP, ATC, or any
      other agency requesting weather assistance. When called, the forecaster on stand-by will
      determine the appropriate response to the request, as required. The following
      circumstances will be used as general guidance for reasons to recall the stand-by
      forecaster.
         2.4.2.1. 21 OWS notifies stand-by forecaster of a pending or issued weather watch or
         warning.
         2.4.2.2. Support is required for exercise, alert, in-flight emergencies, or any other
         contingency.
         2.4.2.3. A toxic corridor is required (stand-by forecaster will remain until notified by
         command post or CE/CEX that threat is over).
         2.4.2.4. 21 OWS, tower, or GCA are experiencing problems with JET, FMQ-19, or
         are otherwise unable to see local weather information.
         2.4.2.5. Any operation 52 OG/CC determines to require weather support.
         2.4.2.6. Any time criterion in Table 6 has occurred or is forecasted to occur.

      2.4.3. Upon notification, stand-by forecasters must contact ATC or 21 OWS for a
      discussion of the situation immediately. If unable to resolve the issue (e.g. pending
      weather, equipment outage, etc) via phone, the stand-by weather technician will report to
      the weather station to assess local conditions or to augment the FMQ-19 as required by
      AFMAN 15-111 and local procedures. If the stand-by forecaster reports to Building 47,
      they will immediately notify the 21 OWS, 52 FW/CP, ATC, and 52 OSS/OSW leadership
      upon arrival and begin weather duties.

     2.4.4. On normal duty days, the Airfield Services Element (ASE) is responsible for shift
     duties and METWATCH until 1630L or until wing flying is complete. Stand-by hours
     will begin no earlier than 1630L Monday – Friday.
     2.4.5. In the event of a 21 OWS communication outage, stand-by personnel will report in
     to assume TAF and WWA support. Stand-by forecaster will alert weather flight
     leadership about outage and expected fix time, to determine course of action.
  2.5. ATC Limited Observation Training. The 52 OSS/OSW maintains and instructs ATC
  personnel in a Limited Observation Training program. This training is designed to enable the
  Cooperative Weather Watch program and provide better “eyes forward” capability for the 21
  OWS. New ATC personnel who have not been trained will call the 52 OSS/OSW and
  schedule an appointment with the 52 OSS/OSW Training Manager. At the end of training,
  ATC personnel are tested for qualification and will receive a familiarization tour of the
  weather station. Orientation and certification will be conducted by certified weather
  personnel and documented on the AF Form 3622, ATC/Weather Tower Visibility
  Certifications. Training will cover the following:
     2.5.1. Basic observing techniques.
     2.5.2. Visibility and obstructions to visibility.
     2.5.3. Local weather phenomena.
     2.5.4. Decoding observations and TAFs.
     2.5.5. JET operations and FMQ-19 AMOS overview, including automated and
     augmented observation procedures.
     2.5.6. Weather warnings/watches/advisories.
     2.5.7. Importance of a cooperative OSW/OSA relationship.
  2.6. Additional Staff Weather Support. The 52 OSS/OSW staff will also provide or direct
  the following weather support:
     2.6.1. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). 52 OSS/OSW presents the weather portion of
     the monthly IRC. The 52 OSS/OSW will provide refresher training for assigned pilots on
     METAR code, TAF code, MEF products, space weather, and other topics as arranged by
     the 52 OSS/OSW and 52 OG/OGV.
     2.6.2. Mobility Concept Briefing. The 52 OSS/OSW will provide pre-deployment
     planning weather information at Mobility Concept Briefings. The briefing will include
     forecasted departure conditions, en route weather, forecast conditions for destination
     arrival time, and deployed area climatological conditions, with other topics briefed as
     required.
     2.6.3. Quarterly safety meetings and SOF Meetings. 52 OSS/OSW will provide seasonal
     weather briefings at quarterly safety and SOF meetings when requested by the 52 FW
     Safety Office (52 FW/SE) or 52d Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation (52
     OG/OGV) office.
     2.6.4. Extended Weather Outlook. The 21 OWS produces a 5-Day planning weather
     slide for Spangdahlem on their home page each day no later than 0500L. It is amended
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                           11


       and updated as required. This product contains text and graphics for a plain language
       weather forecast for the current day plus 4 days.
          2.6.4.1. Spangdahlem AB 10-Day Outlook. The 52 OSS/OSW tailors the 21 OWS
          Extended Weather Outlook for Spangdahlem AB. The Spangdahlem AB 10-Day
          Outlook provides the same general weather elements plus an added stop-light chart
          for the first 5 days that highlights weather that may impact to the 52 FW mission.
       2.6.5. Staff Briefings and Studies. 52 OSS/OSW provides climatology briefings,
       weather studies, or weather reviews for mishaps when requested through the chain of
       command.
       2.6.6. Solar/Lunar Data. 52 OSS/OSW will provide detailed solar and lunar data upon
       request. Data includes sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, civil twilight, and nautical
       twilight for any location world-wide.
       2.6.7. 52 OSS/OSW Flight Commander, NCOIC or other representative will attend all
       Airfield Operations Board Meetings.
       2.6.8. 52 OSS/OSW will provide average temperatures for heating/cooling days to Civil
       Engineering upon request, usually during the onset of fall and spring. Other specialized
       data is available upon request.
       2.6.9. Space Weather. 52 OSS/OSW will brief space weather events on impacts to
       communications and operations.
       2.6.10. Tropical Weather Updates. 52 OSS/OSW will provide briefings to the wing
       leadership when a tropical system is expected to impact any 52 FW operation world-
       wide. The 52 OSS/OSW will work with the 21 OWS which serves as the primary liaison
       between the tropical centers and 52 OSS/OSW. 52 OSS/OSW will use the Tropical
       Cyclone Tropical Assessment Product (TC-TAP) produced by the 21 OWS or tropical
       cyclone forecasts issued by other designated tropical cyclone centers outside of the 21
       OWS AOR (National Hurricane Center or Joint Typhoon Warning Center). 52
       OSS/OSW will not deviate from the official forecast position, track, movement,
       maximum wind speed, or intensity trend.
   2.7. Flight Information Publications (FLIPs) Updates. The 52 OSS/OSW is responsible
   for ensuring all weather information in the FLIPs, such as operating hours and equipment
   limitations, is current and accurate. The 52 OSS/OSW will review new FLIPs within 10 days
   of receipt for weather information, and for changes to airfield take-off, landing, radar
   instrument approach minima, NOTAMs and other key items which may drive changes to
   weather support. As applicable, the weather flight chief or designee will route any weather
   updates to the Airfield Manager (52 OSS/OSA) for processing. Updates can include
   revisions, changes or corrections. The 52 OSS/OSW will implement any requisite changes to
   weather guidance and/or procedures as soon as possible.
   2.8. Release of Weather Data. Release of weather data to Non-DoD agencies and
   individuals is restricted. No data will be released to non-DoD agencies or personnel without
   the express approval of 52 FW Public Affairs and 52 FW Staff Judge Advocate legal offices.
3. Airfield Services Element (ASE). The 52 OSS/OSW ASE will be open one hour prior to
local flying until the termination of local flying. Outside of local flying hours ASE will open
 12                                             SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


upon request of the 52 OG/CC or designated representative. The ASE will provide support to
the SOF, ATC, 21 OWS forecast and resource protection mission, staff weather services, and
PMSV contacts. ASE will also supplement and/or back up automated observations from the
AMOS.
   3.1. Meteorological Watch. A Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) is used to provide an
   organized approach for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of both current
   and future meteorological situations. 21 OWS performs a continuous METWATCH for
   Spangdahlem AB, with 52 OSS/OSW providing “eyes forward” support. Changes in the
   status of weather elements result in notification from 52 OSS/OSW or 21 OWS to base
   agencies.
   3.2. Continuous Weather Watch. The 52 OSS/OSW is considered an automated weather
   flight because the observing system performs an automatic Continuous Weather Watch.
   When augmentation of the system by weather technicians is required, weather personnel will
   perform a Basic Weather Watch.
   3.3. Basic Weather Watch. The Basic Weather Watch (BWW) observing program has
   been implemented to establish the minimum requirements during AMOS augmentation to
   ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained during 52 FW flying hours. During a
   BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20
   minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation.
   3.4. Cooperative Weather Watch. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) is the process
   whereby ATC personnel, flying units, and Security Forces personnel report observed weather
   conditions to the 52 OSS/OSW. The 52 OSS/OSW will reevaluate weather conditions when
   information reported from a reliable source differs from the last disseminated observation.
   The 52 OSS/OSW may include the conditions in the next observation or as a new
   observation.
      3.4.1. ATC personnel will notify the 52 OSS/OSW when any of the following are seen
      or occur:
          3.4.1.1. Runway lights become inoperative, or if inoperative, become operative.
          3.4.1.2. ATC personnel evacuate/relocate.
          3.4.1.3. Change in active runway.3.4.1.4. Obstructions to visibility.
          3.4.1.4. Lightning is observed.
          3.4.1.5. JET and AMOS malfunctions.
   3.5. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified weather
   technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited
   AN/FMQ-19 AMOS. The two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up.
   Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated
   observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AMOS to detect and/or report. Back-up is
   the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or dissemination to an AMOS
   observation when the primary automated method is not operational or unavailable due to
   sensor and/or communication failure.
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                             13


    3.6. Supplementing. Weather technicians, IAW local policy, unless otherwise specified,
    must physically be within five statute miles of the center of the aerodrome when
    supplementing an AMOS. Weather technicians will supplement observations when the
    airfield is open for weather conditions in Table 7. Weather technicians will perform a BWW
    from the observing location and be ready to supplement observations if the conditions in
    Table 7 are forecast to occur within 1 hour. Weather personnel are required to log on to an
    AMOS and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for
    tornadic activity. Weather technicians are required to supplement during wing flying hours
    for criteria listed in Table 8. These criteria are based on Category D pilot minimums for the
    52 FW and the frequency of these conditions to exist and change rapidly at Spangdahlem
    AB.

Table 7. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions.

Tornado
Funnel Cloud
Hail / Ice Pellets

Table 8. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions During Wing Flying.

Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 700 feet.
Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 700 feet.
Visibility decreases to less than 2 miles (3200 meters).
Visibility increases to equal or exceed 2 miles (3200 meters).
        3.6.1. Augmentation Responsibilities. To perform augmentation duties, the weather
        technician must maintain situational awareness of current weather conditions and AMOS
        observations. The 52 OSS/OSW has developed ORM based augmentation procedures
        and clearly defined duty priorities that include augmentation.
        3.6.2. Back-up of an AMOS. Except for some automated remarks, back-up refers to
        weather technicians providing the same reporting capability as that provided by the
        AMOS. During open airfield hours, weather technicians will back-up the AMOS
        equipment if the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or unavailable due to sensor
        and/or communication failure.
            3.6.2.1. The AN/TMQ-53 is a tactical observing system that can be utilized as a
            back-up to the AN/FMQ-19. Wind and pressure values from any piece of back-up
            equipment (e.g., hand-held devices or other deployable meteorological equipment),
            other than a properly sited and maintained AN/TMQ-53, will be estimated.
            Additionally, UTC-postured (deployable) AN/TMQ-53s cannot be used as a
            permanent base observing system.
    3.7. Types of Observations.
        3.7.1. The 52 OSS/OSW provides observing services 24-hours a day using the AMOS.
        The AMOS in conjunction with JET will disseminate all observations automatically.
 14                                                 SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


        3.7.2. METAR observations are taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59
        minutes after the hour. METAR observations can include SPECI criteria. METAR
        observations are disseminated both locally and long-line via JET. Refer to Attachment
        5, Weather Observation and Forecast Code Formats, for help decoding weather
        observation and forecast products.
        3.7.3. SPECI observations are taken when SPECI criteria are met at Spangdahlem AB.
        A SPECI is an unscheduled observation completed and transmitted when any of the
        special criteria listed below for automated (including when augmenting) and manual
        weather flights have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements
        found in a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the
        report. All SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the
        relevant criteria are observed. Special criteria will be recorded and disseminated IAW
        AFMAN 15-111. All SPECI criteria are listed below:
           3.7.3.1. CEILING. When the observed ceiling forms or dissipates below, decreases
           to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed value in Table 9.

Table 9. SPECI Criteria for Ceiling in Feet


8000     5000    4000    3000     2000    1500    1200    1000
 900      800     700     600      500     400     300     200
           3.7.3.2. VISIBILITY. Prevailing visibility decreases to less than or, if below,
           increases to equal or exceed value in Table 10.

           3.7.3.3. Tornado or funnel cloud is observed, disappears from sight, or ends.
           3.7.3.4. Thunderstorm (occurring at the station) begins or ends. A thunderstorm has
           begun and is occurring at the station when (1) thunder is first heard, (2) when hail is
           falling or lightning is observed at or near the airfield and the local noise level is such
           that resulting thunder cannot be heard, or (3) lightning detection equipment indicates
           lightning strikes within 5 nautical miles of the airfield. A thunderstorm is considered
           to have ended 15 minutes after the last occurrence of any of these criteria.
           3.7.3.5. Precipitation.
                3.7.3.5.1. Hail begins or ends.
                3.7.3.5.2. Freezing precipitation and/or ice pellets begin, end or change intensity.
                3.7.3.5.3. Ice pellets begin, end, or change intensity.
                3.7.3.5.4. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends.
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                             15


          3.7.3.6. Sky Condition. A layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena aloft is observed
          below 1500 feet and no layer aloft was reported below this height in the previous
          METAR or SPECI.
          3.7.3.7. Squall. A strong wind characterized by sudden onset in which the wind
          speed increases at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least one
          minute. A special observation is not required to report a squall if one is currently in
          progress.
          3.7.3.8. Wind Shifts. Any wind direction change of 45 degrees or more in less than
          15 minutes with wind speed 10 knots or more.
          3.7.3.9. RVR. RVR for active runway decreases to less than or, if below, increases
          to equal or exceed criteria in Table 11.

Table 11. SPECI Criteria for RVR in Meters

  P1500       1500       1200       800     750      600      400      350
             3.7.3.9.1. Transmit RVR when prevailing visibility is first observed < 1SM or
             RVR < P1500 meters. Also transmit when prevailing visibility initially goes
             above 1SM or RVR above P1500 meters.
             3.7.3.9.2. RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for runway in use,
             and when it is first determined that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable,
             provided conditions for RVR exist.
          3.7.3.10. Volcanic eruption or volcanic ash cloud is first observed.
          3.7.3.11. Within 15-minutes after the weather technician returns to duty following a
          break in observing coverage or augmentation at the observing location unless a record
          observation is filed during that 15-minute period.
          3.7.3.12. Aircraft Mishap. If in back-up mode, take an aircraft mishap SPECI
          immediately following notification or sighting of an aircraft mishap at or near the
          observing location unless there has been an intervening observation.
          3.7.3.13. Any other meteorological situation that, in the forecaster’s opinion is
          critical
   3.8. Local Criteria. A LOCAL is an unscheduled observation reported to the nearest
   minute, not meeting SPECI criteria. 52 OSS/OSW will only take single element LOCALs
   for altimeter setting change during back-up of AMOS pressure sensor at an interval not to
   exceed 35 minutes since last observation.
   3.9. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories.
      3.9.1. 52 OSS/OSW in conjunction with the 21 OWS provides a two-tiered watch-
      warning process for resource protection. A watch is issued when the potential for
      dangerous weather exists. The watch is upgraded to a warning when dangerous weather
      is imminent, or is occurring. All resource protection products are issued for a 5nm radius
      around Spangdahlem AB. These products are also applied to Bitburg Annex, but other
16                                            SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


     Geographically Separated Units (GSU) receive resource protection through separate point
     warnings via the 21 OWS.
     3.9.2. The 21 OWS will issue all forecast watches and warnings and have the overall
     responsibility for resource protection at Spangdahlem AB. The 52 OSS/OSW will issue
     all observed WWAs. The 52 OSS/OSW will act as the “eyes forward” for the 21 OWS
     and will keep them apprised of local conditions. In the event of imminent threat to life
     and/or property requiring an urgent dissemination, 52 OSS/OSW will issue forecast
     warnings normally issued by 21 OWS. In these cases, 52 OSS/OSW will inform 21
     OWS as time permits.
     3.9.3. If the 21 OWS issues a weather warning or watch outside normal weather station
     hours of operation, the 21 OWS will contact the stand-by weather personnel. The 21
     OWS will also contact the Command Post either directly or via IWWC for all watch,
     warning, and advisory notifications. 52 OSS/OSW responses may include reporting to
     the weather station to monitor the current situation; activating the SWAP; or calling the
     21 OWS to discuss the forecast.
     3.9.4. The 52 OSS/OSW will issue observed weather advisories as conditions require
     during ASE duty hours or upon manning the forecast section after being recalled. The 21
     OWS will issue observed advisories outside duty hours and provide additional assistance
     as required.
     3.9.5. WWAs will specify the magnitude and direction of the weather event as
     applicable. For example, the operational threshold for a wind event is > 45 knots; the
     OWS will issue a weather warning and specify the peak wind speed and 8-point compass
     direction for the event, such as peak gust 65 knots from the west. The OWS will also
     specify maximum hail size and rain/snow accumulations meeting or exceeding the WWA
     threshold.
        3.9.5.1. WWA Numbering System. WWAs will automatically be assigned a number
        sequentially based on the month and the number of previous. For example, Weather
        Warning 06-003 is the third warning issued in the month of June, regardless of the
        warning's stated weather phenomena or method of dissemination.
     3.9.6. 52 FW Unit Requirements. Each unit at Spangdahlem AB is responsible for
     coordinating additional watch, warning, and advisory support or special notification for
     existing WWAs with 52 OSS/OSW. Each customer requesting support must validate the
     requirement by providing 52 OSS/OSW with a list of protective actions for each WWA.
     The protective actions for current WWAs are listed in Attachment 3.
     3.9.7. Weather Watch. A weather watch is a special notice provided by an OWS or WF
     to supported agencies alerting them to the potential for weather conditions of such
     intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. The weather watch can be thought of as a
     "heads up", at which time agencies need to consider implementing required protective
     actions should a subsequent weather warning be issued. Below, Figure 1 shows an
     example weather watch.
        3.9.7.1. Upon receipt of a weather watch, operations may continue. However,
        personnel in high risk areas should be prepared to implement corresponding required
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                              17


          protective actions without delay if and when a subsequent weather warning is issued.
          Table 12 contains weather watches and desired lead times for Spangdahlem AB.

Figure 1. Watch Example.




          3.9.7.2. This example indicates that lightning potential is forecasted to occur within 5
          miles of the base for a 5 hour period. It also emphasizes that this does not override a
          previous watch that still remains in effect.

Table 12. Weather Watch Criteria for Spangdahlem AB.
                      Criteria                      Desired Lead Time
Potential for lightning exists within 5nm               30 minutes
Potential of tornadoes exists within 5nm            As potential warrants
Potential for hail > ½ inch within 5nm                    4 hours
Potential for winds > 45 knots                            4 hours
Potential for freezing precipitation                As potential warrants
Potential for snow > 2 inches in 12 hours           As potential warrants
Potential for rainfall > 2 inches in 12 hours       As potential warrants
          3.9.7.3. Watch Initiation. The 21 OWS forecaster issues watches no earlier than 24
          hours before the expected weather occurrence.
          3.9.7.4. Watch Termination. Each watch is issued with a beginning and ending time.
          Once issued, the 21 OWS forecaster monitors weather conditions and either upgrades
          the watch to a warning, extends the watch, cancels the watch, or allows it to expire if
          evaluation shows the conditions will not occur.
      3.9.8. Weather Warning. A weather warning is a special notice to supported agencies
      giving them advance notification (with sufficient time for protective actions) of expected
      weather conditions of such intensity to pose a hazard to personnel, resources, and
      property. Below, Figure 2 shows an example weather warning.
          3.9.8.1. Upon receipt of a weather warning, required protective actions
          corresponding to the weather event will be immediately implemented to safeguard
          personnel and equipment. Table 13 contains weather warnings and desired lead
          times for Spangdahlem AB.

Figure 2. Warning Example.
 18                                              SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


          3.9.8.2. This example indicates that a warning for wind speeds between 35-44 knots
          is forecasted for an 8 hour period, with a maximum wind speed of 40 knots expected.
          It also indicates that this warning replaces a previous warning for a higher category,
          in our case a warning for winds greater than 45 knots.
          3.9.8.3. Warning Initiation. Each warning is issued by the 21 OWS with a beginning
          and ending time. Once issued, the forecaster monitors weather conditions and
          ensures the warning adequately describes the timing and intensity of the weather
          threat.
             3.9.8.3.1. Lightning warnings are observed, so they will be issued without an end
             time (indicated by UFN or Until Further Notice) when observed by the 52
             OSS/OSW within 5nm of the base.
             3.9.8.3.2. When the 52 OSS/OSW weather station is not manned, the 21 OWS
             will issue the observed lightning warning based on automated observation data
             and other lightning/storm detection methods. The 52 OSS/OSW will notify the
             21 OWS upon arrival and departure to coordinate transfer of responsibility for
             observed weather warning support.
          3.9.8.4. Warning Termination. The 21 OWS forecaster cancels the warning (or
          allows it to expire) if evaluation shows the conditions have ceased and will not occur
          again, or will not occur at all.

Table 13. Weather Warning Criteria for Spangdahlem AB.
                                                          Desired Lead
                       Criteria
                                                              Time
Observed lightning occurring within 5NM                     Observed
Tornado is forecast within 5nm                             15 minutes
Hail ≥ 1/4 inch is forecast within 5nm                       2 hours
Hail ≥ ½ inch is forecast within 5nm                         2 hours
Winds 35-44 knots (Strong Winds)                           90 minutes
Winds > 45 knots (Damaging Winds)                            2 hours
Freezing precipitation forecasted to occur within 5nm      90 minutes
Snow accumulation ≥ 2 inches in 12 hours or less           90 minutes
Rain accumulation ≥ 2 inches in 12 hours or less              90 inutes

      3.9.9. Weather Advisory. A weather advisory is a special weather product to alert an end
      user of the occurrence of, or imminent occurrence of weather conditions impacting
      operations. An advisory is a notification of weather criteria that is less intense than watch
      or warning criteria, but still has a negative impact to a specified organization or mission.
      Below, Figure 3 shows example weather advisory. Table 14 contains the weather
      advisories for Spangdahlem AB.
          3.9.9.1. Upon receipt of a weather advisory, the responsible agencies will implement
          safeguarding procedures.
          3.9.9.2. All weather advisories are based on specific observed criteria and are
          initiated by the 52 OSS/OSW to notify agencies of currently occurring weather
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                        19


         conditions hazardous to operations. The 21 OWS will provide backup assistance as
         required during ASE non-duty hours. The 52 OSS/OSW will notify the 21 OWS
         upon arrival and departure to coordinate transfer of responsibility for observed
         Weather Advisory support.

Figure 3. Advisory Example.




         3.9.9.3. This example indicates a critical crosswind threshold has been breached
         valid from the time issued until further notice.
         3.9.9.4. Weather advisories are terminated when the condition is no longer observed
         or when PIREPs indicate the condition no longer exists.

Table 14. Weather Advisory Criteria for Spangdahlem AB.
                              Criteria
Observed winds ≥ 25 knots
Observed crosswinds ≥ 20 knots
Low level wind shear (from PIREPs)
Observed icing (any intensity) below 10,000 ft (from PIREPs)
Ice FOD for F-16 (-07C to +07C,& RH ≥ 70%)
   3.10. ASE personnel will provide the following unique support for ATC personnel:
      3.10.1. Notify Tower and GCA when JET or AMOS equipment malfunctions and when
      the equipment must be taken down for troubleshooting or maintenance. ASE will notify
      Tower and GCA personnel when augmentation has commenced and when the
      AMOS/JET system is returned back to AUTO status.
      3.10.2. Act as focal point to resolve all JET and AMOS outages. Pass pertinent weather
      data to GCA and Tower via telephone until JET/AMOS outages are resolved. In the
      event of telephone outage, time-sensitive weather data (i.e., RVR, rapidly changing
      ceiling, rapidly changing visibility, etc.) can be passed via PMSV while the JET/AMOS
      is being augmented.
      3.10.3. Serve as the primary for disseminating PIREPS passed by ATC. Forecasters on
      stand-by will verbally relay PIREPS to the 21 OWS for dissemination.
      3.10.4. Notify Tower and GCA when weather personnel are present for duty and again
      when they leave.
      3.10.5. Notify Tower/GCA when weather personnel evacuate/relocate to alternate
      facility.
      3.10.6. Provide information to the Airfield Manager for FLIP updates. OSW will
      validate the accuracy of the information each time the FLIP is published and take
      immediate steps to correct erroneous data.
 20                                              SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


       3.10.7. Incorporate changes to the airfield minima, as published in new editions of the
       FLIPs, into observation procedures.
       3.10.8. Provide hourly observations, unless special criteria are met or local procedures
       are required to be activated.
       3.10.9. Accomplish daily PMSV checks and respond to calling aircraft, both on the
       ground and in the air.
       3.10.10. OSW will provide Tower facilities RVR readings upon request. If JET is
       inoperative OSW will update GCA and Tower of any changes to RVR until JET and/or
       AMOS have been restored.
4. Mission Weather Element (MWE). 52 OSS/OSW MWE forecasters supporting the wing
flying mission, will arrive a minimum of 2 hours before first brief time as determined by the
Patriot Excalibur Schedule (PEX) and stay until wing flying is terminated and MEF products
have been verified for accuracy.
   4.1. Operations Support. The MWE provides MEFs, flight weather briefing services,
   MISSIONWATCH, staff briefing services, and climate data for the 52 Fighter Wing. The
   480th Fighter is supported directly by means of a MEF.
   4.2. MEFs. The MEF is the primary tool used to accomplish day-to-day weather support for
   Spangdahlem AB. MEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements and are developed
   using a 2-phase process outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2 and local procedures. During this
   process the 52 OSS/OSW will fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater
   weather centers, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule) and
   agencies. The end result is a product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant
   weather support to customers. The MEF must be consistent with all products issued by 21
   OWS and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA). However, during rapidly changing
   conditions, emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource protection, the 52 OSS/OSW
   will amend the MEF to accurately reflect conditions and brief 21 OWS when time permits.
   4.3. See Attachment 4 for an example of the 52 OSS/OSW MEF.
   4.4. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). When developing the MEF, the 52
   OSS/OSW follows a detailed MEFP. The MEFP is an organized and systematic approach
   used to temporally and spatially refine forecast products to provide decision-quality
   environmental information for an operational decision-making process. The MEFP specifies
   techniques and tools used to forecast relevant individual weather elements critical to mission
   success, and how to best apply them to parent/host unit’s operational requirements. The
   MEFP also guides forecasters through the MISSIONWATCH, which is a process of
   verifying and, if necessary, amending the MEF.
   4.5. MISSIONWATCH. MISSIONWATCH is the process by which 52 OSS/OSW
   monitors the weather for all local missions.               Combined with METWATCH,
   MISSIONWATCH allows 52 OSS/OSW to monitor operations around Spangdahlem AB,
   including regional flying areas and routes, in order to issue amendments to any MEF. See
   Attachment 6, 52 FW Training Areas, to view the regional forecast areas.
       4.5.1. During rapidly changing conditions or if the MEF is inaccurate, 52 OSS/OSW will
       amend the MEF to ensure the forecast accurately reflects current or expected conditions
SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014                                                              21


        and contact the SOF or Top 3 to pass mission impacts. MISSIONWATCH will include
        determining how weather will affect defined air and ground mission-limiting parameters
        as listed in Attachment 3.
    4.6. Forecast Amendments. An amendment to the MEF flying package is required
    whenever one or more of the criteria listed in Table 15 occurs for a designated forecast valid
    period.

Table 15. MEF Amendment Criteria.
                              Amendment Criteria
Ceiling (ft)        2000                 700                  300
Visibility (m)      5000                 3200                 1600
Icing               Unforecasted, change of intensity or no longer occurring
Turbulence          Unforecasted or no longer occurring (MDT or greater)
TSTMs               Unforecasted or no longer occurring
Mission Wx          Anytime observed or forecasted Go/No Go conditions
                    change from a Go to a No Go (or No Go to a Go) for that
                    mission type (i.e. CAS, CSAR etc…)
Space Wx            Unforecasted severe impacts to GPS or UHF
Alternate WX        Unforecasted change that crosses 1000 /2
Note: Cig and Vis changes are for going above or below the listed criteria.
Amendments will also be made to the TOLD data section of the MEF when
the ETAD TAF is amended by the 21 OWS for crossing a TAF threshold.

    4.7. Off-station Support. The 52 OSS/OSW is the primary source for tailored weather
    information for off-station support for 52 FW aircraft. When mission activities occur away
    from the main operating location, 52 OSS/OSW leadership will determine the most effective
    means of ensuring Spangdahlem based units receive mission execution weather information.
        4.7.1. The 52 OSS/OSW will provide MEFs to Spangdahlem units/assets transiting or
        conducting flying missions at other locations via reachback, or by arranging support
        through other weather units or the OWS servicing the off-station location.
    4.8. Additional Aircrew Briefing Support.
        4.8.1. Transient & AMC Aircrew Services. During normal operating hours, transient
        aircrews may receive flight weather briefings from 52 OSS/OSW according to the
        standard duty priorities outlined in Table 1 AMC aircrews filed with the Tanker-Airlift
        Control Center (TACC) for weather support will be required to contact TACC for
        weather updates. During duty hours 52 OSS/OSW can provide updated take off data for
        TACC flights. During non-duty hours observation data can be obtained through ATC or
        TACC.
        4.8.2. During 52 OSS/OSW closure, transient aircrews should contact 21 OWS for flight
        weather briefing support at DSN 489-2133 or 496-6145.
 22                                              SPANGDAHLEMABI15-101 16 JUNE 2014


      4.8.3. 175-1 Briefings. The 21 OWS and 52 OSS/OSW prepare DD Form 175-1, Flight
      Weather Briefing, in compliance with AFMAN 15-129. The 21 OWS prepares 175-1
      weather briefings when the 52 OSS/OSW is closed. The 52 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS
      request 24 hr notification for 175-1s.
      4.8.4. Mass Briefings. The MWE forecasters provide mass weather briefs to the 480 FS.
      4.8.5. Coronet Briefings. 52 OSS/OSW supports host/tenant Coronet aircraft movements
      departing from Spangdahlem AB with planning and mission weather briefings.
      4.8.6. Tactical Decision Aids (TDAs). The 52 OSS/OSW requires a description of the
      target scenario and 2 hours advance notice to produce Electro Optic (EO) TDAs. The
      accuracy of the product relies on the detail of the operational input the user supplies. The
      52 OSS/OSW uses Target Acquisition Weapons Software (TAWS) to produce tailored
      target aids. TDA data will be provided by the 52 OSS/OSW in mass briefings and
      tailored to the day’s given missions, upon request.
5. Reciprocal Support.
   5.1. 52 FW Commander. 52 FW Commander or designated person will chair annual severe
   weather response meeting, IAW AFI 10-229.
   5.2. 52 FW Command Post.
      5.2.1. 52 FW/CP disseminates weather warnings, watches, and advisory notifications as
      listed in Attachment 2 (Table A2.1-A2.2) so that agencies may take the necessary
      actions to minimize damage. Attachment 3 lists the weather threats to the 52 FW.
      5.2.2. Once notified by Airfield Management Operations via the Secondary Crash Phone,
      the 52 FW/CP will notify the on-duty or stand-by weather forecaster of local aircraft
      mishaps.
      5.2.3. The Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) receives all weather watches,
      warnings, and advisories from the Emergency Actions (EA) Cell. The MOC notifies all
      sections in Table A2.4.
      5.2.4. Both the Command Post and MOC will send a representative to attend annual
      severe weather response meeting.
   5.3. 52 OSS/OSA Airfield Operations.
      5.3.1. Airfield Operations reciprocal support is outlined in Spangdahlem AB Instruction

The 480th Fighter Squadron - the Warhawks

The squadron flies the F-16CM Block 50 Fighting Falcon aircraft, informally referred to as the Viper. The F-16 is a highly
maneuverable multi-role fighter aircraft and has proven itself in air-to-air and air-to-surface combat. In the air-to-air role,
the Fighting Falcon wields a 20mm cannon, AIM-9X air-to-air infrared missiles, and AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range
Air-to-Air Missiles. The aircraft carries a variety of air-to-surface ordnance, including High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles
and precision-guided munitions, as well as a full complement of self-protection chaff and flares.

Aircraft: F-16 Block 50                                                 Name: Fighting Falcon
Manufacturer: Lockheed Martin Corp.                                     Category Aircraft: II
Primary Mission: Multi-role fighter                                     Crew: F-16C: One; F-16D: Two
Max Range: Over 1,740 nm                                                Ceiling: Above 50,000 ft
Munitions: Six hardpoints or nine hardpoints for air-to-air missiles (AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder,
and AIM-120 AMRAAM); air-to-surface missile (AGM-88 HARM); air-to-surface munitions (AGM-65

                                         Weather Sensitivities
Max X-Wind Comp: 25 kt (Dry), 20 kt (Wet)
Induction Icing Thresholds: Critical for engine startup: Temp < 07°C (45°F) and visible moisture (fog: Vis <
1 nm, rain, snow, water on runway, etc.) or when ice/snow is present. Ice FOD: Temperature is between
25°F (-04°C) and 45°F (07°C) and the temp/dew point spread is < 09°F (04°C) or temp is between 20°F (-
07°C) and 45°F (07°C) and any precipitation is occurring.
Icing: Avoid MDT or greater                         Turbulence: Avoid observed or forecast SVR or greater
Lightning/TSTMS: Avoid if possible                  In-Flight Refueling: VSBY must be > 1 nm
Radar: No weather radar; can detect SVR weather when radar is in ground mode.
Remark: Cloud cover > 3/8 and cloud bases < 3,000 ft degrade attack options and maneuverability. Cloud
cover > 5/8 and cloud bases < 1,000 ft significantly degrade visual attacks and maneuverability. Attacks
become predictable by restricting aircraft to cloud free corridors. VSBY < 5 nm degrades navigational and
terrain avoidance capability which reduces the time available to acquire and identify targets. Any occurrence
of freezing rain delays mission launch because exposed aircraft must be deiced. Rain > light intensity
degrades the pilot’s visual and infrared detection ranges. Any occurrence of snow degrades visual and
infrared detection ranges.
