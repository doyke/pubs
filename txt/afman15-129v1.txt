SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This manual has been divided into two volumes and must be completely reviewed. Volume One
contains information on overarching weather principles and weather characterization, Volume
Two contains information concerning integration and exploitation of weather data. Training
information has been removed from this manual and is included in AFI 15-127, Mission
Readiness Training. Guidance specific to the unique operations of Special Operations Weather
Teams (SOWT) will be maintained in AFI 15-135, Special Operations Weather.

                               OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES

1.1. Overarching Principles.
   1.1.1. General. For the purposes of this document, characterization organizations include,
   but are not limited to, the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Operational Weather
   Squadrons (OWSs), appropriate Weather Squadrons (e.g., 23 WS, 16WS), and other
   organizations whose primary responsibility is to produce and disseminate authoritative
   products that specify the past, current, and future state of the atmosphere for their respective
   geographic/functional AOR. OWSs will develop procedures and products as directed in this
   publication. Non-OWS AFWA units will develop standard operating procedures and
   products to fulfill Air Force Mission Directive 52, Air Force Weather Agency and roles and
   responsibilities outline within AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities.
   Exploitation Units (EU) include, but are not limited to, Weather Flights (WFs), Weather
   Specialty Teams (WSTs) and other organizations whose primary purpose is to use products
   created by characterization organizations for exploitation of the environment through direct
   integration with the warfighter. A weather organization’s operability spans the full spectrum
   of strategic, operational and tactical operations. Given the dynamic nature of modern
   warfare, an organization can find itself supporting more than one function at a time.
   Therefore, the volumes of AFMAN 15-129 will focus on weather functions that are integral
   to supporting operations at each level.
      1.1.1.1. Characterization. Characterization encompasses the ―collect, analyze and
      predict‖ weather core competencies. Characterization depends on our ability to collect
      accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the results to produce a coherent
      picture of the present and future state of the air and space environment. Specific weather
      units are designated with the responsibility for environmental characterization. In
      accordance with (IAW) AFI 38-101 Air Force Organization, characterization units are
      organized, trained, and equipped at the squadron level, with the exception of the 612
      Support Squadron/Operational WF (also known as the AFSOUTH WF). Units organized
      below squadron level are not characterization units.
   1.1.2. Exploitation. Exploitation is the ability to minimize the impact of environmental
   threats to friendly forces while simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions that
   maximize the operational advantage over enemy forces. AFW enables decision makers to
   plan and execute weather-optimized courses of action through timely injection of mission-
   tailored environmental threat information at every decision point in the mission planning and
   execution process.
      1.1.2.1. Tailoring. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific
      mission profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment. This
      information can be spatial, temporal or both, but will always focus on the mission profile
      and the associated mission-limiting weather thresholds. Tailoring does not mean
      changing the characterization of the air and space environment. To the greatest extent
      possible, weather organizations charged with tailoring and exploitation will use the
      characterized data provided to them.
 6                                                      AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


        1.1.2.2. Integration. Integration is the process by which AFW organizations seek to
        inject the right information at the right time every time. The foundation of exploitation
        and integration is built upon two tenets: knowledge and relationships.
            1.1.2.2.1. Knowledge. Missions are affected by a wide variety of environmental
            threats, requiring operational commanders and mission planners to understand the
            threats most likely to impair their mission’s effectiveness. AFW leaders will identify
            and understand specific impacts of the environment on those missions, translate those
            impacts into the mission-language of their supported warfighters for action, and
            impart this expertise to their subordinate weather personnel through enduring
            training, processes, and procedures. It is crucial to understand not only the
            capabilities and sensitivities of mission platforms, equipment, and systems but also
            mission processes (e.g., mission analysis, planning, course of action (COA)
            development/comparison/selection, and execution) and the points where weather
            processes must intersect or work in parallel with these mission processes. For
            example, when supporting the Army, one needs to be intimately involved in the
            Military Decision Making Process (MDMP), and know key decision points that will
            influence the process and optimize the outcome. It is the responsibility of AFW
            leaders and their subordinates to actively seek this knowledge using every available
            resource, starting with their supported warfighters.
            1.1.2.2.2. Relationships. AFW leaders must be proactively involved with their
            supported organizations, building trust through the skillful application of weather and
            mission-based expertise to maintain commanders’ environmental awareness, optimize
            mission planning, and achieve mission success. To be effective, these relationships
            will be established and actively maintained with the supported organizations’ key
            operational decision makers, operators, intelligence specialists, tactical-level mission
            planners, schedulers, and weapons and tactics experts. Once established, AFW
            personnel will be able to quickly adapt to process and/or mission changes.
1.2. Risk Management. Risk management (RM) is a decision-making process to systematically
evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of
action for any given situation. Leadership will apply RM principles and processes to day-to-day
weather operations to focus activities and allocate resources of the weather unit to exploit
environmental conditions, mitigate mission delays, and enhance the overall effectiveness of
operations.
     1.2.1. AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management, establishes the Air Force Operational
     Risk Management Program. AF weather units will implement AFPD 90-9 with Air Force
     Instruction (AFI) 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and use the Air Force Pamphlet
     (AFPAM) 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools, as a process
     guide. This pamphlet provides the definitions, guidelines, procedures, and tools for the
     integration and execution of ORM for all US Air Force organizations and personnel. Figure
     1.1 identifies and describes the six-step ORM process.

                condition that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death to
     Step 1     personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property. Experience,
                common sense, and specific risk management tools help identify real or
                potential hazards.
                Assess the Risk. Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure
                to the hazard. The assessment step is the application of quantitative or
                qualitative measures to determine the level of risk associated with a
     Step 2
                specific hazard. This process defines the probability and severity of a
                mishap that could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of
                personnel or assets to that hazard.
                Analyze Risk Control Measures. Investigate specific strategies and tools
                that reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the risk. Effective control measures
     Step 3
                reduce or eliminate one of the three components (probability, severity, or
                exposure) of risk.
                Make Control Decisions. Decision-makers at the appropriate level
     Step 4     choose the best control or combination of controls based on the analysis of
                overall costs and benefits.
                Implement Risk Controls. Once control strategies have been selected, an
                implementation strategy needs to be developed and then applied by
     Step 5
                management and the work force. Implementation requires commitment of
                time and resources.
                Supervise and Review. Risk management is a process that continues
                throughout the life cycle of the system, mission, or activity. Leaders at
     Step 6     every level must fulfill their respective roles in assuring controls are
                sustained over time. Once controls are in place, the process must be
                periodically reevaluated to ensure their effectiveness.

                                           Chapter 2

                                   CHARACTERIZATION

2.1. Characterization. Characterization units will develop logical and repeatable analysis and
forecast processes. These processes will focus on uniform analysis of observed data, forecasting
of space and terrestrial weather conditions, producing and disseminating graphical and
alphanumeric weather products, and Quality Assurance of all final products. Additionally,
characterization units will develop metrics to assess product quality. Timely delivery of weather
products to weather personnel, command and control agencies and systems, and decision aids is
critical for effective exploitation.
   2.1.1. Principles. The OWS is the primary or first source in analysis and prediction. As
   such, characterization is not a normal function of the EU. Certain weather organizations are
   assigned characterization duties for a specific functional area such as special operations
   forces, national intelligence community, volcanic ash detection, spacelift/space operations, or
   climatology. These units will coordinate to the maximum extent possible with the OWS
   having characterization responsibility for a given geographic area. While there is always
   some forecasting involved in any mission execution product, the intent is that the EU will not
   replicate the efforts of those organizations which are both equipped and manned to
   accomplish a thorough characterization of the atmosphere. Units organized as EU assigned
   to a management headquarters weather squadron or subordinate to an operations support
   squadron do not routinely function as characterization units. EUs apply environmental
   characterizations to specific missions and provide military decision makers with impacts and
   actionable information to maximize host/parent unit mission execution and resource
   protection actions.
2.2. Processes and Procedures. Characterization units will employ logical, repeatable
processes and procedures to collect, analyze and predict mission critical thresholds in the
terrestrial or space environment in accordance with mission descriptions and assigned
geographic or functional areas of responsibility. Characterization unit leadership will:
   2.2.1. Conduct and document, at a minimum, an annual review of processes and procedures
   (e.g., SOPs, OIs) to ensure accuracy.
   2.2.2. Conduct and document, at a minimum, an annual review of all processes and
   procedures (e.g., SOPs, OIs) for which they are position qualified.
   2.2.3. Establish and document, at a minimum, a continuous improvement process for the
   following core processes: collection, analysis and prediction.
   2.2.4. Formally document both quality assurance and forecast review processes.
   2.2.5. Cross feed best practices and lessons learned to other characterization units through
   the AFWA Standardization and Evaluation Division (AFWA/A3V) for standardization
   across the functional community.
2.3. Collection Process. Collection is the essential component of worldwide and regional
databases from which characterization units derive weather products. Characterization units
 10                                                    AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


collect terrestrial and space environmental information from across the globe. A continual
collection of weather and space data contributes to the accuracy of products.
2.4. Analysis Process. Characterization units will develop a systematic analysis process to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. Analysis entails building a coherent, integrated
depiction of the past and current state of the natural environment over a specified region.
Characterization units provide effective analysis of collected weather data (terrestrial and space)
to help ensure the accuracy of products. These data are processed and assimilated into
environmental databases to provide battlespace awareness and inputs for decision-making and
predictions. Analysis will drive forecast decision trees throughout the process. The procedures
for analyzing data may vary depending on the data and parameters, and methods may include
visually inspecting data and producing analysis products.
2.5. Prediction Process. This process guides weather forecasters in developing a prediction of
the future state of the atmosphere. Characterization units will include the following items in the
forecast processes and procedures:
   2.5.1. Continuity and Persistence.
   2.5.2. Climatology.
   2.5.3. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models. NWP output will be evaluated every 3
   hours through an objective verification process to identify model deviations from the sensed
   environment and evaluate the run-to-run consistency of meteorological models to improve
   the forecast processes. Model verification products will be used, along with subjective
   techniques such as continuity and extrapolation, as a guide for adjusting forecasts.
   2.5.4. Ensembles. Characterization units employ Ensemble Prediction Suites (EPS) as a tool
   to assess credibility of weather data identified by single model forecasts. Characterization of
   credible data will enhance military decision making processes when provided to units
   serviced by characterization units for exploitation purposes.
   2.5.5. Forecast Techniques and Rules of Thumb (ROT). Characterization units will
   document, evaluate and review biennially, all forecast techniques and rules of thumb.
   Characterization units will integrate validated forecast techniques and rules of thumb into
   forecast processes.
   2.5.6. Forecast Worksheets/Checklists. Forecasters will utilize forecast worksheets and
   checklists in order to work logically and consistently through the forecast process. When
   developing worksheets/checklists/decision aids, characterization units will:
       2.5.6.1. Design worksheets/checklists to help forecast specific terrestrial or space
       weather parameters.
       2.5.6.2. Integrate location specific forecast reference material, forecast tools and
       techniques for different seasons and atmospheric patterns as applicable.
           2.5.6.2.1. Review forecast reference material seasonally for forecast application
           updates.
           2.5.6.2.2. Ensure relevant, specific, and tailored forecast reference material, as
           required in AFI 15-128, Air Force Roles and Responsibilities, is included in
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                               11


          qualification training and reviewed by training flight weather personnel on a semi-
          annual basis.
       2.5.6.3. Provide a summation of forecast reasoning employed for developing the
       forecast.
       2.5.6.4. Document significant changes to forecast products as a result of collaboration
       with exploitation units.
       2.5.6.5. Host worksheets on primary and backup OWS sites for continued tier 1 support
       as required in AFI 15-128.
2.6. Dissemination.
   2.6.1. The 2d Systems Operations Squadron (2SYOS) at Offutt AFB is the primary agency
   responsible for weather enterprise collection and dissemination activities. 2SYOS operates
   and maintains enterprise transmission and storage systems operating at multiple levels of
   security classification.
   2.6.2. Characterization units will process meteorological data and prepare weather products
   using Air Force approved production systems. Air Force standard weather production
   systems will be used to disseminate characterization products, weather watches, warnings,
   advisories, and other products or services via an Air Force standard communication node,
   web services, and/or subscription services.
   2.6.3. Characterization units will make every effort to make environmental data and products
   available for dissemination via systems and data networks approved by combatant or joint
   commands. These efforts will apply to units participating in joint, coalition, or combined
   operations within the characterization unit’s AOR when cross-system and/or cross-network
   data transfer is available.
2.7. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). This is a deliberate continuous process for
monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a
METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from
forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group
of products, and notify designated agencies. Characterization units will:
   2.7.1. Establish and maintain a prioritized threat-based METWATCH process for all
   locations for which it is responsible for issuing products (i.e., warnings, watches, and
   advisories), and employ Risk Management (RM) steps to identify weather threats impacting
   characterization products and maximize effectiveness of resources.
   2.7.2. Monitor and identify changes in weather conditions that cross critical weather
   thresholds, as outlined in the installation data page for the supported unit, and evaluate
   forecast products/reasoning when conditions are not occurring as forecast.
   2.7.3. Amend forecast per product amend criteria and coordinate with exploitation units per
   established procedures.
   2.7.4. Develop METWATCH procedures to include the following:
       2.7.4.1. Identify primary METWATCH data sources, document forecast methods, and
       standardize methods of obtaining weather situational awareness.
 12                                                   AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


       2.7.4.2. Identify weather products and services affected by unexpected changes to
       forecasted conditions. At a minimum, characterization units that have METWATCH
       responsibilities will have prioritized procedures for Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
       (WWAs), Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), Military Operating Area Forecasts
       (MOAFs), and flight hazards.
       2.7.4.3. Outline the actions to take when forecast conditions change during the
       METWATCH. Specify the units to contact and primary and backup contact methods
       (e.g., telephone, e-mail, phone patch).
2.8. Aircraft Mishaps. Upon notification of an aircraft or ground mishap, the OWS will
provide pertinent data to the investigating authority by any and all coordinated means or media.
This data will include, but is not limited to observations, TAFs, WWA, hazards charts,
Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) imagery, and available RADAR data (including Velocity
Azimuth Display (VAD) wind profiles). This will include data from the time of the event
through the previous 12 hours for the region of operations, and subsequent 6 hours after event.
2.9. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE). OWSs
will:
   2.9.1. Provide products and services specified in the regionally responsible Air Force OWS
   section of Table A4.38 in AFI 10-2501 Air Force Emergency Management Program
   Planning and Operations.
   2.9.2. Execute items 5-9 of WF section of Table A4.38 in AFI 10-2501 Air Force
   Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations when the installation WF is
   absent or unavailable.

3.3. NWP Models.
   3.3.1. OWSs will:
      3.3.1.1. Select the viable model or models for their AOR, factoring in data availability
      and 16 WS monthly or seasonal model performance metrics.
      3.3.1.2. Evaluate data on the synoptic scale or mesoscale, depending on model scale and
      AOR-specific requirements.
      3.3.1.3. Automate model verification products every 3 hours for all viable models using
      Table 3.5 as a minimum. The OWS may create additional verification products.
      3.3.1.4. Identify and discuss deviations from the representative model data in appropriate
      forecast discussion bulletin(s).
      3.3.1.5. Analyze representative model(s) data for the supported AOR.
      3.3.1.6. Automate as many significant parameters as the capability exists, except for
      fronts and troughs at the surface.
      3.3.1.7. Develop processes and procedures for depicting significant features on the
      representative model using Table 3.5. and Attachment 4.
      3.3.1.8. Use fine-scale and long-range model data from multiple sources as needed to
      provide representative products.
      3.3.1.9. Produce forecast model products at 12-hour intervals starting at the base hour
      (e.g., 00Z or 12Z) through the 72-hour point for parameters listed in Table 3.6
      3.3.1.10. Develop modified depiction procedures for tropical regions within the AOR.
      OWSs will document tropical-unique depiction procedures in analysis and forecast
      procedures. OWSs may include a description of the modified depiction parameters in the
      data page (see AFI 15-128, 4.1.1) with supported EUs if deemed operationally
      significant. OWSs may leverage hurricane/typhoon center products if their products are
      adequate to meet area and type requirements.

        locations within their assigned region or functional area.
        3.4.2.3.2. Use KQ identifiers for temporary, contingency, exercise, or classified
        operating locations.
  3.4.3. TAF Production.
     3.4.3.1. Characterization units producing TAFs will:
        3.4.3.1.1. Develop a TAF production cycle for all locations and coordinate TAF issue
        times with supported units.
        3.4.3.1.2. Issue forecasts valid for a 30-hour period.
        3.4.3.1.3. Issue TAF-coded forecasts, at a minimum, every 8 hours within 15 minutes
        after the file time during airfield operational hours.
        3.4.3.1.4. Encode the TAF-coded forecast product IAW AFMAN 15-124,
        Meteorological Codes.
        3.4.3.1.5. Collaborate with supported exploitation units prior to TAF dissemination
        and formally document exploitation unit inputs.
        3.4.3.1.6. Disseminate all TAF-coded forecast products (including amendments) via
        standard production and dissemination systems.
        3.4.3.1.7. Disseminate TAF-coded forecasts for limited operation airfields not more
        than 3 hours before the airfield opens. Deviations from this practice will be by
        mutual agreement with the supported unit and documented on the installation data
        page.
  3.4.4. TAF-coded Forecast Specification and Amendment.
     3.4.4.1. Characterization units will:
        3.4.4.1.1. Specify the onset, duration, and intensity for the standard criteria in Table
        3.8 throughout the valid period of the forecast. Forecasts will be amended when
        conditions do not match specified conditions within Table 3.8
        3.4.4.1.2. Specify and amend ceiling and visibility categories for US Army or US Air
        Force flight planning criteria throughout the valid period of the forecast. The lower
        of the two conditions will determine the ceiling and visibility amendment category.
            3.4.4.1.2.1. Use ceiling and visibility specification criteria in Table 3.9 for TAF-
            coded forecasts issued for Army airfields.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                     23


              3.4.4.1.2.2. Use ceiling and visibility specification criteria in Table 3.10 for
              TAF-coded forecasts issued for Air Force operating locations.
       3.4.4.2. Characterization units issuing forecasts for Joint/Coalition airfields will validate
       criteria based on operational requirements. Use Air Force ceiling and visibility
       specification criteria located in Table 3.10 when Air Force agencies operate the airfield.
       Characterization units will use Army criteria from Table 3.9 when Army organizations
       operate the airfield.
       3.4.4.3. Forecasters will employ trend data from standard display systems (e.g., Airfield
       Sensor Displays) to determine prevailing conditions.
          3.4.4.3.1. Prevailing conditions are those that persist for at least 30 consecutive
          minutes.
          3.4.4.3.2. Conditions occurring once during a specified time-period for less than 30
          consecutive minutes or occurring for an aggregate total of less than 30 minutes of
          every cardinal hour are temporary.
          3.4.4.3.3. During periods of rapidly changing ceilings or visibilities crossing multiple
          categories, consider conditions occurring for the greatest aggregate total during a
          cardinal hour the predominant condition for that cardinal hour.

       are not required to produce standard FITL graphics products covering regions not
       routinely used by the U.S. military (low use areas), but will have processes and
       procedures in place for users to request, and the OWS to produce and disseminate,
       standard FITL graphics for these areas if needed. OWSs will produce a separate chart
       using automated model output products for those areas deemed ―low use areas‖.
       Characterization units will employ standard forecast techniques maintained by
       AFWA/A3 to mediate digital data fields. AFWA/A3 will publish these weather
       techniques and procedures in a standardized format approved by AF/A3O-W for use in
       the field.
       3.5.2.5. MSL Heights. All forecast heights on OWS thunderstorm, icing, turbulence
       products, and the cloud tops on theater cloud products will be depicted using MSL
       values. OWSs will take into account the geography changes in the AOR to prevent
       forecasting MSL bases below general terrain heights. This does not include the small-
       scale changes in terrain heights (e.g., differences between mountain peaks in close
       proximity), which EUs will integrate into the mission execution forecast process to
       further refine forecasts.
       3.5.2.6. AGL Heights. The OWS HWD and theater cloud forecast products will depict
       cloud bases as AGL height depictions.
       3.5.2.7. METWATCHING and Amending FITL Graphics Products. OWSs will
       METWATCH and amend standard graphics products for the criteria listed in Table 3.12
       Use perishable data (such as Pilot Reports (PIREPS), observations, radar data, and
       METSAT imagery) and NWP output available at forecast hours after the production
       cycle to METWATCH and amend products as required.

Table 3.12. Amendment Criteria for OWS Standard FITL Graphics Products
1. Moderate or greater icing incorrectly depicted in horizontal extent, vertical extent, type,
intensity, or time of occurrence.
2. Moderate or greater turbulence incorrectly depicted in horizontal extent, vertical extent,
intensity, or time of occurrence.
3. Lines or organized clusters of thunderstorms, not easily circumnavigated (usually described as
Numerous thunderstorms) incorrectly depicted on the forecast.
4. Thresholds listed in Table 3.11. incorrectly forecast.
5. Vertical extent incorrectly forecast by >2,000 ft below 10,000AGL, >5,000 ft above
10,000MSL.
6. Horizontal extent incorrectly forecast by >90 nautical miles.
7. Graphical depiction is not representative of existing or forecast conditions.

       3.5.2.8. Collaborate with bordering OWSs and mesh all FITL products to provide
       horizontal consistency within areas of responsibilities.
       3.5.2.9. If disagreements exist on the depiction of hazardous weather between AORs, the
       OWS responsible for the AOR with the upstream conditions will decide the depiction.

                WEATHER PRODUCTS FOR RESOURCE PROTECTION

4.1. General. Characterization units conduct a continuous meteorological watch to identify and
assess emerging and imminent threats to installations for which they have forecast responsibility.
Special Weather Statements (SWS) and WWAs are special notices provided by the
characterization unit resulting from both the forecast and METWATCH processes to assist
military decision makers with resource and resource protection decisions. SWSs provide
advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions that have the potential to affect
military installation(s). Watches and warnings provide notice of weather events posing a hazard
to life or property. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
phenomena with the potential to impact operations.
   4.1.1. WWA Procedures. Applicable characterization units produce, disseminate, and
   amend SWSs and WWAs to inform supported installations/sites of potential and observed
   weather conditions that require protective actions. Characterization units will discuss
   credible threats to an installation with the affected EU to assist them in influencing mission
   planning and execution activities prior to onset.
       4.1.1.1. Characterization units will:
           4.1.1.1.1. Issue WWAs in a standard format and numbering scheme via the standard
           Air Force dissemination system for the following installations:
               4.1.1.1.1.1. Active duty USAF and Army installations.
           4.1.1.1.2. Expeditionary operating locations in their AORs.
           4.1.1.1.3. Guard and Reserve installations.
           4.1.1.1.4. Homeland Defense sites and operations.
           4.1.1.1.5. Special sites of national interest (e.g., The White House).
           4.1.1.1.6. Major Continental United States (CONUS) Lock and Dam facilities.
           4.1.1.1.7. Joint, Coalition, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
           munitions storage areas.
           4.1.1.1.8. Spacelift operations and assets including government, military, and
           commercial facilities.
           4.1.1.1.9. Joint Bases where the Air Force or Army is the supporting component.
       4.1.1.2. Use WWA text pre-loaded into the Air Force dissemination system to ensure
       continuity. Specific text may vary by location. Text will be brief and clearly describe
       weather conditions in terms understood by all users of the product.
       4.1.1.3. Include maximum hail size, maximum rain/snow accumulation, or maximum
       wind speed as applicable in warnings and advisories. Additional criteria may be
       specified by supported agencies.
   4.1.2. Only one warning will be in effect at a given time (and will include multiple warning
   criteria as required) except for forecast tornado warnings and/or observed lightning warnings.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                              37


  4.1.3. Warnings take precedence over advisories for the same phenomena. Forecast
  advisory/warning valid for the same phenomena will not be valid for the same time.
  Conversely, warnings and multiple forecast advisories for different phenomena may be valid
  for the same time.
  4.1.4. Watches are stand alone products based upon potential and are unaffected by warnings
  or advisories for the same phenomena.
     4.1.4.1. Mandatory watch criteria include: tornados, severe thunderstorms, damaging
     winds, lightning within 5NM, and freezing precipitation as the potential warrants.
     4.1.4.2. Additional watch criteria may exist based upon supported agency requirements.
  4.1.5. Upgrading and downgrading warnings and advisories.
     4.1.5.1. A warning is upgraded by adding a phenomena or crossing to a higher threshold.
     A warning is downgraded by removing a phenomena or crossing to a lower threshold.
     4.1.5.2. Forecasted warnings or advisories will use the Integrated Weather Warnings
     Capability (IWWC) default wording for upgrading and downgrading warnings or
     advisories.
  4.1.6. Forecasted warnings and advisories will maintain horizontal consistency with TAF
  and other forecast products. Watches are not required to be included in the body of the TAF-
  coded forecast depending on circumstance.
  4.1.7. OWSs will coordinate annually with each EU/supported agency in their AOR and
  maintain an installation data page of WWA thresholds/desired lead-times and mission
  impacts. Table 4.1. provides default thresholds and desired lead-times for OWS to use when
  WF/supported agency does not specify a DLT or state a specific threshold. Exploitation
  units will coordinate with their supporting OWS and supported organization leadership to
  determine required desired lead-times for the supported organization.
     4.1.7.1. Characterization units will maximize the use of watches within their effected
     regions until conditions warrant the issuance of a warning to meet desired lead-times for
     the supported organizations. Watches should be issued at a minimum of one hour before
     a warning is issued, with the exception of the lightning watch, which should be issued
     with at least 30 minutes before the lightning warning is issued. Issue warnings at the
     desired lead times specified by the supported unit.
     4.1.7.2. Characterization units will use the default minimum desired lead-times in Table
     4.1 only if the supported organization does not specify a minimum DLT.

Note 1. Lead-time requirement determined by needs of the military decision making process at
the affected installation. Default lead-times will be used when a local requirement has not been
specifically stated.
Note 2. Mandatory EU Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) criteria.
Note 3. EU SWAP activities dictated by local policy.
   4.1.8. Verification. Warnings and advisories will be verified using all available sources of
   representative sensed or observed data or subjective analysis (when appropriate) within an
   expanding radius around a specific geographic location based on the desired lead-time
   requirement of the warning or advisory product (see Figure 4.1.). Unit leadership will
   ensure verification sources are credible. The greater the lead-time requirement levied on the
   characterization unit, the wider the radius around the point location employed in data
   collection for verifying warnings and advisories. Employing a flexible verification range
   acknowledges limitations in the state of the meteorological art and provides a measure of
   accuracy similar to delivery error components of weapons delivery metrics resulting in
   determination of a circular error probability (CEP). Although loosely based on these
   concepts, the results are familiar to military decision makers employing weather warning and
   advisory products to conduct operations and protect resources and personnel.
42                                                  AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


     4.1.8.1. WWA products will specifically state the area affected by the WWA product.
     Normally, this is a 5 nautical mile circle around the center of a runway complex, a point
     within a range complex, or a specific location. The area enclosed by a 5NM circle
     around the point is known as the specification distance and considered ―at the location‖
     for verification of WWA products. WWA products issued for an area such as a missile
     field, exercise area, or maneuver area are geographically irregular in dimension and may
     not be associated with a specific point like an airfield complex. Weather events
     occurring within the geographic confines of the area are considered ―at the location‖ for
     verification purposes and there is no CEP.
     4.1.8.2. Observed warnings and advisories are verified using sensed or observed data
     within the specification distance from the point location. For example, a warning for
     lightning within 5NM of an airfield is issued and simultaneously verified based on
     lightning strikes, radar returns within the specification distance, or reporting TS as a
     weather type in the body of an observation.
     4.1.8.3. Warnings and advisories issued with lead-times are verified using an expanded
     verification radius, not to exceed 15nm, around the affected location using the graph in
     Figure 4.1. The verification radius is completely independent of specification distance
     and is employed to ensure adequate sampling of the environment for verification
     purposes only.
        4.1.8.3.1. Characterization units will omit reporting locations within the verification
        radius that are not representative of the location receiving WWA products.
        Document these sites in forecast reference material or SOPs. For example, wind
        reports from a meteorological reporting station within the verification radius at a
        higher elevation than the warned location will be excluded because wind speeds at
        that elevation do not accurately represent conditions at the warned location
        4.1.8.3.2. Characterization units will employ all data available from representative
        sources of sensed or observed data within the verification radius to objectively verify
        warnings and advisories. Sensed data from Doppler radars, mesonets, environmental
        monitoring systems, tactical air traffic control (ATC) systems, forward armament and
        refueling points, other sensing systems, or storm spotter reports are considered
        objective data for evaluating and verifying WWA products. Unofficial reports from
        credible sources (e.g., law enforcement and fire and rescue personnel) within the
        verification radius of the warned location will only be used to verify warnings and
        advisories when unit leadership determines the reports are credible based on
        corroborating objective weather data or subjective analysis of relevant weather data.
        4.1.8.3.3. In cases where objective verification is not possible, inadequate, or
        misrepresentative, characterization units may analyze available data to determine if
        the event actually occurred. In situations where units use subjective verification, they
        will also take responsibility for a missed occurrence of the weather threat if these
        phenomena are reported with no WWAs in effect at that time.
     4.1.8.4. Units issuing WWAs will verify each phenomenon separately except as
     indicated below.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                43


     4.1.8.4.1.    Severe thunderstorm and moderate thunderstorm warnings will be verified
     upon first occurrence of either wind or hail threshold at the warned location. Occurrence
     of either of the specified criteria in severe thunderstorm and moderate thunderstorm
     warnings verifies these warnings; the criteria are ―bundled‖ for verification purposes.
        4.1.8.4.2. Verify a lightning watch as if it were a forecast WWA product with a 30-
        minute desired lead-time. Lead-time will be based on the issued time of the watch
        subtracted from the time of first occurrence of the lightning within specification
        distance of the warned location.
     4.1.8.5. Verify heavy precipitation warnings using measurements from the airfield
     observing system, Doppler radar precipitation measurements, other rain gauges, or storm
     reports in the verification radius for the warned location.
        4.1.8.5.1. Heavy rain warnings specifying an accumulation in a specified time period.
        These warnings will be verified using a summation of the one-hour precipitation
        measurements from the airfield observing system. Collect the one-hour amounts
        reported by the airfield observing system commencing with the cardinal hour that the
        warning was issued and indicate on a weather warning verification tracker when the
        specified precipitation total was reached. Continue to collect the one-hourly
        accumulations during the valid period of the warning and enter the total liquid
        precipitation received during the valid period of the warning into the verification
        database.
        4.1.8.5.2. Characterization units will use accumulated reports of six-hourly, 12-
        hourly, or summary of the day during the valid period of the warning for verifying
        heavy rain warnings at locations where the characterization unit does not have access
        to the hourly rain gauge data from an airfield observing system. Actual time of
        occurrence may be estimated based on interpolations from the rate of accumulation in
        METAR or Synoptic reports.
        4.1.8.5.3. Characterization units with access to WSR-88D Doppler radar data will
        use radar generated precipitation total products to supplement direct measurements
        from a rain gauge, and verify precipitation accumulation warnings provided the data
        has been evaluated for accuracy (account for high reflectivity phenomena such as hail
        or bright band contamination of the data). Characterization units may use radar
        measured precipitation products from other radar types if the data are considered
        reliable.
        4.1.8.5.4. Characterization units may use reports of flooding or visible damage
        within the area covered by a warning as subjective verification of a heavy rain
        warning.
        4.1.8.5.5. Heavy snow warnings will specify a threshold snow accumulation over a
        specified period of time and will be verified using manually observed snowfall totals
        from Air Force, sister service, coalition partners, or host nation sources where the
        capability exists.
        4.1.8.5.6. In the absence of manual snowfall totals, characterization units will convert
        one-hour liquid precipitation measurements into hourly snow equivalent using Table
        12.1. in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. Collect the one-hour
44                                                   AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


         amounts reported by the airfield observing system commencing with the cardinal
         hour that the warning was issued, and indicate on a weather warning verification
         tracker when the specified snowfall total was reached. Continue to collect the one-
         hourly accumulations during the valid period of the warning and enter the total
         snowfall and liquid precipitation received during the valid period of the warning into
         the verification database.
         4.1.8.5.7. Weather radar data is unreliable for determining snowfall and will not be
         used to objectively verify heavy snow warnings. Characterization units may use
         radar reflectivity returns to subjectively evaluate heavy snowfall warnings to justify
         warnings that do not verify by other means.
         4.1.8.5.8. Characterization units will use accumulated reports of six-hourly, 12-
         hourly, or summary of the day during the valid period of a heavy snow warning at
         locations where the characterization unit does not have access to hourly data from an
         airfield observing system. Actual time of occurrence may be estimated based on
         interpolations from the rate of accumulation in METAR or Synoptic reports. Use the
         observation date/time group on METAR reports with Snow increasing rapidly
         remarks (SNINCR s/tt) to verify heavy snow warnings when either value in the
         remark meets or exceeds the warning threshold.
  4.1.8.6. Characterization units will verify all WWAs transferred to them from a sister unit or
  an EU during/after a disruption in services and enter the verification data in the Air Force
  weather dissemination system.
     4.1.8.7. Document sound meteorological reasoning used in determining the need for all
     forecast WWAs in the appropriate spaces provided in the Air Force weather
     dissemination system.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 45


Figure 4.1. Determining Verification Radius based on Desired Lead-Time Requirement




      4.1.8.8. Warnings and advisories fall into one of four verification categories.
         4.1.8.8.1. Hit:
             4.1.8.8.1.1. Issued and verified within 10% of the threshold w/in 5nm radius of
             the affected location with at least 75% desired lead-time.
             4.1.8.8.1.2. Issued and verified within the verification radius with at least 75% of
             desired lead-time. Characterization units may accept 50% of desired lead-time
             outside of 11nautical miles for convective systems transiting the verification
             radius at speeds of 30 knots or greater.
         4.1.8.8.2. Push / Miss: Not issued; occurred w/in lead-time verification radius but
         not w/in 5 nm radius. Note: a push warning is an event considered significant to
         meteorologists but did not impact the mission at the warned location.
         4.1.8.8.3. Miss:
             4.1.8.8.3.1. Not issued but event occurred w/in 5 nm radius or lead-time
             verification radius of the affected location.
             4.1.8.8.3.2. Occurred within the verification radius but did not provide at least

        75% desired lead-time. Note: characterization units may accept 50% lead-time
        outside of 11 nautical miles from the warned location in the event of convective
        systems moving at speeds of 30 knots or greater through the verification range of
        the warned location.
     4.1.8.8.4. False Alarm: Issued but event did not occur w/in the 5nm radius or lead-
     time verification radius of the affected location.

  4.1.9. Lead-time Computation
     4.1.9.1. Actual lead-time is the time elapsed between the issue time of the warning and
     advisory and the first time of occurrence.
     4.1.9.2. Actual lead-time computation for warnings and advisories that are downgrades
     from an existing warning or advisory is based on the issue time of the first warning or
     advisory provided there is no break in coverage. Ensure there is no break in coverage
     and a ―DOWNGRADE‖ remark is appended to the new warning or advisory. If a break
     in coverage does occur, actual lead-time will be computed from the new issue time.
  4.1.10. In addition to the verification procedures described in paragraph 4.1.8,
  characterization units will continue to use legacy verification techniques IAW AFI 15-114,
  Functional Resource and Weather Technical Performance Evaluation until further guidance
  is issued.
  4.1.11. Provide WWAs using the rules and information in Tables 4.2 and 4.3.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  49




Table 4.2. Rules for Issuing WWAs

1. A Watch is not a substitute for a Warning. Units will issue Warnings, as required, regardless of
whether or not a Watch had previously been issued.
2. All Watches and WWs are issued for specific and distinct locations.
- The area affected by a Watch or Warning will be clearly indicated in the text of the Watch/WW.
- Watches may be issued for an area larger than the corresponding Warning (Watch for base X
and surrounding local flying area, WW for the aerodrome).
- WW normally affect an area no larger than 5 nautical miles (nm) radius (except for lightning
warnings that have a minimum radius of 5 nm). Document deviations in supported agency data
pages or parent MAJCOM plans or instructions.
- Watches and WWs for Military Operating Areas (e.g., training areas, ranges, and missile
complexes) may cover larger areas.
3. The lightning watch and the observed lightning warning are separate entities and do not
supersede previously issued Watches or WWs for other criteria.
4. A separate valid time will be specified for each criterion when warranted.
- All times used in a Watch or WW will be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and
Local Time.
- Exception: A valid time is not used in observed warnings. In place of valid time, the following
statement is used: "Valid until further notice."
5. Do not issue a forecast WWA for a single unforecasted event that is not expected to persist or
recur. Account for this as a miss.
6. Characterization unit will issue observed warnings when EU is not on duty, as capability exists.

7. More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time for the same location, but only one
will be in effect for a particular phenomenon at the same time.

8. Under rare circumstances EUs may, without prior coordination, issue WWs to facilitate
resource protection actions when sufficient time does not exist to communicate a change in
weather with the characterization unit. EUs will forward pertinent information to the servicing
characterization unit to ensure the warning is entered into the Air Force weather dissemination
system.

9. EUs will issue observed WWAs to include lightning warnings while on duty.
 50                                                   AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011




Table 4.3. Rules for Amending, Extending, and Canceling WWAs
 1. When a Warning or advisory no longer adequately describes the phenomenon's expected
 occurrence, issue a completely new warning or advisory with a new number.
 2. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to the expiration of the
 original notice.
 3. Clearly state how the amended or extended WWA affects any previously issued notice.
 4. Cancel WWAs when previously forecast/observed conditions are no longer occurring and are
 not expected to recur.
 5. Lightning Watches are canceled only when the potential for lightning within the next 30
 minutes is no longer forecast. Do not cancel if there is potential for another thunderstorm within
 30 minutes.
 6. Cancel WWs for OBSERVED LIGHTNING when thunderstorms have dissipated or passed
 beyond the area covered by the Warning and lightning is no longer occurring within 5NM of the
 installation. For lightning warning cancellations, include a statement indicating its affect on any
 previously issued warnings, such as "WEATHER WARNING #XX-XXX remains in effect" or
 ―WEATHER WATCH #XX-XXX FOR LIGHTNING REMAINS IN EFFECT.‖
 Note: The EU, or OWS when the EU is off duty, will cancel the lightning warning.

   4.1.11.1. Weather Advisories.
      4.1.11.1.1. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of environmental
      phenomena impacting operations. Weather advisories issued with an advance notice
      requirement are known as a Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA) and advisories issued to
      provide notice of an event’s occurrence are known as an Observed Weather Advisory
      (OWA). EUs will coordinate advisory requirements with the servicing OWS for criteria
      or phenomena for which a local capability to forecast does not exist and will include in
      local Mission Weather Product (MWP) as required.
      4.1.11.2. Characterization units will issue FWAs for specific criteria, where sensing
      capability exists, as documented in the data page.
          4.1.11.2.1. Characterization units will not issue OWAs when the EU is on duty.
          4.1.11.2.2. OWAs that impact flight operations will not be issued when the airfield is
          closed or during non-duty hours, but may be issued for hazards that affect airfield
          operations.
          4.1.11.2.3. When several units require Weather Advisories (WAs) for similar criteria,
          characterization units may consolidate advisories to the extent possible without
          compromising the requirements of supported agencies.
4.2. WWA Backup Procedures.
   4.2.1. When the primary notification system is inoperable, weather agencies issuing WWAs
   will record notification and verification on an AF IMT 3807, Watch/Warning Notification
   and Verification, or on an AF IMT 3806, Weather Watch Advisory Log, as applicable, until a
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                  51


   global database capability is restored. Instructions for completing the AF IMT 3807 and
   3806 are found in attachments 5 and 6 respectively.
   4.2.2. In the event a WWA does not reach the intended agency, the issuing authority is
   responsible for notifying ATC and the Command and Control (C2) authority responsible for
   the Installation Notification and Warning System, (per AFI 10-2501, Emergency
   Management Planning and Operations) as identified in the supported agency data page. In
   the event additional notifications are required, they will be documented in the supported
   agency data page.
4.3. Other Products.
   4.3.1. SWS. OWSs will issue SWS products to notify military decision makers of
   widespread severe weather events affecting military installations serviced by the OWS.
   SWSs will be routinely updated as conditions warrant.
      4.3.1.1. SWS is a stand-alone product normally issued 48-72 hours in advance of the
      forecast event.
      4.3.1.2. SWS will be an A/N product describing the type, onset, duration, and area
      impacted by the event and will be disseminated via common user communications.
      4.3.1.3. SWS may also include graphical depiction of the forecast event.
      4.3.1.4. OWSs will communicate the potential of significant weather events to supported
      WFs (as applicable) for evaluation, prior to dissemination of SWSs to the WF’s
      supported parent/host unit(s).
   4.3.2. Space Weather. Characterization units will host on their webpage, appropriate
   theater-specific space weather products issued by the 2d Weather Squadron (2 WS).
   4.3.3. Volcanic Ash. Characterization units will host appropriate theater-specific volcanic
   ash products on their webpages. The primary source is the WMO volcanic ash advisory
   centers (VAACs). If responsible VAAC cannot produce the volcanic ash products, then the
   2WS will be the primary source. Characterization units will include remarks in text forecasts
   horizontally consistent with the VAAC products where applicable.
   4.3.4. Characterization units may produce additional products to meet WF requirements
   based on specific operational necessities as documented on the data page.
   4.3.5. Characterization units may leverage unique products from other meteorological
   agencies to include US, civilian, and military agencies (e.g., Naval worldwide oceanographic
   products), and foreign nation products. These products will be displayed directly or will
   exist as links to the operational products hosted elsewhere.
   4.3.6. OWSs will provide a summary of severe weather events in their AOR for the Air
   Force Director of Weather and MAJCOM functional managers.
      4.3.6.1. The 1 WXG will consolidate subordinate unit reports into a single submission.
      4.3.6.2. The report will summarize verification data for tornados, damaging wind, and
      damaging hail events and their respective lead-times for the warnings covering those
      events. See example in Figure 4.3.
 52                                                 AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


      4.3.6.3. Report will contain hits, misses, and false alarms at main operating locations,
      missile fields, tethered aerostat sites, and significant locations in the OWS region.

4.4. Disseminating Weather Products
   4.4.1. Characterization units will:
      4.4.1.1. Post all OWS products and those made available from other sources (e.g., Space
      products, leveraged products, etc.) on its Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router
      Network (NIPRnet) webpage, and post mission-essential products on its SECRET
      Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRnet) (if available) and JWICS (if available)
      webpage as needed to meet supported user requirements.
      4.4.1.2. Transmit required products and data via common-user communication and
      satellite communication networks, as required for supported operations in their AOR.
      4.4.1.3. Disseminate TAFs to WFs and other supported users (if applicable) using AF
      dissemination systems. Characterization units may use MAJCOM-approved theater
      specific, or joint dissemination systems as required.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                53


     4.4.1.4. Post a summary of current Characterization unit-issued WWAs to its
     NIPRnet/SIPRnet webpages.

                                            Chapter 5

                            TROPICAL SUPPORT OPERATIONS

5.1. Tropical Support Operations. Tropical cyclones pose a significant threat to lives,
property, and operations. Military decision makers at affected installations are driven by
directive to take time-phased actions to evacuate or shelter personnel and aviation assets that are
largely influenced by forecast elements. Characterization units provide detailed information
based on the official track forecast to facilitate efficient and effective evacuation, survival, and
post event reconstitution activities.       Horizontal consistency between national centers,
characterization units, Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC), and WFs is critical to
successful planning and execution of military operations driven by tropical cyclone events. The
National Hurricane Operations Plan clarifies terms and establishes policies, procedures, and
responsibilities in the Atlantic and the Eastern and Central Pacific westward to 180 degrees
longitude. Pacific Air Force Instruction (PACAFI) 15-101, Weather Support for PACAF,
provides information for the Pacific Ocean west of 180 degrees longitude and the Indian Ocean.
   5.1.1. Procedures. Characterization units will fully exploit on-line forecast resources
   provided by tropical cyclone forecast centers (i.e., the Tropical Prediction Center (Miami,
   FL), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (Honolulu, HI), and the Joint Typhoon Warning
   Center (Pearl Harbor, HI)).
       5.1.1.1. Characterization units will not deviate from the official forecast position, track,
       movement, forecast cone, and maximum wind speed associated with a tropical cyclone
       except for the following.
           5.1.1.1.1. Warnings and advisories issued for feeder band convective activity (away
           from the storm center) may exceed forecast maximum wind for that time period.
           5.1.1.1.2. Characterization units may adjust forecast wind speeds if terrain, foliage,
           and land use data for an affected location indicates higher or lower wind speeds than
           originally forecasted.
       5.1.1.2. OWSs will depict tropical cyclone centers, and caveat that moderate to severe
       flight hazards are implied in and near tropical cyclones. The non-convective flight
       hazards in areas where synoptic-scale features interact with the tropical cyclone will be
       depicted on graphical charts.
       5.1.1.3. Characterization units will perform METWATCH responsibilities and serve as
       the primary liaison between the tropical cyclone forecast centers and EUs.
       5.1.1.4. Queries for tropical storm information from non-operational sources will be
       directed to publically available products from responsible forecast agencies (National
       Weather Service (NWS), National Hurricane Center (NHC), etc).
5.2. Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product (TC-TAP). The purpose of the TC-TAP is
to provide a standardized product for exploitation units to use in assisting installation
commanders and Emergency Management personnel in making decisions on the evacuation and
sheltering of aircraft and personnel, and on other mitigation actions.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                 55


   5.2.1. OWSs will produce a coordinated TC-TAP for supported locations within their area of
   responsibility (AOR) expected to experience sustained winds ≥ 35-knots during the next 96
   hours as a result of a tropical cyclone. Characterization units will provide site-specific TC-
   TAP information as requested by exploitation units.
   5.2.2. The TC-TAP will contain, at a minimum, the following:
      5.2.2.1. Time and date product was produced and the NHC/CPHC/Joint Typhoon
      Warning Center (JTWC) bulletin number/ identifier used to create the product.
      5.2.2.2. Onset and duration of sustained 35-knot and 50-knot winds.
      5.2.2.3. Peak wind and time of occurrence, including gusts.
      5.2.2.4. Onset and duration of operationally significant (locally determined) crosswinds,
      including gusts for the primary instrumented runway. Use 25-knot crosswinds as the
      default.
      5.2.2.5. Closest point of approach of the storm relative to the installation.
      5.2.2.6. Forecast cone product.
5.3. Preparation/Dissemination of TC-TAP. OWSs will:
   5.3.1. Use approved software applications.
      5.3.1.1. The standardized software for producing TC threat assessments is the tropical
      cyclone software contained in the baseline OWS Production System.
      5.3.1.2. The TC-TAP will be valid through a minimum of 96 hours and updated as new
      information is received from the NHC, CPHC, and/or JTWC.
   5.3.2. Develop procedures to expeditiously disseminate the TC-TAP information to all
   applicable organizations.     Ensure TC-TAP information is consistent from initial
   dissemination through actual posting of the information on the webpage.
 56                                                    AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                              CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS

6.1. Continuity of Operations. Characterization units must be prepared to continue mission-
essential functions without significant interruption during a national security emergency or other
disruptive conditions, such as major equipment/communications outages or evacuations. To
ensure continuity of operations during these situations, units will develop processes to use
alternate equipment/systems, operate from alternate locations, or arrange transfer of critical
functions to other organizations. Units aligned to provide continuity of operations support for
another unit must be capable of providing the support and be fully prepared to assume the
responsibility in minimum time. Characterization units will:
   6.1.1. Establish and formally document continuity of operations processes and procedures.
   6.1.2. Provide a copy of the continuity of operations documents to all organizations tasked to
   provide backup support.
   6.1.3. Make continuity of operations documents available to supported units upon request
   IAW parent MAJCOM policies and procedures.
   6.1.4. Review and update continuity of operations processes and procedures, consistent with
   MAJCOM continuity of operations policies or as necessary, to reflect substantive changes in
   operations.
   6.1.5. Exercise continuity of operations processes quarterly. Real world events meet this
   requirement if properly evaluated and documented, to include lessons learned.
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                               57

                       SPACE WEATHER CHARACTERIZATION

7.1. General. Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect the near-Earth space
environment, satellites, and ground based systems used by the military and civil sectors. Space
weather is a consequence of the behavior of the Sun, the nature of Earth’s magnetic field and
atmosphere, and our location in the solar system. Just as AFW organizations characterize,
exploit, and tailor the terrestrial weather for military operations, they have the same
responsibility for space weather.
7.2. 2d Weather Squadron (2 WS). 2 WS is the Air Force’s characterization unit for space
weather. 2 WS will:
   7.2.1. Operate the Air Force’s Solar Electro Optical Observing Network.
   7.2.2. Maintain space weather modeling capabilities.
   7.2.3. Provide event level alerts and warnings to DoD organizations.
   7.2.4. Provide routine bulletins, notices, and data which characterize the current state of
   space weather.
   7.2.5. Work closely with other national space weather partners to leverage available
   resources to characterize space weather.
   7.2.6. Coordinate space anomaly assessments with the 21st Operations Support Squadron
   Weather Flight (21 OSS/OSW) and 614th Air and Space Operations Center Weather
   Specialty Team (614 AOC/CODW).
   7.2.7. Maintain a Space Weather Catalog that describes all the space weather products
   issued.
   7.2.8. Respond to space weather support requests submitted through the SAR process.
   7.2.9. Upon notification of a space anomaly, save all pertinent space weather data necessary
   to completely reconstruct the environmental picture at the time of the anomaly.

Terms
Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)— A strategic weather center at Offutt AFB NE,
providing atmospheric data and analysis/forecast products required by the regional OWSs and
the WFs worldwide. AFWA provides the centralized repository for global observations and
forecasts that are data based at AFWA and, in turn, disseminated to DoD weather data users
worldwide. In addition to global observations and forecasts collected from worldwide sources,
AFWA collects meteorological satellite data from multiple sources. Based on global analysis of
available data, AFWA creates global analysis and forecast products to meet the forecast
requirements of its supported users.
Analysis and Forecast Program (AFP)— A systematic and consistent approach to weather
forecasting. The AFP identifies techniques and tools used to forecast individual weather
AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                                   63


elements, describes requirements for locally prepared work charts/composites, and explains
refinements and application of centralized products.
Climatology— The historical records of weather conditions measured or observed at a specific
location is knows as climatology. Some data go back over 100 but generally a 10- to 25-year
history is more common. Climatology is useful in planning operations beyond 5 to 7 days. It
usually describes the average (or mean) conditions such as high and low temperatures and
extremes.
Desired Lead Time (DLT)— The total amount of time required to disseminate a forecast WWA
from the supporting OWS through the local dissemination tree to all affected end-users plus the
amount of advance notice a supported organization requires to complete mandatory protective
actions before the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
False Alarm— When a lightning watch, weather warning, or forecast weather advisory is issued
and the specified criteria do not occur during the specified valid time.
Forecaster—In-the-Loop (FITL) - Term covering a range of human activities to ensure
forecast
information is meteorologically sound. FITL activities span a broad spectrum from a basic
review and editing of information to a detailed production process resulting in forecaster—
created weather products such as graphical forecast products or mission specific environmental
impacts decision aids.
FITL Graphics (Standard)— A suite of weather products depicting standardized criteria,
created by
forecasters in an Operational Weather Squadron for a specific geographic region. These products
represent the sum of the forecasting activities for basic weather parameters necessary for creation
of
mission execution forecasts.
Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA)— A weather advisory issued when the supported user
requires advance notification of an impending weather condition with sufficient time to allow for
protective actions.
Forecast Worksheet— Tool used to document, track, and evaluate past and future weather
events. It may contain forecast rules-of-thumb, question and answer discriminators, decision
logic trees, etc., to help develop a forecast.
Horizontal Consistency— Weather data provided in one product that is consistent to data
provided in another product for the same area and time. For example, TAFs must be consistent
with all other products, including the current observation, weather warnings, weather advisories,
lightning watches, etc. Elements within each TAF must also be consistent, for example, if heavy
snow showers are forecast, the visibility will be restricted appropriately. Strong gusty winds or
hail would generally be expected if severe thunderstorms were forecast. Product consistency
prevents supported users from receiving conflicting information.
ICAO Identifier— A specifically authorized 4-letter identifier assigned to a location. The ICAO
is not to be confused with the Routing Identifier used by the Automatic Digital Weather Switch
to transmit addressed messages including Automated Response to Queries. Routing IDs may not
always match a station ICAO and can have 5 characters.
 64                                                    AFMAN15-129V1 6 DECEMBER 2011


Installation Data Page— A document defining the specific environmental support
requirements, technical data, reference material, and contact information for each organization
receiving TAF and WWA support from the OWS.
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)— A United Nations organization
specializing in international aviation and navigation.
Issue Time— The time when an agency is notified of a watch, warning, or advisory. When more
than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up
notifications are not considered when determining issue time.
Joint Operational Area Forecast (JOAF)— The JOAF, as approved by the Joint
Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Officer (JMO), is the official planning forecast for
all components of the joint force. It is issued at the Joint Force Commander (JFC) level to ensure
that all components are aware of what the JFC is using to plan the coordinated battle. Significant
deviations from the JOAF will be coordinated with the JMO. Components and individual units
will use the JOAF as the point of departure to tailor METOC information and to develop tailored
mission execution forecasts. The JOAF may include a forecast database when needed for tactical
decisions used in planning.
Lead Weather Unit— The weather unit having overall responsibility for coordinating air and
space
weather support, issuing the weather support LOI, and providing or arranging forecasts for the
Controlling MWP.
Main Operating Location— For the purposes of this instruction, a main operating location is a
military installation operated by the US Department of Defense for which the primary flying
mission is conducted by a DoD unit and the service is the primary agent responsible for Air
Traffic Control. Generally, main operating locations serviced by an OWS are designated as Air
Force Bases, Air Reserve Bases, Air National Guard Bases, or Army Air Fields.
Mesoscale— Systems which vary in size horizontally from 1 to 500 nautical miles (2 to 926
kilometers) and have a duration from tens of minutes to several hours (e.g., low level jets, squall
lines, thunderstorms, clear air turbulence, or land-sea breezes).
METWATCH (Meteorological Watch)— A deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial
weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to
identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and
determining courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and
designated agencies notified. Strategic and Operational level weather units typically conduct
METWATCH activities.
Military Operating Area Forecast (MOAF)— A forecast guidance product that provides the
weather or space environmental conditions for a specific area in which military operations are
occurring.
Missed Lightning Watch, Weather Warning, or Forecast Weather Advisory— When
specified lightning watch, weather warning, or forecast weather advisory criteria occur but a
corresponding lightning watch, weather warning, or forecast weather advisory is not issued for
the event.

Mission Weather Product (MWP)— Any weather product or group of weather products
generated by an Exploitation Unit that is integrated into the military decision making process.
MWPs may be planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP)— A systematic, repeatable process for tailoring
weather products and forecasting mission-limiting meteorological parameters and providing
decision quality environmental information for an operational end user. This process provides a
basic framework for fusing perishable meteorological data, operational and strategic forecast
products, and an understanding of the supported user’s tactics which will be applied to any
mission their supported user may undertake. The MEFP describes an end-to-end process
incorporating management steps, forecast development, mission meteorological watch, and post-
mission analysis of the information provided.
Mission Profile— describes a mission’s operating platform(s), route, flight level(s), weapons
systems, equipment, target(s), tactics/techniques/procedures (TTPs), and timing.
MISSIONWATCH (Mission Meteorological Watch)— A deliberate process for monitoring
terrestrial weather or the space environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors.
The
MISSIONWATCH process identifies and alerts decision—makers to changes affecting
mission success.
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)— The processes involved in representing the
atmospheric
system with fundamental mathematical equations, which can be solved in discrete time steps to
achieve a numerical forecast of the parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, humidity) used to
define the state of the atmosphere.
Objective Verification— A set of predetermined meteorological criteria used to determine the
accuracy of a forecast product.
Observed Weather Advisory (OWA)— A weather advisory issued when a particular weather
event first occurs and the supported user does not require advanced notification of the observed
weather phenomenon.
Observed Weather Warning— A weather warning issued when a particular weather event first
occurs and the supported user does not require advanced notification of the observed weather
phenomenon.
Operational Risk Management— The systematic process of identifying hazards, assessing
risks, analyzing risk control measures, making control decisions, implementing risk controls, and
supervising and reviewing the process.
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)— A characterization unit comprised of management,
technician, and training personnel responsible for providing regional weather support. Their
mission is to produce fine-scale tailored weather forecast products and services to supported
users within their area of responsibility (AOR).
Pilot Report (PIREP)— A report of in-flight weather provided by an aircrew member.

Severe Thunderstorm— A thunderstorm presenting a threat to lives or property that requires
agencies to enhance resource protection measures. Generally, thunderstorms producing hail
greater than or equal to ¾ inch diameter and/or surface wind greater than or equal to 50 knots.
Severe Weather— Any weather condition that poses a hazard to property or life.
Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP)— Actions taken by a weather unit to enhance the
unit’s response capability during a severe weather event. Actions include, but are not limited to,
recalling personnel or reallocating resources from other tasks to provide focused support during a
severe weather event.
Special Weather Statement (SWS)— An environmental characterization providing advance
notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions offering potential to affect military
installation(s) in a specified geographic area. Special Weather Statements are provided by
characterization units to improve situational awareness and facilitate risk management activities
by military decision makers.
Subjective Verification— A review to determine meteorological soundness by comparing the
product in question with other weather data and products.
Support Assistance Request (SAR)— Used to request specialized weather, space
environmental, or climatological support from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), 14 WS,
MAJCOMs, or Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS).
Synoptic Scale— Systems which vary in size horizontally from 100 to 1,000 nautical miles and
have a duration of tens of hours to several days (e.g., migratory high and low pressure systems,
frontal systems, or tropical cyclones).

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) - Is a standard text forecast containing the cloud cover,
cloud heights, and visibility for general flight rule conditions (IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3,
General Flight Rules; and AR 95-1, Flight Regulations), as well as wind, altimeter, and other
weather parameters needed to sustain the landing and takeoff of aircraft.
Valid Time (VT)— The time in which a weather watch, warning, or advisory is in effect. The
start time of the VT is when the phenomenon is expected to first occur. The end time of the VT
is when the phenomenon is expected to cease and no longer occur.
Weather Advisory (WA)— A special product notifying an end user when an established
environmental condition effecting operations is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Warning (WW)— A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
established
weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is occurring or is
expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining environmental
threats and are used by operational commanders to make resource protection decisions.
Weather Watch (WATCH)— A special notice to notify installation personnel/supported units
of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or
property. Weather Watches indicate a potential for environmental threats and are used by
installation personnel/supported units to make force protection and risk management decisions.
