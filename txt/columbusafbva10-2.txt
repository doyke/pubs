                   COLUMBUS AFB PROTECTIVE ACTIONS
“LOCKDOWN” – THIS TERM IS USED WHEN AN “ACTIVE SHOOTER” THREAT EXISTS.
 Proceed to the nearest room and take cover. Shut and lock the door. If outside, find an area that will shield and protect you as a potential target. Refer to
CAFB Integrated Defense Plan (IDP) 31-101, Annex L, Appendix 2.

“SHELTER-IN-PLACE” – THIS TERM IS USED WHEN AN AIRBORNE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL
(HAZMAT) OR CBRN THREAT EXISTS.
 Shut down HVAC, proceed to a designated shelter-in-place (SIP) room, and seal the windows, doors, and vents with plastic to prevent the hazard from
entering. Refer to facility SIP checklists and AFTTP 3-2.33, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation CBRN Defense.

“SEEK SHELTER” – THIS TERM IS NORMALLY USED FOR SEVERE WEATHER WARNINGS ISSUED ON
CAFB.
 Take immediate shelter where you are. Details of the warning and any additional guidance will be announced over Giant Voice and included in AtHoc
messages, i.e. Tornado Warning. Refer to CAFB Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2 checklists for further information.

“STAY PUT” – THIS TERM IS USED WHEN THE IMMEDIATE DANGER OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION HAS
PASSED, BUT PERSONNEL ARE REQUIRED TO REMAIN INDOORS.
 During “stay put” status, the main base populace should remain indoors while first responders assess the safety of the base property and identify safe routes of
travel in order to keep personnel clear of hazardous areas. Expect further guidance via Giant Voice, AtHoc messages, Crisis Action Team (CAT) Directives, etc.

“ALL CLEAR” – THIS TERM IS USED TO NOTIFY PERSONNEL THEY ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO
REMAIN INDOORS.
 Transition to “all clear” status will be dependent upon a safety assessment by first responders and any actions required to secure any hazardous areas on the
base property. Transition to “all clear” status may include restrictions on routes of travel and hazardous areas to avoid.
