                               GENERAL INFORMATION
                                          Overview


Introduction           This handbook serves as a guide for applying the Instructional
                       System Development (ISD) process during design of instruction
                       for device-based aircrew training. This handbook follows the
                       principles of ISD.


Background             This handbook supplements background in learning theory and
                       instructional design theory as applied to complex integrated
                       training, particularly in full mission simulation. The context of this
                       handbook comes from several decades of aircrew training
                       research and applied theory documented in an unpublished
                       manuscript of Dr. William D. Spears. The concepts, though
                       abstract, attempt to explain the process of learning as a new
                       student takes individual tasks and begins to integrate them into
                       complex aircraft operation, mission qualification, and then
                       continued combat readiness.


Expanded use of        The complexity and operating costs of Air Force aircraft and
training devices       weapon systems, together with the technological advances made
                       in flight simulation and training devices, have led to expanded
                       use of training devices and simulators in the training and
                       performance evaluation of aircrew members. Properly designed
                       and used, these devices provide in-depth training and a high
                       transfer of skills, knowledge and behavior to improve aircrew
                       performance.


Definition of ATD      Aircrew training devices (ATDs) are used to prepare aircrew
                       members for the actual performance of flight duties. ATDs
                       include cockpit familiarization trainers (CFT), cockpit procedures
                       trainers (CPT), operational flight trainers (OFT), part-task trainers
                       (PTT), and weapon system trainers (WST).

Purpose             The purpose of this handbook is to draw to the attention of the
                    training device and instructional design team the basic concepts
                    that lead to integrated skill performance and the design of training
                    devices within a total training system. This handbook also
                    addresses the use of aircrew training devices, provides guidance
                    on developing instruction for them, and offers suggested
                    procedures to follow when aircrew training devices are selected
                    for training of integrated activities.


Who should use      This handbook addresses the question: "How do you apply ISD
this volume?        theory and learning theory in design of aircrew training devices
                    for total training systems?" But is this handbook for you? The

Updated ISD model       Figure 1 shows the Air Force ISD model as it appears in AFMAN
                        36-2234. In the model, the system functions and ISD phases are
                        embedded in the quality improvement process. Refer to AFMAN
                        36-2234 for detailed discussion of ISD.

                        Figure 1 Updated Air Force ISD Model




Basis for ATD           The ISD process of media selection should identify the integrated
design                  activities and the training devices most appropriate for training
                        those activities (AFMAN 36-2234). The ATD should be designed
                        to effectively train those integrated activities.


Multi-disciplinary      The use of training devices is different from the past concept of
team required           replicating the aircraft. There are known capabilities that only a
                        training device can support, such as repeated reset and
                        predetermined conditions. The context or "big picture" in which
                        the training device is used should also guide the design. The
                        functions covered by the design should trace back to the training,
                        support, and operations requirements. The concept of design is
                        for training rather than for engineering simulation. The design will
                        require a multi-disciplinary team approach.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 7       1 November 2002                                         6



New concerns          Today's concerns include not only classroom instructions, but
                      instructions that are exported to the job site using new delivery
                      methods and technologies. New automated instructional
                      development tools can make instructional development more
                      efficient.


Building quality      Building quality in instructional systems is a key concern. Other
                      concerns include the concept of totally integrated training
                      systems and how to use the ISD process in different applications
                      such as systems acquisition, education, aircrew training, and
                      technical training programs.


Evolution of ISD to   Principles of ISD have evolved over the past three decades from
meet complex          ISD as a tool for applying behavioral learning principles to
technology            classroom instruction. It began with models of step-by-step
                      procedures designed to enable anyone to develop instruction and
                      evolved to sophisticated models concerned with complex
                      technological as well as cognitive and attitudinal issues that
                      require experienced instructional design experts to sort out.


Experts               Today's instructional development, updating, and revisions
required              require expertise not only in instructional design but also in media
                      (e.g., computer hardware and software, video, interactive
                      systems), cognitive learning theory, and vastly complex content
                      areas. The scope of required expertise has gone beyond the
                      capabilities of the single instructional design expert and now
                      requires a team of experts from several disciplines.


Introducing expert    Attempts are being made to use expert system techniques to help
systems               both the experts and novice instructional developers cope with
                      contemporary advancements. If successful, these techniques will
                      impact instructional design in fundamental ways, such as by
                      providing ISD expert system tools.


Adaptability          The new model of the ISD process reflects the movement away
                      from rigorously applied procedures and emphasizes adaptability
                      to changing environments. These concerns have become
                      cornerstones of the Air Force ISD process.

FAA qualification      The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the major
and SIMCERT            command team for simulator certification (SIMCERT) have
                       qualification and certification programs designed to ensure that
                       training systems and devices provide an accurate, credible
                       environment for training in specific events.

                       Terminal proficiency objectives are developed on the basis of the
                       ISD training in specific events. The suite of aircrew training
                       devices is designed to meet the terminal objectives allocated to
                       them and to prepare for meeting the remainder of the terminal
                       objectives completed in the aircraft.

                       The FAA has defined in FAR Part 121, Appendix H, levels of
                       simulators by alpha characters, with numeric designations for
                       training devices. The Air Force has defined SIMCERT in AFP 36-
                       2211.

                                       Background

Past difficulties      In the past, application of ISD to aircrew training device design
                       has been difficult. The traditional structural analysis approach of
                       ISD works relatively well with training in how to operate and
                       maintain systems and how to respond to the status indicators of
                       the system, whether normal or emergency procedures. At this
                       level, the tasks can be broken down and then arranged in a
                       hierarchical relationship.


Structured analysis    When the tasks become more complex and shift from a specific
approach               objective per task to multiple objectives combined to achieve a
breakdown              common goal, there is a breakdown in the structural analysis
                       approach. Dynamics such as those in crew interactions or
                       interactions with systems outside the aircraft (especially if hostile
                       or unknown) have been shortchanged. Previously, critical
                       requirements were not identified; particularly requirements
                       beyond initial qualification training.


Complex activities     These complex, integrated activities were often left to a skillful
                       instructor and the learn-as-you-go practice of the crew, especially
                       in continuation training. "Mission-ready" took on new meaning
                       when the crew was able to practice a full combat scenario in a
                       weapon system trainer. Something more was needed.

                                 Lessons Learned

Training system      Lessons on how to integrate aircrew training simulation into a
reviews              total training system took time (Bills, 1987; Nullmeyer and
                     Rockaway, 1984). Training effectiveness studies led to reviews
                     of training systems.


Model aircrew        A model aircrew training system (MATS) was derived (Fishburne,
system               Spears, and Williams, 1987) providing a method for introducing
                     new training technology. It required a review of the total system
                     perspective, keeping in mind the entire life cycle of crewmember
                     development through the training system.


Training to          Certain tasks were certified as trainable to proficiency in
proficiency in       simulation, allowing instructors to better focus their attention in
simulation           the operational aircraft. This focus was on events that could only
                     be completed in flight. Criterion proficiency of an event first
                     achieved in simulation results in a significant reduction in the
                     number of attempts to attain proficiency in the aircraft. The
                     complex training capability of full weapon system simulation
                     required considerable preparation in lower-level media in order to
                     gain the benefit of the training capability in a full-mission/full-crew
                     environment.


Techniques of        Techniques of instruction in simulation were shown as different
instruction in       from those used in flight. Caro (1978) noted that instructors could
simulation           be taught WST features such as adaptive training, performance
                     playback, backward chaining, and automatic performance
                     monitoring. They could be shown instructional techniques such
                     as discovery learning or individualized proficiency advancement.
                     They should be given an opportunity to practice simulator
                     instruction before beginning with a new student. Even proficiency
                     assessment, usually by the expert judgment of instructors,
                     needed standardization.

Updated need for       An update of the Air Force ISD process was needed to address
integrated skills      training development for integrated skills and media design,
                       particularly training device design, within a total training system.
                       This enterprise should be a comprehensive one, incorporating all
                       categories of learning. Gagné and Merrill (1990) defined an
                       enterprise as an integration of multiple objectives, which come
                       together in pursuit of a comprehensive purpose or common goal.

                       The human process of learning is complex and is integrated in
                       real life. This being the case, then the application of ISD must
                       also be an integrated approach.


Advances from          Capabilities for simulation have advanced. For example, visual
computing power        display systems once driven by a room full of computers can now
explosion              be operated on a single supercomputer. The addition of
                       computing power to advances in software design has widened
                       the range of effective and more efficient training devices and
                       simulators.

                     USE OF AIRCREW TRAINING DEVICES
                                         Overview


Introduction          This chapter presents the principles for use of aircrew training
                      devices. These principles will not cover functional requirements
                      of aircrew training device capabilities. There are no mechanical
                      procedures for application of learning principles to aircrew
                      training device instruction. Since these are not categorical rules,
                      judgment is required. A foundation for structuring such judgment
                      is provided in this chapter.


Value of ATD          The ultimate value of ATD training depends on the extent to
                      which skills learned during that training will transfer to the aircraft.
                      Three factors affecting this transfer should be considered:

                         Cue development
                         Cue and response discrimination
                         Generalization


Cues                  Being able to interpret cues and respond to them appropriately is
                      the essence of aircrew skills. Thus, ATD instruction should focus
                      on teaching aircrew members to learn cues (i.e., the meaning of
                      physical stimuli), and to derive pertinent information from them so
                      that the proper response can be made.


Response              The aircrew members must learn to discriminate (i.e., recognize
discrimination and    and select) the cues and responses appropriate to a given task,
generalization        and must then generalize these to situations different from the
                      situations in which these were learned.


ATD training          Although the focus of all aircrew instruction is on teaching the
advantage             discriminations underlying aircraft performance, ATDs have a
                      distinct training advantage over aircraft in that discriminations can
                      be taught in ATDs at times and in ways that promote the most
                      efficient development of skills.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7       1 November 2002                                         13



Cue information      It is the cue information available in an ATD, rather than stimulus
criterion            fidelity per se, that should be the criterion for deciding what skills
                     or skill components are taught in it. Because transfer is based on
                     cue information, all valid cue interpretations learned in an ATD
                     can be generalized in both vehicles. Thus, it is important that
                     ATD training focus on the generalizable meanings of the cues
                     they can provide.


Using ATDs to their Transfer depends on meanings, whether ATD stimuli and
full potential      responses are realistic or not. "Similarity" explanations of
                     transfer, upon which many conceptions of ATD training value
                     rely, focus only upon the physical similarity of training devices to
                     aircraft, and upon their capability to provide for task performance
                     as it is actually done in the aircraft. When ATD training objectives
                     are determined by dependence on physical and task fidelity,
                     ATDs cannot be used to their full potential.


Description of       Mediation is a complex psychological process, which permits
mediation process    performance in devices of various fidelity levels to acquire
                     meanings similar to the meanings of corresponding performance
                     in aircraft.


Definition of        Mediation is the intermediary process that provides meaning for
mediation            the situation at hand when generalizing from previously learned
                     discriminations. Mediation comes between, or mediates, the acts
                     of sensing a stimulus and responding. Thus, through mediation,
                     ATD training is not limited to device-aircraft similarity.


Mediation and ATD    Through mediational processes such as language and mental
effectiveness        rehearsal, the effectiveness of all ATDs is enhanced.

                                    Section A
                                 Cognitive Training

What it is            Cognitive training consists of learning about:

                         Cues and responses that must be discriminated.
                         Purposes of those discriminations.
                         Meanings of symbols that will substitute for aircraft cues and
                         responses in ATDs.
                         Subtle differences between ATDs and aircraft that must be
                         noted before transferring to aircraft.


When it takes place   Effective and efficient ATD training depends upon preparation for
                      learning. That preparation takes place in classrooms, briefings,
                      discussions, ATDs and aircraft, and in a variety of other formal
                      and informal settings.


What it involves      Much of this preparation involves cognitive processes, i.e.,
                      thoughts, ideas, mental images, and concepts that are both
                      verbal and nonverbal. It basically consists of the cognitive
                      foundations upon which ATD training, and ultimately, aircrew
                      performance rests.


Principles            The following principles apply to the cognitive component of ATD
applicable to         training:
cognitive
component                A meaningful context should be provided for the learning of
                         skilled performance in the ATD.
                         Mediation should be employed systematically in teaching cue
                         and response discriminations.
                         When students are practicing in the ATD, they should be
                         instructed to think about the meaning and effects of their
                         actions with respect to requirements for performance in the
                         aircraft.
                         Briefing for ATD sessions should anticipate and guard against
                         a student's relating what he or she does during ATD practice
                         only to the device itself.
                         Recognizing that transfer is a mediational process, a major
                         goal for ATD training should be to exploit the types and uses
                         of mediation that maximize transfer.

                                      Section B
                                      Feedback

What it is            Feedback refers to information that informs a learner about the
                      results or effects of the learner's actions.


Roles during ATD      Feedback has two important roles during ATD training:
training
                         To maintain a student's motivation to learn.
                         To inform the student of the appropriateness or
                         inappropriateness of interpretations of cues and responses to
                         those cues.


Principles            The following principles apply to the role of feedback in ATD
applicable to         training:
feedback
                         Feedback determines the nature and extent of discriminations
                         that will be learned.
                         Feedback should focus on specific aspects of cognitive,
                         perceptual, and motor actions that must be discriminated.
                         Augmented and supplemental feedback should be used only
                         when task-intrinsic feedback cannot be discriminated, and its
                         use should be specifically for the purpose of teaching cue and
                         response discriminations intrinsic to the aircraft task.
                         Timely supplemental or augmented feedback should be used
                         to signal the availability of intrinsic feedback.
                         When intrinsic feedback is needed as a signal for a
                         subsequent action, ATDs must provide it quickly enough to
                         avoid disrupting the action.
                         Feedback will help maintain student motivation if the feedback
                         ensures progress.

                                         Section C
                                         Guidance

What it is              Guidance is the directing of a learner's actions toward a desired
                        goal. The actions being guided may be thought processes,
                        physical movements, oral communications, selection of cues, or
                        processing of cue information.


When it happens         Guidance is involved every time an instructor comments to a
                        student about what the student should do, remember, or think
                        about.


How it helps            Properly used, guidance helps in the learning of aircrew skills in
                        two ways:

                           It speeds learning when it identifies desirable cues and
                           responses that the student cannot recognize unaided.
                           By identifying correct cues and responses, it reduces the
                           likelihood that inappropriate cues will be used and incorrect
                           responses made. Thus, it helps prevent learning of erroneous
                           actions that would eventually have to be unlearned.


Principles applied      The following principles apply to the use of guidance in ATD
to guidance             training:

                           The purpose of guidance is to focus the student's attention on
                           correct cue and response discriminations and to avoid
                           incorrect cue interpretations and actions.
                           To avoid dependence on guidance, it should not be used
                           when the student is able to make the required discrimination
                           without help.
                           Contrasting, through guidance, desirable with undesirable cue
                           interpretations and responses can highlight critical cues and
                           responses when the discriminations to be learned are difficult.
                           When feedback is used primarily in a guiding role, it should
                           occur as soon as practical after the action, and the student
                           should repeat the action without undue delay.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 7      1 November 2002                                      18



Principles applied         Guidance should be used during advanced training when
to guidance                needed to focus students' attention on new cue and response
(Continued)                discriminations, or on previously mastered discriminations that
                           can be generalized to new tasks.
                           Guidance can be valuable for experienced aircrews when their
                           skills have deteriorated appreciably, or when it can define or
                           clarify standards for performance.
                           Guidance should focus on aspects of ATD skill performance
                           that are transferable to aircraft, or that can promote transfer.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 7       1 November 2002                                          19



                                     Section D
                          Priorities for ATD Scheduling

Scheduling            Scheduling ATDs for training must be responsive to two types of
priorities            priorities. One type involves different kinds of training (e.g.,
                      combat crew training vs. continuation training vs. instructor
                      training). The second involves different training needs within a
                      training group (e.g., aircraft control vs. emergency procedures vs.
                      low-level navigator).


How to establish      It is desirable to establish priorities for training tasks on the basis
priorities            of the kinds of training that can be done best with each available
                      device. Alternative resources, including aircraft, should be
                      identified for each task to be trained, and the relative
                      effectiveness and efficiency of each resource estimated. Trade-
                      offs can then be made between priorities and alternative ATDs,
                      with cost helping to determine the trade-offs.


Principles            The following principles apply to priorities for ATD scheduling:
applicable to
scheduling               Priorities for scheduling ATD use should be developed
                         systematically, considering the needs for serving different
                         groups as well as the relative needs within each group.
                         ATD training priorities should optimize the effectiveness and
                         efficiency of all available devices.
                         Course syllabuses should reflect training priorities and identify
                         alternative resources.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7       1 November 2002                                        20



                                  Section E
                      Sequencing ATD and Other Training

Considerations for    The contribution of ATD training varies, depending on how it is
integrating ATD       integrated with aircraft and academic training. Four
with other training   considerations are relevant:

                         ATD training can provide concrete meaning for theoretical
                         knowledge and timely practice in applying that knowledge.
                         Academic instruction can sometimes be more meaningful if it
                         follows ATD practice.
                         Transfer of ATD training to aircraft often requires practice in
                         the aircraft soon after ATD learning.
                         Some ATD instruction will be more meaningful if it is preceded
                         by exposure to the tasks in the aircraft.


Principles            The following principles apply to sequencing ATD training relative
applicable to         to academic and aircraft training:
sequencing
                         ATD practice should be designed and scheduled to provide
                         experience in the use of knowledge and concepts previously
                         learned at the verbal level in academic training.
                         When students have not had experiences needed for
                         academic concepts to be understood, ATD experience of an
                         appropriate kind should precede or be concurrent with
                         academic training in those concepts.
                         ATD and aircraft training should be sequenced as needed to
                         maximize the contributions of both.
                         The experience level of a student should help determine the
                         length of delays among related academic, ATD, and aircraft
                         experiences.

                       Allocation of Training Among ATDs

Developing a plan      ATDs can vary in effectiveness and efficiency for teaching a
for using ATDs         particular skill. In such cases, a plan for the use of specific ATDs
                       should reflect the capabilities of individual devices. In addition,
                       occasions arise when two or more different types of ATDs are
                       available and are essentially equivalent in value for teaching a
                       particular skill. If so, factors other than device capabilities can be
                       considered in their use.


Principles             The following principles apply to the allocation of training among
applicable to          ATDs:
allocation
                          For any task to be trained in an ATD, key cues and responses
                          related to the task should be represented meaningfully.
                          If precise visual-motor skills are to be learned, precise
                          performance must be practiced.
                          The experience levels of students should be considered when
                          allocating training to ATDs with differing capabilities.
                          Training should be allocated to individual ATDs according to
                          their effectiveness and efficiency in training portions of tasks.
                          Training can be allocated to an ATD with characteristics
                          different from a particular target aircraft, provided that the
                          skills being practiced are not specific to the aircraft.
                          When two or more ATDs are equally useful for training a
                          particular set of skills, allocation of training to a device should
                          consider relative cost, overall program efficiency, and
                          preferences of instructors and students.

                                     Section G
                            Organizing Tasks for Practice

Important points        A consideration in the design and conduct of any ATD training
for organizing          activity is the need to organize the tasks to be learned into
tasks for practice      practice sessions. Whether motor skills, procedural skills,
                        communication skills, or more typically, a combination of skill
                        types are to be learned, two points stand out:

                           Cue and response complexity should be reduced in early
                           stages of development of a skill.
                           Skills should eventually be practiced in situations representing
                           the full complexity of operational performance.


Questions to            Two questions follow the above points:
answer when
organizing tasks           How should tasks be separated for practice so that their
for practice               complexity can be reduced while learning the component
                           tasks?
                           How can training ensure the eventual integration of tasks
                           learned separately?


Principles              The following principles apply to organizing tasks for practice in
applicable to           ATD sessions:
organizing tasks
for practice               Tasks should be separated, or grouped, for practice to reduce
                           cue and response complexity (simplify) early in training, then
                           provide opportunities to put the "simple" in context of the more
                           complex "big picture."
                           Complex tasks should be separated into parts, or subtasks, if
                           it makes the parts easier to learn.
                           Tasks should be separated from each other during early
                           learning if separation aids cue discrimination.
                           Tasks separated for practice should be divided so as to
                           maintain integrity of the parts.
                           When tasks normally occur together or in a contiguous
                           sequence, but are practiced separately, some cues and
                           responses related to the omitted tasks should appear at
                           appropriate times during practice.

                                 Section H
                     Duration and Frequency of Practice

Factors of concern   Optimum practice schedules depend on a number of factors that
                     vary with the tasks being trained, when they occur during the
                     training program, and the relative skill level of the aircrew
                     students. The factors of primary concern are:

                        Effects of interference.
                        Level of previous learning.
                        Amount forgotten during training.


Principles           The following principles apply to the duration and frequency of
applicable to        practice in ATDs:
duration and
frequency of            ATD practice sessions should be of a duration and frequency
practice
                        that permit steady progress during learning.
                        Schedules for practice should prevent intertask interference
                        as much as possible.
                        Practice during task acquisition should not continue to the
                        point that a student becomes unduly bored or fatigued.
                        As skill mastery progresses, practice sessions can be both
                        longer and more frequent.
                        Practice sessions should be frequent enough to prevent
                        unacceptable deterioration of skills.

                          Chapter 3
       BASIC CONCEPTS LEADING TO SKILLED PERFORMANCE
                                        Overview

Introduction          This chapter presents basic concepts leading to an
                      understanding of how to guide training design so that it results in
                      skilled performance of integrated activities. These concepts have
                      broader application than aircrew training device design. The
                      human process of learning is complex. The methods for
                      preparing instruction have grown out of an attempt to understand
                      this complex process.


Instruction and       Regardless of how well instruction agrees with the human
learning              process of learning, instruction will continue to take place.
                      People will be taught or they will find out on their own what they
                      need to know and how to do what they need to do in order to
                      meet the demands placed upon them. In the course of events,
                      unforeseen detours will be made, unneeded costs will be
                      incurred, and in some cases there will be unnecessary failures.


Attempts to           A body of psychologists and educators has attempted to better
improve the           understand this complex process of human learning and to derive
learning process      methods for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of
                      corresponding instruction. This understanding starts with the
                      basic concepts presented in this chapter.

                                        Section A
                                      Discrimination

What it is              Discrimination refers to the process of telling the difference
                        between one stimulus and another.


Cues and cue            Skilled aircrew performance requires innumerable discriminations
patterns                of cues and cue patterns. For a pilot controlling the flight of an
                        aircraft, a cue pattern at any instant may include:

                           The status of several displays.
                           Selected characteristics of out-the-window scenes.
                           Complexes of accelerative forces on the body resulting from
                           the motion of the aircraft.
                           Sounds from the engines and flow of air across aircraft
                           surfaces, kinesthetic and other "feel" stimuli arising from
                           inputs to controls and their touch and resistance
                           characteristics.


Changes in              At another instant, any or all of these sources of information may
information             be changed. The pilot must monitor the changes as they occur,
                        assessing the overall status of the cue complex and adjusting
                        responses according to the status and the pilot's immediate,
                        short-range and long-range goals. During this process, the pilot's
                        actions, especially those regarding control inputs, must be finely
                        discriminated.


Discrimination for      Crewmembers, other than the pilot or copilot, also must make
crew members            numerous discriminations. Depending on the crew position and
                        stage of a mission, their required discriminations may be almost
                        entirely cognitive in nature, but no less complex. The difference,
                        usually, is that purely cognitive discriminations by adults can be
                        formulated according to verbal rules. Indeed, language can be
                        described as essentially an elaborate discriminative and
                        generalizing system.

                                      Section B
                                    Generalization

What it is            Generalization refers to the extension of cue and response
                      discriminations across time and situation. Without generalization,
                      all learning would be specific to the time and situation of the
                      learning. Just responding the same way on two different days
                      requires that minor or major differences in the stimulus be
                      accommodated, thus deriving cues from what the situations have
                      in common.


Cue characteristics   In complex behavior, it is usually necessary to key on cue
                      characteristics that are often subtle, especially those arising from
                      feedback of a kinesthetic nature (resulting from body position,
                      presence, or movement). Hence, desirable generalizations
                      require highly discriminated frameworks of cues and responses to
                      be made to them.


Relationships to      In one way or another, effective training programs focus primarily
training              on this point. Trainees practice under conditions with sufficient
                      variation for the trainees to learn to identify which common cues
                      to key on and how to tailor actions to the nuances of cues and
                      contexts. These elements of training relate to cues:

                         Guidance Guidance helps direct trainees' attention to cue
                         peculiarities and what they mean in terms of required
                         responses.

                         Feedback Feedback helps trainees discriminate between
                         correct and incorrect cue interpretations and selections of
                         responses.

                         Practice Practice provides repetition of the experiences in
                         varying conditions so that discriminations can become
                         generalized and habitual.


Generalized           The result is a broad context for associating cue meanings and
discriminative        selections of responses with situational requirements. In other
system                words, the result is a generalized discriminative system.

Novice / expert      Any account of the main differences between an expert and a
differences          novice in a skill, in one way or another, will focus on the greater
                     scope of the expert's generalization system for the skill and the
                     greater number and detail of mastered discriminations within the
                     system.

                     The following table (Tennyson, 1991) further clarifies the
                     differences between novices and experts.

                                        Transfer

What it is             In applied settings, transfer is typically viewed only as a product
                       of training. A much more profound influence of transfer on
                       behavior is due to its role as a process of learning.


Transfer as a          The continuity of behavior is attributable to transfer as a process
process of learning    of building new learning on old learning. Experience is a complex
                       matrix of discriminations that is generalized selectively to each
                       new experience. Everything from simple motor skills to profound
                       understandings depends on what experiences have gone on
                       before and how they are brought to bear on the present. This is
                       transfer as a process of learning.


How transfer works     Much experimental and theoretical effort has been directed
                       toward understanding how transfer works as a process of
                       learning and how to optimize it for particular purposes. While any
                       brief explanation of transfer in these respects seriously
                       oversimplifies the concept, one may begin by considering transfer
                       a generalized discrimination system. Its effectiveness and
                       efficiency as a process thus depend on the adequacy of
                       discriminations at the time, and on the scope and structure of the
                       framework within which the discriminations are generalized.


Building learning      The idea underlying almost all of the preceding discussions is
on learning            that one learns something new by building on what is already
                       known. As knowledge increases, there is an ever-expanding
                       generalization, and discrimination, of a complex knowledge base.
                       At the same time, new learning experiences add to the
                       knowledge base and can be built upon in the future.


Influence on           At any point in training, there should be deliberate provisions for
training design        drawing forth from students whatever is in their background that
                       can be effectively and efficiently brought to bear on training
                       issues at hand. Training design for given objectives should
                       anticipate how what is learned in one set of exercises can be
                       incorporated into the knowledge base in such a way that it can be
                       further built upon in later training.

                                Learning Hierarchies

Definition of         As used here, learning hierarchy refers to an organization of skills
hierarchy             and related elements that shows when transfer would occur
                      during learning, building learning on previous learning.


Hierarchical levels   At the bottom of the hierarchy are those skills and elements that
                      should be learned first. Their priority is due simply to the fact that
                      once they have been learned sufficiently, they facilitate learning
                      of skills and elements at the next hierarchical level. In turn, what
                      is learned at the second level facilitates acquisition at the third
                      level, and so on. To take advantage of this process, it is
                      necessary to know what learning facilitates other learning and to
                      conceptualize the hierarchy accordingly.


Alternative           Due to the complexity of behavior and of the interactions of
hierarchies           required discrimination systems, more than one arrangement of
                      the hierarchy can work. Hence, optimal training must select
                      among alternative hierarchies and choose those best for the
                      purpose. Unfortunately, what may be best for efficiency of
                      training as measured by speed of skill acquisition may not be
                      best by some other criterion, such as retention. Furthermore,
                      individual trainees differ in learning styles, which are important
                      determinants of how a learning hierarchy should be arranged. A
                      learning style is identified, in effect, by the optimal hierarchical
                      structure for learning.


Difference between    It is important to recognize that a learning hierarchy is not the
learning hierarchy    same as what is called a "skill hierarchy." The latter usually
and skill hierarchy   refers to an organization of skills and elements defined by their
                      relation to job requirements. Such an organization would rarely
                      conform to experts' schemas for skill performance.

                       a student. The individual brings experience to the situation, and
                       what happens depends largely on the nature of previous learning
                       that is brought to bear. Two concepts, encoding and chunking,
                       are involved.

                                     Encoding


Definition of      Encoding is the process of taking the incoming "message" and
encoding           putting it into meaningful "code" or units.


Encoding           A brief look at the process of encoding will clarify what goes on
                   when a performer or student approaches a task. Generally, there
                   are four encoding steps that comprise what is often referred to as
                   "pattern matching."

                   1. Selection of factors for attention.

                   2. Transformation of factors (e.g., stimuli) into meaningful
                      representations (e.g., cue recognition).

                   3. Abstraction of patterns of the transformations, sorting out what
                      goes with what in what order.

                   4. Spelling out the results as needed to understand the task.

                   After a skill is learned, these four processes become more or less
                   automatic.


Encoding by        Experts bring more knowledge and experience to a situation.
experts            Thus, experts are more likely to pick up all relevant stimuli
                   (step 1), have a greater variety of useful transformations available
                   (step 2), have better habits of abstracting key features of patterns
                   (step 3), and be more versatile in obtaining the final pattern
                   match (step 4). Experts are also more likely to recognize failure
                   to obtain an adequate match.


Encoding by        Students typically fall short on all four of the encoding processes.
students           In fact, a major goal of training is to provide the knowledge and
                   processing skills that make these four steps automatic and
                   comprehensive. To do so, instruction must build on the
                   experiences students bring with them at the beginning, and
                   provide new experiences as required to expand or replace older
                   ones.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7      1 November 2002                                         32




                                      Chunking


Definition of        Chunking is the process of establishing relationships among units
chunking             so the organization of the units has meaning to the performer or
                     student.

Example of           Most people can usually recall no more than nine unrelated
chunking             numbers if pronounced without emphasis and one second apart.
                     (The average for adults is seven digits.) More can be recalled if
                     pronounced in a rhythmic manner because the rhythm imposes
                     an organization that the hearers can adopt.

                     The same is true for unrelated words. But if the words comprise
                     a sentence, a large number can be remembered, not just
                     immediately, but for days, even years. Through meaning, a
                     sentence organizes–"chunks"–the units. Thus, though one may
                     be able to recall only seven or so new digits presented one
                     second apart, one may just as easily recall seven chunks of digits
                     such as phone numbers where each chunk has several digits.


Why chunking Is      Chunking in the sense of meaningful organizations of units is
necessary            obviously necessary if one is to respond to multiple factors in
                     performance situations. An insight into how it can be brought
                     about was suggested by earlier sections regarding the need to
                     pattern cue and response systems. The most useful patterns are
                     those grounded in experience. Further, the inclusiveness and
                     efficiency of chunking in given situations will be determined by
                     the degree of hierarchical structure developed within the process.

                     Chunking should derive from existing meaning structures,
                     especially those that go beyond rote learning and are organic in
                     nature. When we speak of chunking, then, reference is to the
                     complexity of cue-response organization discussed earlier.


Mnemonics and        Mnemonics are memory-improving systems for organizing
chunking             information and thereby facilitating its retention. A more useful
                     application of mnemonics is in reference to strategies for
                     chunking and other aspects of encoding that go well beyond rote
                     memory. Hierarchical processing systems are mnemonic in
                     function, and they run the gamut to, and include, expert systems.

Definition of long      Enduring learning is stored in long-term memory. In this
term processes          discussion, we will ignore what long-term memory is and what
                        "storing" might involve. This focus is on processes that
                        characterize the long-range effects of learning and how past
                        learning becomes adapted over and over again, as situations
                        require.


Training to             Training to proficiency is a powerful approach. If training is
proficiency             designed for only one or two trials where all objective indicators
                        are acceptable, neither mastery nor organic knowledge will likely
                        result. Research has demonstrated that when an event such as
                        air refueling is mastered in the training device, training to
                        proficiency in the aircraft is significantly reduced (Nullmeyer and
                        Rockway, 1984.) There should also be ample provision in the
                        future for continuing practice on the skills in other contexts to
                        ensure a broad range of experience in using the skills.

                   such a complex process that training could surely be improved if
                   conditions fostering integration were identified and exploited
                   during instruction. Useful terms in discussing integration are
                   schemas, enterprise theory, and metaskills.

                                          Schema


Definition of          "Schema" is probably the most valuable concept in modern
schema                 psychology. The term usually refers to a hierarchical
                       organization of cue-response processing patterns that govern the
                       adaptation of behavior to the situation at hand.

                       Cue and response selectivity becomes attuned to goals and
                       conditions for performance. The governing schema must be
                       sensitive to changes in pertinent cues and responses as
                       requirements evolve during the performance. The schema must
                       also be sensitive to changes in conditions as they affect cue and
                       response selection.

                       Fishburne, Spears and Williams (1987) also described a possible
                       schema structure which would show patterns, relationships,
                       situations and circumstances, similar schemas, approach,
                       attention required, subgoals or checkpoints, rules, context and
                       dynamic patterns (timing, coordination, variation, cause-effect
                       factors). Again, this illustrates the complexity of learning. The
                       formulation of schemas takes place within an enterprise.


Schema as an           A schema is an adaptive transfer system. Its value in
adaptive transfer      performance, and for facilitating a learning process, depends on
system                 its comprehensiveness relative to the situation at hand.
                       Comprehensiveness requires not only adequate scope, but also
                       appropriate discriminations among nuances of variations in cue
                       patterns and response requirements.


Comprehensive-         Building appropriate schemas is essential for skill adaptability or
ness of schemas        "robustness," as it has been called. One of the primary
                       differences between expert and nonexpert performers is in the
                       comprehensiveness of the schemas that govern their
                       performance.
AFH 36-2235           Volume 7       1 November 2002                                      36



Skill adaptability       All training should target schema development. The resulting
and skill retention      organization and patterning of skills and their components are
                         critical to skill adaptability and skill retention. Further, because
                         comprehensive schemas are elaborate transfer systems, the
                         earlier they develop the greater their value in subsequent learning
                         (learning to learn).


Success of               The success of a given learning hierarchy in training design will
learning                 depend on the extent to which schemas for separate skills come
hierarchies              to encompass more than just the specific conditions for practicing
                         the separate skills. It is for this reason that prolonged practice
                         under restricted conditions can lead to rigid, nonadaptive
                         performance. Only limited schemas are called for, so
                         performance becomes relatively task- and condition-specific.


Relationship of          It should be apparent that cognitive processes are critical to
cognitive                comprehensive schema development. This is especially true of
processes and            language, whether overt or as an implicit mediational vehicle. For

                                     Enterprise


Definition of      An enterprise is a purposeful, planned activity that may depend
enterprise         for its execution on some combination of verbal information,
                   intellectual skills, and cognitive strategies, all related by their
                   involvement in the common goal.

                   Gagné and Merrill (1990) proposed a method to identify learning
                   goals that require an integration of multiple objectives. They
                   proposed that such an integration of multiple objectives be
                   conceived in terms of the pursuit of a comprehensive purpose, in
                   which the learner is engaged, called enterprise.


Task for           The task for the instructional designer is to identify the goal of a
instructional      targeted enterprise, along with its component skills, knowledge,
designers          and attitudes, and then design instruction to enable the student to
                   acquire the capability of achieving this integrated outcome. The
                   student works toward a goal and wants to achieve.


Relationships      Relationships between enterprises begin in part task training,
between            starting first with normal procedures. The initial enterprises are
enterprises        simplified goals with proficiency required before proceeding to the
                   next enterprise. Relationships are established part-to-whole and
                   practice begins in integrating related enterprises. Through this
                   process, learning is built upon learning and enterprises become
                   more complex.


Macro              Variations such as emergency procedures are introduced and
approach to        interactions are required with other players. The resulting
understanding      complex enterprise performed proficiently under varying
                   conditions must be organized in a manner that can be described
                   in terms of hierarchical relationships. This is a macro approach
                   to understanding enterprise components and the strategies for
                   accomplishing them.

Example of       A good approach to understanding what must happen during
enterprise       successful development is to focus on the differences between
development      the schemas of novices and those of experts.

                    Novice. In aircrew training there is a point called acquisition
                    of initial proficiency when the new pilot can accomplish all the
                    checklist items and perform the maneuvers correctly. There
                    the integrated performance is that of the novice. The
                    instructor recognizes that the right schemas for safe flight are
                    formed, but the novice must continue to work other
                    enterprises in order to gain "age and experience."

                    Expert. The pilot continues from initial qualification to mission
                    or combat qualification. The schemas are now expanded to
                    meet the demands of the "real world." The squadron
                    commander knows that this is not enough. Exercises such as
                    Red Flag, combat training in simulation and in-flight practice in
                    multiple situations build on the schemas. In time, the expert
                    emerges, having achieved a repertoire of metaskills.

Progression from      Figure 2 shows the progression from simple individual objectives
simple task to        to the more complex end goal or terminal objective. The
metaskill             integration of multiple objectives, or enterprises, is developed
                      along the simple-to-complex continuum. The highest plateau on
                      this continuum is the metaskill.

                                         Metaskill


Definition of         Spears (1983) defined a metaskill as the complex skill of
metaskill             adapting, monitoring, and correcting the use of individual skills in
                      complex performances that integrate all learning processes. The
                      person with metaskills can deal with even novel situations
                      successfully.


Generalized and       A metaskill is the skill required to adapt the specific skills it affects
discriminative        to the requirements of a situation. The more developed the
metaskills            metaskill, the greater the variation among situations that can be
                      accommodated. The more discriminative the metaskill, the more
                      likely that given adaptations will be appropriate and precise.


Incorporation of      A metaskill thus incorporates schemas for performance,
schemas in            becoming a transfer system that can serve as both a process and
metaskills            a product of training. It should be noted at the outset, however,
                      that metaskills are typically complex systems or composites.
                      They involve hierarchies of components and ranges of complex
                      enterprises. The components will normally vary in nature,
                      ranging from verbal systems to kinesthetic systems.

      ATD INSTRUCTION WITHIN THE TOTAL TRAINING SYSTEM
                                       Overview


Introduction         This chapter presents key issues to be considered in the design
                     of aircrew training devices within the total training system. These
                     issues have broader application than aircrew training device
                     design.


Considerations for   The total training approach takes into consideration three things:
the total training
approach                The full life cycle of training from entry to exit for any person in
                        the operation, maintenance, or support of the defense system.
                        Every situation and any environment in which training will
                        occur in order to achieve the goal or mission.
                        Confidence that the pilot or aircrew will succeed in achieving
                        the goal or mission and returning safely.


Achieving "Perfect   Vince Lombardi once said of his total training design:
Practices"
                     "Practice does not make perfect; perfect practices make perfect."

                     The following key issues lead to the design of aircrew training
                     devices so that "perfect practices" can be achieved within the
                     total training system.

                               Total Training Approach

Building learning      The total training approach recognizes that the most profound
on learning            facilitator of learning is efficient and effective building of learning
                       on previous learning. Another way to say this is to capitalize on
                       the concept of transfer in the process of acquiring a skill. This
                       ties the new skill to the context in which it will be integrated,
                       which enhances the retention of the skill.


Discrimination of      Discrimination of differences in situations and the requirement to
differences            achieve the goal within those situations are presented in a broad
                       context so that the skill is more adaptable and becomes more
                       robust through experience. As much as possible, meaning is
                       gained by the learner in a natural way, which also enhances
                       motivation.


Conceiving the         Success in this approach is in the analysis and design phases so
"big picture"          that the comprehensive "big picture" is conceived and the
                       appropriate schedules of learning experiences are derived. This
                       design establishes the pattern of skill components within the
                       enterprise hierarchy. There are several good ways to implement
                       this approach. The key issues in the remaining sections will
                       guide you in doing it correctly.

                                   Section B
              Structure of Skill Repertoire (Training Tasks List)

Task analysis           The task analysis provides for the aircrew a set of required skill
                        repertoires from a very limited perspective. It does not take into
                        consideration the many circumstances in which various skills
                        must be adapted for successful performance; nor should task
                        analysis try to capture all possible circumstances. However, no
                        training program can be successful if all these circumstances are
                        ignored.


The expert              The difference between an expert and a novice is in their skill
performer               repertoires. The expert has a skill repertoire in which separate
                        skills are integrated into broad complexes of skill patterns,
                        together with conditions for their performance.


Metaskills              A pilot with years of experience in all phases of flight can develop
                        a broad spectrum of adaptive skills, which in time emerge as
                        metaskills. The schemas formed as the tasks from the task
                        analysis are brought together in enterprises. These enterprises
                        provide the foundation for this broad spectrum. The goal of
                        training is to hasten this normally slow acquisition of metaskills.


Key to structuring      The key to structuring skill repertoires is to keep in mind the
skill repertoires       moment-to-moment adaptations required by circumstances in
                        phases of flight. Properly designed training should:

                           Build the integration as much as develop individual skills
                           separately. In order to understand the nature of the
                           integration, one must understand the broad similarities among
                           expert repertoires.
                           Use the understanding of integration to develop enterprise
                           hierarchies. The patterns should also show what to avoid to
                           prevent interference of learning during training. Some skills
                           support others while some interfere.

Example of          During practice in a simulator, it may be desirable after a landing
structuring         to reset the initial conditions over and over to a point in the
                    approach where several attempts can be made in a short period
                    of time. For a novice, much could be accomplished. Immediate
                    retrials would take advantage of whatever memory traces had not
                    yet dissipated. At the same time, it would normally be desirable
                    to vary the initial conditions each time the simulator is reset–a
                    slightly different altitude or attitude, a change in wind speed or
                    direction, etc. By so doing, skill adaptation is practiced along with
                    landing.


ATD advantages in   Variation in initial conditions occurs naturally in an aircraft insofar
structuring skill   as some parameters are concerned (e.g., altitude), but the
repertoires         simulator has advantages. These advantages include immediate
                    retrials, greater possible variations in conditions during a given
                    practice period, etc.–advantages that allow a degree of control in
                    the development of skills (and their underlying metaskills) that is
                    not possible in the aircraft.

                              Organization of Training

Why organization      Training should be organized so that effectiveness and efficiency
is important          are jointly optimized. In practice, there are realistic constraints
                      such as the number of aircraft that can be generated for training
                      in a given day and the number of instructors available. Other
                      constraints come from cost control measures and time and facility
                      limitations. Without regard to constraints, the basic principles
                      remain the same. Constraints may impact how these basic
                      principles are implemented. Important considerations for the
                      organization of training are discussed in the five subsections that
                      follow.

Present sequence      Overall, the present sequence of aircrew training by stages is
of training           quite valid on logical grounds. Given certain entry skills on the
                      part of the trainees:

                         Initial qualification training provides for basic orientation to
                         skill requirements and development of basic skills.

                         Mission qualification training ensures that trainees learn to
                         perform their respective skills to minimal levels of mission
                         proficiency, both as individuals and as members of a combat
                         team.

                         Continuation training ensures that proficiency in the
                         acquired skills is maintained, performance is "polished," and
                         new variations are learned.

                      The achievements must generalize to a variety of situations never
                      before encountered by the crew, and must generalize
                      immediately in operational circumstances.


Principles            Decisions for sequencing training are guided by six principles:
applicable to
sequencing of            Build learning on prior learning. To optimize training
training                 efficiency and effectiveness, it is necessary to build learning
                         on prior learning. The training designer should understand
                         interrelations, especially those that are supportive, among
                         various skills and skill components. From this knowledge,
                         learning hierarchies can be identified, at least to a first
                         approximation. Knowing the organization of learning
                         hierarchies, building learning on learning can be accomplished
                         in a straightforward manner.

                         Facilitate transfer as a process of learning. Sequencing of
                         training experiences should be such that transfer as a process
                         of learning is maximized, other things being equal. As
                         illustrated in an earlier example, the close response-feedback
                         loop required for a pilot to fly by instruments can result in a
                         highly generalized skill of aircraft control, so generalized that it
                         can transfer to a variety of flight control
AFH 36-2235     Volume 7       1 November 2002                                         48

sequencing of         Similarly, many other skills can have broad effects on the
training              learning and performance of others.
(Continued)
                      Maximize meaning for a complex of separate skills. There
                      is another dimension of the sequencing issue that deserves
                      considerable attention. The concern in this case is the
                      meaningfulness of practice at given times (and hence student
                      motivation as well). Meaning necessarily incorporates
                      interconnecting among skills, performance, goals, situational
                      factors, etc., that promote both skill acquisition and retention.
                      (Meaning is also the primary vehicle for the development and
                      manifestation of metaskills.) Thus, it is important to maximize
                      meaning to the extent practicable during every training
                      experience.

                      Establish appropriate anchoring experiences in a timely
                      manner. Without discounting the roles of overall verbal
                      comprehension of interrelations among tasks, it is still
                      necessary to realize that many—in some cases most—
                      meanings are perceptual and visceral in nature. The essential
                      characteristics of the required meaning systems cannot be
                      understood through verbal descriptions alone.

                      The training problem, then, is to ensure that appropriate
                      experiential foundations, in the concrete sense, have been
                      established in a timely manner. Familiarization rides for
                      beginning student pilots prior to flight training obviously have
                      this need in mind. But the issue should permeate the
                      conception of an entire training program, especially at the
                      stages where trainees may encounter tasks and situational
                      requirements for which they have no prior anchoring
                      experiences.

                      Target metaskill development day-to-day. This is done by
                      drawing attention to the approaches used by experts. One
                      method is to encourage learners during training practices to
                      conceptualize and verbalize what they are or will be doing.
                      Then the instructor puts his or her approach in context of the
                      approach used by experts. This context should be directed so
                      that clear discrimination occurs and builds to more
                      generalizable metaskills.

                                     Team Training


Team training         The concept of metaskill is useful for understanding the essence
requirements          of teamwork, and hence of team training requirements. In fact,
                      teamwork can be characterized as a special kind of metaskill.
                      Individual crewmembers must perform their various duties within
                      constraints imposed by the activities of other members of the
                      team. As varying situations require each member to adapt his or
                      her skills to a matrix of situational factors, the constraints on
                      others arising from each person's adaptations also vary from
                      situation to situation.


Aircrew teamwork      The problem is perhaps best exemplified in the management of
example               crew resources, especially under conditions of stress. It may
                      often happen that a given crewmember would have to give a
                      second member assistance with tasks the first member normally
                      would not perform. In some cases, the first person may have to
                      perform the entire second set of tasks while keeping up with, or
                      handing off, normal responsibilities. Individual crewmembers
                      should be sensitive to such evolving requirements; this state of
                      readiness to act when called upon is integral to team training.


Description of        Line-oriented flight training (LOFT), mission-oriented simulator
formal programs to    training (MOST), and cockpit resource management (CRM) are
train team            formal programs to train team skills, as opposed to individual
members               skills. However, in practice LOFT, MOST, and CRM are used
                      mainly to add an element of teamwork to crews who have already
                      achieved considerable proficiency in their individual skills. When
                      viewed as efficient learning of a metaskill, the practice of team
                      coordination by novices should occur to some extent with almost
                      every skill while they are learning it. It should begin as soon as
                      they have acquired enough proficiency not to disrupt other
                      members of the team due to ineptness in their own personal
                      domains. This is not to say that every practice session should be
                      team-oriented.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 7       1 November 2002                                          51



Principles             Training for team coordination should recognize six principles:
applicable to
coordinating team         As a metaskill, team coordination will develop gradually.
training
                          Varying the skills and conditions to be coordinated will
                          foster its development. Mastery of team coordination for
                          particular skills and conditions is not of itself indicative of
                          metaskill development.

                          Team coordination should be incorporated into practice
                          as early as possible. This assumes each crewmember has
                          overcome any ineptness in skills that would disrupt team
                          efforts. It is not necessary, or even desirable, that once team
                          coordination becomes an implicit aspect of practice, it should
                          be so for every practice session. There should be ample
                          provisions for independent and individualized instruction in
                          areas of need, whether for mastery training or for practice on
                          new skills.

                          The ultimate goal of comprehensive crew coordination
                          should not be stated as a formal objective to be achieved
                          during any one-practice session. Crew coordination is an
                          orientation and awareness of personal responsibilities in
                          context of the team. It includes who does what, when, and to
                          whom, and involves timing, sequencing, decision authority,
                          and response. Crew coordination is in context of the team
                          effort to achieve the mission. The formal objective is the
                          successful completion of the event.

                          As learning progresses, provisions should be made for
                          periodic checks of the status of team coordination. The
                          times for the checks should be such that levels of team
                          achievement can be identified and assessed. It is at such
                          times that objectives for the metaskill of team coordination are
                          meaningful, and the objectives should be stated in terms of
                          coordinated team behavior.

                          Any deficiencies noted following periodic assessments
                          should be diagnosed and remedial measures
                          implemented.

                                     Part-task Training


Part-task training      Part-task training (PTT) is often a poorly defined concept. With
                        PTT, a learner typically breaks any whole task, no matter how
                        small at the start, into facets, only one or two of which will be the
                        focus at any particular time. Research indicates that the focus
                        shifts from facet to facet, on a moment-to-moment basis,
                        depending on the extent to which the learner's immediate goals at
                        the time incorporate the facets.


Example of PTT          When first practicing landings, a student pilot's focus shifts from,
                        say, airspeed control to angle of attack to line-up with the runway
                        to glideslope, and back again, over and over, to any facets that
                        the pilot is capable of incorporating into the effort without
                        disrupting the whole process.


Practice and            At the outset, the student is momentarily attending to only one
integration of          facet at a time, and progress will depend on the ability to monitor
facets                  and control each facet when, and as, circumstances require.
                        With practice, at least some separate facets will be integrated
                        perceptually and behaviorally into a single facet (e.g., angle of
                        attack and glideslope). Eventually, the entire maneuver will be
                        integrated into a schema wherein each facet has a priority for
                        attention only as monitored feedback indicates a significant
                        departure from expectations (templates).


Questions for           The question for designers of part-task training is how to ensure
designing PTT           efficient progress toward schematic skill integration both during
                        part-task practice and later when the part-task is to be integrated
                        into whole-task performance.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7        1 November 2002                                         53



Relevant points for   The example highlights four points which are relevant to
PTT                   designing part-task training:

                         A novice must adopt a part-task approach to a task of even
                         low complexity. An instructor's preference for whole-task
                         training notwithstanding, the learner is going to break the task
                         into manageable pieces.

                         What is manageable depends to a great extent on the time
                         available to monitor and respond to the requirements of each
                         facet, without chaos, and on the conflicts (interference) among
                         facets, such as simultaneously controlling airspeed, angle of
                         attack, line-up, and glideslope. Simultaneous control of all
                         four requires skill integration at a schema level. Manageability
                         at a given time reduces to avoiding chaos.

                         The example illustrates that, with practice, the learner can
                         come to terms with all facets, if not simultaneously, at least in
                         acceptable patterns of variation.

                         The learner can eventually "insert" the skill in a performance
                         sequence when and as required.


Plans for PTT         Plans for part-task training should consider these two general
                      principles:

                         Emphasize part-task practice to a point of comfortable
                         mechanization of the skill, and then begin integrating it
                         with other activities. This principle concerns part-tasks that
                         are relatively isolated from others in the whole task. That is,
                         cues for the required actions are unique to the part-task, and
                         the actions themselves are not part of a cueing-feedback
                         complex that governs, moment-to-moment, the performance
                         of the remaining part-tasks.

                         As an example of this principle, consider the communications
                         with the ground or among crewmembers that occur during
                         flight control tasks, navigation, monitoring of instruments, etc.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 7       1 November 2002                                        54



Avoiding                In these cases, the primary problem of whole-task integration is
interference            avoiding interference when the part-tasks must be time-shared.
                        At least up to a point, such interference can be reduced if each
                        part-task has been previously mastered to the extent that it can
                        be performed more or less mechanically.


Avoiding isolation      At the same time, there is at least some indirect evidence that
of part-task            prolonged practice on part-tasks in isolation may result in
                        performance habits that are too restricted to allow the easy
                        adaptation to whole-task performance and the required sharing of
                        attention.


Task context            It normally helps if, during part-task practice, the learner
                        maintains cognitive or situational awareness of the entire task
                        context and how the context affects, and is affected by, the part-
                        task. Thereby, the eventual schematic organization of the whole
                        task should be facilitated.


Refresher training      For experienced performers undergoing refresher training, whole-
                        task integration usually is not a significant issue, so even
                        prolonged part-task practice should be productive.

                           Develop a general schema in which separate responses
                           take into consideration their total effects. This principle
                           concerns part-tasks that are not isolated from the others in the
                           whole tasks. The earlier landing example is a good
                           illustration. The problem to the novice is that responses to
                           one element affect the status of others. Prior to integration,
                           trainees normally trade off attention among task elements.


How to identify         Training designers, depending perhaps more on experience than
skills for PTT          logic, should consider part-task training when:

                           Beginning trainees trade off attention among elements within
                           the task.
                           The scope of the part-task can be managed so that the
                           learner does not encounter conditions that cannot be

How to identify         corrected. (Device features such as parameter freeze are
skills for PTT          useful for ensuring manageability at the start.)
(Continued)             It is desirable to include, at the same time, all task elements
                        whose performances directly affect each other.
                        Some elements are to be temporarily omitted. Care should be
                        taken that practice does not continue for long in the
                        oversimplified context.
                        It is all right if the learner has to struggle during the task,
                        provided that noticeable progress occurs. The task should be
                        simplified, parameters frozen, other focus techniques used
                        only to maintain manageability. Even so, it would be wise to
                        expose the trainee periodically and briefly to the more
                        complex conditions to prevent restrictive, element-specific
                        habits from developing. This also helps monitor progress.


Alternative less     There are numerous alternative approaches to part-task training,
costly approaches    depending on the tasks and the level of development of the
                     learner. For this reason, training designers should also consider
                     issues related to training resource management and utilization.
                     In most cases, equipment needed for part-task training is usually
                     less costly to acquire, use, and maintain than that required for
                     whole-task training. Hence, using less costly equipment, part-
                     task training can also target specific trainee deficiencies for
                     intensive practice. This can be done without entailing similar
                     effort on related skills on which the trainee has already reached
                     at least a tentative level of proficiency.

                                   Learning Styles


Variations in        Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis not only on
learning styles      processing habits in skill performance, but also on variations in
                     processes which different students depend on to learn a skill.

                        Learner Difference. "Visual" and "auditory" learners are
                        mentioned often to designate, respectively, those who learn
                        more readily through reading and graphic displays versus
                        those who do better if they hear the same material described.
                        Another difference is that some people learn more easily
                        when an idea is presented in a mathematical equation, while
                        others require a verbal formulation of the same idea. Still
                        another difference is due to the extent of "field dependence"
                        versus "field independence" on the part of the students.

                        Do a learner's actions and thoughts have to be led or guided
                        via a lot of direction, examples, etc.? This is an indication of
                        dependence on the "field" of external stimulation. Or does the
                        learner do better with a minimum of guidance, relying on
                        himself or herself instead? This is an indication of
                        independence of the external "field."

                        Learning styles. These and other differences are referred to
                        as learning styles.


Benefit of           With the advent of computer-based training (CBT), it is feasible to
computer-based       consider learning styles during courseware development. Good
training             textbooks have attempted to do so for years, of course, by
                     presenting more than one approach to materials to be learned.
                     But CBT can mix auditory with visual presentations, use animated
                     graphics, and have the learner interact physically with a
                     simulation.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 7       1 November 2002                                         57



Conducting target      Whether a training program is blessed with talented students or
audience analysis      must serve a mixed lot, training designers should anticipate major
                       patterns in learning styles and allow for them. In doing so,
                       persons who plan the training should have information regarding
                       variations in major strengths and weaknesses of the student
                       population.

                       Because poor reading is such a common difficulty in many
                       training programs, it is important to identify the likely incidence of
                       this problem first.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 7       1 November 2002                                          58




                                Individualized Instruction


Individualization      The preceding discussions imply that learning is a highly
and compromise         individualized and personal process. Ideally implemented,
                       instruction would be tailored to each trainee's peculiarities with
                       respect to learning hierarchies as determined by individual
                       learning styles: rate of progress on separate skills and metaskill
                       development, specific training difficulties, etc. As an efficient
                       system for training, however, compromises may be made in
                       individualization of training. In some cases, chaos could result.


Effective general      An effective general plan is to develop a model program that:

                          Recognizes the value of individualizing instruction to the
                          extent feasible.
                          Is adaptable to broad classes of individual differences,
                          especially concerning development of skill mastery.
                          Has provisions for individual instruction when feasible and
                          desirable.
                          Implements assessment and diagnostic procedures that
                          identify training difficulties that indicate needs for
                          individualized guidance and practice (instructors play a critical
                          role here).


Five principles        Five principles regarding the development of learning foundations
applicable to          are presented below.
learning
foundations               Developing metaskills is just as important a concern for
                          individualization as development of the separate skills
                          that they govern. While instructors often recognize this
                          intuitively, they often do not know how to teach metaskills
                          specifically, and they know even less about how to assess and
                          identify problems in their development. If, as suggested,
                          metaskills are targeted early in training, it will be necessary to
                          prepare instructors for these responsibilities.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7       1 November 2002                                       59



Five principles         Emphasize the peculiarities of learning metaskills. When
applicable to           narrowly conceived, training to proficiency on particular tasks,
learning                as a universal guide for individual practice schedules, can lead
foundations             to inferior metaskill development. Proficiency on task- and
(Continued)
                        condition-specific performance is no guarantee that broadly
                        adaptive schemas have been acquired. In fact, and
                        paradoxical though it may seem, metaskill development can
                        be expected even when criterion performance is not achieved
                        until the learner is fairly well along in training. This is not to
                        say that one should not train to proficiency. Rather, the intent
                        is to emphasize the peculiarities of learning metaskills. The
                        requirement is a variety of experiences for task performance,
                        using different combinations of tasks and task elements.

                        Once a trainee has achieved proficiency on specific task-
                        condition performance, the trainer should permit additional
                        practice, even under conditions that might never normally
                        occur.

                        A fairly common observation in pilot training is that, when left
                        to themselves, students often try "way out" stunts in a flight
                        simulator. Instructors have been observed doing the same
                        thing. From the standpoint of metaskill development, this is a
                        good practice so long as normal discriminative cue-response
                        complexes are maintained through practice in realistic
                        situations.

                        Recognize the central role of transfer as a process of
                        learning and tailor individual instruction accordingly. The
                        individualization of instruction under the philosophy
                        expounded here would surely result in better skill retention,
                        and hence less need for refresher training. Building on each
                        trainee's past learning, ensuring achievement in the process,
                        should result in more meaningful learning and superior skill
                        integration. Retention rests on meaning and integration,
                        especially as the point of habitual patternization of skills is
                        reached. Hence, it is important that individualized training be
                        more than just trainees practicing separately.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7      1 November 2002                                        60



Five principles         Allow trainees some flexibility to individualize their
applicable to           instruction. Students will often recognize their needs better
learning                than their instructors will, especially with respect to disruptive
foundations
                        interference patterns. For evidence, one need only recall that,
(Continued)
                        as in an earlier example, novices’ trade off attention to facets
                        of a skill, concentrating on what they feel to be important at
                        the time. Instructors are typically unaware that this is
                        happening. Obviously, trainees can identify some particular
                        difficulties in their performance that instructors may not notice.
                        Therefore, there should be some opportunities for the trainees
                        to manage their instruction as they see fit. Occasional
                        monitoring of the trainees will ensure that the time is well
                        spent.

                        Ensure that team training follows the above principles.
                        Team training should follow principles that are analogous to
                        those listed above. The team as constituted at a given time is
                        a unit, and it will have its own needs and peculiarities.

                                        Attitudes

Concept of attitude   In aircrew training, the attitude of the instructor and the attitude of
                      the student toward using a training device, rather than an aircraft,
                      impacts the effectiveness of the training.


Role of attitude      Attitudes reflect sensitivities to certain kinds of information and
                      selection of certain habitual modes of processing and responding
                      to information. To tie into the discussion of goals, for example, a
                      student or performer who is said to have a "poor attitude" is one
                      whose self-based goals fall short of normal requirements.
                      Attitude governs what one responds to, how it is interpreted, and
                      the actions that follow. An attitude has a strong evaluative
                      component, usually with emotional overtones—"I like it!"

                      For example, the new pilot has learned from past experiences
                      that trust in the instructor and doing what the instructor says will
                      result in safe flight. As the pilot begins initial qualification on the
                      new aircraft, the attitude is to continue that pattern.


Establishing          What governs quality of job performance, day in and day out, are
performance goals     the goals that performers set for themselves. Goals become
                      equivalents of manifestations of effort; of how much effort
                      performers are willing to make to satisfy themselves in what they
                      do. A training developer might decide to focus on an enduring
                      pride of accomplishment on the part of students, a life-long
                      positive attitude that makes everything turn out right. That
                      developer should look forward to success only with students who
                      have this characteristic already generalized in their behavior. For
                      other students, training that targets such an attitude will be
                      tantamount to preaching.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 7       1 November 2002                                       62



Skill mastery      Experts in skills expend less effort than novices in performing the
                   same tasks, and experts perform at a superior level. Perhaps
                   this is one reason many people strive for skill mastery–it makes a
                   task easier to perform.

                   Related to performance are proficient ways of processing
                   information. During the item-by-item analysis of performance,
                   identify what processing has become more or less second nature
                   to achieve quality in performance. The implication of this point is
                   that training in the long haul–total training–should make proficient
                   performance easy compared to nonproficient or borderline
                   performance.


Milestones of      A critical point: students' general and specific comprehension of
achievement        what they are doing, and why, should advance day by day. As
                   they complete a lesson, they should grow not only in the specific
                   skills addressed that day, but in overall skill comprehension as
                   well. They should recognize which holes are being filled.

                   The overview should have milestones of achievement against
                   which students can regularly assess their progress. At the same
                   time, emphasis should not be on how many skills or skill
                   components have accumulated. Progress should be related to a
                   real-life view of skill requirements. "You have learned to do X
                   yesterday and today. Tomorrow you will see how this fits into
                   (applies to, etc.) these other tasks."

                                         Feedback

Importance of           The most important thing in maintaining interest and effort during
feedback                training is recognizing that one is making progress. Feedback
                        regarding effort is essential. Never leave students in doubt as to
                        whether they have learned something. Even if progress has
                        been slow, find something that is done correctly and point it out;
                        they may not be able to recognize it themselves. Also, provide
                        other encouragement on a regular basis.


Intrinsic feedback      Inherent in training is the goal that students recognize and
                        interpret feedback that is a natural outgrowth of their actions.
                        This can be termed "intrinsic" feedback because it is intrinsic to
                        performance itself. If one turns the steering wheel of a moving
                        car, the direction of movement changes. By visually noting this
                        feedback, the amount and rate of change, the driver can monitor
                        the pressure on the steering wheel so as to achieve the desired
                        direction of movement. At the same time, the tactile sensations
                        arising in the hands from pressing the steering wheel, and the
                        kinesthetic sensations from muscle contractions, are also
                        important intrinsic feedback cues.


Supplemental            In contrast to intrinsic feedback, supplemental feedback is not a
feedback                natural outgrowth of actions. As the term suggests, the feedback
                        is added to any intrinsic feedback that might occur. In training,
                        supplemental feedback is often contrived to take the place of
                        intrinsic feedback. Two general applications follow:

                           If students are not far enough along to recognize intrinsic
                           feedback, supplemental feedback substitutes for intrinsic
                           feedback while discrimination of the latter is being learned.
                           Given practice situations may not be capable of providing
                           intrinsic feedback as it occurs in real contexts. This is true for
                           most part-task training as well as CBT when perceptual and
                           motor components are represented symbolically. In these
                           cases, creating supplemental feedback is necessary.
AFH 36-2235        Volume 7       1 November 2002                                      64



Using                 An important principle for using supplemental feedback in training
supplemental          is that it should be designed, and timed, to focus attention on
feedback              intrinsic feedback that is to be discriminated. Specificity of
                      feedback is very important. If feedback is too general, it cannot
                      guide attention to specific factors intrinsic to actions.

                      Students must focus on integrating what they are practicing and
                      how it relates to whole skills and to situational factors not
                      represented in part-task contexts. It is usually necessary to
                      provide them information about the effects that their actions
                      would have on the total system. Without such supplemental
                      feedback, eventual skill integration could be delayed, because
                      there would be no basis for anticipating the missing intrinsic
                      feedback. Worse, students' comprehension of skill requirements
                      could become restricted to part-task contexts in ways not easily
                      overcome.


General rule for      A general rule for the use of supplemental feedback is to reduce
using                 or withdraw it systematically as proficiency progresses. If from
supplemental          direct observation or monitoring a student is found to be
feedback              floundering, temporarily provide more supplementary feedback.
                      Help the student focus on the discrimination of intrinsic cues and
                      their interpretation.


Timing of feedback    Effective timing of the delivery of feedback to the student
                      depends on how the feedback is to be used by the student.

                         Soon enough. In an ongoing, dynamic practice, feedback
                         must be available soon enough to allow the performer to make
                         needed adjustments during the action. For closely
                         coordinated actions, such as perceptual-motor responses,
                         delay can be disastrous. The latest time feedback should be
                         available is determined by how long it takes the performer to
                         interpret the feedback cues and process them into the action
                         dynamics.

                         Not too soon. In practices where the response time is not a
                         critical factor, feedback is less effective if given immediately
                         and it becomes disruptive. Feedback provided either too early
                         or too late can disrupt rhythmic coordination.
AFH 36-2235      Volume 7         1 November 2002                                      65



Timing of feedback       Self-feedback. If practice is intended to have students learn
(Continued)              how to evaluate their own actions and develop the expectancy
                         templates needed for the task; feedback provided too early
                         can stop the process in its tracks. Both during and after an
                         action, students should be mentally reviewing what they did,
                         the bases for their selection of responses, and their
                         interpretations of cues that led to actions.


Productive delay of   There are times when feedback can be delayed, productively, a
feedback              day or even a week. If students spend part of the interim thinking
                      through why they might be right or wrong, and discussing it with
                      their classmates, they will learn much more about the processing
                      of performance than they will learn if this self-analysis is short-
                      circuited by immediate feedback.

                                Practice as a Vehicle

Role of practice      Practice is simply a means, or a vehicle, whereby other things
                      occur.


Discrimination and    In the practice of task performance, students should be forced to
generalization        consider alternative interpretations of task requirements, and to
                      select from alternatives their own courses of action. Practice will
                      also teach them how to monitor and assess the effects of their
                      choices, and recognize when they need to take different
                      approaches or adapt their approaches in order to increase their
                      probabilities of success. This kind of practice will result in
                      learning discriminations and generalizations.


Repetitive practice   In designing course content for successive practice sessions, one
                      should keep in mind that organic knowledge, and the mastery
                      that makes it effective, requires repetitive practice across time.

                         The practice involved should have clear purposes. Thus,
                         provisions can be made for returning to skills practiced earlier,
                         not only for review but to broaden generalizations.
                         In the process, training goals should include integration of the
                         earlier skills with those practiced later.
                         Whatever is to be integrated, whether overall interrelations
                         among skills or overt actions accompanying separate skills,
                         hierarchical understanding should be pursued systematically
                         over time.


Contexts for          Students learn to generalize by practicing generalizations. The
practice              task for the performer is to scan the stimulus conditions and then
                      identify characteristics that signal what to do. No two sets of
                      stimulus conditions are identical. Unless the performer has
                      learned to abstract the stimulus complex, as it exists, to get cue
                      information, actions will probably be misguided. That is, one
                      must learn to identify features that can be found in any situation
                      where the skill is to be performed. Consider the following points:
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7       1 November 2002                                       67



Contexts for            Abstraction. Abstraction is required because one must
practice                create, in one's own mind, a structure for processing
(Continued)             whatever objective stimuli are provided so that a constancy
                        of interpretive information results. The emphasized terms,
                        create and constancy, focus the issue.

                        Example. An example will clarify this. Locations of fences in
                        airport environs are not constant. Further, teaching student
                        pilots to rely on a fence makes unnecessary the creating of a
                        system for processing stimulus conditions that can generalize
                        across landing fields.

                        Variable Practice Conditions. In restricted practice
                        conditions, students often learn to key on factors peculiar to
                        the conditions. In variable practice conditions, they are forced
                        to search for pertinent commonalities–constancy amid all
                        sorts of variations–and in so doing they abstract (create)
                        characteristics of individual cues and cue patterns that can be
                        recognized in numerous different stimulus complexes. This is
                        generalization.


Variations that      Full metaskill development requires practice of a number of
require              different skills, which involves more than simply varying
generalization       conditions for practicing individual skills. Even if restricted
                     practice conditions are indicated, introduce variations that require
                     generalization as soon as feasible in plans for practice.

                        Insert something new. This can be done even though
                        additional restricted practice is needed. Introduce periodically
                        something new that students have to think about, then return
                        to the restricted routine. This technique can keep the
                        generalization requirements in evidence, thus preventing
                        undue focus on cues and actions peculiar to immediate
                        practice requirements. It also provides opportunities for
                        monitoring progress toward skill adaptability that can be
                        valuable for individualization of instruction.

                        Think through. Whatever the purpose of a given lesson,
                        think through contexts for practice. Do not let them develop
                        inadvertently as a mechanical outgrowth of a focus on
                        proficiency requirements.

Boredom and            Regardless of the interest students may have in skills being
practice routines      trained, practice routines can become quite boring. This is
                       especially true when the actions involved are tediously difficult or
                       training content is a sequence of humdrum actions or details to
                       be assimilated. When boredom sets in, interest flags,
                       concentration is disrupted, and performance becomes
                       mechanical. Learning necessarily suffers. In fact, sloppy if not
                       outright erroneous performance often results. And if it does, it is
                       likely to become what the student learns.

                          Limit duration. Plan patterns of practice so that boring
                          routines are limited in duration for any one-practice session.

                          Intersperse. Boring routines should also be interspersed with
                          practice content that is intrinsically challenging or at least
                          interesting.

                          availability of different kinds of training equipment–CBT, part-
                          task trainers, and actual equipment–so students can switch
                          not only content but also training devices.

                       Diagnostic and Remedial Techniques

Individualization of   Individualization of instruction is probably most often achieved
instruction            through analyses of sources of individual learning difficulties and
                       of ways they can be directly addressed. Good instructors do this
                       regularly. By observing students during practice and questioning
                       them about apparent problems, instructors identify specific
                       difficulties and prescribe corrective practice routines for their
                       correction.


Increased need to      With the current emphasis on CBT and the correlated changes in
identify               instructor roles, there is an increased need for incorporating
                       diagnostic techniques and remedial instruction into courseware
                       itself.

                       It is necessary first to identify the kinds of difficulties that are likely
                       to arise, and to do so clearly enough to lay a foundation for
                       remedial instruction.


Monitoring             In addition to basic and integrated skill development, it is also
metaskill              possible to monitor metaskill development in at least two ways:
development
                          Day-to-day rates of progress. Over time the data collected
                          from this tracking can be used to derive a meaningful norm or
                          standard for a given stage of training. As a general rule, the
                          greater the metaskill development, the more rapid will be the
                          acquisition of a new variation or adaptation of the skill.

                          Assessment of the tasks and enterprises that form the
                          composite of the metaskill. Deficiencies in the composite
                          structure will normally be reflected as difficulties in specific
                          task or enterprise performance. The general principle is that
                          the degree and rate of skill decay are dependent on the
                          underlying metaskill.

The "Aha"           There is another consideration termed the "aha" phenomenon–
phenomenon          "Aha! I've got it!" The pattern is a relatively sudden emergence of
                    proficiency in specific skills following a period of little or no
                    apparent progress. Instructor pilots have noticed this sudden
                    insight manifested by the student's immediate improvement in a
                    number of related skills where there clearly was difficulty in all
                    earlier trials. In this case, the indicators of metaskill development
                    will not be apparent until the insight is acquired.


Proficiency of      Overall, once a metaskill is developed, proficiency of
performance         performance will have little variability. The indicator would be that
                    when the student performs the composite tasks and enterprises
                    in different circumstances or adaptations, and does them
                    proficiently, it is apparent that the student is approaching the
                    desired metaskill.

Approaches to         Gibbons (1993) described a method for selecting media for

                      activities. Examples of learning activities for each approach are
                      provided with possible media for supporting those activities. The
                      instructional designer should consider the learning activity for
                      which instruction is being prepared and select the appropriate
                      media to achieve the integrated goal, end goal, or terminal

Method for       A method for assessment of proficiency of performance by flight
assessment       event is to use the following grading criteria based on student
                 progress in context of instructor involvement. The scale goes
                 from total instructor demonstration (level 1.0) to no instructor
                 intervention (level 4.0). As a general rule, initial proficiency is
                 defined by achievement of level 3.0.

                         Grading Criteria on Student Progress Reports
                             The student demonstrated a lack of knowledge about the
                             task or made major deviations or omissions that made
                 Level 1.0   accomplishment of the task impossible. The instructor was
                             required to demonstrate proper accomplishment of the
                             task.
                             The student demonstrated limited knowledge of the task.
                             Although the student can begin the task, performance
                 Level 1.5
                             deteriorates quickly and extensive instructor interaction is
                             required to maintain safe accomplishment.
                             The student has a basic understanding of the task, but
                             errors or deviations are significant and would jeopardize
                 Level 2.0   safety or mission accomplishment. Even under ideal
                             conditions extensive instructor intervention is required for
                             safety or mission accomplishment.
                             The student made errors or deviations. Limited assistance
                             along with frequent coaching by the instructor was
                 Level 2.5   essential for safe accomplishment of the task. The student
                             has sufficient systems knowledge to make correct
                             response when provided coaching by the instructor.
                             The student accomplished the task successfully, but there
                             were slight errors or deviations that the student could not
                             correct. The instructor was required to provide coaching
                 Level 3.0   for smooth performance, but not for safe mission
                             accomplishment. The student can perform under ideal
                             conditions, but would have difficulty under adverse
                             conditions.
                             The student was able to accomplish the task safely and
                             successfully with minor errors or deviations. The student
                 Level 3.5
                             was able to correct these minor errors, and no assistance
                             was required from the instructor.
                             The student performed the task without errors or
                             deviations. No instructor intervention was required. The
                 Level 4.0
                             student has progressed beyond mere proficiency and could
                             probably perform well under adverse conditions.

Using the grading      This scale has been used successfully as grading criteria on
scale                  student progress in both simulation and inflight aircrew training.
                       The scale is the basis for rating forms that track the
                       crewmember's performance on each flight event. See the
                       following sample form.


Sample progress        A rating from the scale is given for each flight event accomplished
report form            during the training session. The form has the rating scale across
                       the top and the flight events by phase of flight listed down the
                       side. There is space to the side of each event for recording the
                       rating and any notes the instructor feels important to record.

                              Chapter 5
               GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING INSTRUCTION

Introduction        In the 1980s, William D. Spears worked on development of a
                    model aircrew training system for the Air Force. The training is
                    based on learning principles derived from analyses of complex
                    human performance and emphasizes mastery of learning and
                    development of metaskills.

                    A major goal of the training was the full integration of individual
                    skills in the individual crewmember and the same level of skill
                    integration (coordination) in the aircrew team. A major portion of
                    this handbook is based on the Spears writings.


Summary of          This handbook was written as a guide for applying the ISD
guidelines          process during aircrew training device design considerations.
                    This chapter summarizes the concepts presented throughout this
                    handbook.

                    The concepts have implications for design of training devices as
                    well as total training systems.

                    The guidelines are grouped and presented in the following order:

                       Presentation
                       Guidance
                       Practice: Content and Organization
                       Practice: Schedules
                       Feedback
                       Part-Task Training
                       Assessment of Progress and Difficulties


Presentation        Consider these four areas of presentation:

                    Build on Past Experience
                           Design each aspect of training with prior training
                           experience in mind. How can earlier exercises and
                           achievements be built upon?
AFH 36-2235    Volume 7       1 November 2002                                      84



Presentation         Emphasize meaning for all cues and actions through
(Continued)          associations with past experience, interrelations of skill
                     components, and performance objectives.
                     Contrive ways of presenting materials that require students to
                     verbalize what they are perceiving, doing, and why. In
                     addition, require them periodically to relate, verbally or
                     perceptually (via graphics, for example), what they are
                     perceiving and doing to things they already know or are
                     learning at the time. Insist on organization of experience, and
                     hence of skill knowledge.

                  Focus on Cognitive Learning Tasks
                    Emphasize logical relations among task objectives, situational
                    factors, and performance requirements. This should be done
                    for any kind of skill, procedural as well as perceptual-motor, or
                    application of concepts and principles.
                    Focus on related cognitive components during practice of
                    motor skills. Self-monitoring and evaluation via feedback
                    expectancies are always appropriate for their attention, and
                    performance plans and awareness of situational factors
                    usually are appropriate as well.
                    Ensure mastery of any information that must be built upon
                    during skill learning. To prevent forgetting or cognitive
                    isolation of previous learning, work it in periodically as it
                    applies to new skills being practiced. Refresher training can
                    be an alternative.
                    Present occasions for students to summarize their
                    understanding or actions in their own words. Do not simply
                    ask them to recognize a suitable summary as presented on
                    video, for example. Organic knowledge has to be self-
                    organized and skills self-performed. Picking out what to do
                    from a video display is quite different from performing in the
                    job where operators have to come up with options on their
                    own.
                    Lead students to use intrinsic cues as starting points in
                    recalling facts and principles. Use intrinsic cues to trigger
                    mnemonic systems.
                    Ensure meaning for all otherwise isolated events by relating
                    them to other aspects of skills or tasks.
AFH 36-2235    Volume 7       1 November 2002                                      85



Presentation      Skill Building
(Continued)          Encourage students to associate entire cue patterns /
                     sequences with entire action patterns / sequences through
                     questions and variations in conditions
                     If two or more skills or components are mutually supportive
                     (i.e., each can transfer to the other), have students practice
                     first those skills or components requiring the most precision in
                     performance.
                     Ensure practice on subordinate skills or components do not
                     continue for too long before tapping their transfer value in
                     practice of skills or components higher in the learning
                     hierarchy.

                  Consider the future
                    Design each aspect of training with future training in mind.
                    How will given exercises be built upon in the future?
                    Emphasize thinking ahead.


Guidance          Points to consider:

                     Use a variety of guidance early in training–models,
                     performance aids, checklists, examples, formats, instructions–
                     but as students progress, steadily reduce guidance to what
                     they can expect on the job.
                     Use guidance as necessary to prevent floundering on the part
                     of students, and undue repetition of erroneous actions. Note,
                     however, all errors would not be prevented; only corrected in
                     a timely manner. Discriminatory learning requires knowing
                     what is wrong as well as what is right.
                     Through explanations and especially through demonstrations,
                     periodically provide students with models of correct
                     performance.
                     In demonstration, include only what students can understand,
                     or be expected to understand, by the end of the exercise
                     (exception–when demonstrations are to broaden perspectives
                     for skills to be learned at the time).
                     Emphasize relations among cues and guide students in
                     identifying characteristics of cue patterns.
                     Guide students to note the feel of actions in order to recognize
                     kinesthetic feedback for planning and monitoring actions.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 7       1 November 2002                                      86



Guidance            For common errors in performance, illustrate how/when they
(Continued)         might occur by contrasting demonstrations of correct and
                    erroneous performance, emphasizing how and why they differ.
                    (Performance in this case includes cognitive as well as
                    perceptual-motor tasks. For example, incorrect applications of
                    concepts or principles.)
                    Following the earliest stages of practice on a skill, the
                    effectiveness of guidance depends on the complexity of the
                    skill. Simple motor actions require only feedback, but as
                    demands of a cognitive-perceptual matrix of tasks
                    requirements increase, guidance will be necessary, at least
                    periodically, until considerable progress has been made.


Practice:        Bear in mind that practice by itself is only a vehicle for, not a
Objectives       producer of, learning. Never leave it entirely up to students what
                 they will get from an exercise. Always be sure students
                 understand a clearly defined set of objectives for any exercise,

Practice:                 Accommodating interference
Objectives                Skill integration
(Continued)
                       Before students are very far along in skill development, provide
                       the specific information they need for an exercise (unless the
                       training objective is for them to learn to obtain the data on their
                       own) so as to avoid lost time in seeking information. As students
                       progress, reduce supplementary information to only what will be
                       available on the job.


Practice: Content      Consider the following three areas:
and organization
                       General Design Considerations
                         During early, rote stages of learning, do not overload students
                         with too many things–data, sequences, etc.–to remember at
                         one time. Organize data, sequences into meaningful
                         subgroups.
                         Brief pauses can often be as effective in long tedious practice
                         routines as long pauses. When total calendar time poses a
                         constraint, practice need not be distributed over days; several
                         sessions can be held in a single day, or even a morning or
                         afternoon.
                         As training media permit, arrange for students to attempt a
                         variety of skills related to those to be learned, whether or not
                         proficiency is to be achieved on some of the skills attempted.
                         As training media permits, require actions as they would occur
                         on the job.
                         Increase data processing load as students progress, ending
                         with a load characteristic of on-the-job performance, or even a
                         somewhat heavier load so as to provide practice under
                         pressure (some of the load should be due to naturally
                         occurring irrelevant information that has to be sorted out.)
                         Familiar skill components should dominate during mental
                         rehearsal.
                         Mental rehearsal should be more than a mechanical "ticking
                         off" of sequential cues and responses. Encourage students to
                         think why as well as what and when.

                       Effective Techniques
                          When developing encoding and elaboration of cues, focus on
                          intrinsic onset and feedback signals.
AFH 36-2235         Volume 7      1 November 2002                                      88



Practice: Content         For organic knowledge and metaskill development, regularly
and organization          vary conditions for performance, including performance
(Continued)               objectives. When feasible, vary how skills are to be
                          performed, reflecting on-the-job circumstances.
                          Require responses from students. When only mental actions
                          are called for, regularly require an overt response that can
                          indicate whether the mental actions were performed, and
                          correctly so.
                          Provide for actions to occur at appropriate intervals following
                          cues, unless the intent is to encourage analysis and self-
                          evaluation on the part of the students prior to responding.
                          Periodically require students to identify alternative
                          interpretations and courses of actions before responding and,
                          as appropriate, require them to anticipate what will happen
                          with each alternative.
                          When practicing decision-making, vary situational constraints
                          and specific performance goals, as well as cue patterns.
                          When kinesthetic cueing is involved, including sequential
                          procedural actions, provide for realistic action sequences and
                          focus students' attention on what they experience during
                          movements.
                              Encourage independent mental rehearsal, both before
                              and following a trial of all aspects of performance,
                              emphasizing:
                              Cues and their interpretation
                              Recognition of task requirements
                              Plans for performance
                              Expected outcome, step by step, during performance
                              How students themselves assess outcomes, step by step,
                              in light of task requirements
                              Awareness of situational factors and of what they are
                              doing in relation to task and situational requirements

                       Specific Issues
                         Be sure student responses are pertinent and well timed. Do
                         not introduce irrelevancies through required responses and do
                         not short-circuit thought processes.
                              In focusing on discrimination of cues and responses, first
                              emphasize correct interpretations and actions, illustrating
                              incorrect aspects only after a positive structure begins
                              developing. Let students see what is correct before
                              showing them what is not correct (do both, however, to
                              the extent necessary to learn required discriminations.)
AFH 36-2235         Volume 7       1 November 2002                                        89



Practice: Content              Vary irrelevant as well as relevant stimuli when teaching
and organization               cue discriminations and interpretations. Increase
(Continued)                    discrimination requirements as students progress.
                               Vary cue complexes in ways that require abstraction of
                               cue patterns for interpretation.
                               Unfamiliar components should be "flagged" in students'
                               minds in such a way that they say, "I've got to concentrate
                               on that the next time I do this." Familiar components
                               should dominate because too many "thats" will lead to
                               confusion.


Practice:              Consider the following:
Schedules
                          In allowing for total practice time, note that practice
                          requirements increase with the number of unfamiliar skill
                          components to be learned.
                          To the extent that learning is still in a serial stage, distributed
                          practice is generally more effective than massed practice. In
                          either case, do not let so much time elapse between practice
                          sessions that students have difficulty returning to earlier
                          proficiency levels.
                          The effectiveness of massed practice depends on the degree
                          of organic knowledge that students have at the time.
                          (Because general understanding increases with maturity and
                          experience, older students often profit from massed practice
                          when younger students do not.)
                          Continue provisions for practice of motor actions until they are
                          performed smoothly and without hesitation.
                          Ensure mastery of skill components through later periodic
                          repetition in original and especially new contexts.
                          Even though students may have mastered a skill earlier,
                          periodically require them to practice the skill in later exercises,
                          preferably through working it into current practice materials, or
                          through special arrangements that may not draw upon current
                          materials.
                          To help break restrictive sets induced by sequential tasks,
                          when tasks allow, provide for practice of different orders of
                          tasks during performance. Organic understanding as opposed
                          to mechanical, serial learning is thus enhanced, as is
                          development of metaskills.
AFH 36-2235   Volume 7       1 November 2002                                        90



Practice:           Encourage mental rehearsal of skills, both between practice
Schedules           sessions and prior to individual practice attempts. Not only
(Continued)         can mental rehearsal often substitute for actual practice on a
                    one-to-one basis, mental rehearsal also promotes skill
                    comprehension, planning, and self-monitoring.
                    Encourage mental rehearsal of all sequential steps at least
                    until organic understanding replaces serial knowledge.


Feedback         Consider the following three areas:

                 Intrinsic and Supplemental
                     Feedback should identify the nature of any discrepancy on the
                     student's part.
                     Intrinsic feedback, or supplemental feedback that symbolizes
                     it (i.e., when media cannot provide realistic intrinsic feedback),
                     should be timed as it is in real-world performance. Delays can
                     be acceptable up to a point unless the feedback is normally
                     kinesthetic or is used to cue a sequence of coordinated motor
                     actions.
                     For learning basic perceptual discriminations of cues and
                     intrinsic feedback, provide supplemental feedback as soon as
                     feasible.
                     Guide students to recognize and interpret intrinsic feedback
                     as indicators of personal success (i.e., in the sense of
                     motivational support). Students will likely take more pride in
                     their performance if they see for themselves that they are
                     doing a good job.

                 General Considerations
                   Use supplemental feedback generously early in training, but
                   steadily reduce it in amount and frequency to no more than
                   what will be provided on the job. Except when used for
                   general motivational purposes, supplemental feedback should
                   be specific to action components–cue recognition or
                   interpretation, individual responses, analysis of skill
                   requirements or situational factors that determine them.
                   Delays in supplemental feedback are beneficial provided
                   students pursue analysis of their actions during the interim. Do
                   not delay supplemental feedback if students are not likely to
                   pursue appropriate analyses of their actions.
AFH 36-2235          Volume 7       1 November 2002                                     91



Feedback                   To ensure analyses, guide students via questions to examine
(Continued)                their interpretation of requirements, what they did, and likely
                           outcomes.
                           Encourage students to seek and identify redundancy in
                           feedback cues during self-monitoring so as to confirm
                           adequacy of actions and identification of task requirements.
                           For some motor actions and perceptual discriminations, it is
                           not possible to communicate verbally just what students are to
                           do or perceive. In such cases it may be necessary to "shape"
                           the desired response by providing supplemental feedback for
                           ever-increasing approximations of what is desired. At the
                           same time, explain what you are doing, focusing on
                           characteristics of desired performance.

                        Effective Techniques
                           As learning progresses, reduce supplemental feedback so as
                           to:
                               Avoid dependence on feedback that will not occur in
                               operational situations.
                               Force students to identify and use intrinsic feedback.
                          As learning progresses, extend time between response and
                          feedback telling students that they have performed correctly or
                          incorrectly. Students must learn to evaluate their performance
                          on their own.
                          Do not be hasty in pointing out all student errors; Students
                          need to learn to detect errors themselves from intrinsic
                          feedback or from self-examination. Delayed feedback, with
                          guidance as necessary, can promote this kind of self-
                          examination and monitoring.


Part-task training      Purpose
                        Provide part-task practice to:
                           Simplify practice content.
                           Develop information-processing subsystems.
                           Reduce the number of skill parameters.
                           Establish preparatory sets.
                           Reduce interference.
                           Allow for appropriate amounts of training effort.
                           Make duration of practice reasonable.

Part-task training      Planning
(Continued)                In planning part-task training recognize that in many respects,
                           skill integration itself can often be a candidate for part-task
                           practice. In such a case, emphasis may be on interskill or
                           intercomponent cueing, critical stages in time-sharing, action
                           harmonics, or particular executive functions.
                           Recognize the interplay of cognitive, perceptual, and motor
                           processes in any skill, and treat any of these processes as
                           part-tasks when taught separately. Keep their eventual
                           integration in mind when designing training.
                           In planning part-task training, focus as much on information
                           processing variables as on objective descriptions of skill
                           components.
                        Anticipate, and provide for, the "two-way street" of bases for
                        meaning when:
                           Hands-on experience is needed to give concrete meaning to
                           concepts and principles.
                           Conceptual organization is needed as a framework for
                           understanding physical actions and perceptions of cues.
                           Group skills and skill components for part-task practice that:
                                 Comprise a set that is functionally independent of other
                                 skills.
                                 Involve mutual cueing to coordinate actions.
                                 Involve time-sharing that can be learned after separate
                                 skills or components are learned.
                                 Comprise a set of skills/components that do not vary
                                 when used in a variety of contexts or combinations with
                                 other skills.
                                 Comprise identifiable components or levels in learning
                                 hierarchies.
                                 Represent meaningful combinations, considering
                                 students' present levels of understanding.
                                 Involve integrative processes, which are themselves
                                 objectives of part-task practice.
                           Keep plans for part-task practice adaptable to individual
                           learning styles. Permit students to go from part-task to whole-
                           task practice and back again.

Part-task training      Effective Techniques
(Continued)                Arrange to keep whole-task requirements in mind while
                           students practice part-tasks; encourage verbalization for this
                           purpose, and provide occasional practice in whole-task
                           contexts as needed.
                                As availability of media permit, incorporate different media
                                in part-task practice, and especially with respect to:
                                Interspersed, occasional whole-task practices.
                                Freedom for students to self-impose foci for part-task
                                emphasis.
                           Ensure that integral sets of kinesthetic cueing sequences are
                           fully represented in part-task practice.
                           Provide preliminary and subsequent periodic overviews of
                           whole-task requirements as a context for part-task practice.
                           When part-task practice involves multiple skills or
                           components, permit students to select and vary sequences to
                           focus on at given times. (Recall that students self-impose
                           part-task practice in whole-task situations, and usually in
                           idiosyncratic ways.)

                        Skill Interference
                           If skills comprising the same tasks interfere with each other
                           when being learned, separate the troublesome component
                           skills for part-task practice so as to avoid or at least reduce
                           interference while learning.
                           Let part-task practice on mutually interfering skills continue
                           until performance becomes fairly automatic for at least one
                           part-task set. However, periodically confront students with
                           whole-task requirements so as to force recognition of the need
                           to integrate part-tasks into whole tasks. Such confrontations
                           should be more frequent as the possibility increases of
                           learning incompatible habits in contexts for part-task practice.


Whole-task vs.          Experienced students (i.e., those who have previously learned or
part-task training      at least practiced whole-skills) are more adaptable to part-task
                        practice because whole-task contexts and coordination
                        requirements are more familiar. Consider the following points:
AFH 36-2235          Volume 7      1 November 2002                                     94



Whole-task vs.             Continue part-task practice (with occasional practice in whole-
part-task training         task contexts as needed) until a reasonable level of mastery is
(Continued)                achieved (i.e., performances become stable or consistent).
                           Avoid development of motor rhythms and harmonics during
                           part-task practice that might be incompatible with whole-task
                           skills that are practiced separately; check performance during
                           occasional whole-task efforts to monitor any difficulties.
                           Do not continue part-task practice beyond the point of
                           appropriately targeted part-task proficiency. Otherwise, cue-
                           action sequences pertaining only to part-tasks may become
                           "set," resulting in difficulty in whole-task integration.
                           The order of practice of different part-tasks should conform to
                           optimum transfer processes in learning hierarchies.


Assessment of           Consider the following:
progress and
difficulties               If student actions are to be a basis for later analysis or
                           diagnosis of difficulties, significant indicators in students'
                           actions should be recorded.
                           Arrange for records of kind and frequency of errors made
                           during practice. Records should be separate by student for
                           individualization of training, and cumulative across students
                           for assessing the training program.
                           As students progress through a training program, they should
                           learn new skills more quickly than they would have learned the
                           same skills if they had practiced them earlier. If students do
                           not progress in speed of learning, there may be a deficiency in
                           the development of their metaskills and/or organic
                           organization of overall skill knowledge.
                           As with the preceding guide, if skills degrade substantially
                           after relatively brief periods of no practice, metaskills
                           development and/or organic knowledge may be lacking.
                           Remedial training should focus on these high-order factors;
                           limited refresher training may get them through a performance
                           check, but later on-the-job performance may be deficient.
AFH 36-2235     Volume 7      1 November 2002                                      95



Assessment of      Interrupted Progress
progress and
difficulties       If student progress seems to slow down or stop too soon, check
(Continued)
                   for:

                      Cognitive Failures
                         Lack of adequate chunking during encoding (poor short-
                         term retention).

                      Cognitive Failures (Continued)
                         Lack of recall of details of what they have just done and
                         why (poor cognitive structuring).
                         Persistence in the same inadequate actions
                         (misunderstanding of the problem, task requirements,
                         intrinsic feedback, and/or lack of meaningful checkpoints
                         for self-assessment).
                         Failure to recognize intrinsic feedback (consequent
                         dependence on supplemental feedback).
                         Inability to adapt to changes (if any) in task requirements
                         or conditions (poor generalizations).
                         Poor retention of basic task-situational requirements (lack
                         of organization of task knowledge).
                         Tendency to react in ways that have undesirable
                         outcomes (failure to assess effects of actions–lack of
                         organic knowledge).
                         Need for excessive guidance (inadequate skill
                         understanding, or inability to make effective use of
                         knowledge–overdependence on guidance, no self-starting
                         "programs" for open- and/or closed-loop actions).

                      Cue Processing Failures
                         Lack of an open-loop performance program (inadequate
                         mastery or habitualization of basic cue processing and
                         actions).
                         Tendency to simply react to cues and task conditions with
                         no plans or even knowledge of what to do or expect (no
                         expectancies; failure to stay ahead of system–poor
                         organic knowledge).
                         Failure to note, assess, and prioritize all cues (cue-pattern
                         deficiency).
                         Failure to discriminate false or irrelevant cues (cue or cue-
                         pattern deficiency).
AFH 36-2235     Volume 7       1 November 2002                                         96

difficulties               Undue delays in student responses (confusion regarding
(Continued)                cues, their interpretations, action requirements; cue
                           and/or action interference; insufficient mastery of at least
                           some skill components).

                   Plateaus

                   Students will often reach temporary "plateaus" where, to a casual
                   observer, progress has ceased. It is at such points that
                   significant new integrations of skill components normally occur,
                   resulting eventually in a fairly rapid increase in proficiency.
                      If a plateau seems to occur too soon (i.e., at too low a level of
                      proficiency), or last too long, there is a need to find out why
                      and correct the underlying difficulty.
                      If too soon, refer to the indicators listed immediately above.
                      If a plateau seems to persist too long, skill integration is likely
                      a problem.

                   Additional Issues

                   In addition to the items above, check for emerging requirements
                   (if any) in chunking and integration of skill components, which in
                   this case are especially relevant aspects of organic knowledge.

                   Periodically–weekly, daily, action-by-action, as appropriate–
                   provide students with nonthreatening updates regarding their
                   progress. Be specific as to successes and shortcomings.

                                        TERMS


Attitude. (a) The emotions or feelings that influence a learner's desire or choice to
       perform a particular task. (b) A positive alteration in personal and professional
       beliefs, values, and feelings that will enable the learner to use skills and
       knowledge to implement positive change in the work environment. Also see
       Knowledge and Skill.

Behavior. Any activity, overt or covert, capable of being measured.

Computer-Based Training (CBT). Training in which computers are used for both
    training delivery and training management. The management functions often
    include scheduling, lesson selection, scorekeeping, and quality of student
    responses.

Constraints. Limiting or constraining conditions or factors, such as policy
     considerations, time limitations, equipment, environmental factors, personnel,
     budgetary, or other resource limitations.

Discrimination. The process of making different responses to a stimulus. A
      discrimination requires a person to determine the differences among inputs and
      to respond differently to each.

Enterprise. An integrated, purposeful activity that usually leads to accomplishment of a
      goal. The importance of an enterprise is that it is purposeful and relevant to the
      learner; it motivates learning behavior necessary to complete the component
      tasks. Also see Metaskill and Schema.

Fidelity. The degree to which a task or a training device represents the actual system
       performance, characteristics, and environment.

Generalization. Learning to respond to a new stimulus that is similar, but not identical,
     to one that was present during original learning. For example, during learning a
     child calls a beagle and a spaniel by the term "dog"; a child who has generalized
     would respond "dog" when presented with a hound.

Instructional System. An integrated combination of resources (students, instructors,
      materials, equipment, and facilities), techniques, and procedures performing
      effectively and efficiently the functions required to achieve specified learning
      objectives.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7        1 November 2002                                     104


Instructional System Developer. A person who is knowledgeable of the instructional
      system development (ISD) process and is involved in the analysis, design,
      development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional systems. Also
      called Instructional Designer, Instructional Developer, Curriculum Developer,
      Curriculum Development Manager, and other terms.

Instructional System Development (ISD). A deliberate and orderly, but flexible,
      process for planning, developing, implementing, and managing instructional
      systems. ISD ensures that personnel are taught in a cost-efficient way the skills,
      knowledge, and attitudes essential for successful job performance.

Job Performance Requirements (JPR). The tasks required of the human component
     of the system, the conditions under which these tasks may be performed, and the
     quality standards for acceptable performance. JPRs describe what people
     should do to perform their jobs.

Knowledge. Use of the mental processes that enable a person to recall facts, identify
     concepts, apply rules or principles, solve problems, and think creatively.
     Knowledge is not directly observable. A person manifests knowledge through
     performing associated overt activities. Also see Attitude and Skill.

Learning. A change in the behavior of the learner as a result of experience. The
      behavior can be physical and overt, or it can be intellectual or attitudinal.

Media. The delivery vehicle for presenting instructional material or basic
      communication stimuli to a student to induce learning. Examples are instructors,
      textbooks, slides, and interactive courseware (ICW).

Metaskill. Cognitive strategy that an individual applies to the processing of new
     information in a situation not previously experienced. Metaskills include chunking
     or organizing new information, recalling relevant schemas, adding new
     information to old schemas, and creating new schemas. These skills are highly
     developed and demonstrated by experts in the context of complex enterprises.
     Also see Enterprise and Schema.

Metrics. Measurement tools used for assessing the qualitative and quantitative
      progress of instructional development with respect to the development standards
      specified.

Motor Skill. Physical actions required to perform a specific task. All skills require some
      type of action.

Performance. Part of a criterion objective that describes the observable student
      behavior (or the product of that behavior) that is acceptable to the instructor as
      proof that learning has occurred.
AFH 36-2235       Volume 7        1 November 2002                                      105


Schema. An individual's organization of knowledge. Different levels of learners have
     different types of schemas. The novice has a sketchy structure into which new
     information can be placed. The experienced learner has a better structure and is
     a quicker learner than the novice. The expert has a highly developed structure
     and is capable of rapid learning with little support. Also see Enterprise and
     Metaskill.

Skill. The ability to perform a job-related activity that contributes to the effective
       performance of a task. Skills involve physical or manipulative activities, which
       often require knowledge for their execution. All skills are actions having specific
       requirements for speed, accuracy, or coordination. Also see Attitude and
       Knowledge.

Target Audience. The total collection of possible users of a given instructional system.
      The persons for whom the instructional system is designed.

Task. A unit of work activity or operation, which forms a significant part of a duty. A
      task usually has clear beginning and ending points and directly observable or
      otherwise measurable processes, frequently but not always resulting in a product
      that can be evaluated for quantity, quality, accuracy, or fitness in the work
      environment. A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent
      upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or
      job array.

Task Analysis. The process of describing job tasks in terms of Job Performance
      Requirements (JPR) and the process of analyzing these JPRs to determine
      training requirements. Also see Job Performance Requirements.

Training. A set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner,
      through one or more media, for the attainment and retention of skills, knowledge,
      and attitudes required to meet job performance requirements.

Training Needs Assessment (TNA). The study of performance and the environment
      that influences it in order to make recommendations and decisions on how to
      close the gap between the desired performance and the actual performance.

Training System. A systematically developed curriculum including, but not necessarily
      limited to, courseware, classroom aids, training simulators and devices,
      operational equipment, embedded training capability, and personnel to operate,
      maintain, or employ a system. The training system includes all necessary
      elements of logistic support.
