Preface

1. This CFETP is a comprehensive education and training document identifying life-cycle education and
training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for an Air Force Specialty
(AFS). The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success, instill rigor in all aspects of
career field training, and serve as the “Contract for Training” between Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) and a career field. Note: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II as
a guide to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors at all levels plan, manage, and control training within
their specialty using both parts of the plan.

   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
   explains the overall use of the plan; Section B identifies career-field progression information, duties
   and responsibilities, training decisions, and career field path; Section C associates each level with
   specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); Section D indicates
   resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E
   identifies transition training guide requirements for Staff Sergeant (SSgt) through Master Sergeant
   (MSgt).

   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the STS to include duties, tasks, and
   technical references to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core task, and
   correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
   standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C
   identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) which
   may be developed to support proficiency training. Section D identifies a training course index that
   supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included in the section are
   both mandatory and optional courses, as well as exportable courseware. Section E identifies
   MAJCOM-unique training requirements that supervisors can use to determine additional training
   required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II
   to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Section F
   identifies HST references and course material required for this specialty in support of
   contingency/wartime training.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and
efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today’s
workforce for tomorrow’s jobs.

PART I:

Section A – General Information

4. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field
Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers, to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field
training program. This plan outlines the training individuals require in this AFS in order to develop and
progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and
proficiency training and serves as the contract between AETC and a functional community. Initial skills
training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon
                                                     4
retraining into a specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at
one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task
qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-,
7-, and 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to
qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the
upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do
the job. Advanced training is a formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one or
more positions of their AFS with additional skill/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.
Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced level of the AFS. Proficiency training is
additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job (OJT)
training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for
upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes. These purposes are:

   4.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
   program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
   individual’s career.

   4.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
   recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

   4.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and training
   delivery methods.

   4.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field
   training process.

5. Uses of the CFETP. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

   5.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and
   exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the
   CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM, Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency Force
   Development (HQ AFCESA/CEOM) to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed
   to provide the identified training.

   5.2. MFMs will ensure all training programs at the MAJCOM level complement the CFETP
   mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training, contract training,
   Air Force Qualification Training Package assessments, or exportable courses can satisfy identified
   requirements. MAJCOM developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into
   the plan.

   5.3. Unit Training Managers (UTMs) and supervisors must ensure each individual completes the
   mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental requirements) for the upgrade
   training specified in the training plan.

   5.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The
   list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

6. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training
requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and
accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

9. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass
the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Operations Management career field. The spectrum
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be
apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.
Members of the Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) held on 14-17 April 2009 at Sheppard
AFB, TX reviewed all skill level training and requirements. The following training decisions were
made:

   9.1. Initial Skills Training. The 3-level apprentice course was reviewed for content. Additions,
   deletions, and modifications were made to the course using Mission Ready Airman (MRA) as the
   guiding criteria. Wartime training tasks were identified and validated.

   9.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Reviewed existing 5-level CDC requirements to
   ensure additions and changes to the 5-level column in the STS were made to keep information current.

   9.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Additional 7-level skill requirements were
   incorporated into the CFETP to ensure adequate career progression and training was met. The result
   of this review was that a supplemental course was required to bridge the gap in training after initial
   skills training.

                                                     9
9.4. Proficiency Training. Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught
through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training. The purpose of
continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements with
emphasis on present and future duty positions. MAJCOMs must develop a continuation training
program that ensures personnel in the Operations Management career field receive the necessary training
at the appropriate point in their career. The training program will identify both mandatory and optional
training requirements.

  9. 5. Supplemental Training. Supplemental training when applicable, SMEs review formal resident
  supplemental training course requirements for technical accuracy and identify training that is no
  longer required. Based on MAJCOM input, AETC training personnel develop and provide Course
  Training Standards (CTS) documents to list the knowledge and skills required in a particular area of
  the AFS.

10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon award of
primary AFSC. CCAF which is located at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, provides the opportunity to obtain an
Associate of Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the
following:

  10.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. The instructor must:
      10.1.1. be a full-time instructor teaching a CCAF course at an affiliated school at the time of
  nomination.
     10.1.2. be assigned to a CCAF course(s) in CCAF STARS-FD.
     10.1.3. have at least 2 years teaching experience as a CCAF instructor from the DAID.
     10.1.4. have teaching experience documented either on the CCAF Occupational Instructor
     Certification Teaching Experience Log, Version 2 or in the STARS-FD CCAF Occupational
     Instructor Certification Teaching Experience Log.
     10.1.5. have at least 2,000 hours of documented practical experience teaching a CCAF course(s).
     10.1.6. hold an associate or higher-level degree from an accredited institution.
     10.1.7. have completed a 12-semester-hour CCAF Instructor Teaching Internship.
     10.1.8. have completed at least 3-semester-hours of CCAF-approved instructor methodology
     coursework.
     10.1.9. be recommended by the school commander, commandant or PME flight chief.

  10.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification
  is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment
  process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman,
  Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager). All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

  10.3. Professional Manager Certification (PMC). A professional credential awarded by CCAF that
  formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and experience in leadership and
  management, as well as professional accomplishments. The program provides a structured
  professional development track that supplements Enlisted Professional Military Education (EPME)
  and Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).

  10.4. Air University Associate to Baccalaureate Cooperative (AU-ABC). The Air Universities
  ABC program directs Airmen with an associate in applied science degrees from the Community
  College of the Air Force (CCAF) to a collection of accredited “military friendly” colleges and
  universities to consider when completing a four-year degree. The program maximizes the application
  of military career education and training,

11. The Maintenance Production Management Associates Degree (4VJG) applies to AFSC 3E6X1.

    11.1 Degree requirements. The Maintenance Production Management Associates Degree (4VJG)
    applies to the 3E6X1 career field. One degree requirement is that individuals must hold the 5-skill
    level at the time of the 4VJG program completion. As with most of CCAF degree programs, the

     that meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable
     the Air Force to perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used
     by engineers in designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and
     compass together symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force Civil Engineer.
     Finally, the wings help to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and
     aviation components; and that the built environment is the foundation supporting Air
     Force mission and people.

PART II

Section A – Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level
course with classes beginning 8 December 2010 and graduating on or after 15 February 2011.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and the Air Force Civil
Engineer Career Field Manager has made it mandatory for all civil engineers regardless of duty
assignment to use the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) application located on the AFCESA Civil
Engineer Virtual Learning Center (CE-VLC) to document upgrade and qualification training.

   2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical Reference[TR]) the most common tasks,
   knowledge, and supporting TRs necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill
   level.

   2.2. Lists in Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an
   asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column. As a minimum, trainees must complete all
   core, critical, and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.

   2.3. Tasks identified by a diamond () are considered contingency/war tasks and are critical to the
   career field. Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with the actual hands-on
   certification of these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction,
   completion of the corresponding task web-based AFQTP or passing the standalone AFQTP
   assessment (if developed) is all that is required for upgrade training.

   2.4. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
   training requirements. Use AFTR to document technician qualifications. Task certification of core,
   critical, and diamond tasks require a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and
   certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer
   only.

   2.5. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
   proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task,
   knowledge, and the career knowledge provided by formal courses, CDCs, ADL, and AFQTPs.

   2.6. Identifies qualitative requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to
   indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by ADL, resident training, and career
   development courses.

   2.7. Becomes a JQS for OJT training when placed in AFTR and used according to AFI 36-2201. For
   OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual
   can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and
   correct use of procedures. AFQTPs, when available, will be used to identify Air Force standardized
   procedures. When used as a JQS, the following documentation applies:

       2.7.1. Duty position requirements will be developed and identified by the supervisor along with
       the Unit Training Manger (UTM) and loaded in AFTR. Completion of core, critical, and
       diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions. Ensure the correct duty position title is listed
       under Profile 1 section of trainees’ AFTR record.


                                                    23
   2.7.2. AFQTP Training and Documentation. AFQTP or AFQTP assessments are mandatory and
   must be completed to fulfill task knowledge requirements on core and diamond tasks for upgrade
   training.

       2.7.2.1. Training. Document the start and completion of the AFQTP on the QTP Tab located
       in AFTR. This is required for all Core and Diamond tasks, AFTR will not let you signed off
       any tasks in the Job Qualification Standard (JQS) until the completion date has been entered.
       Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the review and post test
       located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on the AFCESA CE-
       VLC to determine if the trainee has attained the knowledge level required. A minimum
       passing score of 80% is required. Once the trainee has completed the web-based course or
       AFQTP assessment, they must take their certificate to their trainer/supervisor to document the
       completion in AFTR and complete hands-on training if the equipment is available.

       2.7.2.2. Hands-On Training. DO NOT sign off the tasks in the Job Qualification Standard
       (JQS) tab until the trainee has completed hands-on/certification training. For diamond tasks,
       if the equipment is not available at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP
       assessment is all that is required for upgrade. When the equipment becomes available either
       at home station or at a TDY location, the trainee can be signed off on the JQS tab in AFTR.

   2.7.3. Transcribing from previous versions to new CFETP. Most items should transcribe
   automatically during the update in AFTR. The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of
   the new STS to identify any new core or diamond or non-core tasks and add those tasks to the
   duty positions.

       2.7.3.1. For new core or diamond tasks the trainer will ensure the trainee is trained and
       qualified to the go/no go level. Upon completion of the training the trainee, trainer, and
       certifier will enter their initials and completion date in AFTR.


       2.7.3.2. For non-core tasks the trainer will ensure the trainee is trained and qualified to the
       go/no go level. Upon completion of the training the trainee and trainer will enter their initials
       and completion date in AFTR.

   2.7.4. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies
   STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge in accordance with (IAW)
   AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all
   mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101. For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit
   commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be
   documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.

   2.7.5. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task,
   the supervisor shall click on the decertify button in the JQS tab. enter airman into qualification
   training. AFTR will automatically generate an AF Form 623a entry and the supervisor will enter
   the reason for decertification. The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.

2.8. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion
System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational
Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career field. The tests
sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most
appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the

                                                24
   WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military
   Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the ARC personnel.

2.9. Tasks identified by a pyramid (Δ) have been selected by the AFCFM to be CBRNE Defense
    Functional Area Task Qualification Training (TQT) requirements. Individual supervisors and
    trainers will train and evaluate individual demonstration-performance objectives identified in the
    STS. TQT provides personnel the ability to demonstrate proficiency in performing mission-critical
    tasks in a CBRNE environment. TQT must be accomplished after CBRNE Defense Awareness and
    Survival Skills.

3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning quality of AETC
training. Reference this STS and address correspondence regarding changes to 782 TRG/TGAV, 620 9th
Avenue, Suite 3, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2368. A customer service information line has been installed
for the supervisors' convenience to identify graduates who may have received excessive or insufficient
training on task/knowledge items listed in this training standard. For a quick response to problems, call

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

Δ - CBRNE Defense Functional Area Task Qualification Training (TQT) requirements.

 - Contingency/war tasks and are critical to the career field.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during war time.

Section B – Course Objective List (COL)
(This section used when developing lesson plans)

4. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

4.1. Written Test (W) - Used to sample each knowledge objective and the knowledge
components of performance objectives.

4.2. Performance Test (P) - Used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to
measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning activity
has been completed.

4.3. Progress Checks (PC) - Administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory
instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or performance objectives.

5. Standard. Standards for written and performance measurement are indicated in the objectives
and delineated on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided as needed
during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until
satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing
the task.

7. COL. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by block of instruction.

7.1. Initial Skills Course. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be obtained
by written request to 366 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2254.

Section C – Support Material

8. Air Force Qualification Training Packages (AFQTPs).

8.1. AFQTP. An instructional package designed for trainees to qualify on core or diamond tasks.
AFQTPs are the standardized method for performing the task. The AFQTP are paper-based
products that may lead to the completion of computer- or web-based courses or other audiovisual
media for a particular piece of equipment or procedure. See the AFCESA web pages for up-to-
date AFQTPs at: HQ AFCESA/CEOM portal website

8.2. AFQTP Assessments.

   8.2.1. The AFQTP assessment is a computer-based evaluation tool on the AFCESA CE-VLC
   to ensure skilled civil engineers are available to meet the Air Force’s changing needs. It
   enhances OJT and QTP training by evaluating an individual's knowledge of the principles and
   procedures in each specialty.

                                                  43
  8.2..2. These assessments are mandatory evaluation, required for upgrade. All core (*/**) and
  diamond (♦) coded tasks on the STS have a corresponding mandatory assessment as a
  standalone or incorp.


8.3. AFCESA CE-VLC also has optional career development course (CDC) end-of-course
assessments to be used by the unit commander, unit training manager, and supervisor to provide
them an indication how well the trainee has studied to pass their actual CDC end-of-course exam
at the base training office. These assessments contain the volume review exercises and an overall
assessment for the each set, if applicable. The evaluation assessments are password protected and
the UTM is the only one provided the password to unlock them. Commanders are encouraged to
integrate these tools in their unit’s OJT program.


8.4. The mandatory AFQTP assessments are listed in each AFQTP, if required.

                                               45
Section F – Home Stations Training (HST)

17. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and training
sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces will train to
meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges from
knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training conducted
in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-210,
Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.

   17.1. HST Definition. HST is training that is conducted at the individual’s home station for
   contingency operations. The CE commander ensures training is provided, documented, and
   arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. HST requirements are
   identified in AFI 10-210, Attachments 2 and 3.

      17.1.1. Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon assignment to the unit, all
      military and emergency-essential civilian employees will be trained on the unit’s Prime
      BEEF and Emergency Management missions. The training will emphasize the individual’s
      role and how he or she fits into the program. It will also include an overview of Civil
      Engineer Doctrine and explain the organization, training, equipment, operating concepts,
      and contingency missions pertaining to the unit.

           17.1.1.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an
           integral part of any HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI
           FREEDOM have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat
           readiness. Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does
           not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps
           taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness level capable of
           supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk combat environments.

           17.1.1.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS).                     Wartime or
           contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-
           essential equipment that civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations.
           Due to the cost and complexity, mission essential contingency equipment and trainer
           expertise are not commonly found at Continental United States (CONUS)
           installations. Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented
           in their CFETP. AFI 10-210 identifies minimum personnel to be trained, positions by
           specialty, frequencies and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key
           equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations. CBRNE
           Defense Functional Area Task Qualification Training (TQT) provides personnel the
           ability to demonstrate proficiency in performing mission-critical tasks in a CBRNE
           environment. TQT requirements must be accomplished after CBRNE Defense
           Awareness and Survival Skills and are outlined in Part 2, Section A, Para 2.9.

17.1.2. Silver Flag Training. Silver Flag Exercise Sites are located at Tyndall AFB, FL;
Ramstein AB, Germany; and Kadena AB, Japan. They conduct training with their major focus on
students being able to perform critical contingency task in a team environment. The training

                                                46
focuses on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using hands-on training with basic
expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) equipment in a realistic beddown environment. Where
possible, combat skills training has been added to the curriculum to ensure realism and help
fortify combat skills mentality amongst teams. All CE personnel who fill Unit Type Code (UTC)
positions will receive team training at Silver Flag Exercise Sites with the exception of members
on headquarters staff augmentation UTCs, pavement evaluation UTCs, generator repair, and
maintenance UTCs.
