1. Program Overview. Everyday, United States soldiers, sailors, airm en, and m arines are
recovering at various m ilitary treatment facilities (MTFs) due to injuries sustained while on
active duty status. As a result, the Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented the Computer
Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) for DoD employees and service m embers, to
include our Wounded Warriors. CAP provides real solutions for real needs while ensuring that
people with disabilities and wounded service m embers have equal access to the inform ation
environment and opportunities in the Federal gove rnment. CAP works closely with service
members across the nation to ensure they recei ve appropriate assistive technology for their
needs. Accommodations are available for servi ce members and DoD em ployees with injuries
that have caused cognitive and com munication difficulties, dexterity im pairments, hearing and
vision loss.

5. CAP Accommodation Process. The first step in the CAP pr ocess is completing the online
needs assessment to determ ine the m ost appropriate AT solution f or the patient. A com plete
needs assessment is a critical step in the CAP accommodation process and should be done on a
case-by-case basis.

5.1. W ounded Service Mem ber (WSM) needs a ssessment provides the CAP office with
information to identify the best assistive tec hnology for the patient. Needs assessm ents shall
include identification of training needs, t     echnical specifications for com puters and/or
telecommunication systems, and aspects of         service members’ functional limitations and
computing or communication tasks. Once com pleted, the needs assessm ent information shall be
submitted       to CAP as part of                  the    AT request via the URL:
http://tricare.mil/cap/wsm/accom_process/request.cfm?type=request

5.1.1. CAP will make the accommodation solution based on the responses in the assessm ent. It
is critical that com plete information on all lim itations experienced due to the injury/im pairment
is provided.

5.1.2. The 59 MDW CAP representative, case m anager, therapist/provider m ay complete and
submit WSM needs assessment to the DoD CAP office.

5.1.2.1. Service members and their families may submit WSM needs assessment only after they
coordinate their assessment with their medical providers, CAP representative and/or therapist.

5.1.3. The CAP office m ay request additional m edical documentation or m edical test after
receiving WSM needs assessm ent request. Thus, it is recom mended to disclose all functional
limitations and disabling conditions when completing the assessment.

5.1.4. The DoD CAP office will notify the patient and therapist/59 MDW CAP Representative
regarding the best assistive technology for the patient (if approved) after receiving the W SM
needs assessment.

5.1.5. The AT shall be procured by DoD CAP o ffice and delivered to the 59 MDW or other
appropriate location at no cost to the 59 MDW or location. If requested, CAP shall also procure
training and technical integration support services for the patient.
