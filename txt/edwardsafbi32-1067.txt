This instruction implements Air Force Instruction 32-1067, Water Systems. It provides
responsibilities and procedures to control the use of potable water that will allow adequate
storage capacities for firefighting protection. It is designed to establish an effective conservation
management program. It applies to all organizations on Edwards AFB. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’ s chain of command. This publication may be supplemented at any level,
but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to
certification and approval. Request for waivers must be submitted to the OPR listed above for
consideration and approval, Air Force personnel must ensure any information/records to be
provided outside official DoD channels, including foreign nationals, must be released in
accordance with the provisions of AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Review Process, and have the
approval of the release authority. If a written request for DoD records has been made by an
persons, organization, business, excluding a Federal Agency, that either explicitly or implicitly

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision implements changes in notification procedures to include Dryden Flight Research
Center (DFRC) and the Schools District Office. Additional changes include updates to the
instruction title (EAFBI) as this instruction only applies to EAFB, and office symbols due to the
412th Civil Engineer Directorate transformation.
1. Responsibilities. The Installation Commander (412 TW/CC) is the authority for
implementing the conditions defined in paragraph 4. below. The Base Civil Engineer is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective water conservation management
program. The success of the program depends on maximum cooperation from all base functions
and activities.
2. Purpose. This regulation provides actions necessary to minimize the impact of an emergency
water supply situation.
3. Operations. This regulation executes four condition categories depending on the relationship
between water production capabilities and water demand. Edwards AFB potable water is
supplied from deep wells located on base and purchased water from the Antelope Valley Eastern
Kern (AVEK) water district. During the summer months, peak consumption severely taxes
production capacity and depletes storage levels needed for fire protection. The Water/Gas/Fuel
Section of the 412th Test Wing Civil Engineer Division (412 TW/CE) maintains a decision table
that identifies the four water supply situations. All four situations require water conservation.
4. Conditions Defined
     4.1. Normal:
        4.1.1. No special actions required.
        4.1.2. Under normal conditions Military Family Housing (MFH) residents may water
        yards as necessary to maintain healthy lawns/shrubs. Residents are asked to use only
        what is needed, applying good judgment just as if they were paying for the water
        personally and follow guidelines below to the maximum extent possible.
            4.1.2.1. Recommend watering from 0600-0900 or 1700-2000 to minimize water
            waste through evaporation.
            4.1.2.2. Lawn watering, maximum duration is 10 minutes at a time to improve
            ground absorption and minimize loss through run off; multiple waterings in one day
            are preferable to long watering periods.
            4.1.2.3. No watering on Wednesday except brown spots, new plants/trees. This
            measure has been adopted to allow water reservoir recovery during midweek.
     4.2. Limited:
        4.2.1. Restricted MFH lawn watering.
        4.2.2. Odd/even day watering to match odd/even street numbering.
        4.2.3. Lawn watering no more than 10 minutes per day; recommend two 5-minute
        periods.
        4.2.4. In non-MFH areas, reduce automatic lawn sprinklers to three days a week.
EDWARDSAFBI32-1067 2 APRIL 2014                                                              3


   4.3. Critical:
       4.3.1. No watering of any lawns or trees on base. In this situation as well as
       “emergency” below, water conditions are of such a critical status that lawns and trees
       may have to suffer for lack of water.
       4.3.2. Shut down automatic lawn sprinklers throughout base, including contracted areas.
       4.3.3. Stop washing of government and private vehicles and aircraft.
       4.3.4. Stop fire hydrant testing.
       4.3.5. Do not fill home pools.
   4.4. Emergency:
       4.4.1. No watering of any lawns or trees on base.
       4.4.2. Shut down automatic sprinklers throughout base, including contracted areas.
       4.4.3. Stop washing of government vehicles and aircraft.
       4.4.4. Stop fire hydrant testing.
       4.4.5. Do not fill home pools.
       4.4.6. Stop operation of base pools.
       4.4.7. Restrict consumption at homes and dormitories. 412 TW/CC will consider the
       following restrictions to water use in both MFH and duty areas and announce
       implementation in accordance with paragraph five below.
          4.4.7.1. Showers
          4.4.7.2. Cooking
          4.4.7.3. Flushing
5. Notification Procedures. A communication procedure will be established within 412
TW/CE to alert the appropriate activities. These activities include the Command Post, Office of
Public Affairs, Security Police, Transportation, Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC), Schools
District Office and Fire Department.
