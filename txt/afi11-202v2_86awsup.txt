SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This supplement has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1.3.3.1. (Added) Waiver Request Process. Units will use the following process when
requesting waivers (except AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and AFI 11-2MDSV1 waivers) for
86 OG aircrew and missions. The primary method of processing waivers is via eSSS. If
time/conditions do not permit the use of eSSS, email or verbal waiver processing is authorized.
Email or verbal waiver requests/approval will be followed up with eSSS notification at the
earliest opportunity.
1.3.3.1.1. (Added) Normal Duty Hours. During normal duty hours, format the 86 OG/CC
waiver/approval in official electronic Staff Summary Sheet (eSSS). See sample letter on the
OGV SharePoint website https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/86OG/OGV/default.aspx, under
―Waiver Examples.‖ Include, at a minimum, requested waiver reference (specific
regulation/paragraph requesting to be waived), specific details and explanation of request (full
details explaining the who, what, when, where, why, and how), and results or mission impact if
waiver is not granted. Include any supporting documentation with the request. 86 OG/OGV will
concur/non-concur and electronically forward the eSSS. The 86 OG/CC (or designated
representative) will coord or approve/disapprove, electronically sign the eSSS, and forward to
the next level or if complete to the requester and 86 OG/OGV. Approval/disapproval eSSS will
be maintained electronically by 86 OG/OGV. If time does not permit drafting an eSSS on
SharePoint, then the requester should send a detailed email message to the 86 OG/OGV
Stan/Eval inbox or telephone the 86 OG/OGV office, in that order.
1.3.3.1.2. (Added) Non-Duty Hours and/or Short-notice Waiver Requests. If waivers are
required during non-duty hours or with short-notice, requestors will contact the 86 OG/OGV
Group On-Call (GOC) Evaluator through the 86 AW Command Post to request a verbal waiver.
Verbal waivers will be followed up with an email request to 86 OG/OGV at the earliest
opportunity. 86 OG/OGV GOC will notify requestor of waiver disposition.
1.3.3.1.3. (Added) For additional waiver information please reference the ―How to Create a
Waiver” document located in the ―Waiver Examples‖ folder on the OGV SharePoint.

IAW paragraph 7.3.8. The temporary evaluation certificate will be a signed copy of the AF
Form 3862 or PEX-generated evaluation worksheet, or a draft AF Form 8. Document evaluation
completion in the unit evaluation log. If a qualification level 2 or 3 is given, or the evaluation
debrief cannot be immediately accomplished for an evaluation that may result in a qualification
level 2 or 3, the flight examiner will immediately notify the Sq/CC and/or DO, Sq/CCV,
scheduling, and SARM, so the status (qualified/unqualified or supervised) of the individual is
clearly understood. Sq/CCV should notify OGV at the earliest opportunity whenever a
qualification level 2 or 3 is given.
7.3.1.3.2. (Added) Within 1 duty day after the completion of post-mission crew rest (if
applicable), the examiner should complete any additional actions required by unit-specific AF
Form 8 completion checklists. The completed AF Form 8 will be reviewed by OGV prior to
routing for signatures. Two copies of the AF Form 8 will be printed and signed by the examiner
completing the evaluation. One copy of the signed AF Form 8 will be annotated as a ―draft‖ and
placed in section II of the examinee’s FEF and the other copy will be routed for signatures.
Signatures for the AF Form 8 should be obtained as soon as possible.
7.3.1.3.3. (Added) Once the AF Form 8 is completed and all signatures have been obtained, the
temporary evaluation certificate placed in the FEF will be removed and destroyed. Sq/CCVs
