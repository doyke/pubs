                                              CHAPTER 1

                                           INTRODUCTION

1.1. General:
     1.1.1. All Range Users operating on the AFSPC ranges, including the ER and WR, are subject to the
     requirements of this volume to ensure safety by design, testing, inspection, and hazard analysis. Air
     Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) standards do not apply to contractors or contractor
     employees except where Air Force personnel or property are endangered or if specifically required by
     contract.
     1.1.2. The Space Shuttle Payload Ground Safety Handbook (KHB 1700.7) design requirements may
     be used in lieu of the design requirements of this volume only for payloads intended to fly on the
     Space Shuttle. Systems not addressed in KHB 1700.7 shall meet the requirements of this volume. For
     expendable launch vehicle payloads processed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
     (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) payload processing facilities, ground support equipment
     (GSE) may be designed to the requirements of KHB 1700.7 instead of AFSPCMAN 91-710 if the
     GSE is used only on KSC property.

1.2. Organization of the Volume:
     1.2.1. Main Chapters. The main chapters of this volume include common requirements for all vehi-
     cle classes. Appendixes include additional requirements to supplement the main chapters.
     1.2.2. Open Text. The open text contains the actual mandatory performance-based requirements. The
     only tailoring expected for these requirements would be the deletion of non-applicable requirements.
     For example, solid rocket motor performance requirements would be deleted for launch systems that
     do not use solid rocket motors.
     1.2.3. Bordered Paragraphs:
        1.2.3.1. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
        detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements. In addition, the bordered
        paragraphs contain lessons learned from previous applications of the performance requirement,
        where a certain design may have been found successful, or have been tried and failed to meet the
        requirement. These technical solutions are provided for the following reasons:
            1.2.3.1.1. To aid the tailoring process between Range Safety and Range Users in evaluating a
            potential system against all the performance requirements.
            1.2.3.1.2. To aid Range Safety and Range Users in implementing lessons learned.
            1.2.3.1.3. To provide benchmarks that demonstrate what Range Safety considers an accept-
            able technical solution/implementation of the performance requirement and to help convey the
            level of safety the performance requirement is intended to achieve.
        1.2.3.2. The technical solutions in the bordered paragraphs may be adopted into the tailored ver-
        sion of the requirements for a specific program when the Range User intends to use that solution
        to meet the performance requirement. At this point, they become mandatory requirements to
        obtain Range Safety approval. This process is done to:
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                      13


        1.2.3.2.1. Provide an appropriate level of detail necessary for contractual efforts and to pro-
        mote efficiency in the design process.
        1.2.3.2.2. Avoid contractual misunderstandings that experience has shown often occur if an
        appropriate level of detail is not agreed to. The level of detail in the bordered paragraphs is
        necessary to avoid costly out-of-scope contractual changes and to prevent inadvertently over-
        looking a critical technical requirement.
     1.2.3.3. The Range User always has the option to propose alternatives to the bordered paragraph
     solutions. Range User proposed alternative solutions shall achieve an equivalent level of safety
     and be approved by Range Safety. After meeting these two requirements, the Range User pro-
     posed solutions become part of the tailored AFSPCMAN 91-710 for that specific program.
     1.2.3.4. Range Safety has final decision authority in determining whether Range User proposed
     detailed technical solutions meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 performance requirements.

                                    GENERAL DESIGN POLICY

3.1. General:
   3.1.1. All systems shall be designed to tolerate a minimum number of credible failures.
   3.1.2. The number of design inhibits required to prevent an overall system failure or mishap is based
   on the failure or mishap result. Specific inhibit requirements are addressed in the design criteria for
   each of the systems addressed in this volume.

3.2. Systems Without Specific Design Criteria. Those systems that do not have specific design criteria
or systems not addressed in this volume shall be designed to the following general criteria:
   3.2.1. If a system failure may lead to a catastrophic hazard, the system shall have three inhibits (dual
   fault tolerant).
   3.2.2. If a system failure may lead to a critical hazard, the system shall have two inhibits (single fault
   tolerant).
   3.2.3. If a system failure may lead to a marginal hazard, the system shall have a single inhibit (no
   fault tolerant).
   3.2.4. Probabilities of hazard occurrence shall be taken into consideration when determining the num-
   ber of required inhibits. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3, Table 3.1.)
   3.2.5. Systems shall be able to be brought to a safe state with the loss of an inhibit.
   3.2.6. All inhibits shall be independent and verifiable. Common cause failures shall be considered.
   3.2.7. Design inhibits shall consist of electrical and/or mechanical hardware.
   3.2.8. Operator controls shall not be considered a design inhibit. Operator controls are considered a
   control of an inhibit.

              tem shall be provided for all hoist drives and motors to ensure that the hoist holding brakes
              are not released until the motor has been verified for its ability to energize. If microdrive
              systems with non-fail safe clutches are used, this torque-proving system shall be designed
              not to release the hoist brakes until the system has verified positive clutch engagement.
              The torque-proving system shall be designed to eliminate any undesirable hook jump.
              6.2.5.1.4.11. Overhead Cranes and Hoists With Microdrives Using Non-Fail Safe

hoist emergency brakes by a dead man lever controlled pressure regulator. Controls to configure the
emergency brake system into manual operation should be provided. An electric switch with a positive
indicator light should be provided on the control panel to release the hoist holding brake(s). Emer-
gency load lowering panels should be equipped with pressure gauges. A crane-mounted air compres-
sor equipped with an air filter and drier should be used to provide the source of compressed air. Use of
gaseous nitrogen, either bottled, or festoon supplied, is an acceptable alternative. A quick disconnect
fitting should be provided in the system to enable the use of an external pressurized air source in an
emergency.

          6.2.5.1.6. Software. Crane computer hardware and software shall be designed and tested in
          accordance with the requirements in Chapter 16 of this volume and applicable industry stan-
          dards. A diagnostic port shall be provided on the crane control panel to enable downloading of

     6.2.5.1.8. Reeving:
        6.2.5.1.8.1. Overhead cranes and hoists shall be capable of operating with a minimum
        5-degree hoist offset angle, normal to the drum axis, without the load line contacting any
        structural member or obstructions and without the rope being pulled out of the drum or
        sheave grooves.
        6.2.5.1.8.2. Cranes shall be dual reeved with all load lines terminated at an equalizer bar
        and drum(s). The equalizer system shall have the means to allow movement of the system
        to level the block.
        6.2.5.1.8.3. Cranes shall be reeved with one right-lay rope and one left-lay rope to cancel
        the load block rotation tendency.
        6.2.5.1.8.4. At least two wraps of the rope shall remain on the drum at the lower limit of
        lift.
        6.2.5.1.8.5. All overhead cranes and hoists shall be equipped with a means (such as a
        level-wind device) for preventing the load line from coming out of the drum groove and
        overwrapping itself on the drum. As an alternative, a warning device may be used (such as
        a spooling monitor that will activate an aural/visual warning and stops hoisting, but enable
        drum reversal) when the rope comes out of the drum groove.
        6.2.5.1.8.6. Vertical load displacement following a rope failure shall be minimized. This
        vertical load displacement shall be calculated and the analysis submitted.
        6.2.5.1.8.7. The effects of a broken rope on the entire system, including the load block and
        the equalizer assembly, shall be analyzed and reported.
        6.2.5.1.8.8. In the event of one broken rope, the remaining intact reeving system shall not
        be loaded to more than 40 percent of the breaking strength of the remaining intact wire
        rope, including the dynamic loading effects of the load transfer.
        6.2.5.1.8.9. Ropes shall be attached to the drum with a minimum of two clamps each.
        Clamp bolts shall be properly torqued.
        6.2.5.1.8.10. Provisions shall be made to support the drum, to prevent disengagement of
        the drum gearing, and to prevent disengagement of the drum from its emergency brake in
        the event of drum shaft, drum hub, shaft bearing, or bearing support failure.

             6.2.5.1.10.3. Specialized Bridge Cranes:
                 6.2.5.1.10.3.1. For those bridge cranes designed for intentional side pulls or for bridge
                 cranes used in tandem crane operations where horizontal forces will be exerted on the
                 crane because of angular pulls, special features shall be incorporated to prevent sliding
                 of the crane bridge/trolley as a result of the horizontal forces applied and to shut down
                 the hoist if the maximum side pull angle has been exceeded.


To prevent stressing the bridge/trolley brakes, rail clamps can be used to hold the bridge/trolley in
place during these operations. Also, limit switches can be used to shutdown the hoist if the maximum
allowable side pull angle on the crane ropes has been exceeded.

                 6.2.5.1.10.3.2. Specialized bridge crane design shall ensure the trolley remains stable
                 (no potential danger of tipover due to the horizontal component of the resulting force)
                 under worst case loading conditions.
         6.2.5.1.11. Stationary Cranes. Stationary cranes (for example, jib, tower, portal, pillar, ham-
         merhead cranes and derricks) used to handle critical hardware shall comply with applicable
         ANSI standards and be submitted for review and approval to Range Safety on a case-by-case
         basis.
         6.2.5.1.12. Portal Cranes. Portal cranes used to handle critical hardware shall be designed to

        6.2.5.1.14. Mobile Cranes:
           6.2.5.1.14.1. The use of mobile cranes to lift critical hardware shall be justified to and
           approved by Range Safety on a case-by-case basis.
           6.2.5.1.14.2. Load charts shall be used as the primary means for determining safe loads
           for various boom angles. Crane computers shall not be used as a sole means for this deter-
           mination.
           6.2.5.1.14.3. Evolutions that actually involve man-rated lifts shall also comply with the
           operational requirements of Volume 6, Chapter 6. For man-rated lifts, the total weight of
           the loaded personnel platform and related rigging shall not exceed 50 percent of the rated
           capacity for the radius and configuration of the crane or derrick (70 percent when a spe-
           cific lift plan is approved by Range Safety).
           6.2.5.1.14.4. The data package provided to Range Safety for review and approval shall
           provide evidence that the mobile crane meets the following requirements:
               6.2.5.1.14.4.1. ANSI/ASME B30.5, Mobile and Locomotive Cranes, 29 CFR 1926,

                height and at least one emergency stop shall be made at the 110 percent lowering speed
                to verify that brake application meets specification requirements.
                6.2.5.2.1.3.5. The hoist emergency load lowering system shall be tested to verify that
                it is fail-safe and functions properly. The load shall be lowered a minimum of 2 feet.
                6.2.5.2.1.3.6. The hoist overload detection devices shall be tested to verify that they
                activate when the test weight is greater than 110 percent of rated capacity.
                6.2.5.2.1.3.7. The uncommanded motion and load slippage detection system shall be
                tested for proper activation to ensure that the load does not slip and/or stops within the
                specified distance. If the crane is equipped with a non-fail safe microdrive, electrically
                operated clutch, a test that simulates clutch failure to engage (mechanical failure with
                coil energized) and clutch electrical failure during hoisting shall be performed. Maxi-
                mum load drop shall be measured to ensure that it is within specifications and the
                detection system performs properly. For cranes equipped with non-fail safe electrical

                                               CHAPTER 11

     GROUND SUPPORT PRESSURE, VACUUM, AND HAZARDOUS STORAGE SYSTEMS


These requirements establish minimum safety design, fabrication, installation, testing, inspection, recer-
tification, and data requirements for fixed, portable, or mobile ground support hazardous pressure sys-
tems. Ground support systems include aerospace ground equipment (AGE), ground support equipment
(GSE), missile support systems, real property installed equipment (RPIE), and industrial property.
Ground support hazardous pressure systems are defined as follows: (1) systems used to store and trans-
fer hazardous fluids such as cryogens, flammables, combustibles, and hypergols; (2) systems with oper-
ating pressures that exceed 250 psig; (3) systems with stored energy levels exceeding 14,240 foot
pounds; (4) systems that are identified by Range Safety as safety critical.

11.1. Ground Support Pressure Vacuum and Storage Systems Requirements:
     11.1.1. Pressure and vacuum systems shall be designed in accordance with accepted national industry
     standards such as NFPA, UL, American Petroleum Institute (API), ASME, Department of Transporta-
     tion (DOT), T.O. 00-25-223, Integrated Pressure Systems and Components (Portable and Installed),
     and federal, state, and local environmental regulations.


 Vacuum systems should be designed using T.O. 00-25-223 as guidance.

     11.1.2. Pressure systems used to store and transfer fuels such as kerosene, RP-1, and heating oils are
     not generally considered hazardous when designed and operated in accordance with the following
     requirements:
        11.1.2.1. Pressure shall not exceed 15 psig.
        11.1.2.2. The system shall be designed, maintained, and operated in accordance with API 620,
        Recommended Rules for Design and Construction of Large, Welded Low Pressure Storage
        Tanks, and applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and
        Health Administration (OSHA) requirements.

11.2. Ground Support Pressure Systems Requirements:
     11.2.1. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Requirements:
        11.2.1.1. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Service Life. All pressure system compo-
        nents shall operate safely and reliably during their intended period of service (service life). Com-
        ponents shall not fail at operating conditions in a time period that is four times the service life of
        the components. Minimum service life requirements are as follows:
            11.2.1.1.1. Permanently installed pressure vessels shall be designed to have a service life of at
            least 20 years.
            11.2.1.1.2. Other components shall be designed to have a service life of not less than 5,000
            cycles
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                            53



Normal preventive maintenance and calibration may be performed to maintain the service life. The
source document for the service life is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

      11.2.1.2. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Safety Factor. Safety factor for pressure
      systems is the ratio of design burst pressure over the maximum allowable working pressure or
      design pressure, whichever is greater. The safety factor can also be expressed as the ratio of tensile
      strength over the maximum allowable stress for the material. ASME or DOT codes are specified
      as compliance documents for various components such as pressure vessels and piping throughout
      this part. Acceptable safety factors have already been incorporated into the specified code. If an
      ASME or DOT code is not specified in this part as a compliance document for a component
      (applicable code does not exist), the minimum safety factor for the component shall be 4.
      11.2.1.3. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Fault Tolerance:
         11.2.1.3.1. Ground support pressure systems shall be designed to ensure that no single failure
         (component fails to function or human operator error) can result in serious injury and/or loss
         of life.
         11.2.1.3.2. Single-fault (failure) tolerant systems shall have at least two, Range Safety
         approved, independent and verifiable inhibits in place during all periods when the potential for
         serious injury and/or death exists. Structural failure of tubing, piping, or pressure vessels is not
         to be considered single failure.
         11.2.1.3.3. Range Safety may require that a pressure system be dual-fault tolerant if the fail-
         ure of 2 components could result in multiple injuries or deaths.
      11.2.1.4. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Material Selection and Compatibility:
         11.2.1.4.1. Materials shall be compatible throughout their intended service life with the ser-
         vice fluids and the materials such as supports, anchors, and clamps used in construction and
         installation of tankage, piping, and components as well as nonmetallic items such as gaskets,
         seals, packing, seats, and lubricants.
         11.2.1.4.2. At a minimum, material compatibility shall be determined in regard to the follow-
         ing criteria: permeability, flammability, ignition and combustion, functional and material deg-
         radation, contamination, toxicity, pressure and temperature extremes, shock, oxidation, and
         corrosion.
         11.2.1.4.3. Brittle materials shall not be used for pressure system components. The nil-ductil-
         ity transition temperature of materials shall be below the service temperatures.


Material properties should be selected in accordance with reputable government and industry sources
or material test results when testing was done in accordance with Range Safety approved testing meth-
ods. Reliable sources include MIL-HDBK-5, Metallic Materials and Elements for Aerospace Vehi-
cle Structures, MIL-HDBK-17, Plastic for Aerospace Vehicles, Part 1, Referenced Plastics,
American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standards, and the Air Force Damage Tolerant
Design Handbook should be used to verify material is not crack sensitive.

     11.2.1.4.4. Materials that could come in contact with fluid from a ruptured or leaky tank, pipe,
     or other components that store or transfer hazardous fluids shall be compatible with the fluid
     so that they do not create a flammable, combustible, or toxic hazard.
     11.2.1.4.5. Compatible materials selection shall be obtained from one of the following
     sources:

       11.2.1.5. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Corrosion Control. Although corrosion
       control is primarily the responsibility of the maintainer of the equipment, the designer is responsi-
       ble for providing hardware that cannot present safety problems caused by corrosion. As a mini-
       mum, the following potentially critical areas shall be evaluated and appropriately protected:


 NASA-STD-5008A, Protective Coating Of Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, And Aluminum On
 Launch Structures, Facilities, And Ground Support Equipment, or National Association of Corro-
 sion Engineers (NACE) RP0 285-95, Corrosion Control of Underground Storage Tank Systems by
 Cathodic Protection, should be used as guidance for corrosion control. Corrosion protection of fixed
 outdoor pressure systems include supports, anchors, and clamps. Where possible, 17-4PH stainless
 steel should be avoided due to its susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking at low heat treatment lev-
 els. Any 17-4PH stainless steel specified should be heat treated to condition H1025 or higher. Where
 300-series stainless steels are specified, type 303 should be avoided wherever possible due to suscep-
 tibility to stress corrosion cracking.

           11.2.1.5.1. Carbon steel surfaces exposed to atmospheric corrosion shall be protected by the
           application of zinc coatings (inorganic zinc or hot dip galvanizing) or equivalent means.
           11.2.1.5.2. Stainless steel surfaces exposed to rocket engine exhaust impingement or acid
           deposits from solid rocket motor exhaust shall be coated with inhibitive polyamide epoxy
56                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


          primer and aliphatic polyurethane topcoat in accordance with NASA-STD-5008, Protective
          Coating of Carbon Steel, Stainless Steel, and Aluminum on Launch Structures.


 Nitrile, rubber-based, aluminum-pigmented coating (AR-7) is no longer recommended for coating
 stainless steel surfaces because it has a high volatile organic compound content and is generally
 unavailable through commercial suppliers.

          11.2.1.5.3. Exterior stainless steel surfaces exposed to hypergolic propellant shall be coated
          with inhibitive polyamide epoxy primer and aliphatic polyurethane topcoat in accordance with
          NASA-STD-5008.
          11.2.1.5.4. Underground vessels and piping shall be coated with a coal-tar, epoxy coating (or
          equivalent) and galvanically protected.
          11.2.1.5.5. All underground systems shall be cathodically protected and designed so that peri-
          odic checks of the protection can be obtained.
          11.2.1.5.6. Dissimilar metals shall be protected through mutual isolation.
          11.2.1.5.7. All underground metallic systems shall be protected against corrosion by cathodic
          protection. Cathodic protection systems (sacrificial or DC power) shall be designed so that a
          periodic check of the system can be obtained.
       11.2.1.6. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Contamination Control:
          11.2.1.6.1. To avoid a hazardous failure, adequate levels of contamination control shall be
          established by relating the cleanliness requirements to the actual needs and nature of the sys-
          tem and components.


 KSC-C-123, Surface Cleanliness of Fluid Systems, Specifications for or T.O. 42C-11, Cleaning and
 Inspection Procedures for Ballistic Missile Systems, should be used as guidance in relating cleanli-
 ness requirements to the actual needs and nature of the system and components.

          11.2.1.6.2. Materials and fluids used in the design shall be selected to reduce internally gener-
          ated contamination caused by rate of wear, friction, and fluid decomposition.
          11.2.1.6.3. Systems shall have acceptable contamination tolerance levels. The tolerance level
          of the system and/or components shall be based on considerations of the overall functional
          requirements and service life.
          11.2.1.6.4. The system shall be designed to verify, through sampling, that the lines and com-
          ponents are clean after flushing and purging of the system.
          11.2.1.6.5. Each component or section of a system shall be cleaned to the appropriate level
          before installation. Immediately following cleaning, all components or sections of a system
          shall be protected to prevent contamination.
          11.2.1.6.6. Equipment designed to be cleaned or recleaned in place without significant disas-
          sembly shall be provided with high point bleeds and low point drains to facilitate introduction
          and removal of cleaning fluid.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           57


        11.2.1.6.7. Filters shall be installed immediately downstream of all interfaces where control
        of particulate matter is critical and at other appropriate points as required to control particulate
        migration.
        11.2.1.6.8. Filter design shall permit easy servicing and ready accessibility.
     11.2.1.7. Generic Ground Support Pressure System Identification and Marking. All hazard-
     ous pressure system components shall be identified as to function, content, applicable hazard, and,
     if applicable, direction of flow. The marking and identification shall be accomplished by some
     means that cannot cause “stress concentration” or otherwise reduce the integrity of the system.
     Minimum identification and marking requirements are as follows:

       FLIGHT HARDWARE PRESSURE SYSTEMS AND PRESSURIZED STRUCTURES


Hazardous flight hardware pressure systems are defined as follows: (1) flight systems containing haz-
ardous fluids such as cryogens, flammables, combustibles, and toxics; (2) systems used to transfer haz-
ardous fluids such as cryogens, flammables, combustibles, and hypergols; (3) systems with operating
pressures that exceed 100 psig; (4) systems with stored energy levels exceeding 14,240 foot pounds; and
(5) systems that are identified by Range Safety as safety critical. This chapter establishes minimum
design, fabricaton, installation, testing, inspection, certification, and data requirements for flight aero-
space vehicle equipment (AVE) and pressurized structures.

12.1. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure General Requirements. Defini-
tion - Space Launch System Anomaly: Any parameter (pressure, temperature, voltage, acceleration, etc.)
that deviates outside the prescribed or expected range of values. Any occurrence that represents an
unusual, irregular, abnormal, or unexplained departure from expected results.
     12.1.1. Flight Hardware Presssure System and Pressurized Structure General Design Require-
     ments:
        12.1.1.1. The structural design of all pressure vessels and pressurized structures shall use industry
        or government standard processes and procedures for manufacture and repair.
        12.1.1.2. The design shall provide for access, inspection, service, repair, and refurbishment..
        12.1.1.3. For all reusable pressure vessels and pressurized structures, the design shall permit these
        hardware to be maintained in and refurbished to a flightworthy condition. To be considered flight-
        worthy, repaired or refurbished hardware items shall pass all the applicable acceptance tests and
        inspections required for new flight hardware.
        12.1.1.4. Repaired and refurbished hardware shall meet the same conditions of flightworthiness
        as new hardware.
     12.1.2. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Fault Tolerance:
        12.1.2.1. Airborne hazardous pressure systems shall be designed to be single fault tolerant against
        inadvertent actuations that could result in a critical hazard during prelaunch operations. Structural
        failure of tubing, piping, and vessels shall not be considered single failures provided they meet the
        requirements of this volume.
        12.1.2.2. A pressure system shall be dual fault tolerant if the failure of two components could
        result in a catastrophic hazard.
     12.1.3. Flight Hardware Pressure System Offloading:
        12.1.3.1. For contingency safing operations, hazardous pressure systems shall be designed so that
        depressurization and drain fittings are accessible and do not create a personnel or equipment haz-
        ard for offloading hazardous fluids at the launch complex.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                          95


     12.1.3.2. The design goal is to be able to offload these pressure systems at any point after pressur-
     ization or loading, including the ability to offload all systems at the launch pad without demating
     of the spacecraft from the launch vehicle or any other disassembly of vehicle systems.
     12.1.3.3. If the Range User and Range Safety decide that depressurizing and/or offloading the
     pressure systems of a mated spacecraft is prohibited at the launch pad, spacecraft offload proce-
     dures shall be approved by Range Safety prior to use.
  12.1.4. Flight Hardware Pressure System Operations. The requirements for operating hazardous
  pressure systems found in Volume 6 of this publication shall be taken into consideration in the design
  and testing of these systems in addition to the general requirements identified in 12.5 of this chapter.
  12.1.5. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Analyses:
     12.1.5.1. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Hazard Analysis:
         12.1.5.1.1. A hazard analysis shall be performed on all hazardous systems hardware and soft-
         ware (if applicable) in accordance with a jointly tailored SSPP (Volume 1, Attachment 2).
         12.1.5.1.2. Prelaunch and launch hazards shall be analyzed.
     12.1.5.2. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Functional Analysis:
         12.1.5.2.1. A detailed system functional analysis shall be performed to determine that the
         operation, interaction, or sequencing of components shall not lead to damage to the launch
         vehicle, payload, or associated ground support equipment.
         12.1.5.2.2. The analysis shall identify all possible malfunctions or personnel errors in the
         operation of any component that may create conditions leading to an unacceptable risk to per-
         sonnel or equipment.
         12.1.5.2.3. The analysis shall also evaluate any credible secondary or subsequent occurrence,
         failure, or component malfunction that, initiated by a primary failure, could result in personnel
         injury.
         12.1.5.2.4. .Items identified by the hazard analyses shall be designated safety critical and shall
         require the following considerations:
             12.1.5.2.4.1. Hazard identification and proposed corrective action.
             12.1.5.2.4.2. Design action.
             12.1.5.2.4.3. Safety procedures and operating requirements.
             12.1.5.2.4.4. Safety supervision.
         12.1.5.2.5. Systems analysis data shall show that:
             12.1.5.2.5.1. The system provides the capability of maintaining all pressure levels in a
             safe condition in the event of the interruption of any process or control sequence at any
             time during test or countdown.
             12.1.5.2.5.2. Redundant pressure relief devices have mutually independent pressure
             escape routes
96                                                            AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


           12.1.5.2.5.3. In systems where pressure regulator failure may result in a critical hazard to
           personnel or hardware safety systems, regulation is redundant and, where passive redun-
           dant systems are specified, includes automatic switchover.
           12.1.5.2.5.4. When the hazardous effects of safety critical failures or malfunctions are
           prevented through the use of redundant components or systems, all such redundant compo-
           nents or systems shall be operational before the initiation of irreversible portions of safety
           critical operations or events.
     12.1.5.3. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Stress
        12.1.5.3.1. General Requirements:
           12.1.5.3.1.1. A detailed and comprehensive stress analysis of each pressure vessel and
           pressurized structure shall be conducted under the assumption of no crack-like flaws in the
           structure
           12.1.5.3.1.2. The analysis shall determine stresses resulting from the combined effects of
           internal pressure, ground or flight loads, and thermal gradients.
           12.1.5.3.1.3. Both membrane stresses and bending stresses resulting from internal pres-
           sure and external loads shall be calculated to account for the effects of geometrical discon-
           tinuities, design configuration, and structural support attachments.
           12.1.5.3.1.4. Loads shall be combined by using the appropriate design limit or ultimate
           safety factors on the individual loads and comparing the results to material allowables.
           12.1.5.3.1.5. Safety factors shall be as determined in 12.2.
           12.1.5.3.1.6. Safety factors on external (support) loads shall be as assigned to the primary
           structure supporting the pressurized system.
        12.1.5.3.2. Metallic Pressure Vessels and Pressurized Structures Stress Analysis:
           12.1.5.3.2.1. For metallic pressure vessels and pressurized structures, classical solutions
           are acceptable if the design geometries and loading conditions are simple and the results
           are sufficiently accurate (as determined by Range Safety) to warrant their application.
           12.1.5.3.2.2. For metallic pressure vessels and pressurized structures, classical solutions
           are acceptable if the design geometries and loading conditions are simple and the results
           are sufficiently accurate (as determined by Range Safety) to warrant their application.
           12.1.5.3.2.3. As necessary, local structural models shall be constructed to augment the
           overall structural model in areas of rapidly varying stresses.
           12.1.5.3.2.4. Minimum material gauge as specified in the design drawings shall be used in
           calculating stresses.
           12.1.5.3.2.5. The allowable material strengths shall reflect the effects of temperature,
           thermal cycling and gradients, processing variables, and time associated with the design
           environments.
           12.1.5.3.2.6. Minimum margins of safety associated with the parent materials, weldments,
           and heat-affected zones shall be calculated and tabulated for all pressure vessels and pres-
           surized structures along with their locations and stress levels.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           97


              12.1.5.3.2.7. The margins of safety shall be positive against the strength and stiffness
              requirements of 12.1.7 and 12.1.8.
          12.1.5.3.3. Composite Hardware Stress Analysis:
              12.1.5.3.3.1. For composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) and pressurized
              structures made of composite materials, the state-of-the-art methodology using composite
              laminate theory shall be used.
              12.1.5.3.3.2. Interlamination normal and shear stresses as well as in-plane stress compo-
              nents shall be calculated.
              12.1.5.3.3.3. Effects of ply orientation, stacking sequence, and geometrical discontinuities
              shall be accounted for.
      12.1.5.4. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Fatigue Analysis.
      When conventional fatigue analysis is used to demonstrate the fatigue-life of an unflawed pressure
      vessel or pressurized structure, nominal values of fatigue-life characteristics including stress-life
      (S-N) data, strain-life (Se - N) data of the structural materials shall be used.
          12.1.5.4.1. These data shall be taken from reliable sources or other sources approved by the
          procuring agency.


Fatigue-like characteristics data are available from reliable sources such as MIL-HDBK-5.

          12.1.5.4.2. The analysis shall account for the spectra of expected operating loads, pressure,
          and environments.
          12.1.5.4.3. Fatigue damage cumulative technique such as Miner's rule is an acceptable
          method for handling variable amplitude fatigue cyclic loadings.
      12.1.5.5. Flight Hardware Pressure System and Pressurized Structure Safe-Life Analysis:
          12.1.5.5.1. When crack growth safe-life analysis is used to demonstrate the safe-life of a pres-
          sure vessel or a pressurized structure, undetected flaws shall be assumed to be in the critical
          locations and in the most unfavorable orientation with respect to the applied stress and mate-
          rial properties.
          12.1.5.5.2. The size of the flaws shall be based on either the appropriate NDE techniques or
          defined by the acceptance proof testing.
          12.1.5.5.3. If used, both the crack growth safe-life analysis and the proof test flaw screening
          logic shall be based on fracture mechanics methodology that has been submitted to and
          approved by Range Safety.
          12.1.5.5.4. Nominal values of fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth rate data associ-
          ated with each alloy, temper, product form, and thermal and chemical environments shall be
          used in the safe-life analysis. However, if proof test logic is used to determine the initial flaw
          size, an upper bound fracture toughness value shall be used in determining both the initial flaw
          size and the critical flaw size at fracture.
98                                                                AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


           12.1.5.5.5. Pressure vessels or pressurized structures that experience sustained stresses shall
           also show that the corresponding maximum stress intensity factor (Kmax) during sustained load
           in operation is less than the stress-corrosion cracking threshold (KISCC) data in the appropriate
           environment, Kmax < KISCC.
           12.1.5.5.6. A Range Safety approved crack growth software package shall be used to conduct
           the safe-life analysis.

           12.1.5.5.8. Retardation effects on crack growth rates from variable amplitude loading shall
           not be considered without approval by the procuring agency.
           12.1.5.5.9. Tensile residual stresses shall be included in the analysis.
           12.1.5.5.10. The safe-life analysis shall be included in the stress analysis report. In particular,

     pressure.
     12.1.7.6. Pressurized structures subject to instability modes of failure shall not collapse under
     ultimate loads nor degrade the functioning of any system due to elastic buckling deformation
     under limit loads.
     12.1.7.7. Evaluation of buckling strength shall consider the combined action of primary and sec-
     ondary stresses and their effects on general instability, local or panel instability, and crippling.
     12.1.7.8. Design loads for buckling shall be ultimate loads, except that any load component that
     tends to alleviate buckling shall not be increased by the ultimate design safety factor.
     12.1.7.9. Destabilizing pressures shall be increased by the ultimate design factor, but internal sta-
     bilizing pressures shall not be increased unless they reduce structural capability.
     12.1.7.10. The margin of safety shall be positive and shall be determined by analysis or test at

          loads from flexible hose motion can occur.
          12.1.10.4.4. Flexible hose assemblies shall not be installed in a manner that will place a
          mechanical load on the hose or hose fittings to an extent that will degrade hose strength or
          cause the hose fitting to loosen.
          12.1.10.4.5. Flexible hoses shall be designed such that the bend radius is no less safe than the
          minimum bend radius recommended in authoritative specifications for the particular hose.

          forced by one or more layers of 300 series stainless steel wire and/or fabric braid.


In applications where stringent permeability and leakage requirements apply, hoses with a metal inner
pressure carrier tube should be used. If these hoses will be used in a highly errosive environment, con-
sideration should be given to the use of Hastalloy C-22 in accordance with ASTM B575 for the inner
pressure carrier tube and C-276 material for the reinforcing braid.

            Safety.
            12.1.13.2.6. If the material has a less than 60 percent of the plane-strain fracture toughness,
            KIc under the conditions of its application, it shall be mandatory to show, by a “worst case”
            fracture mechanics analysis, that the low threshold stress intensity factor cannot precipitate
            premature structural failure.
      12.1.14. Flight Hardware Pressure System Contamination and Cleanliness Requirements:

        be given to the material characteristics, fabrication processes, design concepts, structural con-
        figuration, and accessibility for inspection of flaw.
        12.1.17.3.4. For metallic hardware, the flaw geometries shall encompass defects commonly
        encountered, including surface crack at the open surface, corner crack or through-the-thick-
        ness crack at the edge of fastener hole, and surface crack at the root of intersecting prismatic

      in determining the appropriate inspection techniques:
         12.1.17.4.1. The selected NDE inspection techniques shall have the capability to determine
         the size, geometry, location, and orientation of a flaw or defect; to obtain, where multiple
         flaws exist, the location of each with respect to the other and the distance between them; and
         to differentiate among defect shapes, from tight cracks to spherical voids.
         12.1.17.4.2. Two or more NDE methods shall be used for a part or assembly that cannot be
         adequately examined by only one method.
         12.1.17.4.3. The flaw detection capability of each selected NDE technique shall be based on
         past experience on similar hardware.
         12.1.17.4.4. Where this experience is not available or is not sufficiently extensive to provide
         reliable results, the capability, under production or operational inspection conditions, shall be
         determined experimentally and demonstrated by tests approved by the procuring agency on
         representative material product form, thickness, and design configuration.
         12.1.17.4.5. The flaw detection capability shall be expressed in terms of detectable crack
         length, crack depth, and crack area. For COPVs, the detection of laminate defects, such as
         delamination, fiber breakage, and air bubbles, shall also be addressed.
         12.1.17.4.6. The selected NDE should be capable of detecting allowable initial flaw size cor-
         responding to a 90 percent probability of detection at a 95 percent confidence level.

         flaw types shall be used for all metallic pressure vessels, COPVs, pressurized structures, and
         other hardware based on their flaw detection capabilities.
      12.1.17.5. Inspection Data. At a minimum, inspection data shall be dispositioned as follows:
         12.1.17.5.1. Inspection data in the form of flaw histories shall be maintained throughout the
         life of the pressure vessel or pressurized structure. The inspection data shall be stored in the
         system certification file.
         12.1.17.5.2. These data shall be periodically reviewed and assessed to evaluate trends and
         anomalies associated with the inspection procedures, equipment and personnel, material char-
         acteristics, fabrication processes, design concept, and structural configuration.
         12.1.17.5.3. The result of this assessment shall form the basis of any required corrective
         action.
         12.1.17.5.4. For suspect COPVs, a Material Review Board (MRB) shall be initiated to evalu-
         ate the NDE results and disposition. The MRB shall consist of the procuring agency (Range
         User), the COPV manufacturer, and Range Safety. The MRB shall use NDE comparison, past
         experience, additional NDE, and other qualitative and quantitative methods to determine the
         acceptability of a suspect vessel. Data collected from the MRB process shall be input into the
         inspection database and system certification file.

         12.2.1.2. Approach B. Approach B, Figure 12.1 shows the steps required for verification of a
         metallic pressure vessel designed using the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or the DOT
         Pressure Vessel Codes.
      12.2.2. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure Mode:
         12.2.2.1. The LBB failure mode shall be demonstrated analytically or by test showing that an ini-
         tial surface flaw with a shape (a/2c) ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 will propagate through the vessel
         thickness to become a through-the-thickness crack with a length less than or equal to 10 times the
         vessel thickness and still be stable at MEOP.
         12.2.2.2. Fracture mechanics shall be used if the failure mode is determined by analysis.
         12.2.2.3. A pressure vessel that contains non-hazardous fluid and exhibits LBB failure mode is
         considered a non-hazardous LBB pressure vessel.
         12.2.2.4. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure
         Mode Factor of Safety Requirements:
            12.2.2.4.1. Metallic pressure vessels that satisfy the non-hazardous LBB failure mode crite-
            rion may be designed conventionally, wherein the design factors of safety and proof test fac-
            tors are selected on the basis of successful past experience.
            12.2.2.4.2. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum burst factor shall be 1.5.
         12.2.2.5. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure
         Mode Fatigue-Life Demonstration:
            12.2.2.5.1. After completion of the stress analysis conducted in accordance with the require-
            ments of 12.1.5.3, conventional fatigue-life analysis shall be performed, as appropriate, on the
            unflawed structure to ascertain that the pressure vessel, acted upon by the spectra of operating
            loads, pressures, and environments meets the life requirements.
            12.2.2.5.2. A life factor of 4 shall be used in the analysis..
            12.2.2.5.3. Testing of unflawed specimens to demonstrate fatigue-life of a specific pressure
            vessel together with stress analysis is an acceptable alternative to fatigue test of the vessel.
            12.2.2.5.4. Fatigue-life requirements are considered demonstrated when the unflawed speci-
            mens that represent critical areas such as membrane section, weld joints, heat-affected zone,
            and boss transition section successfully sustain the limit loads and MEOP in the expected
            operating environments for the specified test duration without rupture.
            12.2.2.5.5. The required test duration is 4 times the specified service life.
         12.2.2.6. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure
         Mode Qualification Test Requirements:
            12.2.2.6.1. Qualification tests shall be conducted on flight quality hardware to demonstrate
            structural adequacy of the design.
            12.2.2.6.2. The test fixtures, support structures, and methods of environmental application
            shall not induce erroneous test conditions.
            12.2.2.6.3. The types of instrumentation and their locations in qualification tests shall be
            based on the results of the stress analysis of 12.1.5.3.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           117


          12.2.2.6.4. The instrumentation shall provide sufficient data to ensure proper application of
          the accept/reject criteria, which shall be established before test.
          12.2.2.6.5. The sequences, combinations, levels, and duration of loads, pressure, and environ-
          ments shall demonstrate that design requirements have been met.
          12.2.2.6.6. Qualification testing shall include random vibration testing and pressure testing.
          The following delineates the required tests:
              12.2.2.6.6.1. Random Vibration Testing. Random vibration qualification testing shall be
              performed in accordance with the requirements of MIL-STD-1540 or equivalent unless it
              can be shown that the vibration requirement is enveloped by other qualification testing
              performed.
              12.2.2.6.6.2. Pressure Testing. Required qualification pressure testing levels are shown in
              Table 12.2. Requirements for application of external loads in combination with internal
              pressures during testing shall be evaluated based on the relative magnitude and/or destabi-
              lizing effect of stresses due to the external load. If limit-combined tensile stresses are
              enveloped by test pressure stresses, the application of external loads shall not be required.
              If the application of external loads is required, the load shall be cycled to limit for 4 times
              the predicted number of operating cycles of the most severe design condition (for example,
              destabilizing load with constant minimum internal pressure or maximum additive load
              with a constant maximum expected operating pressure). Qualification test procedures shall
              be approved by the procuring agency and the appropriate range approval authority.

      12.2.2.7. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure
      Mode Acceptance Test Requirements. Every pressurized system element shall be proof tested to
      verify that the materials, manufacturing processes, and workmanship meet design specifications
      and that the hardware is suitable for flight.
          12.2.2.7.1. Acceptance tests shall be conducted on every pressure system element before
          commitment to flight. Accept/reject criteria shall be formulated before tests.
118                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


            12.2.2.7.2. The test fixtures and support structures shall be designed to permit application of
            all test loads without jeopardizing the flightworthiness of the test article.
            12.2.2.7.3. At a minimum, the following are required:
                12.2.2.7.3.1. Nondestructive Inspection. A complete inspection by the selected nonde-
                structive inspection (NDE) technique(s) shall be performed before the proof-pressure test
                to establish the initial condition of the hardware.
                12.2.2.7.3.2. Proof-Pressure Test. Every pressure vessel shall be proof-pressure tested to
                verify that the materials, manufacturing processes, and workmanship meet design specifi-
                cations and that the hardware is suitable for flight. The proof pressure shall be equal to:




                for burst factor less than 2.0 or 1.5 x (MEOP) for burst factor equal or greater than 2.0.
         12.2.2.8. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure
         Mode Recertification Test Requirements. All refurbished pressure system elements shall be
         recertified after each refurbishment by the acceptance test requirements for new hardware to ver-
         ify their structural integrity and to establish their suitability for continued service before commit-
         ment to flight. Pressure vessels that have exceeded the approved storage environment
         (temperature, humidity, time, and others) shall also be recertified by the acceptance test require-
         ments for new hardware.
         12.2.2.9. Special Provisions. For one-of-a-kind applications, a proof test of each flight unit to a
         minimum of 1.5 times MEOP and a conventional fatigue analysis showing a minimum of 10
         design lifetimes may be used in lieu of the required pressure testing as defined in 12.2.2.6. The
         implementation of this option needs prior approval by the procuring agency and the appropriate
         range approval authority.
      12.2.3. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous LBB
      Failure Mode:
         12.2.3.1. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
         LBB Failure Mode Factor of Safety Requirements:
            12.2.3.1.1. Safe-life design methodology based on fracture mechanics techniques shall be
            used to establish the appropriate design factor of safety and the associated proof factor for
            metallic pressure vessels that exhibit brittle fracture or hazardous LBB failure mode.
            12.2.3.1.2. The loading spectra, material strengths, fracture toughness, and flaw growth rates
            of the parent material and weldments, test program requirements, stress levels, and the com-
            patibility of the structural materials with the thermal and chemical environments expected in
            service shall be taken into consideration.
            12.2.3.1.3. Nominal values of fracture toughness and flaw growth rate data corresponding to
            each alloy system, temper, and product form shall be used along with a life factor of 4 on spec-
            ified service life in establishing the design factor of safety and the associated proof factor.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           119


        12.2.3.1.4. Unless otherwise specified, the minimum burst factor shall be 1.5.
     12.2.3.2. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
     LBB Failure Mode Safe-Life Demonstration Requirements:
        12.2.3.2.1. After completion of the stress analysis conducted in accordance with the require-
        ments of 12.1.5.3, a safe-life analysis of each pressure vessel covering the maximum expected
        operating loads and environments shall be performed under the assumption of pre-existing ini-
        tial flaws or cracks in the vessel.
        12.2.3.2.2. The analysis shall show that the metallic pressure vessel with flaws placed in the
        most unfavorable orientation with respect to the applied stress and material properties, of sizes
        defined by the acceptance proof test or NDE and acted upon by the spectra of expected operat-
        ing loads and environments, meets the safe-life requirements of 12.1.15.
        12.2.3.2.3. Nominal values of fracture toughness and flaw growth rate data associated with
        each alloy system, temper, product form, thermal and chemical environments, and loading
        spectra shall be used along with a life factor of 4 on specified service life in all safe-life analy-
        ses.
        12.2.3.2.4. Pressure vessels that experience sustained stress shall also show that the corre-
        sponding applied stress intensity (KI) during operation is less than KISCC in the appropriate
        environment.
        12.2.3.2.5. Testing of metallic pressure vessels under fracture control in lieu of safe-life anal-
        ysis is an acceptable alternative, provided that, in addition to following a quality assurance
        program (12.1.17) for each flight article, a qualification test program is implemented on
        pre-flawed specimens representative of the structure design.
        12.2.3.2.6. These flaws shall not be less than the flaw sizes established by the acceptance
        proof test or the selected NDE method(s).
        12.2.3.2.7. Safe-life requirements of 12.1.15 are considered demonstrated when the
        pre-flawed test specimens successfully sustain the limit loads and pressure cycles in the
        expected operating environments without rupture.
        12.2.3.2.8. A life factor of 4 on specified service life shall be applied in the safe-life demon-
        stration testing.
        12.2.3.2.9. A report that documents the fracture mechanics safe-life analysis or safe-life test-
        ing shall be prepared to delineate the following:
            12.2.3.2.9.1. Fracture mechanics data (fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth rates).
            12.2.3.2.9.2. Loading spectrum and environments.

             12.2.3.2.10. This report shall be closely coordinated with the stress analysis report and shall
             be periodically revised and updated during the life of the program.
         12.2.3.3. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
         LBB Failure Mode Qualification Test Requirements. Qualification testing shall meet require-
         ments of 12.2.2.6.
         12.2.3.4. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
         LBB Failure Mode Acceptance Test Requirements. Acceptance test requirements for pressure
         vessels that exhibit brittle fracture or hazardous LBB failure mode are identical to those with duc-
         tile fracture failure mode as defined in 12.2.2.7 except that the test level shall be that defined by
         the fracture mechanics analysis. Surface and volume NDE shall be performed before and after
         proof test on the weld joints as a minimum. Cryo-proof acceptance test procedures may be
         required to adequately verify initial flaw size. The pressure vessel shall not rupture or leak at the
         acceptance test pressure.
         12.2.3.5. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
         LBB Failure Mode Recertification Test Requirements. Recertification testing shall meet the
         requirements of 12.2.2.8.
         12.2.3.6. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels with Brittle Fracture or Hazardous
         LBB Failure Mode Special Provisions. For one-of-a-kind applications, a proof test of each
         flight unit to a minimum of 1.5 times MEOP and a conventional fatigue analysis showing a mini-
         mum of 10 design lifetimes may be used in lieu of the required pressure testing as defined in
         12.2.2.6 for qualification. The implementation of this option needs prior approval by Range
         Safety.
      12.2.4. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels Designed Using ASME Boiler and Pressure
      Vessel Code. Metallic pressure vessels may be designed and manufactured per the rules of the ASME
      Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Divisions 1 or 2.
         12.2.4.1. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels Designed Using ASME Boiler and Pres-
         sure Vessel Code Qualification Test Requirements. Qualification testing shall meet the require-
         ments of 12.2.2.6.
         12.2.4.2. Flight Hardware Metallic Pressure Vessels Designed Using ASME Boiler and Pres-
         sure Vessel Code Acceptance Test Requirements:
             12.2.4.2.1. A proof test shall be performed as specified in ASME Code pressure test at 1.5 x
             MAWP unless otherwise prohibited by the Code.
             12.2.4.2.2. NDE shall be performed in accordance with the ASME Code and RT and/or UT as
             appropriate to quantify defects in all full penetration welds after the proof test.
      12.2.5. Flight Hardware Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels. Flight hardware COPVs
      shall be designed using either Approach A or Approach B shown in Figure 12.1
         12.2.5.1. Approach A. Flight COPVs designed using Approach A in Figure 12.1 shall have a
         design burst pressure equal to 1.5 or greater. The COPV failure mode shall be demonstrated by
         applicable fracture mechanics analysis, test, or similarity, as approved by Range Safety.
             12.2.5.1.1. Manufacturers of COPVs using non-metallic liners or new composite overwrap
             materials (other than carbon, aramid, or glass fibers in epoxy resins) and their customers shall
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                         121


        conduct the necessary development test program to substantiate an acceptable level of risk as
        determined by Range Safety, comparable to conventional metal-lined COPVs.
        12.2.5.1.2. Based on the results of the failure mode determination, one of two distinct paths
        shall be satisfied: (1) LBB with leakage of the contents not creating a condition that could lead
        to a mishap (such as toxic gas venting, damage to nearby safety critical components, or pres-
        surization of a compartment not capable of withstanding the pressure increase), and (2) brittle
        fracture failure mode or hazardous LBB, in which, if allowed to leak, the leak would cause a
        hazard.
        12.2.5.1.3. The verification requirements for path 1 (LBB) are delineated in 12.2.6 and the
        verification requirements for path 2 (brittle fracture/hazardous LBB) are delineated in 12.2.7.
        12.2.5.1.4. Failure mode and safe-life testing using coupons or subscale vessels shall not be
        used unless approved by Range Safety.
        12.2.5.1.5. COPVs with metal liners, evaluated by similarity (in other words, comparison
        with a vessel that has already been tested and documented having similar fiber, epoxy, matrix
        design, and geometry) may not require a demonstration test, if approved by Range Safety.
        12.2.5.1.6. For COPVs subjected to sustained load conditions, stress rupture life shall be con-
        sidered. The COPV shall not be susceptible to stress rupture or sustained creep failure mecha-
        nisms. The predicted stress rupture life shall be at least 4 times the service life (for the
        environment and pressure versus time profile history).
     12.2.5.2. 12.2.5.2.Approach B. Approach B, in Figure 12-1, shows the steps required for verifi-
     cation of a COPV designed using ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code or DOT Title 49
     Exemptions with a burst factor equal to 3.0 or greater.
     12.2.5.3. COPV Prelaunch Inspection and Pressure Test Requirements:
        12.2.5.3.1. Before the first pressurization of a COPV at an AFSPC range, an inspection of the
        vessel shall be conducted to determine if there is any evidence of visible damage. An inspec-
        tor, certified in accordance with Section 12.1.17.3, shall perform the inspection. If this inspec-
        tion is not possible at the launch base (in other words, the COPV is not accessible), then it shall
        be conducted the last time the vessel is accessible for inspection.
        12.2.5.3.2. After arrival at the prelaunch processing facility and completion of the visual
        inspection (with no evidence of damage to the COPV) but before any commodity loading or
        pressurization, COPVs shall be pressure tested to 1.1 times the maximum ground operating
        pressure to which personnel are exposed. The minimum hold time for this pressure test shall
        be 10 minutes. This pressure test shall be conducted remotely or a blast shield shall be used to
        protect personnel.
  12.2.6. COPVs with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure Mode:
     12.2.6.1. General:
        12.2.6.1.1. The failure mode designation for COPVs shall be based on the liner and the com-
        posite overwrap.
        12.2.6.1.2. For metal-lined COPVs, the LBB failure mode shall be demonstrated by applica-
        ble fracture mechanics analysis and/or test or similarity, as approved by Range Safety. The
122                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


             effects of the liner sizing operation on the fracture mechanics characteristics of the metal liner
             shall be accounted for in the LBB evaluation. For non-metallic lined COPVs, the LBB failure
             mode shall be demonstrated by test.
             12.2.6.1.3. The demonstration of the LBB failure mode by test of a COPV shall include a
             pre-flawed liner (flaw size determined by analysis of the liner material and flaw detection
             capabilities of the selected NDE techniques). Surface cracks shall be put into the liner at loca-
             tions and orientations that are most critical to the LBB response. An inert fluid shall be used to
             pressurize the COPV. Pressure cycles shall be applied to the COPV with the upper pressure
             limit equal to the MEOP. The LBB failure mode shall be demonstrated if one or more of the
             cracks leak pressure from the COPV at MEOP before catastrophic failure occurs.
         12.2.6.2. COPVs with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure Mode Factor of Safety Requirements.
         Nonmetallic pressure vessels that satisfy the non-hazardous LBB failure mode criterion may be
         designed conventionally, wherein the design factors of safety and proof test factors are selected on
         the basis of successful past experience. The minimum burst factor shall be 1.5.
         12.2.6.3. COPVs with Non-Hazardous LBB Failure Mode Fatigue-Life Demonstration:

             formed for the liner, bosses, and composite shell of an unflawed COPV. Fatigue-life shall be
             demonstrated either by test or analysis, as approved by Range Safety. The test or analysis shall
             account for the spectra of expected loads, pressures, and environments.
             12.2.6.3.2. The minimum fatigue life for COPVs shall be 4 times the service life. The planned
             number of cycles for the COPV service life shall account for a launch base pressure test at 1.1
             times the ground MEOP.

      requirements described below are applicable only to flight hardware COPVs that exhibit brittle frac-
      ture or hazardous LBB failure modes.

         stration Requirements:
             12.2.7.2.1. In addition to performing a stress analysis as specified in 12.1.5.3, a safe-life dem-
             onstration of each pressure vessel, covering the maximum expected operating loads and envi-
             ronments, shall be performed assuming pre-existing initial flaws or cracks in the vessel. For
             metal-lined COPVs, safe-life shall be demonstrated either by test, analysis, similarity, or any
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                         123


        combination thereof. For non-metallic lined COPVs, the safe-life shall be demonstrated by
        test, similarity, or both.
        12.2.7.2.2. Specifically, the analysis shall show that the metal-lined COPV (with liner flaws
        placed in the most unfavorable orientation with respect to the applied stress and material prop-
        erties, of sizes defined by the acceptance proof test or NDE and acted upon by the spectra of
        expected operating loads) shall meet the safe-life requirements specified by 12.1.15.
        12.2.7.2.3. For metallic liners, the nominal values of fracture toughness and flaw growth rate
        data associated with each alloy system, temper, product form, thermal and chemical environ-
        ments, and loading spectra shall be used in all safe-life analyses.
        12.2.7.2.4. Metal-lined COPVs that experience sustained stress shall also show that the corre-
        sponding stress intensity factor (K1) applied to the metal liner during the operation is less than
        KISCC in the appropriate environment. For all liner materials for which data do not exist, the
        sustained load crack behavior of the liner material shall be determined by test for all fluids that
        are introduced into the COPV under pressure.
        12.2.7.2.5. Testing of metal-lined COPVs under fracture control is an acceptable alternative
        to safe-life analysis, provided that, in addition to following a quality assurance program
        (12.1.17) for each flight article, a qualification test program is implemented on pre-flawed
        specimens representative of the structure design. For non-metallic lined COPVs, safe-life
        demonstrations shall be performed by test.
        12.2.7.2.6. These flaws shall not be less than the flaw sizes established by the acceptance
        proof test or the selected NDE method(s).
        12.2.7.2.7. Safe-life requirements of 12.1.15 are considered demonstrated when the
        pre-flawed test specimens successfully sustain the limit loads and pressure cycles in the
        expected operating environments without rupture.
        12.2.7.2.8. The safe-life shall be 4 times the service life for all safe-life demonstrations. The
        planned number of cycles for the COPV service life shall account for a launch base pressure
        test at 1.1 times the ground MEOP.
        12.2.7.2.9. A report that documents the fracture mechanics safe-life analysis (for metal liners
        only) or safe-life testing shall be prepared to delineate the following:

             inspection shall be performed by an inspector certified in accordance with 12.1.17.3. If this
             inspection is not possible at the launch base (in other word, not accessible), then it shall be
             conducted the last time the vessel is accessible for inspection.
             12.2.7.5.3. After arrival at the prelaunch processing facility and completion of the visual

                 4 times the predicted number of operating cycles of the most severe design condition
                 (for example, destabilizing load with constant minimum internal pressure or maximum

        spectra shall be used along with a life factor of 4 on specified service life in all safe-life analy-
        sis.
        12.3.3.2.4. Safe-life testing in lieu of safe-life analysis is an acceptable alternative, provided
        that, in addition to following a quality assurance program (12.1.17) for each flight article, a
        qualification test program is implemented on pre-flawed specimens representative of the struc-
        tural design.

             fracture failure mode or hazardous LBB failure mode are identical to those with non-hazard-
             ous LBB failure mode as defined in 12.3.2 except that the selected NDE techniques shall be
             capable of detecting flaws or cracks smaller than the allowable initial flaw size as determined
             by safe-life analysis.

           assembled into a subsystem or system to 1.5 times the system MOP. This approach shall be
           approved by Range Safety.
           12.5.1.17.1.12. Pneumatic proof testing to a proof pressure of 1.25 times MAWP is per-
           missible only if hydrostatic proof testing is impractical, impossible, or jeopardizes the
           integrity of the system or system element. Prior approval for pneumatic proof testing at the
           ranges shall be obtained from Range Safety.
        12.5.1.17.2. Testing Flight Hardware Pneumatic and Hydraulic Systems After Assem-
        bly. All newly assembled pressure systems shall be hydrostatically tested to 1.5 times MOP/
        MEOP before use. MOP here refers to the maximum operating pressure that personnel are
        exposed to. Where this is not possible, Range Safety shall determine the adequacy of compo-
        nent testing and alternate means of testing the assembled system.

               media except that for hazardous gas systems, a system-compatible, non-hazardous gas
               may be used that has a density as near as possible to the system fluid; for example,
               helium should be used to leak test a gaseous hydrogen system.
               12.5.1.17.3.3.2. Mechanical connections, gasketed joints, seals, weld seams, and other
               items shall be visually bubble tight for a minimum of 1 minute when an approved leak

                                        ORDNANCE SYSTEMS

13.1. Ordnance Hazard Classification:
   13.1.1. Ordnance General Classification:
       13.1.1.1. Ordnance items shall be assigned the appropriate DoD and United Nations (UN) hazard
       classification and storage compatibility group in accordance with DoD 6055.9-STD.
       13.1.1.2. Items that have not previously been classified and cannot be classified based on similar-
       ity with previously classified items shall be tested in accordance with AFTO 11A-1-47/
       (NAVSEAINST 8020.3/TB700-2/DLAR 8220.1), Explosive Hazard Classification Procedures,
       and classified accordingly.
       13.1.1.3. Ordnance items shall also have a DOT classification. The Range User is responsible for
       obtaining DOT classification.
       13.1.1.4. The Range User shall provide the DoD and DOT documentation demonstrating proper
       classification to Range Safety for review and approval before delivering ordnance to the ranges.
   13.1.2. Range Safety Ordnance Device and System Categorization:
       13.1.2.1. In addition to the requirements noted above, each ordnance device and system shall be
       classified as category A (hazardous) or B (non-hazardous) and the proposed classifications sub-
       mitted to Range Safety for review and approval before delivering ordnance to the ranges.
       13.1.2.2. The following criteria shall be used to determine ordnance device and system hazard
       category:
           13.1.2.2.1. Handheld Mode:
               13.1.2.2.1.1. At least 1 percent of an ordnance item qualification lot or a minimum of 10
               units shall be functioned to determine if the ordnance produces fragments, if the tempera-
               ture rises above 260oC, if the ordnance produces flame, or if the ordnance produces pres-
               sure in excess of 150 psig at the output end. If testing or analogy is not accomplished, the
               initiating device shall be treated as category A.


It is not the intention of this publication to impose excessive test requirements. Similarities with previ-
ously tested items are often sufficient for categorization.

               13.1.2.2.1.2. If one or more of the tested units violate the criteria, the ordnance shall be
               considered category A in the handheld mode.
           13.1.2.2.2. Assembled Mode:
               13.1.2.2.2.1. An analysis of the ordnance system shall be performed to determine if its ini-
               tiation is capable of causing injury or damage to DoD property on the ranges.
               13.1.2.2.2.2. Tests will not be required for the assembled mode.

13.2. Ordnance System General Requirements. All the remaining parts of Chapter 13 establish the design
requirements for category A ordnance and ordnance systems during transportation, handling, storage,
installation, testing, and connection on the ranges. Category B ordnance and ordnance systems do not
have to meet the design requirements identified in this chapter; however, Category B ordnance and ord-
nance systems shall meet the operational requirements identified in Volume 6 of this publication.
      13.2.1. Ordnance Subsystem Identification. Ordnance systems include the following subsystems. All
      of these subsystems are subject to the design requirements described below.

         tor.
         13.2.1.2. Firing Circuit (the path between the power source and the initiating device). The firing
         circuit includes the electrical path and the optical path for laser initiated ordnance.

      as shock, vibration, and static electricity encountered during ground processing.
      13.2.3. Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis. A FMECA shall be performed on all ordnance
      systems in accordance with the requirements of a jointly tailored MIL-STD-882.

13.3. Ordnance Electrical and Optical Circuits:
      13.3.1. Ordnance Electrical and Optical Circuit General Design Requirements:
         13.3.1.1. Ordnance system circuitry shall be protected to preclude energy sources such as electro-
         magnetic energy or stray light from the ranges and/or launch vehicle from causing undesired out-
         put of the system.


Solutions for protection of ordnance system circuitry include shielding, filtering, grounding, and other
isolation techniques that can preclude the energy sources such as electromagnetic energy or stray light
from the range and/or launch vehicle from causing undesired output of the system.

         13.3.1.2. Category A ordnance systems shall be designed so that the initiating devices can be
         installed in the system just before final electrical and/or optical hookup on the launch pad.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           163



It is understood that the requirement for designing ordnance so that the initiating devices can be installed
in the system just before final electrical and/or optical hookup on the launch pad cannot always be met.
Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis where the Range User has demonstrated compliance
with the intent.

           13.3.1.2.1. Initiating device locations shall be accessible to facilitate installation and removal
           and electrical and/or optical connections as late as possible in the launch countdown.

           point) with other circuits. Static bleed resistors of 10 kilo-ohms to 100 kilo-ohms are not con-
           sidered to violate the single point ground.
           13.3.1.5.2. This interconnection shall be at the power source only.
           13.3.1.5.3. Other ground connections with equivalent isolation shall be handled on a

       to such faults as ground loops and failure of solid state switches.
       13.3.1.8. Redundant circuits are required if loss of power or signal may result in injury to person-
       nel or be a detriment to safety critical systems.
       13.3.1.9. The elements of a redundant circuit shall not be terminated in a single connector where
       the loss of such connector will negate the redundant feature.


Redundant circuits should be separated to the maximum extent possible.

   13.3.2. Ordnance Electrical and Optical Circuit Shielding:
       13.3.2.1. Shields shall not be used as intentional current-carrying conductors.
       13.3.2.2. Electrical firing circuits shall be completely shielded or shielded from the initiating ord-
       nance or laser firing unit (LFU) back to a point in the firing circuit at which filters or absorptive

       13.3.2.3. RF shielding shall provide a minimum of 85 percent of optical coverage ratio.
164                                                                  AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004



Optical coverage ratio is the percentage of the surface area of the cable core insulation covered by a
shield. A solid shield rather than a mesh shield would have 100 percent coverage.

         13.3.4.2. Electrical and optical connectors shall be selected to eliminate the possibility of mismat-
         ing. Mismating includes improper installation as well as connecting wrong connectors.
         13.3.4.3. Electrical and optical connectors shall be of the self-locking type or lock wiring shall be
         used to prevent accidental or inadvertent demating.
         13.3.4.4. The design shall ensure that the shielding connection for an electrical connector is com-
         plete before the pin connection.
         13.3.4.5. Shields need not be carried through a connector if the connector can provide RF attenu-
         ation and electrical conductivity at least equal to that of the shield.
         13.3.4.6. Circuit assignments and the isolation of firing pins within an electrical connector shall
         be so that any single short circuit occurring as a result of a bent pin shall not result in more than 10
         percent of the no-fire current. Unless otherwise agreed to by Range Safety, a bent pin analysis
         shall be performed on all electrical connectors.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                        165

         13.3.6.8. Tolerances for monitor circuit outputs shall be compatible with the tolerances specified
         for the Range Safety required parameter to be verified. Tolerances for monitor circuit outputs shall
         be specified for both RF and hardline.
         13.3.6.9. Maximums and minimums for monitor circuit outputs shall be specified.
         13.3.6.10. No single point failure in monitoring, checkout, or control circuitry and equipment
         shall compromise the safety of the firing circuit.
         13.3.6.11. Firing circuits that do not share a common fire command shall be electrically isolated
         from one another so that current in one firing circuit does not induce a current greater than 20 dB
         below the no-fire current in any firing output circuit. Control circuits shall be electrically isolated
         so that a stimulus in one circuit does not induce a stimulus greater than 20 dB below the activation
         level in any firing circuit.
         13.3.6.12. The monitor circuit that applies current to the EED shall be defined to limit the open
         circuit output voltage to 1 volt.

13.4. Initiator Electrical and Optical Circuits:
      13.4.1. Electrical and Optical Low Voltage Electromechanical Circuits Design Requirements:
         13.4.1.1. All solid rocket motor ignition circuits and other high hazard ordnance systems (as
         determined by Range Safety) using low voltage initiators shall provide an electromechanical safe
         and arm (S&A) device.


The term high hazard refers to specific catastrophic events such as the inadvertent firing of a solid rocket
motor or actuation of a destruct system that could result in multiple fatalities, typically threatening more
than just the ordnance technicians handling the hazardous item, and/or "total" destruction of high value
hardware such as the payload, launch vehicle, or facility.

         13.4.1.2. EED ordnance systems other than solid rocket motor ignition circuits and other high
         hazard ordnance systems shall provide 2 independent circuit interrupts such as “enable” and “fire”
         switches in the power side of the initiator and one safe plug that interrupts both the power and
         return side.


A key consideration in providing inhibits in an ordnance circuit is that they be both valid and indepen-
dent. Valid means that the inhibits reside in the direct current path for firing the EED, not in the control
circuit used to change the status of an inhibit. For example, if your two-inhibit compliance approach is
to close two control circuit relays to close a single firing line relay, you are not compliant because you
do not have two valid inhibits. In other words, the single firing line relay is the only inhibit. Independent
means a singular action to remove a singular inhibit. You can have two inhibits; for example, two open
relays in a firing line. However, if a single command removes both inhibits, (for example, closes both
relays), then the inhibits are not independent. In other words, you do not have two independent inhibits.
A concept that is often overlooked is that inhibits are not independent if a single failure can negate both
inhibits.

         13.4.1.3. The safe plug shall provide interruption of the circuit after the “enable” and “fire”
         switches and as close to the end item ordnance as possible.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                         167


       13.4.1.4. The final electrical connection of an EED to the firing circuit shall be as close to the
       EED as possible.
       13.4.1.5. EEDs shall be protected from electrostatic hazards by the placement of resistors from
       line-to-line and line-to-ground (structure). The placement of line-to-structure static bleed resis-
       tances is not considered to violate the single point ground requirement as long as the parallel com-
       bination of these resistors are 10 kilo-ohms or more.
       13.4.1.6. The system circuitry shall be designed and/or located to limit RF power at each EED
       (produced by range and/or vehicle transmitter) to a level at least 20 dB below the pin-to-pin DC
       no-fire power of the EED.


Electromagnetic environment evaluation should either be by analysis or electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) testing. RF power density levels for range facilities are available from Range Safety.

   13.4.2. High Voltage Exploding Bridgewire Circuits:
       13.4.2.1. All solid rocket motor ignition circuits for all launch vehicles and payloads using
       exploding bridgewire (EBW) systems shall include a manual arming and safing plug in addition to
       an EBW-firing unit (EBW-FU).
       13.4.2.2. An EBW-FU is required on all other EBW systems. A manual arming and safing plug
       may also be required depending on the degree of hazard as determined by Range Safety.
   13.4.3. Laser Initiated Ordnance Circuits:
       13.4.3.1. The optic system design shall preclude stray energy sources from causing an undesired
       output. This requirement shall be demonstrated during development and qualification testing.


The optic system undesired stray energy sources include items such as photostrobe, magnified sunlight,
arc welding, xenon strobe, lightning, static electricity, and RF energy causing an undesired output.

       13.4.3.2. Laser power sources shall have a minimum of 2 independent and verifiable inhibits. One
       of these inhibits for the main laser shall be a power interrupt plug that removes all airborne and
       ground power to the LFU.
       13.4.3.3. High voltage laser systems used for solid rocket motor ignition circuit shall use one of
       the following safety devices:

          safed and locked and unlocked remotely; a manual safe plug capable of interrupting power to
          the barrier control circuits shall also be provided.
          13.4.3.3.2. An optical S&A.
          13.4.3.3.3. An ordnance S&A.
       13.4.3.4. Low voltage laser systems such as the diode laser used for the solid rocket motor igni-
       tion circuit shall use one of the following safety devices:
          13.4.3.4.1. An optical S&A.
          13.4.3.4.2. An ordnance S&A.
168                                                                  AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


         13.4.3.5. Specific safety device requirements for systems other than high hazard ordnance sys-
         tems circuits shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by Range Safety based on the degree of
         hazard.
         13.4.3.6. If a low energy level end-to-end test is to be performed when the laser initiated ordnance
         system (LIOS) is connected to the receptor ordnance, the following requirements shall be met:
             13.4.3.6.1. The energy level shall be less than 1/10,000 of the no-fire level of the laser-initi-
             ated device (LID).
             13.4.3.6.2. The single failure mode maximum energy level of the test system shall be less than
             1/100 of no-fire level of the LID.
             13.4.3.6.3. The test source shall emit a different wavelength than the main firing unit laser.
             13.4.3.6.4. One of the following inhibit options shall be implemented during the low energy
             level test:
                 13.4.3.6.4.1. An ordnance S&A device and a safe plug that interrupts power to the main
                 laser shall be provided.
                 13.4.3.6.4.2. Three independent, verifiable inhibits shall be in place to preclude inadvert-
                 ent initiation of the LID by the main laser firing unit during the low level energy test. One
                 of these inhibits shall be a safe plug that interrupts power to the main laser.
                 13.4.3.6.4.3. The explosive train shall be disconnected anywhere between the LID and the
                 receptor ordnance.
         13.4.3.7. If a main laser subsystem firing test is performed by the Range User when the LIOS is
         connected to the receptor ordnance, a minimum of 3 independent, verifiable inhibits shall be in
         place.
             13.4.3.7.1. Two of the inhibits shall be optical barriers capable of being independently locked
             in place.

         13.4.3.8. Lasers shall be completely enclosed during checkout or provided with GSE that can
         enclose the laser emission path at all times the system is powered.

13.5. Ordnance Safety Devices:
      13.5.1. Ordnance Safety Device General Design Requirements. Ordnance safety devices are electri-
      cal, electromechanical, optoelectronic, optical, or mechanical devices used in all ordnance subsystems
      to provide isolation between the power source to firing circuits and firing circuits to initiating devices
      or receptor ordnance.


Examples of ordnance safety devices include S&A devices, arm/disarm devices, relays, switches,
EBW-FUs, LFUs, and manual arming/safing plugs.

         13.5.1.1. Electrical and electronic safety devices shall remain or transfer back to their safe state in
         the event of input power loss.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                            169


       13.5.1.2. All safety devices shall be capable of being functionally tested by ground test equip-
       ment.
       13.5.1.3. Manual safety devices on the launch vehicle and payload that are required to be in place
       in order for the launch pad to be open for normal work shall be accessible up to launch, requiring
       only a minimal crew to access the device and safe it.


It is understood that maintaining accessibility to manual safety devices up to launch and maintaining
accessibility to remotely activated devices up to launch and after launch abort cannot always be met.
Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis where the Range User has demonstrated compliance
with the intent.

       13.5.1.4. The arrangement of safety devices shall maximize safety by placing the most positive
       and reliable form of interruption closest to the initiating device.


For example, a safe plug would be located downstream of a solid state switch.

       13.5.1.5. Ordnance and optical mechanical barriers used for safety devices shall demonstrate a
       reliability of 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level to prevent initiation of the receptor ordnance
       or the LID for LIOS. The test method shall be a Bruceton procedure or other statistical testing
       method acceptable to Range Safety.
       13.5.1.6. Safety devices shall not require adjustment throughout their service life.
       13.5.1.7. Each safety device shall be designed for a service life of at least 10 years after passing
       the acceptance test.
   13.5.2. Ordnance Arming and Safing Plugs:
       13.5.2.1. Safing plugs shall be designed to be manually installed to provide electrical and optical
       isolation of the input power from the electrical and optical ordnance firing circuits.
       13.5.2.2. Arming plugs shall be designed to be manually installed to provide electrical and optical
       continuity from the input power to the electrical and optical ordnance firing circuits.

       order for the launch pad or processing facility to be open for normal work shall be accessible at all
       times, requiring only a minimal crew to access the plug and remove/install it.


It is understood that maintaining accessibility to arming and safing plugs up to just before final launch
complex clear cannot always be met. Exceptions are handled on a case-by-case basis where the Range
User has demonstrated compliance with the intent.

       13.5.2.4. Arming and safing plugs shall be designed to be positively identifiable by color, shape,
       and name.
       13.5.2.5. For low voltage systems (EEDs) that use a safing plug instead of an electromechanical
       S&A, the safing plug shall be designed to electrically isolate and short the initiator side of the fir-
       ing circuit. Isolation shall be a minimum of 10 kilo-ohms.

         13.5.3.1. Electromechanical S&As shall provide mechanical isolation of the EED from the explo-
         sive train and electrical isolation of the firing circuit from the EEDs.
         13.5.3.2. When the S&A is in the safe position, the power and return lines of the firing circuit
         shall be disconnected. The bridgewire shall be shorted and grounded through a 10 kilo-ohm to 100
         kilo-ohm resistor and the explosive train shall be interrupted by a mechanical barrier capable of
         containing the EED output energy without initiating the explosive.
         13.5.3.3. Transition from the safe to arm position shall require 90 degrees of rotation of the
         mechanical barrier for rotating S&As containing ordnance in the barrier. Safe to arm transition tol-
         erances for other electromechanical S&A devices require specific Range Safety approval.
         13.5.3.4. The S&A device shall not be capable of propagating the detonation with the barrier
         rotated at least 50 degrees from safe for a 90-degree rotational barrier. This position shall be 50
         percent of the travel distance between arm and safe for sliding barriers.
         13.5.3.5. The mechanical lock in the S&A shall prevent inadvertent transfer from the arm to safe
         position (or vice versa) under all ground operational environments without the application of any
         electrical signal.
         13.5.3.6. S&A design shall incorporate provisions to safe the ordnance train from any rotor and/
         or barrier position.

         13.5.3.8. Remote and manual safing shall be accomplished without passing through the arm posi-
         tion.
         13.5.3.9. The S&A safe signal shall not be indicated visually or remotely unless the device is less
         than 10 degrees from the safe position for rotating systems or 10 percent from the safe position for
         sliding barriers.
         13.5.3.10. No visual indication of safe or arm shall appear if the device is in between the safe and
         arm positions. The S&A will be considered “not safe” or armed if the indicator does not show
         “safe.”
         13.5.3.11. The electrical continuity of one status circuit of the S&A device (safe or arm) shall
         completely break before the time that the electrical continuity is established for the other status
         circuit (arm or safe).
         13.5.3.12. A remote status indicator shall be provided to show the armed or safed condition.
            13.5.3.12.1. The device shall also indicate its arm or safe status by visual inspection.
            13.5.3.12.2. There shall be easy access to this visual indication throughout ground processing.
         13.5.3.13. S&A device locations on the vehicle shall be accessible to facilitate installation and
         removal and electrical and ordnance connections during final vehicle closeout.
         13.5.3.14. A safing pin shall be used in the S&A to prevent movement from the safe to the arm
         position when the arming signal is applied.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                            171


           13.5.3.14.1. Rotation and/or transition of the mechanical barrier to align the explosive train

              gized.
              13.5.3.14.7.2. The safing pin retention mechanism shall be capable of withstanding
              applied forces of tension or torque without failure.

withstanding an applied force of at least 100 pounds tension or a torque of at least 100 inch-pounds with-
out failure.

       at least 1,000 cycles, or at least 5 times the expected number of cycles, whichever is greater, with-
       out any malfunction, failure, or deterioration in performance.
       13.5.3.16. A constant 1-hour application of S&A arming voltage with the safing pin installed
       shall not cause the explosive in the unit to function or degrade to a point that it will no longer func-
       tion if such a failure could create a hazard.
       13.5.3.17. The time required to arm or safe an S&A device shall not exceed 1 second after appli-
       cation of the actuation signal.
172                                                               AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004

      14.1.6. EGSE and Flight Hardware Connectors. Connector design shall avoid the generation of a haz-
      ardous condition that could lead to a hazardous event. A hazardous condition is where there is a pos-
      sibility for the inadvertent connection of an electrical circuit to cause unintentional current to flow
      where it would cause a short, spark, energize equipment, or initiate ordnance that would create a haz-
      ardous event.

         means of preventing connector mismating shall be provided.


Mismating includes improper installation as well as connecting wrong connectors. Prevention of con-
nector mismating includes alignment pins and key-way arrangements or other possible means to make it
impossible to incorrectly mismate. Color coding may be used in addition to, but not in lieu of, the more
positive means of connector mismate prevention.

         14.1.6.2. If a hazardous event can occur, the following precautions shall be taken:
             14.1.6.2.1. Power and signal leads shall not be terminated on adjacent pins of a connector.

       14.1.8.3. Cables in hazardous areas shall be designed so that they do not, in and of themselves,
       create a hazard.
       14.1.8.4. Cables shall be selected to include factors such as toxicity, combustibility and smoke
       production, offgassing, and compatibility with liquids in the area and environmental exposure.

         exceptions.
         14.2.7.2. Definition of Hazardous (Classified) Locations. Hazardous (Classified) locations are
         defined in NEC Article 500, Hazardous (Classified) Locations.
         14.2.7.3. Explosives and Propellants Not Covered in NEC Article 500. For range installations, the
         following paragraphs define the minimum requirements to be applied in the definitions of loca-
         tions in which explosives, pyrotechnics, or propellants are present or are expected to be present.
         These requirements shall be followed unless less stringent classifications are justified and
         approved as part of the design data submittal process. Range Safety and the Fire Marshal shall
         approve all potential critical facility hazardous location designations. (See Attachment 3 of this
         volume for a flowpath for classifying hazardous areas.)
             14.2.7.3.1. Class I, Division 1. Complete definitions of classified locations are found in
             NFPA 70. These include the following locations:
                14.2.7.3.1.1. Within 25 feet of any vent opening unless the discharge is normally inciner-
                ated or scrubbed to nonflammable conditions [less than 25 percent of Lower Explosive
                Limit (LEL)]. This distance may be increased if the vent flow rate creates a flammability
                concern at a distance greater than 25 feet.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                           191


               14.2.7.3.1.2. Below grade locations in a Class II, Division 1 area.
               14.2.7.3.1.3. Locations in which flammable liquids, vapors, or gases may be present in the
               air during normal operations.
           14.2.7.3.2. Class II, Division 1. Complete definitions of classified locations are found in
           NFPA 70.


Class II, Division 1 usually includes locations where volatile flammable liquids or flammable gases or
vapors are used but, in the judgment of Range Safety and the Fire Marshal, would become hazardous
only in case of an accident or of some unusual operating condition. The quantity of flammable material
that might escape in case of an accident, the adequacy of ventilating equipment, and the total area
involved are all factors that merit consideration in determining the classification and extent of each loca-
tion.

               14.2.7.3.2.1. Piping without valves, checks, meters, and similar devices would not ordi-
               narily introduce a hazardous condition even though used for flammable liquids or gases.
               Locations used for the storage of flammable liquids or of liquefied or compressed gases in
               sealed containers would not normally be considered hazardous unless also subject to other
               hazardous conditions.
               14.2.7.3.2.2. As determined by Range Safety and the Fire Marshal, locations may actively
               change classification depending on the flammable fluid system activity and configuration.
               For these types of locations, fixed or permanently installed electrical equipment shall be
               designed for the worst case hazardous environment.
               14.2.7.3.2.3. .Portable electrical equipment shall be designed for the worst case hazardous
               environment in which it will be used. Portable equipment that is not designated for use in
               a particular hazardous environment is not allowed in that environment.

                   clean rooms that are used to store and handle flammable and combustible propellants
                   when the concentration of vapors inside the room resulting from a release of all fluids
                   stored and handled equals or exceeds the LEL. The quantity of fluids used in the anal-
                   ysis to determine vapor concentration shall be the maximum amount allowed in the
                   explosives site plan.

                                              CHAPTER 16

                             COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE

16.1. General:
   16.1.1. The requirements for computer systems and software that are used to control and/or monitor
   operations identified as safety critical are described below. The term software, as used in AFSPC-
   MAN 91-710, includes firmware.


These requirements are not intended to be used as a checklist; instead, they are to be used in conjunction
with safety analyses performed in accordance with applicable standards and directives.

   16.1.2. The requirements shall be tailored to the system or system type under development. Unless
   specifically excluded by Range Safety, these requirements shall apply to all computer systems and
   subsystems that perform safety critical functions during the assembly, handling, checkout, test, and
   launch of missiles and space vehicles.


These systems and subsystems include auxiliary support equipment (such as cranes and ground trans-
port), vehicle ground support equipment (such as fuel and oxidizer), and airborne systems.

   16.1.3. In addition to contractor-developed computer systems and software, these requirements shall
   apply to programmable logic controllers (PLCs), firmware such as erasable programmable read only
   memory (EPROM or EEPROM), commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf
   (GOTS) products, and reused code.


Chapter 16, in its entirety, applies to all forms of software and firmware; however, special attention
should be paid to the following:
1. EPROMs or EEPROMs should contain unique version identifiers and be validated via checksum or
some other method before installation and use.
2. COTS, GOTS and re-use software should be examined and evaluated as to their appropriateness for
the intended new use. Unused portions of re-use software should be removed.

16.2. Determination of Safety Critical Computer System Functions. Range Users shall identify all
safety critical computer system functions (SCCSFs). These functions are defined as any computer system
function that, (1) if not performed, (2) if performed out of sequence, or (3) if performed incorrectly, may
directly or indirectly cause a safety hazard to exist. Safety critical computer system functions include, but
are not necessarily limited to, the following:


It is recommended that SCCSFs be identified and agreed to by Range Safety very early in the program
along with detailed documentation for each.

   16.2.1. Software used to control and/or monitor safety critical systems.
   16.2.2. Software used for fault detection in safety critical computer hardware or software.
200                                                                  AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


      16.2.3. Software used to transmit safety critical data, including time-critical data and data about haz-
      ardous conditions.
      16.2.4. Software that responds to the detection of a safety critical fault.
      16.2.5. FTS Software.
      16.2.6. Software that computes saety critical data.
      16.2.7. Software used to access safety critical data.
      16.2.8. Processor interrupt software associated with previously designated safety critical computer
      system functions.

16.3. Hardware and Software Safety Design Requirements. The following subparagraphs identify
general hardware and software requirements that shall be met for all safety critical computer system func-
tions.
      16.3.1. Computer Systems:
         16.3.1.1. Computer systems shall be validated for operation in the intended environment.


Validation of central processing unit (CPU) functionality should be based on testing.

         16.3.1.2. Under maximum system loads, CPU throughput shall not exceed 80 percent of its
         design value.


Although CPU throughput of 80 percent is acceptable, experience has shown that a value of 70 percent
is desirable.

         16.3.1.3. Computer system architecture shall be single failure fault tolerant.
             16.3.1.3.1. No single software fault/output shall initiate a hazardous operation.


Safety will also be enhanced if the system is designed so that memory locations not intended to be used
during a particular operation will tend to bring the system to a safe or stable state if inadvertently exe-
cuted.

             16.3.1.3.2. No single software fault/output shall cause a critical accident.
             16.3.1.3.3. No single or double software fault/output shall cause a catastrophic accident.
             16.3.1.3.4. Fulfilling the following requirements in addition to the other requirements in
             16.3.1 shall constitute meeting the computer system requirements in 16.3.1.3.1 through
             16.3.1.3.3 above. Range Users shall identify and provide the following items to Range Safety:
                 16.3.1.3.4.1. All hazardous operations that can be triggered by software, either intention-
                 ally or unintentionally.
                 16.3.1.3.4.2. All critical accidents that can be triggered by software.
                 16.3.1.3.4.3. catastrophic accidents that can be triggered by software.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                             201


               16.3.1.3.4.4. Scenarios where a single software fault/output can create a condition that can
               trigger a hazardous operation or critical accident. Consideration shall be given to data
               integrity, memory use, timeliness and correct sequencing of data, and situations where the
               interaction of modules, hardware, software, and/or users may be problematic.
               16.3.1.3.4.5. Scenarios where a single or double software fault/output can produce a con-
               dition that can trigger a catastrophic accident.
               16.3.1.3.4.6. Analyses and test reports that verify the capability to monitor the system dur-
               ing runtime to ensure the faulty conditions are corrected.
       16.3.1.4. .Safety critical computer system function flight architecture that will be exposed to cos-
       mic radiation shall protect against CPU single event upset (SEU) and other single event effects
       (SEE). An SEU occurs when an energetic particle travels through a transistor substrate and causes
       electrical signals within the transistor.


SEUs can be protected against through redundancy, error correcting memory, voting between parallel
CPUs, or other approved approaches.

       16.3.1.5. Sensitive components of computer systems shall be protected against the harmful
       effects of electromagnetic radiation and/or electrostatic discharge.
       16.3.1.6. As agreed to by Range Safety, the computer system shall periodically verify that safety
       critical hardware and SCCSF, including safety data transmission, are operating correctly.
   16.3.2. Computer System Power:
       16.3.2.1. Computer systems shall be powered up and/or restarted in a safe state.
       16.3.2.2. A computer system shall not enter a hazardous state as a result of an intermittent power
       transient or fluctuation.
       16.3.2.3. In the event of the single failure of primary power to a computer system or computer
       system component, that system or some cooperating system shall take action automatically to
       transition to a stable state.


In the context of response to failure or retreat from some unsafe state, a stable state is the safest possible
state that can be achieved without causing a more hazardous state to occur during that transition.

       16.3.2.4. Software used to power up safety critical systems shall power up the required systems in
       a safe state.
   16.3.3. Computer System Anomaly and Failure Detection:


In addition to those anomalies listed, software should be designed to alert appropriate operators to such
things as:
1. CPU running at greater than 80 percent of specified load.
2. Pending memory overflow.3. Pending buffer overflows.
202                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


         16.3.3.1. Before initiating hazardous operations, computer systems shall perform checks to
         ensure that they are in a safe state and functioning properly. These checks include checking safety
         critical circuits, components, inhibits, interlocks, exception limits, safing logic, memory integrity,
         and program loads.
         16.3.3.2. The following hazardous conditions and failures, including those from multiple sources,
         shall be detected:
            16.3.3.2.1. Invalid input - data or sequences of data passed to software modules, either by
            human input, other software modules, or environmental sensors, that are outside a specified
            range for safe operation.
            16.3.3.2.2. Invalid output - data output from software modules that are outside a specified
            range for safe operation.
            16.3.3.2.3. Timing errors - the state when software-timed events do not happen according to
            specification.
            16.3.3.2.4. Data transmission errors.
            16.3.3.2.5. Loss of memory integrtiy.
            16.3.3.2.6. Greater than allowed safe input data rates.
            16.3.3.2.7. he existence of a pattern other than the arm or safe codes in the arm/safe data reg-
            ister.
            16.3.3.2.8. Software exceptions, such as “divide by zero” or “file not found.”
            16.3.3.2.9. Data transfer messages corrupted or not in the proper format.
      16.3.4. Computer System Anomaly and Failure Response:
         16.3.4.1. All events mentioned in 16.3.3 shall be reported to the appropriate system operator con-
         soles in real time, prioritized as to severity, and logged to an audit file.


Displays that support SCCSFs can vary widely but every attempt should be made to ensure that the oper-
ators are alerted to the most important anomalies. A method of prioritization is necessary. For example,
anomalies of the same priority should be grouped together; all warnings displayed first, cautions next,
and advisories last. The most recent anomaly should be displayed at the top of the priority subgroup.
Details of each anomaly should be accessible with a single operator action.

            16.3.4.1.1. The display shall distinguish between read and unread anomaly alerts.
            16.3.4.1.2. The display shall support reporting multiple anomalies.
            16.3.4.1.3. The display shall distinguish between anomaly alerts for which corrective action
            has been taken and those that are still pending.
         16.3.4.2. Upon detecting an event described in 16.3.3, the software shall remain in or revert to a
         stable state.
         16.3.4.3. Upon detecting a failure during vehicle processing, the software shall maintain the FTS
         in its current state in addition to meeting the requirements in 16.3.4.1 and 16.3.4.2 above.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                        203


          16.3.4.3.1. The software shall maintain the FTS in the safe state before arming.
          16.3.4.3.2. After the FTS is armed, the software shall retain the FTS in the armed state.
          16.3.4.3.3. When the FTS receiver is on internal power, the software shall maintain the FTS
          receiver on internal power.
          16.3.4.3.4. During flight, all detected FTS-related system errors shall be transmitted to the
          range.
   16.3.5. Computer System Testing and Maintenance:
       16.3.5.1. Non-operational hardware and software required for testing or maintenance shall be
       clearly identified.
       16.3.5.2. Systems shall include interlocks, as necessary, to mitigate hazards when performing
       maintenance or testing.
       16.3.5.3. Interlocks shall be designed to prevent an inadvertent override.
       16.3.5.4. Interlocks that are required to be overridden shall not be autonomously controlled by a
       computer system, unless dictated by a timing requirement.
       16.3.5.5. Interlocks that are required to be overridden and are autonomously controlled by a com-
       puter system shall be designed to prevent an inadvertent override.
       16.3.5.6. The status of overridden interlocks shall be displayed on the appropriate operator con-
       sole(s).
       16.3.5.7. A positive indication of interlock(s) restoration shall be provided and verified on the
       appropriate operator console(s) before restoring a system to its operational state.
       16.3.5.8. Compilers:
          16.3.5.8.1. Existing code compiled with a new compiler or new release of a compiler shall be
          regression tested.
          16.3.5.8.2. Beta test versions of language compilers shall not be used for safety critical func-
          tions.

16.4. Software Requirements:

   developed, and tested in accordance with commercial software development standard IEEE/EIA
   12207, Standard for Information Technology.
   16.4.2. Software Coding Practices. The Range User/software developers should apply the software
   coding practices described in Appendixes D and E of the Joint Software System Safety Committee,
   Software System Safety Handbook, dated December 1999.


Experience has indicated that computer systems architectures that contain separate instruction and data
memory and buses, or separate program memory and data memory through memory protection hard-
ware, segment protection, or page protection prove useful for risk mitigation.
204                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004


      16.4.3. Human-Computer Interface:
         16.4.3.1. General human-computer interfaces should use the “DoD Human-Computer Interface
         Style Guide” as specified in Section 2.5 of Version 3.1 of the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA).
         16.4.3.2. The system shall be designed such that the operator may exit current processing to a
         known stable state with a single action.


Care should be taken to prevent the operator from inadvertently initiating a hazardous operation; there-
fore, the "single action" should be designed to minimize that possibility. That action may include press-
ing two keys at the same time.

         16.4.3.3. Computer systems shall minimize the potential for inadvertent actuation of hazardous
         operations.
         16.4.3.4. Only one operator at a time shall control safety critical computer system functions.
         16.4.3.5. Operator-initiated hazardous functions shall require two or more independent operator
         actions.


Examples of acceptable actions to initiate a hazardous operation are:
1. Pressing a key which produces an alert to notify the operator of the impending hazardous operation,
followed by a second keystroke to invoke the operation.
2. Removal of a physical block such as a switch cover followed by flipping the switch.

         16.4.3.6. Software shall provide confirmation of valid command and/or data entry to the operator.
         16.4.3.7. Software shall provide feedback to the operator that indicates command receipt and sta-
         tus of the operation commanded.


The system should provide both visual and aural feedback to ensure the operator knows that the system
has accepted the action and is processing it.

         16.4.3.8. Software shall provide the operator with real-time status reports of operations.
         16.4.3.9. Error messages that distinguish safety critical states/errors from non-safety critical
         states/errors shall be provided.
         16.4.3.10. The system shall ensure that a single failure or error cannot prevent the operator from
         taking safing actions.
      16.4.4. Softwae Data Standards:
         16.4.4.1. Software shall not use a bit pattern of all 1s or all 0s to denote the safe and arm (poten-
         tially hazardous) states.
         16.4.4.2. The arm and safe states shall be represented by unique bit patterns of length at least 4
         bits in such a way that the safe state pattern cannot represent the arm pattern as a result of a 1- or
         2-bit error.

   16.4.5. Configuration Control:
       16.4.5.1. The Range User shall provide a software configuration management (SCM) plan to
       Range Safety.


The system should be designed to prevent or minimize the chance for inadvertent or unauthorized access
to and modification of system software by system operators.

       16.4.5.2. Software and firmware shall be put under formal configuration control as soon as a soft-
       ware baseline is established.
       16.4.5.3. A Software Configuration Control Board (SCCB) shall be established to approve
       changes to configuration-controlled software before implementation.
       16.4.5.4. A member from the system safety engineering team shall be a member of the SCCB and

                                                CHAPTER 17

                                           WR SEISMIC DESIGN


The WR is in seismic zone 4. Local geological structure determines zone determination 1 through 4 con-
sidering the potential severity, frequency, and damage of a seismic event. This designation means that
the WR is located in the most severe seismic region. The probability of the WR being exposed to a
severe earthquake is great enough to require taking specific mitigating measures in design. This chapter
identifies equipment seismic design requirements. Equipment includes aerospace ground equipment
(AGE), ground support equipment (GSE), and ground support systems (GSS). For simplification, the
terms equipment and/or GSE are used in this chapter to include AGE, GSE, and GSS.

17.1. Applicability of Design and/or Anchorage or Restraint Requirements:
      17.1.1. Equipment needed/required for post-earthquake recovery, essential equipment (per code defi-
      nition), or safety critical equipment, shall be designed to remain operational or revert to a “safe mode”
      during a seismic event, and to be operational immediately following a seismic event. This equipment
      shall be designed with an importance factor of 1.5 (I = 1.5).
      17.1.2. Equipment whose failure or excessive deflections during a seismic event could propagate to a
      catastrophic event or endanger personnel, high-pressure systems, or systems used to store hazardous
      or toxic materials shall be designed and anchored to withstand a seismic event. The equipment need
      not remain operational after the seismic event as long as personnel and environmental safety is pre-
      served.
      17.1.3. Equipment whose movement could propagate to a catastrophic event, block personnel egress
      avenues, or injure personnel shall be secured to prevent movement.
      17.1.4. Transportation equipment shall be stored with the casters or wheels locked or blocked. Trans-
      portation equipment shall be stored in open areas so that if movement occurs during an earthquake,
      the equipment shall not impact adjoining structures (for example, building columns) and propagate
      into a facility failure.
      17.1.5. Gravity friction shall not be used to anchor or restrain equipment.

17.2. Basis for Design:
      17.2.1. Seismic design of equipment, supports and/or anchorages shall be in accordance with the
      International Building Code (IBC) and the additional requirements specified in this publication.
      17.2.2. The Structural Engineers Association of California, SEAOC Blue Book, may be used as a sup-
      plement to the above codes and standards.
      17.2.3. Appropriate seismic hazard mitigation shall be implemented for high cost computer or elec-
      tronic equipment.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V3 1 JULY 2004                                                                        207



Where it is cost-effective, high-cost computer or electronic equipment should be mounted on seismic
isolation bearings to mitigate damage during an earthquake. FEMA 74, Reducing the Risks of Non-
structural Earthquake Damage, A Practical Guide, should be used as a guide to reduce the risk of
earthquake non-structural damage.

   17.2.4. Seismic Loading and Loads Combinations:
       17.2.4.1. Seismic loads for AGE/GSE shall be calculated in accordance with the IBC.
       17.2.4.2. Seismic loading shall include vertical component in addition to the horizontal compo-
       nent. Minimum vertical seismic loading shall be 0.2g.
       17.2.4.3. Calculation of the seismic loads shall consider dynamic amplification and the dynamic
       characteristics of the GSE and their supports and anchorage.
       17.2.4.4. As an option, equipment anchorage loads may be designed to react to accelerations
       equivalent to a horizontal force of two times the equipment weight and a vertical force equivalent
       to 0.4 times the equipment weight applied through the equipment center of gravity.
       17.2.4.5. Loads combinations shall be in accordance with IBC and ANSI/ASCE 7, Minimum
       Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.
   17.2.5. Exemptions. GSE that meets any of the following criteria shall be exempt from seismic
   design and/or restraint requirements:
       17.2.5.1. Internal operational elements of GSE that are confined within the GSE structure.
       17.2.5.2. Man-handled GSE physically attached to flight hardware or GSE.
       17.2.5.3. GSE categorized as hand tools.
       17.2.5.4. GSE temporarily positioned in support of operations, used in accordance with the 30
       SW “24 hour” rule (in other words, equipment that is used for less than 24 hours per launch cycle),
       is exempted from seismic design and restraint requirements.
       17.2.5.5. On a case-by-case basis, those items that may be ruled exempt by Range Safety based
       on the results of a risk analysis.
   17.2.6. Existing Equipment. For programs and/or projects planning to reuse existing GSE that does
   not meet the requirements in this publication, contractor/Range User safety and engineering shall
   assess that equipment for potential risk. The contractor/Range User shall coordinate the risk assess-
   ment with Range Safety and formulate risk mitigation plans for the GSE in question.

17.3. WR Seismic Data Requirements. The GSE data package shall be submitted in accordance with
the requirements in Attachment 1, A1.2.5.19 of this volume and shall identify the equipment and potential
for seismic hazard and risk.

      pulsive upon mechanical, electrical, or thermal shock.
      18.2.2. An assessment of the requirements for onsite NDE testing of rocket motor segment and/ or
      motors. X-ray or ultrasonic testing equipment failure modes, and their effect on the rocket motor/seg-
      ment shall be analyzed. This analysis is particularly important for equipment used to inspect rocket
      motor bore.

18.3. Lightning Effects Hazard Analysis. For solid rocket segment/motor processing and storage facili-
ties, a lightning effects hazard analysis that analyzes the effects of a lightning strike on the rocket motor
segments and/or motors inside these facilities shall be performed. This analysis shall specify operational
restrictions; in other words, no lifting or handling of segments or motors during lightning advisory peri-
ods.

18.4. Solid Rocket Motor and Motor Segment Data Requirements. The data requirements found in
Attachment 1, A1.2.4.9.6 of this volume shall be submitted for solid rocket motors and motor segments.

NOTES
      1. Design, Fabrication, and In-Process Requiements:
          a. Meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 design requirements for handling structues.
          b. Identify SFP componens and SFP welds.
      2. Perform 100 percent visual inspection of all components (including SFP) and weld joints (includ-
         ing SFP and non-SFP) and perform 100 percent surface NDE testing of all SFP components and
         SFP welds.
      3. Perform 100 percent visual inspection of all components (including SFP) and weld joints (includ-
         ing SFP and non-SFP) and perform 100 percent surface NDE testing of all SFP components and
         SP welds.
      4. Cycle count is required.
      5. MHE and MHSE that has been in service for 10 years or 2,500 cycles, whichever is less, shall be
         evaluated against current Range Safety standards and requirements.
      6. Perform safe-live analysis assuming flaws to be in the worst location (transition areas, heat
          affected areas, weld joints, membrane sections, and highest stressed areas). Safe-life analysis
          shall be performed using fatigue crack growth computer programs such as
         NASA/FLAGRO (JSC-22267) or other Range Safety Approved computer programs or analysis
         methods. NOTE: Fracture mechanics analysis used to established cyclic limits may
         assume "crack like defects." This assumption does not imply that cracks or other rejectable
         indications are acceptable. The logic identified in this flow chart requires that cracks and reject-
         able indications be fixed.
       7. Provide noncompliance issues, if any, to Range Safety for disposition.
       8. All parts shall be considered to have a low-fracture toughness with a material property ratio
          Kic/Fty<0.33 in 1/2. If the part is a steel bolt and the Kic value is unknown, low fracture
          toughness shall be assumed when Ftu > 180 ksi.
                 Where: Kic = Plane strain fracture toughness
                           Fty = Allowable tensile yield strength
                           Ftu = Allowable tensile ultimate strength
             Reference: NASA NBH 8071.1
    9. Fix hardware. This means either repair or an analytical soluntion is required as approved by Range
Safety.
     10. Periodic test and inspection requirements are identified in the gray areas of the flow chart. All
other processes identified in the figure are considered initial test requirements.
    11. Proof test shall be performed on fully assembled handling structures, unless otherwise approved
by Range Safety. Do not proof test greater than 85 percent of yield.
   12. Perform NDE in accordance with Range Safety approved NDE plan.

NOTES
1: The following are considered flammable liquids/gasses:
      a. Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) - Flashpoint *(Closed Cup) 5×F. NOTE: There is
         conflicting information in available literature that presents the closed cup flashpoint of UDMH to
         be either 5oF or 35oF.
      b. Monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) - Flashpoint* (Closed Cup) 17×F.
2: Hydrazine (N2H4) - is considered a combustible liquid.
      a. The surface temperature of potential spill areas must also be considered.
      b. Temperature in the area must be single fault tolerant to remain below the flashpoint (Closed Cup)
         of 1000F.
      c. Below grade locations may still accumulate enough N2H4 to become flammable at lower temper-
         atures.
3. Adequate venilation is defined by NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, as that
which is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of significant quantities of vapor-air mixtures in concen-
trations over 25 percent of the lower flammability limit.
      a. An adequately ventilated location is one of the following:
         (1) An outside location.
       (2) A building, room, or space that is substantially open and free of obstruction to the natural pas-
sage of air, either vertically or horizontally. Such locations may be roofed over with no walls, may be
roofed over and closed on one side or may be provided with suitably designed wind breaks.
        (3) An enclosed or partly enclosed space provided with mechanical ventilation equivalent to nat-
ural ventilation. The mechanical ventilation system must have adequate safeguards against failure.
      b. Lower flammability limits of specific commodities are as follows:
         (1) N2H4 - 4.7 percent.
         (2) MMH - 2.5 percent.
         (3) UDMH - 2.0 percent.
         (4) Aerozine 50 - 2.0 percent.
    c. Payload propellant systems cannot normally be considered closed piping systems that include only
the pipe, valves, fittings, flanges, and meters; they normally also include a pressure vessel.
4. Payload propellant systems cannot normally be considered piping without valves, fitting, flanges, and
similar accessories.
5. Payload propllant systems cannot be considered suitable containers unless they meet DOT or ASME
requirements or meet AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 3, Chapter 12 and are also protected from outside
damage.
6. If this system is poorly maintained, ths location shall be classified Class I, Division I per Diamond 4,
item 4 above. Thus there is not a "no" answer to this quiestion leading to non-classification.

7. A payload propellant system would normally be considered a process equipment system. In a dynamic
mode, the answer to this question will almost always be “yes;” in a static mode, the answer may be “yes”
or “no” depending on past history and adequacy of protection from outside damage.
8. An analysis shall be provided. Consideration shall b given to the size of the containment area, credible
potential size of the spill, adequacy of the ventilation equipment and its potential failure modes, and the
specific gravity of the commodity in question.
