                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Background Information. This manual prescribes AF METAR weather observing and
reporting procedures based on agreements with the WMO, the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), international and domestic aviation interests and other civil weather services.
1.2. General. FCM-H1 establishes standard United States (US) surface weather observation
requirements and procedures for US Federal meteorological agencies. Based on FCM-H1, this
manual incorporates procedures applicable to AF weather operations in both US and overseas
locations. Visibility values are reported in statute miles at US locations (including Hawaii,
Alaska and Guam); at OCONUS locations visibility values are reported in the same units as the
visibility minimums published for the installation in the DoD FLIPs.
1.3. Applicability of Procedures. The procedures in this manual apply to all AF and Army
weather organizations performing automated, manual or augmented observing operations. No
set of procedures can cover all possibilities in weather observing. Weather technicians must use
their own judgment, adhering as closely as possible to the procedures in this manual, to describe
phenomena not covered adequately by this publication.

                                             Chapter 2

                          GENERAL OBSERVING INFORMATION

2.1. General. This chapter contains general procedures pertaining to all AF weather
organizations responsible for providing and/or arranging for surface weather observations.
     2.1.1. Airfield services functions, weather flights, operating locations, and detachments will
     be referred to in this document as exploitation units (EU).
     2.1.2. The EU will function as the "eyes forward" for the servicing operational weather
     squadron (OWS), and in many cases, will serve as the primary point of contact for the
     collaborative forecast effort to include resource protection for the installation.
     2.1.3. The responsibilities of EUs are outlined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 15-128, Air
     Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities and AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air and Space
     Weather Operations - Exploitation.
2.2. Automated Meteorological Observing Systems (AMOS). An AMOS refers to any
certified AF owned and AF or Army certified observing system (e.g., AN/FMQ-19, AN/TMQ-
53, Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)) with the capability to automatically collect
and disseminate observations.
     2.2.1. AMOSs will be operated in full automated mode, at Department of Defense (DoD)
     controlled airfields, to provide the official METAR and SPECI observations, except under
     the conditions specified in 3.2.1. EU leadership, after formal coordination with supported
     AF or Army organization leadership, will develop procedures based on sound Operational
     Risk Management (ORM) practices to ensure weather technicians are readily available to
     supplement and/or back-up observations as required in Chapter 3.
     2.2.2. In the automated mode, the system continually senses and measures the atmosphere
     for the following weather elements and parameters:                          Wind, Visibility,
     Precipitation/Obstructions to Vision, Cloud Height, Sky Cover, Temperature, Dew Point,
     Altimeter, and Lightning. The system will report wind speed and direction, visibility,
     thunderstorms, precipitation, obscurations to visibility, cloud height, sky cover, temperature,
     dew point and altimeter setting on all observations. The system will also format and report
     specific automated remarks as detailed in Attachment 3.
     2.2.3. Automated stations will always be considered automated, even when a weather
     technician augments or backs up an observation.
     2.2.4. Non-AF or non- Army controlled airfields (i.e., those not owned and operated by US
     military authorities) may be supported by AMOSs. There are many locations to include
     ranges, training areas, drop zones, military operation areas, and uncontrolled airfields where
     AMOSs provide stand-alone weather information.
     2.2.5. Organizations will update Flight Information Publication (FLIP) references IAW AFI
     11-201, Flight Information Publications, to specify those DoD controlled airfields operating
     with an AMOS.          Detailed procedures on updating FLIPs can be found at
     https://weather.af.mil/confluence/display/AFPUBLIC/Weather+Techniques+and+Proce

AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  9


2.3. Fixed Meteorological Equipment. The following requirements apply to all primary
meteorological equipment used in the generation of surface weather observations at both
automated and augmented weather observing locations.
   2.3.1. Equipment Maintenance, Calibration, and Standardization. EUs will perform required
   user/operator maintenance IAW equipment Technical Orders (TOs)/operator manuals. EUs
   will also ensure host/supporting airfield systems and computer maintenance personnel
   provide maintenance to meteorological and communications systems, to include equipment
   calibration and standardization IAW established maintenance schedules and other contract or
   local instructions outlining acceptable maintenance support and response times. Calibration
   and standardization should be performed upon installation and at least annually thereafter,
   and after any major maintenance is performed on an instrument or sensor.
   2.3.2. Siting and Exposure. As best as practical, AMOS sensor groups will be sited IAW the
   FCM-S4-1994, Federal Standard for Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports. Currently
   installed sensors may be operated at their present locations. However, if they are relocated,
   the federal standards will be followed. EUs will coordinate with the host/supporting airfield
   systems maintenance to perform an annual inspection of all meteorological equipment and
   ensure equipment is in good condition and verify no obstructions are affecting the
   equipment’s siting and exposure. EU leadership should accompany maintenance personnel
   on this inspection and log any new equipment limitation(s) into appropriate Flight
   Information Handbook or report equipment issues to higher level(s) (e.g., AFWA,
   MAJCOM).
   2.3.3. AMOSs will be certified IAW the Air Force Weather Station Certification &
   Observing System 21st Century (OS-21) Commissioning Plan. This document identifies the
   process EUs will use to certify AMOSs at Air Force and Army sites. The commissioning
   plan                          is                     located                        at
   https://weather.af.mil/confluence/download/attachments/10846889/Wx_Station_Certific
   ation_and_OS21_Commissioning_Plan.pdf.
2.4. Certification Requirements.
   2.4.1. Weather technicians will be fully trained, task certified, and position qualified
   according to requirements outlined in AFI 15-127, Air Force Weather Qualification Training
   and local training requirements.
   2.4.2. Weather technicians will task-certify ATC personnel to evaluate prevailing visibility
   values from the control tower. If required, weather technicians will also ensure ATC
   personnel can operate the applicable weather equipment in ATC facilities. Log ATC task
   certification on ATC provided AF 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and
   Rating Record.
2.5. Station Information File. EUs responsible for preparing surface weather observations,
regardless of the mode of operation, will ensure their station information is current and
maintained on permanent file at the 14 th Weather Squadron (14WS) and in the observing
locations historical file. See Attachment 4 for a list of information required. E-mail
information to the 14WS at ―14WS_customersvc@afccc.af.mil‖ and 2SYOS/SYSD at
―2SOS/SYSD@offutt.af.mil‖ or mail it to:

Note: E-mail addresses may change without notice.
2.6. Accuracy of Time. The accuracy of the time ascribed to weather observations is of the
utmost importance, especially in aviation safety investigations.
      2.6.1. EUs will designate a single timepiece as the standard clock and establish procedures to
      perform a time check on a daily basis. The standard clock will be a standalone clock zeroed
      with the US Naval Observatory time. A synchronized computer network clock may be used
      as the standard clock if it is verified that the Base/Post network time is synchronized on a
      daily basis with a Global Positioning System or US Naval Observatory clock. Annotate a
      time check in Column 90 on either AF 3803/3813, as applicable.
      2.6.2. Adjust internal clocks of all applicable equipment (e.g., Joint Environmental Toolkit
      (JET), AN/FMQ-19) to the time of the standard clock with each accomplished time check.
      Record any time corrections to equipment in Column 90, (e.g., 0605 ADS CLOCK
      ADJUSTED +20 SECONDS).
2.7. Aviation Weather Code Forms. In addition to prescribing basic observing fundamentals
and terms, this manual establishes aviation code forms for recording and disseminating METAR,
SPECI, and LOCAL weather observations.
      2.7.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR is a routine scheduled
      observation as well as the primary observation code used by the United States to satisfy
      requirements for reporting surface meteorological data. METAR contains a complete report
      of wind, visibility, runway visual range, present weather and obscurations, sky condition,
      temperature, dew point and altimeter setting collectively referred to as "the body of the
      report." In addition, encoded and/or plain language information that elaborates on data in the
      body of the report may be appended to the METAR. The contents of the remarks will vary
      according to the mode of operation (e.g., automated or augmented), and are defined in each
      part of this manual.
         2.7.1.1. EUs will establish METAR file times between H+55 to H+59 minutes past the
         hour. When augmenting an AMOS, the last observed element is the ascribed time of the
         observation to the nearest minute H+55 to H+59.
         2.7.1.2. METAR observations taken at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC include
         additional data and are known as 6-hourly observations. The METAR observations taken
         at 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100 UTC are known as 3-hourly observations and also contain
         additional information.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  11


   2.7.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the special criteria listed in Attachment
   2 are observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found in a METAR plus
   additional remarks that elaborate on data in the body of the report. All SPECI reports will be
   prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria are observed.
      2.7.2.1. The time ascribed to a SPECI reflects the time, to the nearest minute, that the
      SPECI criteria are first met or observed. For a METAR with SPECI criteria, the actual
      time of the observation will be H+55 to H+59 minutes past the hour (standard time of a
      METAR observation).
      2.7.2.2. Range criteria may take the place of the criteria in Attachment 2.
      2.7.2.3. COCOM/MAJCOM or higher headquarters may replace the criteria values in
      Attachment 2 with values from Combatant Commander instructions, manuals or
      supplements relating to command minima for landing, visual flight rules (VFR),
      instrument flight rules (IFR) and alternates.
   2.7.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). A LOCAL is an unscheduled
   observation, reported to the nearest minute, not meeting SPECI criteria. LOCALs will only
   be taken when local leadership determines there is a requirement in support of local
   operations or OPSEC considerations. For LOCALs taken in support of aircraft operations,
   the code form will be METAR. For LOCALs taken and disseminated to other than ATC
   agencies, the contents may be established locally and specified in base/host unit plans, local
   weather support agreements or standard operating procedures. LOCAL altimeter setting
   observations are taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when there has been a change
   of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG value. A METAR or SPECI taken
   within the established time interval will meet this requirement. All LOCAL altimeter setting
   reports will be prepared and disseminated as soon as possible after the relevant altimeter
   setting change is observed.
2.8. Observed Elements.
   2.8.1. Automated Observations. AMOSs use time averaging of sensor data. In an
   automated observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the
   30-minute period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated
   are based on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the
   observation. For the ―objective‖ element; such as pressure, temperature, dew point, and
   wind; automated and augmented observations use a fixed location and time-averaging
   technique. For the ―subjective‖ elements; such as sky condition, visibility, and present
   weather; augmented observations use a fixed time, spatial averaging technique to describe
   the visual elements, while an AMOS will use a fixed location, time-linear technique. Some
   AMOSs are capable of generating an observation every minute. The One-Minute
   Observation (OMO) is encoded in METAR format and includes all basic weather parameters
   found in the body of the METAR plus specific automated remarks. The OMO also accepts
   augmented elements and remarks.           The difference between the OMO and the
   METAR/SPECI is that the OMO is not disseminated. The weather technician can manually
   disseminate the OMO if required, for example, upon arrival at an Alternate Operating
   Location (AOL).
 12                                                         AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      2.8.2. Augmented Observations. Individual elements entered in an observation must, as
      closely as possible, reflect conditions existing at the actual time of observation. Elements
      entered will have been observed within 15 minutes of the actual time of the observation.
      Gusts and squalls will be reported if observed within 10 minutes of the actual time of the
      observation. Observation of elements will be made as close to the scheduled time of the
      observation as possible to meet filing deadlines, but in no case will these observations be
      started more than 15 minutes before the scheduled time. Supplement elements evaluated
      instrumentally with visual observations to ensure accuracy.
         2.8.2.1. Order of Observing. Elements having the greatest rate of change are evaluated
         last. When conditions are relatively unchanging, evaluate the elements in the following
         order:
             2.8.2.1.1. Elements evaluated outdoors. Before taking observations at night, spend
             as much time as practicable outside to allow your eyes to become adjusted to the
             limited light of the nighttime sky.
             2.8.2.1.2. Elements evaluated indoors, with pressure last.
2.9. Installation Observation Requirements.
      2.9.1. At all EUs, the local ceiling, prevailing visibility, and runway visual range landing and
      circling minima will be SPECI observations generated by the AMOS or the weather
      technician. SPECI criteria will be based on published airfield minima (take-off, landing,
      circling) for all approaches (e.g., Instrument Landing System (ILS), Tactical Air Navigation
      system (TACAN)) and other AF, higher headquarters, MAJCOM, Army and installation
      directives. EUs with an AMOS will update SPECI criteria in the software to ensure the
      system generates the required SPECI observations.
      2.9.2. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Review. EUs will have procedures to review
      each new edition of DoD FLIPs, including the Radar Instrument Approach Minimums, local
      NOTAMs and applicable directives for changes in the airfield minima as soon as possible
      after publication. See the Air Force Weather Techniques and Procedures – Flight
      Information             Publication           Procedures           located            at
      https://weather.af.mil/confluence/download/attachments/12653971/Weather_Technique
      s_and_Procedures_3.2.1._FLIP_Procedures.pdf.
      2.9.3. Magnetic Variation. The local magnetic variation must be determined at each
      observing location to convert wind direction from magnetic to true. Obtain local magnetic
      variation from the installations DoD FLIPs or the Tactical Plotting Chart for your area,
      whichever is most current, or the National Oceanographic Atmospheric Association National
      Geophysical Data Center website located at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-
      web/#declination. Local variation will change by several minutes of arc each year at most
      locations. Weather leadership must monitor FLIPS or revised charts for changes in local
      magnetic direction. Shifts in variation may affect the orientation of the wind equipment;
      therefore, keep maintenance personnel informed of changes.
         2.9.3.1. From magnetic to true: (1) add easterly variation to magnetic direction, and (2)
         subtract westerly variation from magnetic direction.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    13


       2.9.3.2. From true to magnetic: (1) add westerly variation to true direction, and (2)
       subtract easterly variation from true direction.
2.10. Unofficial Weather Reports. Unofficial weather reports are defined as a report of one or
more weather elements from an individual who is not task certified to take official weather
observations (e.g., a pilot or law enforcement official). Unofficial reports can provide additional
and supplemental information that may be important to local aviation and public safety. It can
also help increase the weather technician's situational awareness. Unofficial reports of severe
weather from credible sources within 15 statute miles will be appended in the remarks of the
observation and disseminated longline and locally during augmentation of an AMOS (e.g.,
unconfirmed tornado 9 statute miles west of KFAW per law enforcement). Follow up credible
reports of severe weather with the supporting OWS. Mission-restricting weather may be
appended in the remarks of the observation and sent out at the technician’s discretion.
2.11. Points of Observation. For meteorological observations, the observing location is
defined as the ―Point of Observation.‖ ―Points of Observation‖ are locations where the various
elements of the observation are evaluated. Normally, these locations are confined to an area
within 5 statute miles (8000 meters) of the runway complex, drop zone, or landing zone. In
cases where all measurements are taken at approximately the same point, a weather organization
will be regarded as having a single observation location. In cases where various sensors are in
different locations to obtain acceptable exposure, the weather observations may also contain
information on phenomena occurring at areas other than the official observing location (e.g.,
clouds over mountains W, lightning SE, thunderstorms NW). However, in such cases, the point
of observation is not extended to include points where the distant phenomena are occurring. For
example, at a large, modern airfield, the points of observation are generally considered as
follows:
   2.11.1. Automated Observations: The location of the primary sensor group and the
   discontinuity sensor group. The latitude, longitude, and elevation information should be
   provided to the supporting OWS and forwarded to the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) if
   the instrumentation is moved or a site survey shows the reported information to be in error.
   2.11.2. Augmented Observations:
       2.11.2.1. For elements such as prevailing visibility, present weather, obscurations and all
       cloud height and ceiling elements, the observing location may be coincident with the
       weather observing location; or it may be the touchdown area of the primary runway. The
       selected location must provide consistent visually determined values.
       2.11.2.2. The center of the runway complex for temperature, dew point, pressure,
       lightning and winds if the sensor is not installed at touchdown areas. If there is no
       sensing capability available on the runway complex, weather technicians may obtain
       temperature, dew point, pressure, lightning and wind data using back-up methods at the
       observing location.
       2.11.2.3. A point near the approach end of a runway for touchdown runway visual range
       (RVR) and winds.
2.12. Rounding of Figures and Values. Except where otherwise designated, round figures and
values as follows:
 14                                                         AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      2.12.1. If the fractional part of a positive number to be dropped is equal to or greater than
      one-half, the preceding digit will be increased by one. If the fractional part of a negative
      number to be dropped is greater than one-half, the preceding digit will be decreased by one.
      In all other cases, the preceding digit will remain unchanged. For example, 1.5 becomes 2, -
      1.5 becomes -1, 1.3 becomes 1, and -2.6 becomes -3.
      2.12.2. When cloud height and visibility values are halfway or less between two reportable
      values, report the lower value. For example, cloud heights of 2,549 feet and 2,550 feet are
      reported as 2,500 feet, visibility values of 5 1/4 statute miles (8250 meters) and 5 1/2 statute
      miles (8500 meters) are reported as 5 statute miles (8000 meters).
      2.12.3. When cloud height and visibility values are greater than halfway between two
      reportable values, report the higher value. For example, a cloud height of 2,451 feet is
      reported as 2,500 feet, and a visibility value of 4 3/4 statute miles (7750 meters) is reported
      as 5 statute miles (8000 meters).
      2.12.4. When computations of pressure values require that a number be rounded to comply
      with standards on reportable values, the number will be rounded down to the next reportable
      value. For example, a station pressure reading of 29.249 is rounded down to 29.245 while a
      station pressure reading of 29.244 is rounded down to 29.240. Altimeter setting readings of
      29.249 and 29.244 are both truncated to 29.24.
      2.12.5. Altimeter settings provided for international aviation purposes and reported in whole
      hectopascals (hPa) are rounded down when disposing of tenths of hPa (e.g., 1009.9 hPa and
      1009.1 hPa are both rounded down to 1009 hPa).
2.13. Alternate Operating Location (AOL). EUs responsible for preparing surface weather
observations, without regard to the mode of operation, will establish an AOL when the primary
location is evacuated. EUs will work with the local command to establish an AOL and outline
what is needed from various agencies on the installation to support operations at the location.
Operations at the AOL and any reciprocal support from other agencies will be coordinated and
formally documented in base/host unit plans or a local weather support document. See AFMAN
15-129, Volume 2, Air Force Weather Operations - Exploitation, for additional guidance on
operating at an AOL.
      2.13.1. The AOL will be a location with adequate communications and a view of the airfield
      complex. Some EUs may be equipped to augment the AMOS at the AOL, assuming the
      AMOS sensors are still working. If the sensors are not operating, or there is no interface
      available to augment the AMOS, EUs should plan to use available back -up equipment (e.g.,
      deployable equipment) and methods to prepare the observation.
      2.13.2. Within 15 minutes of arrival at the AOL, weather technicians will complete and
      transmit an augmented observation. The ―eyes forward‖ function will begin as soon as
      practical after the observation is transmitted. Note: Observation is not required at automated
      locations if AMOS is working properly and no mandatory supplementary criteria are
      occurring.
      2.13.3. At a minimum, weather technicians must be able to prepare an initial observation
      containing the minimum required elements (i.e., wind speed and direction, prevailing
      visibility, present weather and obscurations, sky condition, temperature, dew point and
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  15


   altimeter setting). Mandatory elements may be omitted from the observation if the necessary
   equipment is not available.
   2.13.4. Resume normal observing operations (i.e., automated, augmented) upon return to the
   primary observing location.
2.14. Weather Watch. Weather technicians at augmented EUs will perform one of two types
of weather watch: a Basic Weather Watch (BWW), or a Continuous Weather Watch (CWW).
Note: At automated locations, the AMOS performs an automatic CWW. When augmentation is
required, weather personnel will perform the BWW (EUs may also perform a CWW if locally
determined to be more appropriate due to existing meteorological conditions).
   2.14.1. Basic Weather Watch. A BWW will be conducted when the airfield is open and
   during periods when any of the mandatory augmentation of AMOS is required IAW Chapter
   3. Due to these other weather duties, weather technicians on duty may not detect and report
   all weather changes as they occur. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather
   conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to
   determine the need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following conditions are
   observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
   2.14.1.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
       2.14.1.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
       2.14.1.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
       2.14.1.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 statute miles (4800 meters).
       2.14.1.5. Precipitation (any form).
       2.14.1.6. Thunderstorms
       2.14.1.7. Fog or Mist.
       2.14.1.8. All supplemental criteria specified in Table 3.1.
       2.14.1.9. During mandatory back-up of AMOS IAW Para 3.4.
       2.14.1.10. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather technicians will
       remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI
       observation. Weather technicians will also monitor local area observational and forecast
       products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of
       responsibility.
   2.14.2. Continuous Weather Watch. At augmented EUs that require a CWW, weather
   technicians will monitor weather conditions continuously and perform no other significant
   duties. In addition to taking METARs, weather technicians will take and disseminate
   observations as conditions occur that meet SPECI observation criteria. EUs may perform a
   CWW during AMOS augmentation if locally determined to be more appropriate due to
   existing meteorological conditions.
2.15. Cooperative Weather Watch. EUs responsible for preparing surface weather
observations, without regard to the mode of operation, will establish a cooperative weather watch
with ATC and other appropriate base/post agencies, as required. Of primary concern is the
report of tower visibility different from the prevailing surface visibility, local PIREPs and any
 16                                                          AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be
critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. All weather
technicians must thoroughly understand and be able to execute every element in the local
cooperative weather watch agreement.
      2.15.1. The cooperative weather watch will define, at a minimum, the process for task
      certified ATC personnel to report changes in tower prevailing visibility to the local EU when
      tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters) and different from the surface
      prevailing visibility.
      2.15.2. As part of the cooperative weather watch, if continuous RVR reporting is needed
      during airfield closure hours, EUs with AMOS systems will notify airfield leadership that the
      RVR system requires the runway lights to be left on to work properly. This is encouraged if
      the possibility exists for an emergency aircraft divert into the location.
      2.15.3. EUs will coordinate cooperative weather watch requirements in base/host unit pla ns
      or local weather support agreement.
2.16. Control Tower Observations and Weather Observing Location Actions.
      2.16.1. ATC Personnel. ATC directives (e.g., AFI 13-204, Volume 3, Airfield Operations
      Procedures and Programs; FAAO JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, TC 3-04.81 (FM 3-
      04.303) Air Traffic Control Facility Operations, Training, Maintenance, and
      Standardization) require task certified control tower personnel to make tower prevailing
      visibility observations when the prevailing visibility at the usual point of observation or at the
      tower level, is less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters). Control tower personnel task certified
      to take visibility observations will also notify the weather technician when the observed
      tower prevailing visibility decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4 statute
      miles (6000 meters).
      2.16.2. Weather technicians at augmented EUs will:
         2.16.2.1. Notify the tower, as soon as possible, whenever the prevailing visibility at the
         official weather observation point decreases to less than or increases to equal or exceed 4
         statute miles (6000 meters).
         2.16.2.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing visibility, as soon as practicable, upon initial
         receipt of a differing control tower value and upon receipt of subsequent reportable
         changes at the control tower level.
         2.16.2.3. Use control tower values of prevailing visibility as a guide in determining the
         surface visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings,
         aircraft, etc. The presence of a surface-based obscuration, uniformly distributed to
         heights above the level of the tower, is sufficient reason to consider the EUs prevailing
         visibility the same as the control tower level.
2.17. Observing Aids for Visibility. EUs will post charts, lists or other positive means of
identifying lights or objects used as observing aids near the weather technician's position (both
primary, alternate observing locations and augment locations for AMOS sites) so they can be
accessed quickly and easily. Separate lists or charts may be used for daytime and nighttime
markers. In any case, the aids must be clearly identified as to whether they are daytime or
nighttime aids. EUs will update visibility charts at least annually.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   17


   2.17.1. Observing locations should research the availability of detailed host installation
   maps/references first and as required submit a work order to survey the markers through the
   local Base Civil Engineering or Army equivalent (if on an Army installation) agency to
   create visibility aids/charts. Deployed locations should use available tools, such as military
   grid reference system maps, laser range finder equipment, and global positioning system
   devices to determine distances to visibility markers and create visibility aids/charts.
   2.17.2. The most suitable daytime markers are prominent dark or nearly dark colored objects
   (such as buildings, chimneys, hills or trees) observed in silhouette against a light-colored
   background, preferably the horizon sky. When using an object located in front of a terrestrial
   background, use caution when the object is located closer to the point of observation than it
   is to the terrestrial background.
   2.17.3. The most desirable night-visibility markers are unfocused lights of moderate
   intensity (about 25 candelas). The red or green runway course lights of airway beacons and
   TV or radio tower obstruction lights may be used. Do not use focused lights such as airway
   beacons due to their intensity; however, their brilliance may serve as an aid in estimating
   whether the visibility is greater or less than the distance to the light source.
   2.17.4. Representative visibility markers should be high quality (color/digital) photos taken
   on a predominantly cloud and obscuration free (clear) day and be representative of the
   current state of the airfield/site (see Figure 2.1). It is also recommended observing locations
   develop map-type visibility charts to augment the photographic visibility markers.

Figure 2.1. Example Visibility Checkpoint Photograph




   2.17.5. Control Tower Visibility Aids. ATC regulations require control towers to maintain a
   visibility checkpoint chart or list of visibility markers posted in the tower. Upon request,
 18                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      EUs will provide whatever assistance is necessary to help prepare a chart or markers of
      suitable objects for determining tower visibility.
2.18. Aircraft Mishap. Upon notification of an aircraft mishap, EUs will:
      2.18.1. Collect and save data related to an aircraft mishap according to instructions in
      AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air Force Weather Operations - Exploitation. Technicians will
      retrieve the archived surface observation data as required by the requesting agency.
      2.18.2. All EUs regardless of operating mode will encode/disseminate a SPECI observation
      IAW instructions detailed in this document.
2.19. Supplementary Data for an Inactive or Parallel Runway. ATC may occasionally
authorize an aircraft to land using an inactive runway. This is a temporary measure and the
current (official) observation is not affected since the active runway is not officially changed.
However, if weather sensors are installed on the inactive runway, the ATC agency may initiate a
requirement for observational data to control aircraft using that runway. At locations where
ATC has procedures to land aircraft on an inactive runway, the EU will develop specific
procedures coordinated with ATC and specified in the base/host unit plans or a local weather
support document. Any requirement must be based on the following factors:
      2.19.1. Wind and RVR. These are the only sensor-derived elements likely to differ between
      the two runways. Current wind data from sensors near the runway are normally available to
      the controller by means of a switching capability in the tower. Therefore, procedures for
      supplementary data are generally necessary only for RVR. At augmented locations, if
      required, RVR for an inactive runway must be reported using the same basic code form as
      that specified for the active runway (e.g., to include the runway number). Supplemental
      RVR data can be encoded and transmitted as a remark in column 13. Wind data from dual
      parallel runways can be reported in the remarks section of a METAR or SPECI observation
      whenever a 6-knot sustained or gust speed difference exists between the active end wind
      sensors. Example: WND RWY 32R 300/10G15KT.
      2.19.2. Cloud Heights. Cloud heights generally do not differ from one end of a runway to
      the other. However, AMOS discontinuity sensors will report cloud ceiling heights as a
      remark in the observation. Any variation in sky condition relative to the runways, such as
      reported in local PIREPs, can be taken into consideration in the evaluation of sky cover as
      reported in the official observation. EUs may report in the remarks section of the observation
      significant or unusual variations in the sky condition (e.g., CLD LYR AT 400 FT ON APCH
      RWY 23 RPRTD BY PIREPS) that could affect flying operations.
2.20. Instrument Procedures.
      2.20.1. When the accuracy or validity of values from meteorological equipment is
      questionable, discontinue use of such equipment and use back-up equipment and methods
      until corrective maintenance actions have been accomplished. Note: AMOSs obtain data
      and compute elements differently from manual observing methods. Weather technicians
      should take into account these differences before logging any system or sensor out.
      2.20.2. Dual Instrumentation/Outage. EUs with weather equipment sensors installed near
      the approach end of two or more runways will use the sensors installed at the active
      (approach) end of the runway when the equipment is operational and considered reliable. If
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                19


  cloud height equipment for the active runway is inoperative, data obtained from the inactive
  runway (or alternate runway) equipment may be used if the measurements are considered
  representative. If wind equipment is inoperative, determine wind data for the runway in use
  using the most reliable system available (i.e., inactive runway instrumentation, hand-held
  anemometer, Beaufort scale, etc.) and include a WND DATA ESTMD remark. If the RVR
  equipment is inoperative and visibility is equal to or less than 1 mile (1600 meters), RVR is
  reported locally and longline as RVRNO. Do not use the alternate end RVR.
 20                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


                                             Chapter 3

                                        AUGMENTATION

3.1. Purpose. This chapter describes the procedures to augment surface weather observations
produced by an AMOS.
3.2. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified weather
technicians manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited AMOS.
The two augmentation processes used are supplement and back-up. Supplementing is a method
of manually adding meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the
capabilities of the AMOS to detect and/or report. Table 3.1 identifies elements that are
mandatory to supplement. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data
and/or dissemination to an AMOS observation when the primary automated method is not
operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
      3.2.1. Determining Augmentable Observation Elements. EUs will only augment for those
      items listed in Table 3.1 and those that would adversely impact flight/ground operations,
      based on documented supported unit requirements, if not augmented. EUs will use manual
      observing methods (e.g., prevailing visibility reporting, thunderstorm reporting) when
      augmenting an AMOS. Back-up the specific observation elements that are missing or
      incorrect due to sensor and/or communication failure.
      3.2.2. Automated Dissemination System (ADS). In this manual, ADS refers to any Air
      Force, Army or NWS accredited dissemination system (e.g., JET or Advanced Weather
      Interactive Processing System (AWIPS)).
      3.2.3. Augmentation Responsibilities. To perform augmentation duties, the weather
      technician must maintain situational awareness of current weather conditions and AMOS
      observations. EUs will develop ORM based augmentation procedures and clearly defined
      duty priorities that include augmentation. These duties will be coordinated and defined in the
      local weather support agreement or equivalent document. In all cases, the highest priority
      will be flight safety.
      3.2.4. Entering and Disseminating Augmented Information. EUs will use ADS to enter and
      disseminate augmented information. If an ADS is not available for use during augmentation,
      EUs will develop back-up procedures to disseminate locally and use an applicable back-up
      weather system interface to disseminate longline (e.g., Air Force Weather Web Services
      (AFW-WEBS)).
      3.2.5. Documenting Augmented Observations. EUs will document AMOS augmented
      observations using ADS (JET) Form 3813, electronic or paper AF 3803, or the approved
      electronic    workbook       version   (Excel®)     of   Form    3803      (available:
      https://notus2.afccc.af.mil/SCIS/form3803info.asp).
      3.2.6. All AN/TMQ-53s used must be properly set up and sited as best as practical IAW
      FCM-S4-1994 prior to use in automated mode. Additionally, EUs will not use UTC-
      postured (deployable) AN/TMQ-53s as their permanent base/post observing system. Note:
      Known limitations on the extended heights of AN/TMQ-53 visibility and wind sensors
      prevent full compliance with all applicable FSM-S4-1994 sensor siting standards.
     AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  21


         3.2.7. ADS Dissemination. Weather technicians should only configure their ADS to
         disseminate in the ―augmented‖ versus ―automated‖ mode when augmentation is required.
         Selecting the ADS ―augmented‖ dissemination mode removes the ―AUTO‖ report modifier
         from the METAR/SPECI observation. When augmentation is no longer required, weather
         personnel must reconfigure their ADS to disseminate in a fully automated mode to turn on
         the ―AUTO‖ report modifier.
     3.3. Supplementing AMOSs. Weather technicians are required to have a view of the airfield
     complex when supplementing an AMOS. Weather technicians will perform a BWW and be
     prepared to supplement observations when the airfield is open and the weather conditions in
     Table 3.1 are observed and/or forecast to occur within 1 hour. Weather personnel are required to
     log on to an ADS and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued
     for tornadic activity. Weather technicians are not required to supplement during airfield closure
     hours for other Table 3.1 criteria. Note: This does not relieve EUs of their AFI 10-229,
     Responding to Severe Weather Events, AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and
     Responsibilities and AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Air Force Weather Operations – Exploitation,
     responsibilities for responding to severe weather events during non-duty hours. EUs will
     continue to have SWAP in place to respond to severe weather threats. EUs should concentrate
     their SWAP efforts on eyes forward resource protection and notification efforts during airfield
     closure hours.

Funnel Cloud (Tornadic Activity _B/ E(hh)mm_LOC/DIR_(MOV)) (Note 2)
Snow Depth (Note 4) (only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been issued and
snowfall is occurring)
NOTES:
1. References for coding of augmentable weather conditions are located in Chapter 13.
2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedence over any other phenomena.
3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather watch or warning
has been issued for the phenomena.
4. All Remarks and Additive Data references are provided in Attachment 3.
         3.3.1. Supplementing remarks. Remarks will be added when supplementing for the above
         criteria. Note: When operating in an auto mode, the FMQ-19 generates the full range of
         required automated remarks listed in Attachment 3. In contrast, the FMQ-22 and TMQ-53
 22                                                      AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      are only capable of generating the lightning and sea level pressure automated remarks.
      Weather organizations using the FMQ-22 or TMQ-53 are not required to manually
      supplement an observation with the additional automated remarks found in Attachment 3.
      Future ADS software patches will be fielded to correct this issue. Weather organizations
      using the FMQ-22 and TMQ-53 are still required to supplement and back-up for all other
      required non-automated remarks listed in Attachment 3.
      3.3.2. Supplementing Tornadic Activity. Tornado(s), waterspout(s), or funnel cloud(s) will
      be reported in a METAR/SPECI IAW Attachment 2 whenever they are observed to begin
      (first seen), are in progress, or disappear (end).
      3.3.3. Supplementing Hail. Hail will be reported in a METAR/SPECI when hail meeting
      local warning criteria begins, is in progress or ends. Depth of hail on the ground is not
      reported in the METAR/SPECI report. When hail is supplemented in the body of the report,
      a remark should be included to report the beginning or ending time, unless the SPECI time is
      the beginning or ending time of the hail. When required to supplement, the weather
      technician should report the hailstone size in remarks. Refer to Attachment 3, for reporting
      hailstone size.
      3.3.4. Supplementing Volcanic Ash. Volcanic Ash will be reported whenever it is observed.
      Refer to Chapter 8 and Attachment 3, for reporting volcanic ash.
3.3.5. Supplementing Sand Storms/Dust Storms. Sandstorms/Duststorms will be reported
whenever a local warning for the condition is required.
3.4. Back-up of an AMOS. Except for some automated remarks, back-up refers to weather
technicians providing the same reporting capability as that provided by the AMOS. Weather
technicians will back-up the AMOS equipment if the system/sensor(s) is/are not operational or
unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. Weather technicians will make every
attempt to immediately log out any broken equipment, except when immediate flight safety (e.g.,
in-flight emergency) warrants otherwise. Weather technicians are not required to immediately
log a system/sensor out if a deficiency report is currently published by AFWA. Weather
technicians do not need to log out the AMOS as the result of a system restart. Refer to AFI 21-
103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, for additional information. EU
leadership will use sound ORM practices to develop/document those operationally significant
weather thresholds (normally provided by a fully operational AMOS) to report while operating
in back-up mode. There is no requirement to back-up the system/sensor when the airfield is
closed. Weather technicians will provide back-up information IAW Attachment 2 and
Attachment 3. Back-up information is required for longline dissemination, for OWS terminal
aerodrome forecast (TAF) production and for local ground-to-air dissemination to sustain air
operations at the airfield (e.g., ATC functions and/or the Automatic Terminal Information
Service (ATIS)). Use manual observing procedures for individual elements when performing
back-up operations. Weather technicians will not replace the entire automated observation with
a manual observation when backing-up malfunctioning sensors.
3.5. Back-up Equipment. EUs should use available equipment (e.g., AN/FMQ-19
discontinuity sensors, AN/TMQ-53, hand-held weather device (e.g., Kestrel®), or other
MAJCOM or AFWA-approved equipment to back-up AMOSs).
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 23


   3.5.1. Conditions for using an AN/TMQ-53 in a back-up mode. EUs may use the AN/TMQ-
   53 as a primary or back-up without estimating values if all the following conditions are met:
       3.5.1.1. The AN/TMQ-53 equipment is in good working condition (e.g., operating
       properly) and properly maintained IAW the TO and established maintenance schedules.
       3.5.1.2. The equipment is set up and operated IAW the T.O. and is sited IAW FCM-S4-
       1994, Chapters 3 and 4. Note: The TMQ-53 has known sensor height exposure
       limitations. However, if the siting requirement in Chapters 3 and 4 are met, the values
       obtained are not estimated.
       3.5.1.3. The values from the AN/TMQ-53 equipment are representative and consistent
       with the values from surrounding observing sites (if available).
   3.5.2. Wind and pressure values from any piece of back-up equipment (e.g., hand-held
   devices or other deployable meteorological equipment), other than a properly sited and
   maintained AN/TMQ-53, will be estimated.
   3.5.3. Unrepresentative Values.      Unrepresentative meteorological values from any
   equipment will not be included in the observation. These values will be considered missing
   (M) if the value cannot be determined by other means.
3.6. Maintenance Procedures. Maintenance procedures for each system are outlined in the
applicable system TO. In addition to the TO procedures, weather technicians will ensure
supported ATC agencies are notified of all outages prior to contacting any maintenance agency.
Notify the AFWA Fielded Systems Service Center (FSSC) when airfield systems personnel are
repairing/replacing parts on any AMOS equipped with a remote maintenance capability (e.g., an
AN/FMQ-19). The AFWA FSSC should not be notified of ASOS outages; use local procedures
instead.

                                            Chapter 4

                               OBSERVATION FORM ENTRIES

4.1. Introduction. This chapter contains instructions for making entries on Form 3813 provided
by the ADS and AF 3803.
4.2. ADS Procedures. EUs with an ADS (e.g., JET) will use the Form 3813 to
encode/disseminate all METAR and SPECI observation data.
      4.2.1. The Form 3813 is an electronically generated official record of daily surface weather
      observations and summary data.
      4.2.2. The ADS has the ability to store data on the Form 3813 and electronically transmit it
      to the 14WS for processing and archive; however, EUs may manually edit and send the form
      to the 14WS at an appropriate time, usually at the beginning of the next duty day (not to
      exceed 7 days).
      4.2.3. Only position qualified weather technicians are authorized to make entries on the
      Form 3813 during augmentation. Trainees may make form entries only when under the
      immediate supervision of a position-qualified weather technician who attests to the validity
      of the entries.
      4.2.4. The Form 3813 automatically populates some of the Summary of Day (SOD) data
      fields as the observations are entered on the ADS. The weather technician will enter or
      correct data as needed.
      4.2.5. The National Climatic Data Center and 14WS automatically collect weather
      observations and summary of the day information from automated ASOS-equipped locations
      that use the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) to disseminate their
      observations.
      4.2.6. Single element LOCALs for altimeter setting can be entered in the ADS Form 3813
      for dissemination. If passed by voice, altimeter LOCALs can be recorded on AF 3803 if not
      recorded on a local dissemination log or a tape recording. If altimeter LOCALs are input
      into an ADS (e.g., JET), the temperature and dew point must also be encoded for the ADS to
      properly calculate PA and DA.
4.3. Non-ADS Procedures. EUs not equipped with ADS will use an electronic or paper AF
3803 or the approved electronic workbook version (Excel ®) of Form 3803 (available:
https://notus2.afccc.af.mil/SCIS/form3803info.asp.). Paper or electronic forms are an official
record of daily surface weather observations and summary data.
      4.3.1. The form may be printed out as a paper version at non-ADS EUs. Start a new form
      with the first observation of each new calendar day local standard time (LST).
      4.3.2. EUs taking surface observations for deployed weather operations (classified or
      unclassified) will prepare the electronic or paper, AF 3803 in one copy. If using a paper
      copy of the AF 3803, data may be recorded for more than 1 day on the same sheet by
      entering the day and month of the next day's observations on a separate line following the
      last observation of the preceding day. If using the electronic version of the AF 3803, use a
      separate worksheet for each calendar day.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  25


  4.3.3. Only position-qualified weather technicians are authorized to make form entries.
  Trainees may make form entries only when under the immediate supervision of a position-
  qualified weather technician who attests to the validity of the entries by initialing in column
  18 (trainee’s initials go in Column 90 Remarks).
  4.3.4. When paper AF 3803 is used, ensure legible copies and ample contrast (for
  photographic requirements) by using only a pencil with black grade 2 medium lead or a
  mechanical pencil (.5 mm or .7 mm) using only black HB or MH lead. AF 3803 hand-
  written entries will be all capital, block letters, or block numerals.
  4.3.5. All METAR and SPECI observations will be recorded on the AF 3803. LOCAL
  altimeter setting observations do not need to be recorded on the form if a record of the
  observations is maintained on a local dissemination log, or a tape-recording. When in doubt,
  record the LOCAL.
  4.3.6. Separation of Data. Use a blank space in column 13 to separate data. Do not use a
  solidus (/).
  4.3.7. Missing Data. When an element does not occur or cannot be observed, the
  corresponding group and preceding space are omitted from that particular report. Briefly
  explain in column 90 (Remarks, Notes, and Miscellaneous Phenomena) the reasons for
  missing data. This does not apply to elements that can be obtained by estimation or alternate
  methods of determination (e.g., sky condition, visibility, present weather, wind, pressure).
  4.3.8. Late Observations. When a METAR is taken late, but within 15 minutes of the
  standard time of observation, and no appreciable changes (SPECI criteria) have occurred
  since the standard time, enter the observation in black and transmit as a METAR using the
  standard time of observation. If conditions have changed appreciably or the observation is
  more than 15 minutes late, skip a line, then record and transmit a SPECI. After transmitting
  the SPECI, return to the skipped line and, using the standard time of the missed observation,
  record an observation in RED using estimates of the conditions probable at the time of the
  missed observation, using data from recording instruments whenever possible. Enter ―FIBI‖
  (Contraction for Filed But Impractical to Transmit) in parentheses in Column 13. This
  observation will not be transmitted.
  4.3.9. Entering AF 3803 Synoptic Data and SOD data. The electronic AF 3803 has internal
  macros to calculate and populate the SOD data fields on the form. However, each of the
  SOD fields can also be edited by the weather technician, except for columns 68 and 69.
     4.3.9.1. Time UTC (Column 41). On the line captioned MID TO (at units taking
     midnight LST observations), enter the beginning time of the first 6-hourly scheduled after
     0000 LST. On the following four lines (captioned 1, 2, 3 and 4 in column 43), enter the
     beginning time of each 6-hourly observation. A time entry is not applicable to the MID
     line. Make all time entries in four figures to the nearest minute UTC. See Figure 4.1
 26                                                    AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


Figure 4.1. Example AF 3803 Synoptic and Summary of the Day Entries




      4.3.9.2. Time LST (Column 42). Enter the LST equivalent to the time UTC entered in
      column 41.
      4.3.9.3. Observation Number (Column 43). No entry required. This column provides a
      reference to the lines used for the midnight and 6-hourly observations. Entries in
      columns 41 through 45 are made on the first line of this column to record precipitation
      amounts for the period from midnight LST to the first 6-hourly observation of the day.
      Entries in columns 41 through 46 are made on the lines captioned 1, 2, 3 and 4 to record
      6-hourly precipitation amounts and snow depth data at the respective synoptic
      observation times of the day. Entries in columns 44 through 46 are made on the last line
      to record precipitation amounts for the period from the last 6-hourly observation to
      midnight LST. No entries are made on the lines captioned MID TO and MID in time
      zones where midnight LST corresponds to the time of a 6-hourly observation.
      4.3.9.4. Precipitation (Column 44). On the MID TO line (at units taking midnight LST
      observations), enter the amount of precipitation (water equivalent) that has occurred
      between the midnight LST observation and the first 6-hourly observation time. At 6-
      hourly observation times, on the applicable lines 1, 2, 3 and 4, enter the amount of
      precipitation occurring in the 6 hours before the respective 6-hourly observation. On the
      MID line (at units taking midnight LST observations), enter the amount of precipitation
      that has occurred between the last 6-hourly observation and the midnight LST
      observation. Enter 0 if no precipitation occurred in the period; enter a T for a trace
      (amounts of less than 0.005-inch). If no precipitation has occurred before actual
      precipitation observation time, but is observed to occur before coding of the observation,
      enter T even though a measurable amount may have occurred. Enter measurable amounts
      to the nearest 0.01inch.
         4.3.9.4.1. Water Equivalent. Whenever the water equivalent of frozen precipitation
         cannot be measured (e.g., by melting a core sampling), enter the estimated water
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   27


        equivalent on the basis of a 1:10 ratio, or other ratio where there is evidence that a
        different ratio is more appropriate for the individual storm or location. Prefix
        estimated values (except 0 or T) with the symbol E, and enter a remark in column 90
        to indicate the ratio used (e.g., E - 1:15 RATIO USED).
        4.3.9.4.2. Limited-Duty Units.       Use the following procedures for the first
        precipitation observations at limited-duty units (those operating less than 24 hours per
        day) where one or more 6-hourly observations are not made.
            4.3.9.4.2.1. Determine and enter the total accumulation of precipitation since the
            last recorded 6-hourly observation. Except as specified below, make this entry at
            the time of the current 6-hourly observation.
            4.3.9.4.2.2. At units opening between 1200 and 1400 UTC, determine this
            precipitation data at the time of the first METAR of the day and enter it on the
            line corresponding to the 1200Z 6-hourly observation.
            4.3.9.4.2.3. Prefix the entry (other than 0) with an asterisk, and enter a remark in
            column 90 to indicate the actual time period applicable to the amount (e.g., *.11
            in column 44 and *12-HR PCPN in column 90). At units that do not operate on
            weekends or holidays, the column 90 remark might be *72-HR PCPN.
     4.3.9.5. Snowfall (Column 45). On the MID TO line (at units taking midnight
     observations), enter the amount of solid precipitation that has occurred between the
     midnight observation and the first 6-hourly observation time. At 6-hourly observation
     times, on the applicable lines 1, 2, 3 and 4, enter the amount of the frozen precipitation
     occurring in the 6 hours before the respective 6-hourly observations. On the MID lines
     (at units taking midnight LST observations), enter the amount of precipitation that has
     occurred between the last 6-hourly observation and the midnight LST observation.
        4.3.9.5.1. Frozen Precipitation. Enter 0 if no frozen precipitation fell in the period.
        Enter T for a trace (less than 0.05 inch), and if precipitation melted as it fell, enter a
        remark in column 90 (e.g., T--MELTED AS IT FELL). If no frozen precipitation has
        occurred before actual precipitation observation time but is observed to occur before
        coding of the observation, enter T even though a measurable amount may have
        occurred.
            4.3.9.5.1.1. For a measurable amount, enter the maximum depth of frozen
            precipitation accumulated in the period to the nearest 0.1-inch. If several
            occurrences of frozen precipitation occurred in the period (e.g., snow showers)
            and each fall melted either completely or in part before the next fall occurred,
            enter the total of the maximum depths accumulated by each of the falls.
            4.3.9.5.1.2. Prefix estimated amounts (except 0 or T) with an E, and enter an
            appropriate remark in column 90 (e.g., E--ESTIMATED DUE TO MELTING).
            4.3.9.5.1.3. Enter an asterisk as a prefix to the amount if it consists entirely of
            hail; enter *HAIL in column 90.
        4.3.9.5.2. Limited-Duty Unit Procedures. Use the following procedures for the first
        precipitation observation at limited-duty units where one or more 6-hourly
        observations are not made.
28                                                    AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


            4.3.9.5.2.1. Determine and enter the total accumulation of frozen precipitation
            since the last recorded 6-hourly observation.
            4.3.9.5.2.2. At units opening between 1200 and 1400 UTC, determine this
            precipitation data at the time of the first METAR of the day and enter it on the
            line corresponding to the 1200Z 6-hourly observation.
            4.3.9.5.2.3. Prefix the entry (other than 0) with an asterisk and enter a remark in
            column 90 to indicate the actual time period applicable to the amount (e.g., *.1 in
            column 45 and *12-HR PCPN in column 90). At units that do not operate on
            weekends, the column 90 remark might be *72-HR PCPN.
     4.3.9.6. Snow Depth (Column 46). Enter the depth of frozen precipitation and ice on the
     ground at the time of each 6-hourly observation on the lines captioned 1, 2, 3 and 4 and at
     the time of the midnight LST observation, if applicable, on the line captioned MID.
     Enter 0 if there is no frozen precipitation or ice on the ground in exposed areas (snow
     may be present in forested or otherwise protected areas). Enter T for a trace (less than
     0.5-inch) on the ground in representative areas. If no solid precipitation or ice is on the
     ground at the actual precipitation observation time but is observed to occur before coding
     of the observation, enter T even though a measurable amount may have occurred. Enter
     measurable depths to the nearest whole inch.
        4.3.9.6.1. Melted Snow Reporting Procedure. If snow melted during the period,
        prefix the current depth with an asterisk. Enter the maximum depth and the
        approximate time UTC of occurrence in column 90 (e.g., MAX SNOW DEPTH 1 AT
        1530).
        4.3.9.6.2. Hail Reporting Procedure. Prefix the depth with an asterisk if it consists
        entirely of hail and enter *HAIL in column 90.
        4.3.9.6.3. Limited-Duty Unit Procedures. Use the following procedures for the first
        precipitation observation at limited-duty units where one or more 6-hourly
        observations are not made.
            4.3.9.6.3.1. Determine and enter the total depth of frozen precipitation on the
            ground at the time of the first 6-hourly observation.
            4.3.9.6.3.2. At units opening between 1200 and 1400 UTC, determine this data at
            the time of the first METAR of the day and enter it on the line corresponding to
            the 1200Z 6-hourly observation. This depth is also entered in column 70 and
            requires a remark to indicate the time applicable to the amount.
     4.3.9.7. 24-Hour Precipitation (Column 68). Enter the total precipitation (water
     equivalent) for the 24 hours ending at midnight LST. The entry is normally based on a
     summation of entries in column 44. However, where midnight LST observations are
     taken, do not include the value of the first 6-hourly observation entered in column 44
     when adding column 44 amounts to determine the column 68 entry. Enter 0 if no
     precipitation occurred in the period. Enter T for a trace (less than 0.005 inch). The sum
     of all trace entries (from column 44) is a trace unless the unit is equipped with a
     recording or totaling gauge that indicates 0.005-inch or more. Prefix amounts (except 0
     or T) with an E when the total includes an estimated amount. At limited-duty units that
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      29


       do not take a midnight LST observation, make this entry using a summation of the
       column 44 entries even though the amounts are not limited to the LST day. Prefix
       amounts (except 0 or T) with an E.
       4.3.9.8. 24-Hour Snowfall (Column 69). Enter the total amount of frozen precipitation
       that has fallen in the 24 hours ending at midnight LST. The entry is normally based on a
       summation of entries in column 45. Where midnight LST observations are taken, do not
       include the value of the first 6-hourly observation entered in column 45. Enter 0 if no
       frozen precipitation fell during the period. Enter T for a trace (less than 0.05-inch); if the
       frozen precipitation melted as it fell, enter T--MELTED AS IT FELL in column 90. The
       sum of all trace entries is a trace unless the unit is equipped with a recording or totaling
       gauge that indicates 0.05-inch or more. For a measurable amount, enter the total amount
       that has fallen to the nearest 0.1-inch. The amount entered must be that which has
       accumulated in the past 24 hours adjusted for any melting or evaporation having taken
       place. Prefix the amount with an asterisk if it consists entirely of hail and enter *HAIL in
       column 90. Prefix an estimated amount with an E, and enter a remark in column 90 (e.g.,
       E—ESTIMATED DUE TO MELTING). At limited-duty units not taking a midnight
       LST observation, make this entry using a summation of the column 45 entries even
       though the amounts are not limited to the LST day. Prefix amounts (except 0 or T) with
       an E.
       4.3.9.9. Snow Depth (Column 70). Enter the depth of frozen precipitation and ice on the
       ground at 1200 UTC or as directed by MAJCOM or higher headquarters. The entry is
       basically the same as that in column 46 for the 1200Z observation. If personnel are not
       on duty at 1200 UTC, enter depth as measured as near to 1200 UTC as practical, and for
       a non-zero entry in Column 70, enter a remark in column 90 to indicate the time UTC
       (e.g., COL 70 ENTRY OBSVD AT 1120). Enter 0 if there is no frozen precipitation or
       ice on the ground in exposed areas (snow may be present in surrounding forested or
       otherwise protected areas). Enter T for a trace (less than 0.5 inch) on the ground in
       representative areas. Enter a measurable depth on the ground at the time of observation
       to the nearest whole inch. Prefix the amount with an asterisk if it consists entirely of hail
       and enter *HAIL in column 90.
4.4. Corrections. Disseminate a correction immediately after detecting an error in a transmitted
report. Do not send a correction long-line if superseded by a later report. All hand written
entries must be legible.
   4.4.1. Correct errors discovered before dissemination (all columns, electronic or paper
   forms) by deleting or erasing, as applicable, the erroneous data from the form and entering
   the correct data in black (font or pencil). Erasing entries on the paper form is authorized only
   if the data has not been disseminated (either locally or long-line).
   4.4.2. Correct errors discovered after either local or long-line dissemination as follows:
       4.4.2.1. Form 3813. If an error is discovered after dissemination, but before another
       observation has been disseminated, select the observation type (SA-C, SP-C, or L-C) as
       applicable. Enter the original time of the observation to be corrected and re-enter the
       entire observation with the corrected data. Enter ―COR (time)‖ in remarks (Column 13)
       representing the time the correction is being disseminated (refer to Attachment 3).
       Select the ―Submit Observation‖ button to disseminate the corrected observation locally
30                                                    AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     and long-line. The letters "COR" will appear in the new observation after the unit's
     ICAO. If an error is discovered after dissemination and after another observation has
     been disseminated, follow the same procedures above, except do not enter ―COR (time)‖
     in remarks and select the ―Save to Form Only‖ button after entering the corrected
     observation. The observation will not be disseminated locally or long-line, but will be
     saved to the Form 3813.
     4.4.2.2. AF 3803 Electronic or Paper. Make corrections according to the following
     procedures. All corrected data and Column 13 & 90 remarks will be in RED FONT.
        4.4.2.2.1. Columns 1 through 13.
            4.4.2.2.1.1. Electronic 3803. Enter the correct data in the appropriate field. In
            column 13, annotate "COR FROM," followed by the appropriate identification,
            the ORIGINAL ENTRY, and the time of the correction. For example, if the
            original (incorrect) temperature entry was 20, and it was corrected to 21 at 1430,
            the column 13 remark would read COR FROM TEMP 20 @ 1430 (in red), and
            the temperature block would be 21 (in red). For corrections not transmitted
            locally or long-line, no time reference is required.
            4.4.2.2.1.2. Paper 3803. Make corrected entries in red pencil on the original.
            Enter corrections by drawing a line through the erroneous data and entering the
            correct data above it or on the next lower line. If space is insufficient, enter the
            correction in column 13 with an appropriate identification (e.g., TEMP 25). If the
            correction is disseminated locally, or locally and long-line, enter COR in column
            13 followed by the time (to the nearest minute UTC) the correction was locally
            disseminated. In the case of long-line-only dissemination (e.g., a correction for
            additive data), enter COR and the approximate UTC time the correction was

            then annotate the corrections. For errors in columns 15 through 21, annotate
            "COR FROM" in column 13 followed by the appropriate identification, the
            ORIGINAL ENTRY, and the time of the correction. For example, if the original
            (incorrect) station pressure entry was 29.370, and it was corrected to 29.375 at
            1530, the column 13 remark would read COR FROM STA PRES 29.370 @ 1530,
            and the station pressure block would be 29.375. For errors in columns 22 through
            90, annotate "COR FROM" in column 90, followed by the appropriate
            identification, the ORIGINAL ENTRY, and the time of the correction. For
            example, if the original (incorrect) snow depth entry was 40, and it was corrected
            to 42 at 1430, the column 90 remark would read COR FROM SNOW DEPTH 40
            @ 1430, and the snow depth block would be 42. For corrections not transmitted
            locally or long-line, no time reference is required.

4.5. Transfer and Disposition of Observation Records. ADS-equipped EUs, except ASOS
locations with AWIPS, will conduct quality assurance on the electronic Form 3813 and send the
form to the 14WS, usually at the beginning of the next duty day (not to exceed 7 days). E-mail
Form 3813s to ―observation_3813@afccc.af.mil.‖ EUs without an ADS should complete the
approved electronic worksheet version (Excel®) of Form 3803 (available:
https://notus2.afccc.af.mil/SCIS/form3803info.asp.) at the beginning of each month. E-mail
the previous month's zipped workbook as an attachment to 14WS at
observation_3803@afccc.af.mil. Note: E-mail addresses may change. EUs without the
capability to email the electronic 3803 forms (workbooks) will send either a CD containing the
workbook or the original hard-copy forms to:
14 WS/WXD
151 Patton Avenue, Room 120
Asheville, NC 28801-5002
   4.5.1. Weather technicians operating in deployed environments will coordinate with 14WS
   for timely transmission and receipt of their forms. At a minimum, every effort will be
   documented to reflect coordination (pre-operation, during or post) with the 14 WS to outline
   data collection efforts.
   4.5.2. Once official observation records are transmitted to 14WS for processing and
   archiving, maintain electronic or paper copies for 30-days. The USAF RDS on the AFRIMS
   webpage is the guidance for records management and disposition.
   4.5.3. EUs will ensure all paper forms sent to 14WS have no cuts, tears, stains, or staples.
   14WS digitizes the forms for permanent record.

                                             Chapter 5

                                               WIND

5.1. Introduction. This chapter prescribes the observing and reporting standards for wind data
in automated and augmented reports. Wind is measured in terms of velocity, a vector that
includes direction and speed. The direction and speed of the wind should be measured in an
unobstructed area. This will avoid, to a large degree, measuring wind directions and speeds that
have been disturbed by local obstructions and will result in a report more representative of the
general weather patterns.
5.2. Definitions.
      5.2.1. Wind. For surface observation purposes, wind is the horizontal motion of the air past
      a given point.
      5.2.2. Wind Direction. The direction from which the wind is blowing.
      5.2.3. Variable Wind Direction. Variable wind direction may be reported when the average
      wind speed is 6 knots or less in the preceding 2 minutes or when the wind direction varies by
      60 degrees or more with an average wind speed greater than 6 knots in the preceding 2
      minutes.
      5.2.4. Wind Shift. A term applied to a change in wind direction by 45 degrees or more in
      less than 15 minutes with sustained winds of 10 knots or more throughout the wind shift.
      5.2.5. Wind Speed. The rate of movement of air past a given point. Refer to Table 5.4 to
      convert miles per hour to knots and Table 5.5 to convert knots to miles per hour.
      5.2.6. Calm Wind. The term used to describe the absence of any apparent motion of the air.
      5.2.7. Gust. Maximum wind speed observed during the 10-minute observation period
      indicated by rapid fluctuations in wind speed with a variation of 10 knots or more between
      peaks and lulls.
      5.2.8. Peak Wind Speed. The highest (maximum) wind speed observed or recorded.
5.3. Wind Algorithms for AMOSs. The AMOS wind algorithm uses 5-second average wind
directions and speeds to compute 2-minute averages for reporting direction and speed. The 5-
second average speed represents an instantaneous wind and is used to determine gusts, squalls
and peak wind data. The 2-minute average direction is used to determine wind shifts and the
range of variability for variable wind direction reports. The wind direction and speed sensors
provide the system processor with sufficient data to compute 5-second and 2-minute average
wind speeds and directions.
5.4. Determining Standards. Table 5.1 may be used for quick reference of wind elements, but
the instructions below should be read to fully understand the wind determining standards.
Report and encode wind conditions IAW Chapter 13. AMOS sensors determine the wind
direction, speed, character, wind shifts and peak wind at all automated observing locations.
      5.4.1. Wind Direction. Direction is measured in tens of degrees with reference to true north.
      The wind direction is determined by averaging the direction over a 2-minute period. Note:
      OCONUS EUs at locations where the host nation is responsible for the airfield observation
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 33


   will ensure DoD aircrews are aware of how winds are measured/reported by the local ATC
   agency (e.g., 2-minute or 10-minute averaged winds).
   5.4.2. Variable Wind Direction. If the range of variability in wind direction observed during
   the 2-minute period meets the definition specified in paragraph 5.2., the wind direction is
   considered variable and will be reported IAW Chapter 13.
   5.4.3. Wind Speed. Wind speed is measured in whole knots. The wind speed is determined
   by averaging the speed over a 2-minute period.
   5.4.4. Wind Character. The wind speed data for the most recent 10 minutes is examined to
   evaluate the occurrence of gusts.
   5.4.5. Peak Wind Speed. Peak wind data is determined by using the internal storage of wind
   data. The peak wind speed is the highest instantaneous wind speed measured since the last
   METAR observation. The peak wind data is reported in the remarks of a METAR whenever
   the peak wind speed exceeds 25 knots. The format for the remark is in Attachment 3.
   5.4.6. Wind Shifts. If conditions meeting the definition of a wind shift specified in
   paragraph 5.2. are met, a wind shift has occurred and will be reported IAW Chapter 13.
   Wind shifts are often associated with the following phenomena:
       5.4.6.1. Frontal passage. Winds shift in a clockwise manner in the Northern
       Hemisphere. Winds shift in a counterclockwise manner in the Southern Hemisphere.
       5.4.6.2. Rapid drop or rise in temperature and/or dew point.
       5.4.6.3. Rapid rise or drop in pressure.
       5.4.6.4. Thunderstorm activity with lightning and hail, rainshowers or snowshowers.

Table 5.1. Summary of Wind Observing Standards.

Data              Wind Observing Standards

Wind Direction    2-minute average in 10-degree increments with respect to true north.
Wind Speed        2-minute average in knots.
Wind Gust         The maximum instantaneous speed in knots in the past 10 minutes.
Peak Wind         The maximum instantaneous speed in knots (since the last METAR) reported
                  whenever the peak is greater than 25 knots.
Wind Shift        A change in wind direction by 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes with
                  sustained winds of 10 knots or greater throughout the shift.
5.5. Manual Observing Methods.
   5.5.1. Determine wind direction, speed, character, wind shifts and peak wind at the
   touchdown area of the active runway. During an outage of the primary (in-use) sensor,
   determine data using other reliable sources. Data obtained from alternate equipment may be
   used as a guide for determining winds when the primary sensor output is considered
   unrepresentative.

      5.5.2. Wind Direction.
         5.5.2.1. Values from digital wind instruments are in reference to magnetic North and
         may be reported locally. These values must be converted to true for observational
         records and longline dissemination. Locations in extreme northern latitudes, such as
         Thule AB, Greenland, may report true wind direction locally when runway heading have
         been changed to reflect true.
         5.5.2.2. Where instruments are inoperative or not available, determine the magnetic wind
         direction by using a compass and observing the wind cone, tree movement of twigs or
         leaves, smoke, etc., or by facing into the wind in an unsheltered area. When determining
         wind direction, note that even small obstacles may cause variations in the wind direction.
         Do not use the movement of clouds, regardless of how low they are, in determining the
         surface wind direction. Convert the wind direction from magnetic to true before
         transmitting longline. Add WND DATA ESTMD column remark in column 13.
      5.5.3. Wind Speed. If an instrument value is not available, use the Beaufort scale (see Table
      5.2) as a guide in determining the wind speed. Add WND DATA ESTMD remark in column
      13.

   missing data. If you believe the peak wind data occurred during a time that no wind record
   was available, consider the data missing.
       5.5.4.1. If the wind direction record is incomplete, estimate the direction (e.g., from past
       directions or from surrounding stations, if representative) to the nearest 10 degrees for
       remarks on peak wind speed and for peak wind of the day. If the outage period is so
       extensive a peak gust direction cannot be reasonably estimated, or if no wind record is
       available, consider the data missing.
       5.5.4.2. EUs with multiple sensor locations use the last highest speed observed for the
       appropriate period, regardless of the active runway at the time of occurrence.

                                              Chapter 6

                                             VISIBILITY

6.1. Introduction. This chapter prescribes the observing and reporting standards for visibility
data in automated and augmented reports. Visibility is a measure of the opacity of the
atmosphere and is expressed in terms of the horizontal distance at which a person is able to see
and identify specified objects. Visibility values are generally reported in statute miles at U.S.
locations (including Hawaii, Alaska and Guam) and the unit of measurement will be the same as
that published for the installation in DoD FLIP airfield approach plate minimums.
6.2. Definitions. Note: The following definitions are for manual observation methods, to
include augmented observations. AMOSs calculate visibility values differently. See Chapter
13 for more information on automated visibility reporting.
      6.2.1. Visibility. The greatest horizontal distance at which selected objects can be seen and
      identified.
      6.2.2. Prevailing Visibility. The visibility considered to be representative of the visibility
      conditions at the official observing point. It is the greatest visibility equaled or exceeded
      throughout at least half the horizon circle, not necessarily continuous (e.g., it may be
      composed of sectors distributed anywhere around the horizon circle).
      6.2.3. Variable Prevailing Visibility. A condition where the prevailing visibility is less than
      3 statute miles (4800 meters) and is rapidly increasing and/or decreasing by 1/2 mile (0800
      meters) or more during the period of observation.
      6.2.4. Sector Visibility. The visibility in a specified direction that represents at least a 45 -
      degree arc (portion) of the horizon circle.
      6.2.5. Surface Visibility. The prevailing visibility determined from the designated point(s)
      of observation. It normally represents a value observed at a height of 6 feet (1.8 meters)
      above ground level.
      6.2.6. Tower Visibility. The prevailing visibility determined from the control tower.
      6.2.7. Visibility Markers. Dark or nearly dark objects viewed against the horizon sky during
      the day or unfocused lights of moderate intensity (about 25 candelas) during the night.
6.3. Visibility Algorithms for AMOS. The AMOS calculates average visibility using spatial
time averaging of sensor data. Visibility is an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 10-
minute period ending at the actual time of the observation. The visibility data during the
averaging period are examined to determine if variable visibility should be reported. Where the
AMOS has meteorological discontinuity sensors, the data from the additional sensors are
examined to determine if their values meet criteria for generating a visibility remark.
6.4. Determining Standards.
      6.4.1. Reportable Visibility Values. The reportable visibility values in statute miles and
      meters are provided in Table 6.1. If the visibility falls halfway between two reportable
      values, the lower value will be reported.
 AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    37


    6.4.2. Surface Visibility. Surface visibility is an evaluation of the prevailing visibility
    gathered during the 10-minute period ending at the actual time of the observation.
    6.4.3. Variable Prevailing Visibility. When variable prevailing visibility conditions occur,
    meeting the definition in paragraph 6.2., variable visibility will be reported in the remarks
    IAW Attachment 3.
    6.4.4. Visibility at Second Location. At observing locations equipped with two or more
    visibility sensors, the visibility at the designated discontinuity sensor will be encoded in
    remarks when the visibility at the second location is lower than the visibility in the body of
    the observation by a reportable value. The format for the remark is given in Attachment 3.
    6.4.5. Visibility Sensor Range. Visibility sensors evaluate visibility from less than one-
    quarter statute mile (M1/4, M0400 meters) to 10 statute miles (9999 meters).

 6.5. Manual Observing Methods.
    6.5.1. Visibility may be manually determined at the surface, the tower level or both. If
    visibility observations are made from just one level (e.g., the air traffic control tower), that
    level will be considered the "designated point of observation" and that visibility will be
    reported as surface visibility. If visibility observations are made from both levels, the
    visibility at the tower level may be reported as tower visibility.
    6.5.2. Surface Visibility Observations.     Determine and report surface visibility data as
    follows:
        6.5.2.1. Point of Observation. The surface observation point should be as free from man-
        made obstructions as possible to view the entire horizon. Where obstructions exist, move
        to as many locations around the observation point as necessary and practicable within the
        period of observation to view as much of the horizon as possible. In this respect, natural
        obstructions, such as trees, hills, etc., are not obstructions to the horizon but define the
        horizon.

         6.5.2.2. Prevailing Visibility. Evaluate visibility as frequently as practical. Using all
         available visibility markers, determine the greatest distances that can be seen in all
         directions around the horizon circle. Estimate the farthest distance that can be seen in
         each direction when the visibility is greater than the farthest marker(s). Base this
         estimate on the appearance of all visibility markers. If they are visible with sharp
         outlines and little blurring of color, the visibility is much greater than the distance to
         them. If a marker can barely be seen and identified, the visibility is about the same as the
         distance to the marker. The silhouette of mountains and hills against the sky and the
         brilliance of stars near the horizon may provide a useful guide to the general clarity of the
         atmosphere. Use the visibility values determined around the horizon circle as a basis for
         determining the prevailing visibility. Evaluate observed values using the following
         guidelines:
             6.5.2.2.1. Under uniform conditions, consider the prevailing visibility to be the same
             as that determined in any direction around the horizon circle.
             6.5.2.2.2. Under non-uniform conditions, use the values determined in the various
             sectors to determine the greatest distance seen throughout at least half the horizon
             circle (see example in Table 6.2).

Prevailing visibility is 2 1/2 (4000) because half Prevailing visibility is 3 (4800) because more
of the horizon circle is at least 2 1/2 (4000).    than half of the horizon circle is at least 3 (4800).
      6.5.3. Variable Prevailing Visibility. If the prevailing visibility rapidly increases and/or
      decreases by 1/2 mile (0800 meters) or more during the time of the observation and the
      average prevailing visibility is less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters), the visibility is
      considered variable and the minimum and maximum visibility values observed will be
      reported in remarks. The format for the remark is given in Attachment 3.
      6.5.4. Sector Visibility. When the visibility is not uniform in all directions, divide the
      horizon circle into arcs (sectors) that have uniform visibility and represent at least one eighth
      (1/8) of the horizon circle (45 degrees). The visibility that is evaluated in each sector is sector
      visibility. Sector visibility may be reported in remarks of weather observations when it
      differs from the prevailing visibility by one or more reportable value and either the prevailing
      or the sector visibility is less than 3 statute miles (4800 meters) or otherwise considered
      operationally significant. The format for the remark is given in Attachment 3.

                                   RUNWAY VISUAL RANGE

7.1. Introduction. This chapter contains information on Runway Visual Range (RVR) and the
standards and procedures for the observing and determining of RVR, if locally required. All
locations for which AF personnel record surface weather observations and have a requirement to
report RVR, will report RVR according to the information stated on the airfield approach plates
(e.g., statute miles/feet, meters/meters).
7.2. Definitions. The following are definitions used for determining runway visual range.
Runway Visual Range is an instrumentally derived value that represents the horizontal distance
that a pilot can see down the runway. The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or
landing at which the runway, or specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a
position above a specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye
level of pilots at touch-down.
7.3. RVR Algorithms for AMOS. Most fixed-base AMOSs in the Air Force inventory will
automatically sense and report RVR. Note: For OCONUS locations reporting RVR in meters,
AMOSs determine RVR in 50-meter increments up to 800 meters, and in 100-meter increments
up to 1500 meters, IAW WMO Manual on Codes (WMO-No. 306). This has a minor effect on
the RVR special requirements (e.g., 0750 vs. 0730 meters), and may have an effect on flying
units and the reporting of RVR minima listed in the FLIP for some overseas locations. EUs will
coordinate RVR reporting in meters with ATC and other supported agencies. EUs will
document local RVR reporting requirements in the base/host unit plans or a local weather
support agreement.
7.4. Determining Standards. RVR will be determined when prevailing visibility is 1 statute
mile (1600 meters) or less and/or RVR is 6000 feet (1500 meters) or less. The unit of
measurement will be the same as that published for the installation in DoD FLIPs—generally
feet in the CONUS and meters at OCONUS locations, unless otherwise determined locally.
When no RVR minima are published in the DoD FLIPs, report locally in meters if prevailing
visibility is locally disseminated in meters and in feet if prevailing visibility is reported locally in
statute miles.

                                            Chapter 8

                                     PRESENT WEATHER

8.1. Introduction. This chapter describes the standards and procedures for automated and
augmented observing, to include augmented observations, of present weather in METAR/SPECI
reports. Present weather includes precipitation, obscurations (obstructions to visibility) and other
weather phenomena, such as tornadic activity and sandstorms/dust storms. Present weather may
be evaluated with instruments, manual methods or with a combination of the two.
8.2. Definitions. The following are simple definitions for types of precipitation, obscurations,
and other weather phenomena. For more detailed definitions, refer to the Air Force Weather
Specialty Qualification Training Package on Observing, or other references such as the
American Meteorological Society Glossary of Meteorology or Meteorology Today. The
acronym used in parenthesis following each type of precipitation, obscuration, or other weather
phenomena denotes its standard notation in meteorological code. Reporting and encoding is
covered in detail in Chapter 13.
   8.2.1. Precipitation. Precipitation is any of the forms of water particles, whether in a liquid
   or solid state, that fall from the atmosphere and reach the ground. The various types are
   defined below:
       8.2.1.1. Drizzle (DZ). DZ is a fairly uniform type of precipitation that is composed of
       fine drops with diameters of less than 0.02-inch (0.5 mm) that are very close together.
       DZ appears to float while following air currents. Unlike fog droplets, DZ does fall to the
       ground.
       8.2.1.2. Rain (RA). RA comes in two forms. The first is in the form of drops larger than
       0.02-inch (0.5 mm). The second can have smaller drops, but unlike DZ, they are widely
       separated.
       8.2.1.3. Snow (SN). A solid form of precipitation which contains crystals, most of
       which are branched in the form of six-pointed stars.
       8.2.1.4. Snow Grains (SG). Precipitation of very small, white, opaque grains of ice.
       When the grains hit hard ground, they do not bounce or shatter. They usually fall in
       small quantities, mostly from stratus type clouds and never as showers.
       8.2.1.5. Ice Crystals (IC) (Diamond Dust). Precipitation that falls as unbranched ice
       crystals in the form of needles, columns or plates.
       8.2.1.6. Ice Pellets (PL). PL are transparent or translucent pellets of ice, which are round
       or irregular, rarely conical and which have a diameter of 0.2 inch/5 mm or less. PL
       usually rebound when striking hard ground and makes a sound on impact. There are two
       main types. One type is composed of hard grains of ice consisting of frozen raindrops, or
       largely melted and refrozen snowflakes (formerly sleet). This type falls as continuous or
       intermittent precipitation. The second type consists of snow pellets encased in a thin
       layer of ice which has formed from the freezing, either of droplets intercepted by PL, or
       of water resulting from the partial melting of PL. This type falls as showers.

        8.2.1.7. Hail (GR). Small balls or other pieces of ice falling separately or frozen together
        in irregular lumps exceeding 1/4 inch (5 mm) in diameter.
        8.2.1.8. Small Hail and/or Snow Pellets (GS). GS are defined as white, opaque grains of
        ice. GS are round or sometimes conical with diameters less than 1/4 inch (5 mm). GS
        are brittle and easily crushed. When they fall on hard ground, they bounce and often
        break up.
        8.2.1.9. Unknown Precipitation (UP). Precipitation that is reported when an AMOS
        precipitation discriminator detects, but cannot recognize, the type of precipitation.
     8.2.2. Obscurations. Obscurations or obstructions to visibility can be any phenomenon in
     the atmosphere (not including precipitation) that reduces horizontal visibility to less than 7
     statute miles (9999 meters). The various kinds are listed below:
        8.2.2.1. Mist (BR) and Fog (FG). A visible aggregate of minute water particles
        suspended in the atmosphere. BR reduces visibility to less than 7 statute miles (9999
        meters) but greater than or equal to 5/8 statute miles (1000 meters), while FG reduces
        visibility to less than 5/8 statute miles (1000 meters). It does not fall to the ground like
        DZ.
        8.2.2.2. Smoke (FU). Small particles produced by combustion that are suspended in the
        air. A transition to haze may occur when smoke particles have traveled great distances
        (25 to 100 statute miles or more), and when the larger particles have settled out and the
        remaining particles have become widely scattered through the atmosphere.
        8.2.2.3. Volcanic Ash (VA). Fine particles of rock powder that have erupted from a
        volcano and remain suspended in the atmosphere for long periods of time.
        8.2.2.4. Widespread Dust (DU). Fine particles of earth or other matter raised or
        suspended in the air by the wind that may have occurred at or away from the unit.
        8.2.2.5. Sand (SA). Particles of SA raised to a sufficient height that reduces visibility.
        8.2.2.6. Haze (HZ). A suspension in the air of extremely small, dry particles invisible to
        the naked eye and sufficiently numerous to give it an opalescent appearance.
        8.2.2.7. Spray (PY). An ensemble of water droplets torn by the wind from the surface of
        a large body of water, generally from the crest of waves, and carried a short distance into
        the air.
     8.2.3. Other Weather Phenomena.
        8.2.3.1. Well-Developed Dust/Sand Whirl (PO) (commonly referred to as Dust Devils).
        An ensemble of particles of dust or sand, sometimes accompanied by small pieces of
        litter, that is raised from the ground and takes the form of a whirling column with varying
        height, small diameter and an approximate vertical axis.
        8.2.3.2. Squall (SQ). A strong wind characterized by a sudden onset in which the wind
        speed increases by at least 16 knots and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least 1
        minute.
        8.2.3.3. Tornadic Activity.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     43


         8.2.3.3.1. Tornado. A violent, rotating column of air touching the ground. It forms a
         pendant, usually from a cumulonimbus cloud, nearly always starts as a funnel cloud
         and is accompanied by a loud roaring noise.
         8.2.3.3.2. Funnel Cloud. A violent, rotating column of air that does not touch the
         surface. It is usually in the form of a pendant from a cumulonimbus cloud.
         8.2.3.3.3. Waterspout. A violent, rotating column of air that forms (or moves) over a
         body of water and touches the water’s surface.
     8.2.3.4. Sandstorm (SS). Particles of SA that are carried aloft by a strong wind. The SA
     particles are mostly confined to the lowest 10 feet, and rarely rise more than 50 feet
     above the ground.
     8.2.3.5. Duststorm (DS). A severe weather condition characterized by strong winds and
     DU-filled air over an extensive area.
  8.2.4. Qualifiers. Intensity. The intensity of weather phenomena is reported using symbols
  to denote light (-), moderate (no symbol) or heavy (+). Chapter 13 provides further
  guidance on which intensity qualifiers can be used with each weather phenomena.
  8.2.5. Proximity. Unless directed elsewhere in this document (e.g., reporting the location of
  thunderstorms and lightning), the proximity qualifier "vicinity" (VC) will be used to identify
  the location of weather relative to the official point of observation expressed in statute miles.
  The location of weather phenomena may be reported as "occurring at the station" if within 5
  statute miles of the point of observation; "in the vicinity of the station" if between 5 and 10
  statute miles of the point of observation; and "distant from the station" (DSNT) when beyond
  10 statute miles of the point of observation.
  8.2.6. Descriptors. These qualifiers further describe weather phenomena and can be used
  with certain types of precipitation and obscurations. The terms used are shallow, partial,
  patches, low drifting, blowing, shower(s), thunderstorm and freezing.
     8.2.6.1. Shallow (MI). The descriptor MI is only used to further describe fog that has
     little vertical extent (less than 6 feet).
     8.2.6.2. Partial (PR) and Patches (BC). The descriptors PR and BC is used to further
     describe fog that has little vertical extent (normally greater than or equal to 6 feet but less
     than 20 feet), and reduces horizontal visibility, but to a lesser extent vertically. The stars
     may often be seen by night and the sun by day. PR indicates a phenomenon that covers a
     substantial portion of the station while BC indicates a phenomenon that randomly covers
     portions of the station.
     8.2.6.3. Low Drifting (DR). A term used to further describe the weather phenomenon
     when dust, sand or snow is raised by the wind to less than 6 feet.
     8.2.6.4. Blowing (BL). A term used to further describe the weather phenomenon when
     dust, sand, snow and/or spray are raised by the wind to heights 6 feet or greater.
     8.2.6.5. Shower(s) (SH). Precipitation characterized by its sudden starting/stopping,
     rapid change in intensity and accompanied by rapid changes in the appearance of the sky.
     8.2.6.6. Thunderstorm (TS). A local storm produced by a cumulonimbus cloud that is
     accompanied by lightning and/or thunder. Note: Due to the various types of
 44                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


         thunderstorm/lightning sensors employed on AF AMOSs, thunderstorm/lightning
         detection and ranging capability differs from platform to platform (e.g., FMQ-19, TMQ-
         53, FMQ-22). Weather technicians should review the Lightning Detection Technique
         and Procedure available on the Air Force Weather Agency Confluence web site, as well
         as the technical order or operations manual of the AMOS used to gain situational
         awareness about the capabilities/limitations of these sensors and the need to supplement
         sensed data from stand-alone sensors with data from a networked lightning detection
         system and/or other reliable sources (when available).
         8.2.6.7. Freezing (FZ). FZ will be used to describe RA or DZ that falls in liquid form
         but freezes upon impact to form a coating of glaze ice upon the ground and on exposed
         objects.
         8.2.6.8. Freezing Fog (FZFG). When FG is present and the temperature is below 0
         degrees C, the descriptor FZ will be used to describe the phenomena. FZFG is a
         suspension of numerous minute ice crystals in the air or water droplets at temperatures
         below 0°C and visibility less than 5/8 statute miles, based at the earth's surface. A report
         of FZFG does not necessarily mean that ice is forming on surfaces.
8.3. Present Weather Alogorithms for AMOS. AMOSs report the type and intensity of
precipitation, times of beginning and ending of precipitation, precipitation accumulation and
obscurations. Table 8.1 indicates the types of weather and obscurations generally reported by
AMOSs.
8.4. Qualifiers. Intensity and Proximity Qualifier.
      8.4.1. Intensity. AMOSs will encode and report light (-), moderate (no symbol), and heavy
      (+) intensities with all reportable precipitation types except Unknown Precipitation, which is
      reported as UP.
      8.4.2. Proximity. Used only with thunderstorms (TS). With the lightning sensor enabled,
      AMOSs will report TS as "occurring at the station" if the lightning sensor detects cloud-to-
      ground strikes within 5 nautical miles of the point of observation, and "in the vicinity of the
      station" (VCTS) if between 5 and 10 nautical miles of the point of observation. Cloud to
      ground lightning strikes detected beyond 10 but less than 30 nautical miles are reported in
      remarks as LTG DSNT followed by the direction.

8.5. Determining Standards. Weather is reported in the body of the observation only when it
is detected at the station at the time the observation is prepared for dissemination.
    8.5.1. Obscurations. Obscurations are reported in the body of the observation only when
    they are occurring at the station at the time the observation and the surface visibility is less
    than 7 statute miles (9999 meters). Other data pertaining to weather and obscurations may be
    reported in remarks, (e.g., time of beginning/ending of weather). Note: Precipitation can
    also restrict visibility to less than 7 SM without an obscuration present.
    8.5.2. Precipitation Occurrence. Precipitation is considered to be occurring when it is
    accumulating at a rate of at least 0.01 inch/hour (liquid equivalent).
    8.5.3. The intensity of precipitation is identified as light, moderate, or heavy IAW one of the
    following:
           8.5.3.1. Intensity of Liquid and Freezing Precipitation. AMOSs determine intensity from
           particle size and fall velocity through the sensor field. Intensities derived are functionally
           equivalent to those obtained from the manual rate-of-fall method.
           8.5.3.2. Intensity of Snow. When SN is occurring alone, the intensity of SN is based on
           the reported surface visibilities listed in Table 8.2 If occurring with other precipitation or
           obscurations, the intensity assigned will be no greater than that determined using the
           visibility criteria if SN was occurring alone. With or without other obscuring
           phenomena, AMOSs will not report heavy snow (+SN) if the visibility is greater than 1/4
           mile, nor will it report moderate snow (SN) if the visibility is greater than 1/2 mile.

Table 8.2. Intensity of Snow or Drizzle Based on Visibility
      Intensity            Criteria
      Light                Visibility > 1/2 mile (800 meters).
      Moderate             Visibility > 1/4 mile (0400 meters) but < 1/2 mile (800 meters).
      Heavy                Visibility < 1/4 mile (0400 meters).
      8.5.4. Reporting Beginning and Ending Times of Precipitation. The time precipitation
      begins or ends is reported in remarks of all observations up to, and including, the next
      METAR. Times for separate periods of the same type of precipitation (e.g., RA, SN) are
      reported only if the intervening time of no precipitation exceeds 15 minutes. The format for
      the remark is given in Attachment 3.
      8.5.5. Other Weather Phenomena. Other weather phenomena meeting the definitions in
      paragraph 8.2 will be measured and reported when observed.
8.6. Manual Observing Methods.
      8.6.1. Intensity. Each intensity is defined with respect to the type of precipitation occurring.
      Use Table 8.4 to estimate the intensity of RA or FZRA. Use Table 8.3 to estimate the
      intensity of PL. Use Table 8.4 to estimate the intensity of RA or PL using rate of fall. Use
      Table 8.2 to estimate the intensity of SN, DZ or FZDZ based on visibility. Note: These
      intensities are based on visibility at the time of observation. When more than one form of
      precipitation is occurring at a time or precipitation is occurring with an obscuration, the
      intensities determined will be no greater than that which would be determined if any of the
      forms were occurring alone.

Table 8.3. Estimating Intensity of Ice Pellets
 Intensity        Criteria
 Light            Scattered pellets that do not completely cover an exposed surface regardless of
                  duration; visibility is not affected.
 Moderate         Slow accumulation on ground; visibility reduced by ice pellets to less than 7
                  statute miles (9999 meters).
 Heavy            Rapid accumulation on ground; visibility reduced by ice pellets to less than 3
                  statute miles (4800 meters).

Table 8.4. Intensity of Rain or Ice Pellets Based on Rate-of-Fall
 Intensity        Criteria
 Light            Up to 0.10-inches per hour; maximum 0.01-inch in 6 minutes.
 Moderate         0.11-inches to 0.30-inches per hour; more than 0.01-inch to 0.03-inches in 6
                  minutes.
 Heavy            More than 0.30-inches per hour; more than 0.03-inches in 6 minutes.
      8.6.2. Precipitation. Augmented stations will report all types of precipitation in the body of
      the report when they are observed.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                       47


   8.6.3. Augmented stations will report all other weather phenomena in the body of the report
   when it is observed. Tornadoes/Waterspouts/Funnel Clouds should only be reported when
   they are observed by a position-qualified weather technician.
   8.6.4. Thunderstorm. A thunderstorm with or without precipitation will be reported in the
   body or remarks of the observation when observed to begin, be in progress or to end.
   Remarks concerning the location, movement and direction (if known) of the storm may be
   added to the METAR/SPECI that reported the thunderstorm.
       8.6.4.1. For reporting purposes, a thunderstorm is considered to have begun and to be
       occurring "at the station" when (1) thunder is first heard when location is unknown, (2)
       when hail is falling or lightning is observed at or near the airfield and the local noise level
       is such that resulting thunder cannot be heard or (3) lightning detection equipment
       indicates lightning strikes within 5 nautical miles of the airfield.
       8.6.4.2. When thunder is heard and the location is known (e.g., determined by radar or
       lighting detector), VCTS may be reported if the location of the storm is determined to be
       between 5-10 nautical miles. If thunder is heard and the location is determined to be
       beyond 10-nautical miles, do not carry TS or VCTS in present weather, technicians may
       include TS comments in remarks (e.g., "TS 12SE MOV NE").
       8.6.4.3. A thunderstorm is considered to have ended 15 minutes after the last occurrence
       of any of the criteria in paragraph 8.6.4.1
   8.6.5. Beginning/Ending Times for Tornadic Activity, Thunderstorms and Hail. If the initial
   SPECI taken for the beginning and/or ending of tornadic activity, thunderstorm or hail was
   not transmitted longline, include the time of beginning (B) and/or ending (E) with the current
   (most recent) remark in the next SPECI or METAR observation transmitted longline.
8.7. Other Significant Weather Phenomena Reported. Weather technicans should be alert
for and may report weather phenomena that are visible from but not occurring at the observing
location. Examples are fog banks, localized rain and snow blowing over runways.

                                         SKY CONDITION

9.1. Introduction. This chapter describes the standards and procedures for automated and
manually reporting of sky condition in METAR/SPECI reports.
9.2. Definitions. The following are simple definitions related to sky condition:
      9.2.1. Sky Condition. A description of the sky as seen from the surface of the earth.
      9.2.2. Horizon. For aviation observation purposes, the actual lower boundary (local horizon)
      of the observed sky or the upper outline of terrestrial objects, including nearby natural
      obstructions such as trees and hills. It is the distant line along which the earth (land and or
      water surface) and the sky appear to meet. The local horizon is based on the best practical
      points of observation, near the earth’s surface, which have been selected to minimize
      obstruction by nearby buildings, towers, etc.
      9.2.3. Celestial Dome. That portion of the sky, which would be visible, provided there was
      an unobstructed view (due to the absence of buildings, hydrometeors, lithometeors, etc.) of
      the horizon in all directions from the observation site.
      9.2.4. Cloud. A visible accumulation of minute water droplets or ice particles in the
      atmosphere above the earth’s surface. Clouds differ from ground fog, fog, or ice fog only in
      that the latter are, by definition, in contact with the earth’s surface.
      9.2.5. Layer. Clouds or obscuring phenomena (not necessarily all of the same type) with
      bases at approximately the same level. It may be either continuous or composed of detached
      elements. A trace of cloud or obscuration aloft is always considered as a layer. However, a
      surface-based obscuring phenomenon is classified as a layer only when it hides 1/8th or more
      of the sky. If present, a partly obscured condition is always considered to be the lowest layer.
      9.2.6. Layer Height. The height of the bases of each reported layer of clouds and/or
      obscurations. It can also be the vertical visibility into an indefinite ceiling.
      9.2.7. Interconnected Cloud Layers. The condition in which cumuliform clouds develop
      below other clouds and reach or penetrate them. Also, by horizontal extension, swelling
      cumulus or cumulonimbus may form stratocumulus, altocumulus or dense cirrus.
      9.2.8. Summation Principle. The basis on which sky cover classifications are made. This
      principle states that the sky cover at any level is equal to the summation of the sky cover of
      the lowest layer plus the additional sky cover present at all successively higher layers up to
      and including the layer being considered. No layer can be assigned a sky cover less than a
      lower layer and no sky cover can be greater than 8/8ths. This concept applies to evaluating
      total sky cover as well as determining ceiling layer.
      9.2.9. Ceiling. The lowest layer aloft reported as broken or overcast or the vertical visibility
      into an indefinite ceiling. If the sky is totally obscured, the vertical visibility will be the
      ceiling.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 49


  9.2.10. Sky Cover. The amount of the sky hidden by clouds and/or obscuration phenomena.
  This includes cloud cover or obscuring phenomena which hides the sky, but through which
  the sun or moon (not stars) may be dimly visible. Sky Cover Amounts:
     9.2.10.1. Layer Sky Cover. The amount of sky cover at a given level, estimated to the
     nearest 1/8th.
     9.2.10.2. Total Sky Cover. The total amount of sky covered by all layers present. This
     amount cannot be greater than 8/8ths.
  9.2.11. Sky Cover Classifications. The terms used to reflect the degree of cloudiness in sky
  condition evaluations based on a summation of the amount cloud cover or obscuring
  phenomena at and below the level of a layer aloft. The basic classification terms are as
  follows:
     9.2.11.1. Clear. A term used to describe the absence of clouds or obscuring phenomena.
     Clear skies are encoded as CLR at automated and augmented locations.
     9.2.11.2. Few. A summation sky cover of a trace through 2/8ths. Note that a trace of
     cloud or obscuration aloft is considered as 1/8th when it is the lowest layer. Encoded as
     FEW.
     9.2.11.3. Scattered. A summation sky cover of 3/8ths through 4/8ths. Encoded as SCT.
     9.2.11.4. Broken. A summation sky cover of 5/8ths through less than 8/8ths. More than
     7/8ths but less than 8/8ths is considered as 7/8ths for reporting purposes. Encoded as
     BKN.
     9.2.11.5. Overcast. A summation sky cover of 8/8ths. Encoded as OVC.
     9.2.11.6. Totally Obscured. A condition in which surface-based obscuring phenomena
     (e.g., fog or snow) are hiding 8/8ths of the sky. The term indefinite ceiling may also be
     used in relation to this sky condition.
     9.2.11.7. Partly Obscured. A condition in which surface-based obscuring phenomena are
     hiding at least 1/8th, but less than 8/8ths, of the sky or higher layers.
  9.2.12. Surface. For layer height determinations, the term denotes the horizontal plane
  whose elevation above mean sea level equals the field elevation. At observing locations
  where the field elevation has not been established, the term refers to the ground elevation at
  the observation site.
  9.2.13. Variable Ceiling. A condition in which the height of the ceiling layer rapidly
  increases and decreases during the period of evaluation and the ceiling layer is below 3,000
  feet.
  9.2.14. Variable Sky Condition. A condition in which a layer height below 3,000 feet that
  varies between one or more reportable values (FEW, SCT, BKN, OVC) during the period of
  observation.
  9.2.15. Vertical Visibility. A term used to indicate the greatest distance that weather
  technicians can see vertically upward into an obscuring phenomena or the height
  corresponding to the upper limit of a laser beam ceilometer’s reading.
  50                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


 9.3. Sky Condition Algorithms for AMOS. An AMOS derives sky condition by detecting the
 frequency and height of clouds passing over the sensor (ceilometer) over a period of 30 minutes.
 The data from the sensor is processed into layers, amounts, heights and variability of clouds.
 AMOSs report sky condition from 100 feet up to a maximum of 25,000 feet with the exception
 of ASOS which will only report to 12,000. AMOSs do not report sky condition above the range
 of the sensor.
 9.4. Determining Standards.
       9.4.1. Sky Cover. All sensor output of clouds or obscuring phenomena aloft is considered to
       be opaque sky cover.
       9.4.2. Height of Sky Cover. The laser-beam ceilometer is used to measure the height of
       layers aloft or the vertical visibility into obscuring phenomena.
       9.4.3. Non-Uniform Sky Condition. At AMOS locations that have multiple ceilometers, the
       data from the meteorological discontinuity sensors are examined and compared with the data
       from the primary sensor to determine if remarks are required to report non-uniform
       conditions. The format for the remark is given in Attachment 3.
       9.4.4. Layer Amounts. Layer amounts are measured according to the reportable values in
       Table 9.1

 Table 9.1. Reportable Values for Sky Cover Amount
Reportable Contraction             Meaning                  Summation Amount of Layer
VV                                 Vertical Visibility      8/8
CLR (see Note)                     Clear                    0
FEW                                Few                      Trace - 2/8
SCT                                Scattered                3/8 - 4/8
BKN                                Broken                   5/8 - 7/8
OVC                                Overcast                 8/8
NOTE: The abbreviation CLR is used at automated locations when no clouds at or below 12,000
feet are reported (or 25,000 feet with the 25K algorithm) and is used at augmented stations when no
layers are reported.
       9.4.5. Layer Heights. Heights of layers are measured in hundreds of feet above the ground,
       rounded to the nearest reportable increment. Cloud layers from the surface to 5,000 feet are
       measured to the nearest 100 feet, to the nearest 500 feet for layers from > 5,000 feet to
       10,000 feet, and to the nearest 1,000 feet for layers > 10,000 feet. When a value falls
       halfway between two reportable increments, the lower value is reported.
       9.4.6. Variable Ceiling. A ceiling is considered variable when it meets the criteria in Table
       9.2. When a variable ceiling, as defined in paragraph 9.2., is detected, it will be reported in
       the remarks IAW Attachment 3.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 51


Table 9.2. Criteria for Variable Ceiling

              Ceiling (feet)                   Variation Amount (feet)

              < 1,000                          200
              > 1,000 and 2,000             400
              > 2,000 and < 3,000              500
   9.4.7. Sky cover and ceiling heights from local PIREPS should be used to maintain
   situational awareness and to compare against the local AMOS or other digital
   instrumentation. Convert cloud bases reported in PIREPs above mean sea level (MSL) to
   above ground level (AGL) before comparing to the local data. Reevaluate sky cover and
   ceiling heights upon receipt of local pilot reports indicating an operationally significant
   deviation from the current observation.
9.5. Manual Observing Methods. The WMO International Cloud Atlas, Volume II, and Cloud
Types for Observers (available from 14WS) contain detailed guidance and photographs for
identifying the various cloud forms.
9.6. Manual Observing Procedures. Sky condition will be evaluated in all METAR and
SPECI observations. Weather technicians will evaluate all clouds and obscurations that are
visible.
   9.6.1. Sky Cover Layers. All layers visible from the observing location should be
   considered in sky cover reports. A maximum of six layers will be reported in the observation
   consistent with the priority for reporting layers provided in Table 13.4. The report will be
   based on the eighths (or oktas) of sky covered by each layer in combination with any lower
   layers. The amount of sky cover for each layer will be the eighths of sky cover attributable
   to clouds or obscurations (e.g., smoke, haze, fog) in the layer being evaluated. Cloud layers
   composed of cumulonimbus or towering cumulus may be identified by appending the
   contractions CB and TCU, respectively to the sky condition. When CB or TCU is appended
   to the layer report accompanied by the remark (e.g., TCU NW or CB NW MOV E), it is
   implied that the CB or TCU is associated with the layer and within 10 statute miles. When
   CB or TCU is outside 10 statute miles, a DSNT remark may be used (e.g., TCU DSNT NW).
   In this case, CB or TCU would not be appended to the layer in the body of the METAR.
       9.6.1.1. Mentally divide the sky into halves or quarters and estimate the layer amount in
       eighths in each section. Add the total amount of eighths estimated from each quadrant to
       arrive at a celestial dome coverage estimate. The inverse of this procedure can be done
       by estimating the amount of clear sky. Subtract this amount from 8/8ths to obtain an
       estimate of layer coverage.
       9.6.1.2. To estimate the amount of an advancing (or receding) layer which extends to the
       horizon, determine the angular elevation above the horizon of the forward or rear edge of
       the layer as seen against the sky. Convert the angle to a sky cover amount using Table
       9.3 When the layer does not extend to the horizon, determine the angular elevation of the
       forward and rear edges and the eighths of sky cover corresponding to each elevation
       angle. The difference will equal the actual sky cover.

         9.6.1.3. To estimate the amount of a continuous layer surrounding the observing location
         and extending to the horizon, determine the angular elevation of the edge of the layer and
         convert it to a sky cover amount using Table 9.3 This method is most useful in
         determining the amount of sky hidden for a partly obscured condition.

      9.6.2. Evaluation of Interconnected Layers. Clouds formed by the horizontal extension of
      swelling cumulus or cumulonimbus, that are attached to a parent cloud, will be regarded as a
      separate layer only if their bases appear horizontal and at a different level from the parent
      cloud. Otherwise, the entire cloud system will be regarded as a single layer at a height
      corresponding to the base of the parent cloud.
      9.6.3. Cumuliform clouds tend to produce a packing effect. The packing effect occurs when
      the sides and tops of the clouds are visible, making clouds appear more numerous toward the
      horizon (see Figure 9.1 for an illustration of this effect). Estimate layers of sky cover based
      on the amount of sky actually covered (e.g., to include both the base and sides of the cloud or
      obscuration).
 AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                53

    9.6.4. Summation Layer Amount. The summation amount for any given layer is equal to the
    sum of the sky cover for the layer being evaluated plus the sky cover of all lower layers
    including partial obscurations. Portions of layers aloft detected through lower layers aloft
    will not increase the summation amount of the higher layer. A summation amount for a layer
    cannot exceed 8/8ths. See Table 9.4 for examples of sky condition summation.

    9.6.5. Layer Height. A ceilometer will be used to measure the height of layers aloft. The
    height of a layer will be the average height of the cloud bases or obscurations for the
    evaluated layer. Additional ceiling height methods include:

      9.6.5.1. AN/TMQ-53, Tactical Meteorological Observing System, or other deployable
      meteorological equipment.
      9.6.5.2. Laser Range Finder. This device must be held as perpendicular to the ground as
      possible and used only to measure cloud bases directly overhead. If held at an angle, it
      will display cloud bases at a height greater than the actual height.
      9.6.5.3. PIREPs.

      9.6.5.6. Use of Convective Cloud-Base Height Table. Use Table 9.5. only to estimate
      the height of cumulus clouds formed in the vicinity of your observing location. It cannot
      be used at observing locations in mountainous or hilly terrain, or to determine the height
      of other than cumulus clouds. This diagram is most accurate when used to determine the
      height of cloud bases below 5,000 feet. Use the dry-bulb temperature and dew point to
      obtain the height of cloud bases above the point of observation.

     9.6.5.7. The apparent size of cloud elements, rolls or features visible in the layer. Large
     rolls or elements greater than 5 degrees wide (three fingers is about 5 degrees when at
     arm’s length) usually indicate the layer is relatively low. Small rolls or elements between
     1 and 5 degrees wide (the little finger is about 1 degree wide when at arm’s length)
     usually indicate the layer is relatively high.
     9.6.5.8. The reflection of city or other lights at night can be used. At night, lights may
     reflect off the base of a layer. This could help estimate the layer’s height. For example, a
     cloud layer over a city may be noticeably illuminated when the base is 5,000 feet or
     lower. However, a layer may be 1,000 feet or lower for any appreciable illumination
     from a small town.

                                              Chapter 10

                               TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT

10.1. Introduction. This chapter contains standards for measuring temperature and dew point
in observations. Defines maximum and minimum temperature and prescribes appropriate
observing standards. Dew point and relative humidity are calculated with respect to water at all
temperatures.
10.2. Definitions. The following are simple definitions used for determining temperature and
dew point:
      10.2.1. Air Temperature. A measure of the average kinetic energy of air molecules. It is
      commonly measured according to the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales.
      10.2.2. Dew Point. The temperature to which a given parcel of air must be cooled at
      constant pressure and constant water vapor content in order for saturation to occur.
      10.2.3. Dry-bulb Temperature. The dry-bulb temperature is the ambient temperature that is
      registered by the dry-bulb thermometer of a psychrometer. It is identical to standard air
      temperature and may also be used in that sense.
      10.2.4. Wet-bulb Temperature. The temperature an air parcel would have if cooled
      adiabatically to saturation at constant pressure by evaporation of water into it, all latent heat
      being supplied by the parcel. It differs from the dry-bulb temperature by an amount
      dependent on the moisture content of the air and, therefore, is generally the same as or lower
      than the dry-bulb temperature.
      10.2.5. Relative Humidity. The ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the actual vapor pressure
      of the air to the saturation vapor pressure.
      10.2.6. Wet-Bulb Depression. The mathematical difference between the dry- and wet-bulb
      temperatures.
10.3. Temperature/Dew Point Algorithms for AMOS. The AMOS measures temperature and
dew point in degrees Celsius. The maximum and minimum temperatures are based on the
highest and lowest average temperatures during the period of evaluation. Note: The AN/FMQ-
19 stops reporting dew point temperatures when the temperature is ≤ -34 degrees Celsius.
10.4. Determining Standards.
      10.4.1. Temperature and Dew Point. Temperature and dew point are determined using an
      AMOS or other digital instrumentation. If no digital method is available, use any backup
      means available.
      10.4.2. Maximum and Minimum Temperature. The maximum and minimum temperatures
      that occurred in the previous 6 hours are determined and reported to the nearest tenth of a
      degree Celsius for the 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC observations. The maximum and
      minimum temperatures for the previous 24 hours are determined and reported for the
      MIDNIGHT (0000 LST) observation. See Attachment 3 for coding of 6-hourly temperature
      data.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   57


   10.4.3. Units of Measure and Resolution for Temperature and Dew Point. Temperatures and
   dew point are measured in degrees Celsius, to the nearest whole degree in the body of the
   report and to the nearest tenth of a degree in the remarks section.
10.5. Manual Observing Methods. For aircraft operations, temperature data is required in
reference to the airfield runways. Normally, data measured at another location on the airfield are
sufficiently representative of the temperature over the runway.
   10.5.1. Observation Periods. Air and dew point temperatures are reported in each METAR,
   SPECI, and full element LOCAL observation. Maximum and minimum temperatures, where
   appropriate, are normally determined at 6-hourly synoptic times and midnight LST.
   10.5.2. Determination of Air and Dew point Temperatures. Obtain air and dew point
   temperatures by direct reading of the sensors from an AMOS or other digital sensor. If no
   digital method is available, use any backup means available.
   10.5.3. Maximum and Minimum Temperatures. The maximum and minimum temperatures
   are the highest and the lowest temperature values respectively for a particular day.
   Determine maximum and minimum temperature extremes of the day from digital readout or
   temperature recording equipment. If none are available, use the air temperature entries from
   column 7 of the AF 3803 (24-hour observing locations only).

                                              Chapter 11

                                             PRESSURE

11.1. Introduction. This chapter describes the standards and procedures for determining the
various forms of atmospheric pressure and contains instructions for making routine pressure
determinations and instrument comparisons. In this chapter, the term "barometric pressure"
refers to the actual pressure sensor value. Weather technicians will operate and use all pressure-
measuring instruments according to the appropriate T.O. and/or operating manuals. Do not use
any pressure-measuring instrument with known or suspected erroneous indications.
11.2. Definitions. Definitions of standard pressure parameters.
      11.2.1. Altimeter Setting (A). Altimeter setting defines the pressure value to which an
      aircraft altimeter scale is set so that the altimeter indicates the altitude above mean sea level
      of an aircraft on the ground at the location for which the value was determined. This value
      may be converted from inches of mercury to hPa using Table 11.7., rounding the value down
      to the nearest whole hPa. Note: Q is used at some overseas locations to identify altimeter.
      11.2.2. Atmospheric Pressure. The pressure exerted by the atmosphere at a given point.
      11.2.3. Barometric Pressure. The atmospheric pressure measured by a barometer.
      11.2.4. Density Altitude (DA). The pressure altitude corrected for virtual temperature
      deviations from the standard atmosphere.
      11.2.5. Field Elevation (Ha). The officially designated elevation of an airfield/site above
      mean sea level. It is the elevation of the highest point on any of the runways of the
      airfield/site.
      11.2.6. Station Elevation (Hp). The officially designated height above sea level to which
      station pressure pertains. It is generally the same as field elevation.
      11.2.7. Non-deployable Barometer. A barometer tasked for use as the primary pressure
      instrument at a permanent-type site and not intended for deployment.
      11.2.8. Pressure-Altitude (PA). The altitude, in the standard atmosphere, at which a given
      pressure will be observed. It is the indicated altitude of a pressure altimeter at an altitude
      setting of 29.92 inches (1013.2 hPa) of mercury and is therefore the indicated altitude above
      or below the 29.92 inches constant-pressure surface. Note: QNE is used at some overseas
      locations.
      11.2.9. Pressure Falling Rapidly (PRESFR). A fall in station pressure at the rate of 0.06 -
      inch Hg (2.0 hPa) or more per hour with a total fall of at least 0.02-inch Hg (0.7 hPa) at the
      time of an observation.
      11.2.10. Pressure Rising Rapidly (PRESRR). A rise in station pressure at the rate of 0.06-
      inch Hg (2.0 hPa) or more per hour with a total rise of at least 0.02-inch Hg (0.7 hPa) at the
      time of observation.
      11.2.11. Pressure Tendency. The pressure characteristic and amount of pressure change
      during a specified period, usually the 3-hour period preceding an observation.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  59


   11.2.12. Removal Correction. A value applied to a pressure reading to compensate for the
   difference in height between the elevation of the pressure instrument and station elevation.
   To find the removal correction (inches of mercury), multiply the difference in height in feet
   by 0.001 inch of mercury per foot. The correction in hectopascals is found by multiplying
   the difference in feet by 0.036 hectopascals per foot. The removal correction is added to the
   barometric pressure if the barometer is higher than the runway, and subtracted if the
   barometer is lower than the runway. Once determined, the same removal correction is
   always added to the indicated barometric pressure unless the barometer is moved.
   11.2.13. Sea Level Pressure (SLP). A pressure value obtained by the theoretical reduction of
   station pressure to sea level. Where the earth’s surface is above sea level, it is assumed the
   atmosphere extends to sea level below the observing location (station) and the properties of
   the hypothetical atmosphere are related to conditions observed at the unit. Note: QFF is
   used at some overseas locations.
   11.2.14. Standard Atmosphere. A hypothetical vertical distribution of the atmospheric
   temperature, pressure, and density, which by international agreement, is considered
   representative of the atmosphere for pressure altimeter calibrations and other purposes.
   11.2.15. Station Pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the location’s assigned station
   elevation. Upon request, convert station pressure from inches of mercury to hPa using Table
   11.7 and round the value down to the nearest whole hPa. Note: QFE is used at some
   overseas locations.
   11.2.16. Deployable Barometer. A pressure-measuring device (regardless of nomenclature)
   tasked for deployment (mobility), contingencies or exercises.
11.3. Pressure Algorithms for AMOS. The AMOS computes a pressure relative to the field
elevation and then based on that value; compute the pressure parameters (e.g., station pressure,
altimeter setting, and sea-level pressure). Computations are made each minute. In addition to
the pressure parameters, the AMOS also generates pressure change and pressure tendency
remarks for possible inclusion in the observations. AMOS pressure sensors are capable of
measuring pressure from 17.5 to 32.5 inches of mercury (600 to 1100hPa).
11.4. Units of Measure. In the United States and at military organizations overseas, data is
normally expressed with respect to inches of mercury for station pressure and altimeter setting,
and with respect to hectopascals (hPa) for sea-level pressure. The common international unit of
measure is hPa for all pressure data (one hPa = one millibar). When required for international
aviation purposes, provide pressure data in whole hPa (rounding down in disposing of tenths of
an hPa). However, until hectopascals are totally accepted in the verbal and written terminology,
the term millibar may be used interchangeably with hPa. Table 11.1 gives the units of measure
and the resolution for the pressure parameters.

11.5. Determining Standards. Altimeter setting is reported in the body of the observation.
Other pressure data such as pressure rising or falling rapidly, sea level pressure and pressure
tendency, when reported, are reported in remarks.
11.6. Priority of Instruments. Obtain pressure data for routine observations using an
instrument from the following priority list. The listing is based on instrument availability and the
assumption the respective instrument is properly calibrated.
      11.6.1. AN/FMQ-19, Automatic Meteorological Station.
      11.6.2. AN/FMQ-22, Fixed-Base System
      11.6.3. Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).
      11.6.4. AN/TMQ-53, Tactical Meteorological Observing System.
      11.6.5. Altimeter Setting Indicator (ASI).
      11.6.6. Aircraft altimeter.
      11.6.7. Hand-held pressure measuring device (e.g., Kestrel®).
      11.6.8. Any other AFWA or MAJCOM-approved device. Note: All permanent observing
      organizations providing direct observing support to flying operations will have a primary
      pressure measurement instrument (e.g., AN/FMQ-19, AN/TMQ-53, ASOS) and should have
      a back-up pressure measuring instrument.
11.7. Manual Observing Procedures. All atmospheric pressure measurements are made on the
basis of instrumental evaluation. They will vary according to local requirements and the type of
equipment used.
      11.7.1. Determination of Station Pressure. Determine station pressure as necessary for use
      in the surface observation and for computation of other pressure or pressure-related data.
      The following procedures summarize the common steps used to determine station pressure:
         11.7.1.1. Obtain a pressure reading from the appropriate instrument.
         11.7.1.2. Determine and apply appropriate corrections to the pressure reading (e.g.,
         algebraically add the posted correction to hand-held pressure measuring device).
         11.7.1.3. When necessary, convert the corrected pressure reading from hPa to inches of
         mercury.
      11.7.2. Determination of Altimeter Setting. Read directly from the pressure measuring
      device or compute an altimeter setting based on a current station pressure value using the
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  61


  method of determination applicable to the unit (e.g., pressure reduction computer, reduction
  constant or altimeter setting table).
     11.7.2.1. Determine altimeter settings as necessary for use in surface observations, upon
     request, and as otherwise necessary to meet local requirements (e.g., as determined
     through coordination with using agencies). Normally, compute values to the nearest
     0.01-inch Hg (e.g., unless required in hPa for international aviation purposes).
     11.7.2.2. During periods between record (hourly) observations, determine an altimeter
     setting at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes since the last determination (during AMOS
     back-up for pressure values). Report this value (e.g., as a single element LOCAL or in a
     METAR or SPECI taken within the established time interval) when there has been a
     change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last locally disseminated value.
     11.7.2.3. At augmented EUs, the following procedures may be used as an alternative to
     the requirement specified in paragraph 11.7.2.2 during periods with limited air traffic or
     when no ATC personnel are on duty. In such cases, a formal agreement must be
     established (and reconfirmed annually) with the airfield operations commander and local
     agencies concerned. The agreement must include the following requirements for
     updating altimeter settings during periods when this procedure is applicable:
         11.7.2.3.1. The ATC agency must ensure weather technicians are notified at least 30
         minutes before each aircraft arrival and departure.
         11.7.2.3.2. As soon as possible following each notification of aircraft arrival and
         departure, weather technicians will determine and report a current altimeter setting if
         the last locally disseminated value was determined more than 30 minutes before the
         time of notification.
         11.7.2.3.3. At locations where an operational ASI is installed in the control tower, the
         requirement in paragraph 11.7.2.2 may be considered not applicable provided the
         control tower is the only ATC agency requiring altimeter settings and ATC personnel
         routinely check the ASI for accuracy. A formal agreement must be established (and
         reconfirmed annually) with the airfield commander and the ATC commander or
         authorized representative to establish the conditions above and to reaffirm the
         exemption from the requirement in paragraph 11.7.2.2
  11.7.3. Pressure Tendency. Pressure tendency and amount of change (reported in the
  Additive Data 5appp group) are computed automatically by the ADS for every 3 -hour
  observation. To determine pressure tendency and amount of change manually, use the
  following procedures:
     11.7.3.1. Determine the pressure tendency character (the "a" in the 5appp group) from
     the 3-hour trend of the altimeter settings entered in column 12 of AF 3803. Using the
     code figures in Table 11.2, choose the figure which best describes the character of the
     change from the altimeter trend.

                              decreasing then decreasing more rapidly
       11.7.3.2. Determine the net change in station pressure (the "ppp" in the 5appp group) for
       the preceding 3 hours to the nearest 0.005-inch by subtracting the current station pressure
       from the station pressure from 3 hours ago recorded in column 17 of AF 3803. Disregard
       the +/- sign as it is not significant to determining net change. Use Table 11.3 to select
       the code figure that corresponds to the net change. Limited-duty EUs can access the
       ADS to obtain past pressure information, if available.
       11.7.3.3. Consider the 3-hour pressure tendency group (5appp) as indeterminable when
       any portion of the group is impossible to determine. Annotate the reason for not
       reporting the group in column 90.

NOTE: Code figures in this table are based on the conversion from inches of mercury to hectopascals
since station pressure is taken in inches of mercury. However, other code figures not listed (e.g., 016
for 1.6 hPa) are also used at locations where station pressure is determined in hectopascals.
64                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     11.7.4. Determination of Pressure Altitude and Density Altitude. Compute PA and DA
     based on a current station pressure value and the method of determination applicable to the
     EU (e.g., pressure reduction computer or table for PA, density altitude computer for DA).
     Determine and report data as necessary to meet locally established requirements, (e.g., in
     conjunction with each determination of altimeter setting). Compute data to at least the
     nearest 10 feet. The FMQ-19 and ADS compute density altitude using almost identical
     formulas, however, the ADS formula takes into account water vapor and the FMQ-19 does
     not. The differences between the calculations are between 5% and 12%, the ADS calculation
     being slightly more accurate due to the additional water vapor calculation. Currently,
     aircrews are instructed to use the ―dry‖ or FMQ-19 computation and then add the water
     vapor computation, if necessary. AFW organizations should provide the dry DA
     computation to supported organizations, unless specifically asked to provide a different
     computation. Advise ATC agencies that PA/DA values are estimated when backing-up of
     the AMOS pressure sensor.
     11.7.5. Determination of Sea-Level Pressure. Compute sea-level pressure (QFF) based on a
     current station pressure value and the method of determination applicable to the station
     (pressure reduction computer, reduction constant, or Sea Level Pressure table). Determine
     QFF values hourly, to the nearest 0.1 hPa. The QFF must be considered as estimated when
     the 12-hour mean temperature used in computations is based on an estimate of the air
     temperature 12 hours previously. Limited-duty EUs can access the ADS to obtain past
     temperature information, if available.
     11.7.6. Determination of Significant Pressure Changes. When pressure is falling or rising
     rapidly at the time of an observation, report the condition in the remarks of the observation.
     When the pressure is rising or falling at a rate of 0.06-inch Hg per hour or more, totaling a
     change 0.02-inch Hg or more at the time of observation, the remark PRESRR (pressure rising
     rapidly) or PRESFR (pressure falling rapidly) will be included in the observation. These
     conditions may be considered operationally significant and included with an altimeter setting
     LOCAL or other observation disseminated to ATC personnel.
     11.7.7. Estimated Pressure Values. Although all pressure data are instrumentally derived,
     values must be classified as estimated under certain conditions. The altimeter, station
     pressure, and all other pressure data will be classified as estimated as follows:
        11.7.7.1. Any correction factor is based on an approximation.
        11.7.7.2. A scheduled barometer comparison is delayed and the reliability of the
        previous correction is suspected to be in error by more than 0.020 inch Hg (0.70 hPa).
        This decision should be as objective as practical and based on such factors as past
        instrument performance, the length of the delay and the reason for the delay.
        11.7.7.3. Anytime pressure readings are suspect in the opinion of weather personnel.
        11.7.7.4. When deployable equipment is used as a back-up to the primary pressure
        measurement instrument. EUs may use the AN/TMQ-53 as back-up without estimating
        pressure values if the requirements in paragraph 3.5 – 3.5.3 are met. Pressure values
        from other deployable meteorological equipment, the sensors from the AN/FMQ-19
        discontinuity group (and midfield if available) or other MAJCOM-approved back-up
        equipment will be estimated.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   65


11.8. Standardization and Comparison Procedures. Each EU with an AN/TMQ-53 and/or
hand-held weather device (e.g., Kestrel®) must establish a barometry program. Instructions in
the following paragraphs are generally limited to those aspects of barometry required by weather
technician in making routine pressure measurements for aviation observations.
   11.8.1. Standardization of deployable digital barometers (e.g., AN/TMQ-53, Kestrel®).
   Deployable barometers will be qualified for operational use. At a minimum, compare digital
   barometers against a standard barometer annually. Complete a barometer comparison before
   deployment (when possible) and upon return from a deployment.

11.12. Equipment Operation and Instrument Evaluation.
   11.12.1. General. Operate and use all pressure-measuring instruments according to the
   appropriate TO and/or operating manuals.
   11.12.2. Aircraft Altimeter. In the event an aircraft altimeter is the only instrument
   available, it may be used in obtaining estimated pressure data for the surface observation.
   Set the altitude scale to indicate the actual elevation of the instrument and take readings to
   the nearest 0.01-inch Hg.
   11.12.3. Pressure Reduction Computer. The following procedures outline requirements in
   using the pressure reduction computer for computation of pressure data:
      11.12.3.1. Altimeter Setting. Step-by-step procedures are printed on side II of the
      reduction computer. Compute the altimeter setting using station pressure to the nearest
      0.005 inch Hg and station elevation to the nearest foot. If the station pressure is in
      hectopascals, the value can be readily converted to inches of mercury using the scale on
      side I of the computer. Table 11.5 provides examples of this process.

      instructions for determining pressure altitude as a function of station pressure. Use
      station pressure (to the nearest 0.005-inch Hg) and read the pressure altitude from the
      computer to at least the nearest 10 feet. Table 11.6 provides examples of this process.

                            PRECIPITATION MEASUREMENT

12.1. General Information. This chapter contains a description of the methods used to measure
precipitation amounts and snow depth.
12.2. Definitions.
   12.2.1. Water Equivalent. Term that refers to the liquid water equivalent of a solid form of
   precipitation that is melted.
   12.2.2. Solid Precipitation. Any precipitation that is freezing or frozen (e.g., SN, SG or
   FZRA).
12.3. Precipitation Algorithms for AMOS.
   12.3.1. Precipitation measurements from an AMOS are normally made by heated and non-
   heated (depending on the system) rain gauges and present weather sensors.
   12.3.2. AN/FMQ-19 and AN/TMQ-53 rain gauges have a 0.01‖ capacity before reporting
   precipitation amount.
   12.3.3. AMOS present weather sensors use infrared light to identify and measure
   precipitation based on characteristic interference signatures. In addition to using IR to
   identify and measure precipitation, the TMQ-53 also uses two capacitance sensors to increase
   sensitivity to very light precipitation (e.g., -DZ). On the TMQ-53, the sensor uses an
   algorithm to estimate snow depth based on particulate size and rate of fall and uses
   temperature ranges (using its internal temperature sensor) to assist with the snow depth
   calculations using different ratios (in essence, "wet/warmer temps", "medium/average" and
   "dry/cold").
12.4. Determining Standards. The measurement of precipitation is expressed in terms of
vertical depth of water (or water equivalent in the case of solid forms) that reaches the surface
during a specified period. In METAR observations, requirements for the measurement of
precipitation are established to include both liquid and frozen amounts that have fallen and the
total depth of solid forms on the ground at the time of observation. Note: The term solid is
sometimes used as a synonym for frozen forms of precipitation.
   12.4.1. Unit of Measurement. The basic unit of measurement is the inch. MAJCOMs or
   higher headquarters may require EUs to report in millimeters (mm) for liquid precipitation
   (or water equivalent) and centimeters (cm) for frozen precipitation and snow depth. Table
   12.1 provides guidance for converting new snowfall to water equivalent.
       12.4.1.1. Liquid precipitation (or water equivalent): To the nearest 0.01‖. Less than
       0.005‖ is termed a trace.
       12.4.1.2. Frozen/Freezing precipitation: To the nearest 0.1‖. Less than 0.05‖ is termed a
       trace.
       12.4.1.3. Snow depth (any solid form): To the nearest whole inch. Less than 0.5‖ is
       termed a trace.
70                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     12.4.2. Observation Periods. Precipitation and snow depth measurements are normally
     obtained at 3- and 6-hourly synoptic times and at midnight LST. Make measurements more
     frequently when necessary to meet local or other support requirements.
     12.4.3. Representative Area for Measurement of Solid Forms. In obtaining samples or
     measurements of snowfall and depth of snow on the ground, select an area that is smooth,
     level, preferably grass covered and as free from drifting as possible. Avoid using paved
     areas and low spots where water tends to collect. Select an area that permits measurements
     to be taken in undisturbed snow.
        12.4.3.1. As an aid in obtaining the measurement of new snowfall, place snowboards on
        top of the snow after each measurement. The next measurement can then be taken from
        the top of the snow to the snowboard.
        12.4.3.2. The snowboard can be a thin, light-colored wooden board or a thin light-
        colored, lightweight composite material board (composite material must be a poor
        conductor of heat). The snowboard must be at least 2’X 2’ (about 60 cm) square and
        should be at least 1/2‖ thick. Flag or mark snowboards in such a way that it is left
        undisturbed by non-weather personnel.
        12.4.3.3. In using the area, start measurements along the edge nearest the observation
        location to avoid unnecessary tracking of the snow. Unless the snow is very deep and
        drifting is pronounced, take a measurement 2’ (about 60 cm) from previous
        measurements.
        12.4.3.4. Irregularities (e.g., uneven terrain, drifting and footsteps before sampling) tend
        to introduce unavoidable errors in the measurements. Therefore, classify amounts as
        estimated if they are not considered representative.
     12.4.4. Measurement of Precipitation Amounts (water equivalent). Water equivalent is an
     expression used to reflect the amount of liquid produced by the melting of solid forms of
     precipitation. Obtain precipitation amounts (or water equivalent) using the following
     procedures:
        12.4.4.1. Under normal circumstances, obtain liquid precipitation amounts and the water
        equivalent of frozen/freezing precipitation using the collection in the rain gauge.
        12.4.4.2. If the rain gauge collection is not considered representative, disregard the catch
        and classify the amount of precipitation as undeterminable when it consists entirely of
        liquid types. If possible, obtain water equivalent by means of core sampling or
        estimation when precipitation during the period consisted entirely of solid forms.
        12.4.4.3. To estimate water equivalent of solid forms of precipitation, first obtain a
        measurement of the snowfall. Convert the actual depth to its water equivalent based on a
        1:10 ratio (or other ratio if known to be representative for the unit or the snowfall). For
        example, if 1.6 inches of snow has fallen, the water equivalent is approximately 0.16 inch
        (1.6 divided by 10 = 0.16) in using a 1:10 ratio. For 4 cm (40 mm) of snowfall, the water
        equivalent is approximately 4 mm in using a 1:10 ratio. Use Table 12.1 to help
        determine the water equivalent of new snowfall only. Packing and melting/freezing has a

  12.4.5. Measurement of Snowfall (Solid Precipitation). For the purpose of snowfall
  measurements, the term snow also includes other types of freezing and frozen precipitation
  that fell during the measurement period. Obtain snowfall amounts using the following
  procedures as a guide.
     12.4.5.1. Using a standard ruler (graduated in inches) or other suitable measuring device,
     measure the depth in several locations, preferably at points where the snow has fallen and
     is undisturbed by the wind. If practical, make these measurements using snowboards or a
     surface that has been cleared of previous snowfall. If the previous snowfall has crusted,
     the new fall may be measured by permitting the end of the ruler to rest on the crust.
         12.4.5.1.1. If a suitable spot is not available and snowboards are not in place, the
         snowfall amount may be obtained by measuring the total depth of snow and
         subtracting the depth previously measured. This will normally be estimated due to
         the effects of melting, sublimation, etc.
         12.4.5.1.2. When melting or settling occurred between measurements, estimate the
         depth of new snow that would have collected if the melting or settling had not
         occurred. For instance, if several snow showers occur between observations and each
         melts before the following one occurs, the total snowfall for the period will be the
         sum of the maximum depth (measured or estimated) for each occurrence.
     12.4.5.2. Obtain an average of the several measurements to the nearest 0.1‖. Consider
     the amount as estimated if there is any doubt as to its accuracy, (e.g., melting, drifting).
     12.4.5.3. When an accurate water equivalent of frozen precipitation has been obtained,
     the snowfall amount may be estimated based on a 1:10 ratio (or other ratio if known to be
     representative. For example, if the water equivalent of snowfall from the rain gauge is
     0.16 inch, the actual amount of snowfall is approximately 1.6 inches (0.16 times 10 =
     1.6) using a 1:10 ratio. If the water equivalent is 4 mm, the actual amount of snowfall is
     approximately 40 mm (or 4 cm) using the 1:10 ratio.
  12.4.6. Measurement of Total Snow Depth. For the purpose of snow depth measurements,
  the term snow also includes other types of frozen precipitation (e.g., ice pellets, hail) and
  sheet ice formed directly or indirectly from precipitation. Obtain total depth of snow in
  conjunction with snowfall measurements using the following procedures:
     12.4.6.1. Using a standard ruler or other suitable measuring device, measure the total
     depth in several locations, preferably at points where the snow is undisturbed by the
     wind.
         12.4.6.1.1. If the ground is covered with ice, cut through the ice with some suitable
         implement and measure its thickness. Add the thickness of the ice to the depth of
         snow above the ice.
         12.4.6.1.2. When the snow has drifted, include the greatest and least depths in
         measurements from the representative area. For example, if spots with no snow are
         visible, use zero as one of the values.
         12.4.6.1.3. Obtain an average of the several measurements, to the nearest whole inch.
     12.4.6.2. Estimates of total depth may be obtained using snow stakes at observing
     location where this method is considered necessary and practical. In such cases, place
   72                                                   AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


        several stakes in the most representative area available, (e.g., where the snow is least
        likely to be disturbed within a few feet (or meters) of the stakes). Obtain an average
        depth by reference to graduated markings on the stakes.

11. Reporting precipitation during periods of limited observations (e.g., weekends and holidays)
when the airfield is only open for a few hours and may not be open during a scheduled 6-hourly
observation.
a. If you are closed during a scheduled 6-hourly observation, but are open during a scheduled 3-
hourly observation, encode and report in column 13 of the AF 3803 in the 6RRRR group. Do
not dump the rain gauge when this occurs.
b. If you are open between 1200Z-1400Z (or MAJCOM approved 24-hour (7-group)
precipitation reporting time) for a scheduled 6-hourly observation, encode and report
precipitation appropriately (as stated above). Dump rain gauge at these times always.
12. The weather technician will only dump precipitation from the rain gauge when opening
between normal hours (1200Z-1400Z or MAJCOM approved 24-hour (7-group) precipitation
reporting time) and subsequent 6-hourly observations. No exceptions.
13. The opening weather technician will always report precipitation extending back to the last 6-
hourly observation, whether it was the day before or the entire weekend.
14. The closing weather technician will dump the rain gauge and report precipitation when
closing on a scheduled 6-hourly observation, but will never dump or encode/report when closing
on non 6-hourly observations (unless at midnight local).
12.5. Manual Observing Methods.
   12.5.1. General. Manual precipitation measurements are normally made by means of ML-17
   standard 8-inch rain and snow gauge. The ML-217 (a 4-inch plastic gauge) and automatic
   precipitation measuring devices also are used. For deployed location measurements, use the
   ML-217, or equivalent. Limited-duty locations will report precipitation according to Table
   12.2
   12.5.2. Installation of the Rain Gauge. Install the rain gauge in the open, away from such
   obstructions as buildings and trees. Low obstructions (e.g., bushes, walls or fences) are
   usually beneficial in breaking the force of the wind. However, place the gauge no closer to
   an obstruction than a distance equal to the height of the object. If the gauge is mounted on
   top of a building, place it in the center of the roof whenever practical. The gau ge must be
   made as level as is possible and installed securely so that it will not be blown over.
   12.5.3. Use of the Rain Gauge for Precipitation Measurements. Measure precipitation
   amounts collected in the rain gauge as necessary for observing and reporting requirements in
   Chapter 13, normally at 3- and 6-hourly synoptic times and at midnight LST. The gauge
   may be emptied more frequently if necessary for local purposes, provided a record of
   precipitation amounts is maintained for use in determining the total amounts for applicable 3-
   and 6-hourly and midnight LST observations. Obtain precipitation amounts by means of the
   rain gauge using the following procedures:
       12.5.3.1. Measurement of Liquid Precipitation. Determine the amount of liquid
       precipitation amounts by measuring the collection in the rain gauge using the ML-75
       measuring stick to the nearest 0.01‖. If only liquid precipitation has occurred during the
       period, the rain gauge will normally be emptied only after the 6-hourly measurement.
           12.5.3.1.1. For the ML-17, slowly insert the ML-75 measuring stick into the
           measuring tube. Permit the stick to rest on the bottom for 2 to 3 seconds, withdraw
           the stick, and read the depth as the upper limit of the wet portion.
76                                                    AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


        12.5.3.1.2. Whenever more than 2 inches of precipitation has fallen, the measuring
        tube will have overflowed, with the excess spilling into the overflow can. In such
        cases, obtain the total precipitation amount as follows:
            12.5.3.1.2.1. Carefully remove and empty the measuring tube (when brimful, the
            tube contains exactly 2 inches of liquid precipitation).
            12.5.3.1.2.2. Pour the liquid from the overflow container (if any) into the
            measuring tube and measure the amount as in paragraph 12.5.3.1.1
            12.5.3.1.2.3. If the measuring tube is filled one or more times, record 2 inches for
            each instance and continue to refill the tube until the last of the overflow has been
            measured.
            12.5.3.1.2.4. Obtain the total precipitation by adding the individual amounts
            measured from the overflow container and measuring tube.
            12.5.3.1.2.5. When measurements have been completed, empty the measuring
            tube (when appropriate) and reassemble the gauge.
     12.5.3.2. Measurement of Water Equivalent for Frozen/Freezing Precipitation. When
     frozen/freezing precipitation is expected, remove the funnel and measuring tube from the
     gauge and store them indoors. Determine the amount of precipitation for the observation
     period based on the collection in the overflow container.
        12.5.3.2.1. If the collection in the overflow container is considered representative,
        determine the water equivalent using the following procedure:
        12.5.3.2.2. Add a measured quantity of warm water to the overflow container in
        order to melt the contents.
        12.5.3.2.3. Pour the liquid into the measuring tube, obtain a measurement, and
        subtract an amount equal to that of the warm water added. The result is the actual
        precipitation amount measured to the nearest 0.01‖ (e.g., the water equivalent of the
        frozen/freezing precipitation).
        12.5.3.2.4. If the collection in the overflow can is considered unrepresentative (e.g.,
        due to strong winds), discard the catch and obtain a measurement by means of
        vertical core sampling or by estimation.
     12.5.3.3. Core Sampling for Water Equivalent of Frozen/Freezing Precipitation. When
     the collection in the rain gauge is considered unrepresentative, precipitation amounts may
     be determined by means of core sampling. A core sample is a section cut from the
     snow/ice cover at an observation location to determine the amount of water present in the
     solid state. Obtain the core sample in conjunction with snowfall and snow/ice depth
     measurements using the following procedures:
        12.5.3.3.1. Invert the overflow container over the top of the snow/ice pack and lower
        it to the snowboard or other reference point for the new snowfall. Use the snowboard
        or other object to collect the sample within the area of the container.
        12.5.3.3.2. Melt the collection to obtain the water content (as explained in
        paragraphs 12.5.3.2.2 and 12.5.3.2.3). Classify the amount as estimated if it is not
        considered representative of the actual snowfall.

           REPORTING AND ENCODING OF WEATHER OBSERVATIONS
13.1. Introduction. This chapter contains information on reporting and encoding weather
observations.
13.2. Weather Observation METAR/SPECI Code Form. The METAR/SPECI report has
two major sections: the Body (consisting of a maximum of 11 groups) and the Remarks
(consisting of a maximum of 2 categories). Figure 13.1 contains the METAR/SPECI code.
Table 13.1 contains the format and contents of the Body and Remarks section of a
METAR/SPECI observation. Together, the body and remarks make up the complete
METAR/SPECI coded report and are encoded in the order shown in Figure 13.1. The underline
character "_" indicates a required space between the groups. The actual content of the report
depends on the observation program at the individual observing organization.

Remarks Section of Report—RMK
(1) Automated, Manual and Plain Language
(2) Additive and Maintenance Data
13.3. Coding Missing Data in METAR and SPECI Reports. When an element does not
occur, or cannot be observed, the corresponding group and preceding space are omitted from that
particular report. When an AMOS cannot provide an element due to sensor failure, the software
will automatically place a missing data flag (M) in the corresponding data field. The system will
also include the maintenance indicator ($) at the end of the observation. Together, these two
characters will cue the weather technicians to contact ATC agencies and maintenance and back-
up the failed element.
13.4. Coding the Body of the METAR or SPECI Reports.
      13.4.1. Type of Report (METAR or SPECI). The type of report, METAR or SPECI, is
      included in all reports. The type of report is separated from subsequent elements by a space.
      When SPECI criteria are met at the time of a routine report (METAR), the type of report will
      be a METAR.
      13.4.2. Station Identifier (CCCC). The observing location identifier, CCCC, is included in
      all reports to identify the station generating the report. The observing location identifier
      consists of four alphanumeric characters if the METAR/SPECI is transmitted longline. The
      observing location identifier is separated from subsequent elements by a space. The agency
      with operational control when the location is first established is responsible for coordinating
      the location identifier with the FAA. A list of approved identifiers can be found in the FAA
      Manual 7350 Series, Location Identifiers. Temporary KQ-identifiers are coordinated with
      AFWA IAW AFMAN 15-128.
      13.4.3. Date and Time of Report (YYGGggZ). The date, YY, and time, GGgg, is included
      in all reports. The time is the actual time the report is transmitted longline or when the
      criteria for a SPECI is met or noted. If the report is a correction to a previously disseminated
      report, the time of the corrected report will be the same time used in the report being
      corrected. The date and time group always ends with a "Z", indicating the use of UTC. For
      example, METAR KGRF 210855Z would be the 0900 scheduled report from KGRF taken at
      0855 UTC on the 21st of the month.
      13.4.4. Report Modifier (AUTO or COR).           The report modifier can be either of the
      following two elements:
         13.4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or
         SPECI is transmitted.
         13.4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human
         intervention. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician
         signs off the ADS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
         13.4.4.3. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
         used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
         manually correcting the observation.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   79


13.5. Wind Group (dddff(f)Gfmf m(f m)KT_dndndnVdxdx dx). The standards and procedures for
observing wind are described in Chapter 5.
   13.5.1. Direction. The true direction (ddd) the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of
   degrees using three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." For
   example, a wind direction of 90 is encoded "090."
   13.5.2. Speed. The wind speed, ff(f), is entered as a two or three digit group immediately
   following the wind direction. The speed is encoded in whole knots using the tens and units
   digits. The hundreds digit is only used when the wind speed exceed 100 knots and is never
   reported as a leading zero. Speeds of less than 10 knots are encoded using a leading zero in
   the tens position. The group always ends with KT to indicate the wind speeds are reported in
   knots. For example, a wind speed of 8 knots is encoded 08KT. A wind speed of 112 knots is
   encoded 112KT.
   13.5.3. Gust. Wind gusts are encoded in the format, Gf mfm(fm). The wind gust is encoded in
   two or three digits immediately following the wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in
   whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if required, the hundreds digit. For example,
   a wind from due west at 20 knots with gusts to 35 knots would be encoded 27020G35KT.
       13.5.4. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with
       wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the ddd. For example, if
       the wind is variable at three knots, it could be encoded VRB03KT.
   13.5.5. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying 60
   degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded in the format,
   dndndnVdxdxdx. The variable wind direction group will immediately follow the wind group.
   The directional variability will be encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind
   is variable from 180 to 240 at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   13.5.6. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
13.6. Visibility Group (VVVVVSM). The surface visibility, VVVVVSM (VVVV in meters
for OCONUS), is encoded in statute miles using the values listed in Table 6.1 A space is
encoded between whole numbers and fractions of reportable visibility values. For example, a
visibility of 1 1/ 2 statute miles is encoded 1 1/2SM. The visibility group at US locations always
ends in SM to indicate that visibilities are in statute miles. Only AMOS locations may use an M
to indicate "less than" when reporting visibility (e.g., M1/4SM (M0400) means a visibility less
than 1/4 SM as reported by AN/FMQ-19).
13.7. Runway Visual Range Group (RD RD R/VRVRVRVRFT). The standards and procedures
for observing RVR are described in Chapter 7. FT at the end of the group indicates the units of
measurement are in feet. Overseas locations will use measurement values as published in the
DoD FLIPs (typically meters). Locations reporting in meters will not include FT or any other
indicator of units.
   13.7.1. RVR is encoded in the format RDRD R/VRVRVRVRFT, where R indicates the runway
   number follows, D RD R is the runway number (an additional D R may be used for runway
   approach directions, such as R for right, L for left, and C for center), V RVRVRVR is the
   constant reportable value.
 80                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      13.7.2. RVR that is varying is encoded in the format, RD RDR/VN VN VN VN VVXVXVXVXFT,
      where R indicates the runway number follows, D RD R is the runway number (an additional D R
      may be used for runway approach directions, such as R for right, L for left, and C for center),
      VN VN VN VN is the lowest reportable value in feet, V separates lowest and highest visual range
      values, VXVXVXVX is the highest reportable value. The 10-minute RVR for runway 01L
      varying between 1,000 and 5,000 (0300 and 1500 meters) feet would be encoded
      "R01L/1000V5000FT" (R01L/0300V1500).
      13.7.3. If the RVR is less than its lowest reportable value, the VRVRVRVR or VN VN VN VN
      groups will be preceded by M. If the RVR is greater than its highest reportable value, the
      VRVRVRVR or VXVXVXVX groups are preceded by a P. For example, an RVR of less than
      100 feet (0050 meters) will be encoded "M0100FT" (M0050); an RVR of greater than 6,000
      feet (1500 meters) will be encoded "P6000FT" (P1500).
      13.7.4. RVR Information Not Available (RVRNO remark). Indicates the 10-minute average
      touchdown RVR for the in-use runway is not available (e.g., equipment failure) during
      periods when prevailing visibility is 1 mile (1600 meters) or less or RVR is 6,000 feet (1830
      meters) or less. RVRNO is not reported in the body of the METAR/SPECI and will be
      reported in the remarks IAW Attachment 3.
13.8. Present Weather Group (w'w'). The standards and procedures for observing present
weather are described in Chapter 8. The following general rules apply when reporting present
weather in a METAR or SPECI report:
      13.8.1. Weather occurring within 5 statute miles (unless directed wlsewhere in nautical miles
      for thunderstorms and lightning of the point of observation (at the station) is encoded in the
      body of the report. Weather occurring in the vicinity of the station (between 5 and 10 statute
      miles unless directed elsewhere in nautical miles for thunderstorms and lightning) is also
      encoded in the body of the report. AMOSs will only use the vicinity (VC) qualifier with
      thunderstorms (TS). Augmented stations may report weather not occurring at or in the
      vicinity of the station in the remarks.
     AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  81

        13.8.2. Separate groups are used for each type of present weather. Each group is separated
        from the other by a space. A METAR/SPECI will contain no more than three present
        weather groups. The groups will be ordered by priority based on Table 13.3

     Table 13.2. Present Weather Reporting Order

         First       - Tornadic Activity—Tornado, Funnel Cloud or Waterspout.


         Second      - Thunderstorm(s) (with/without associated precipitation).

                     - Precipitation in order of decreasing predominance—Most dominant
         Third
                     reported first.

         Fourth      predominance (except Tornado, Funnel Cloud or Waterspout)—Most
                     dominant reported first.

     13.8.3. The weather groups are constructed by considering columns 1 through 5 in Table
     13.2 in sequence (e.g., heavy freezing rain is encoded +FZRA).
        13.8.3.1. Intensity or Proximity Qualifier.
           13.8.3.1.1. Intensity Qualifier. Intensity will be encoded with all precipitation types,
           except ice crystals (IC), small hail and/or snow pellets (GS), and hail (GR), including
           those associated with a TS and those of a showery (SH) nature. No intensity will be
           ascribed to the obscurations of blowing dust (BLDU), blowing sand (BLSA), blowing
           snow (BLSN), blowing spray (BLPY), well-developed dust/sand whirls (PO) and
           squalls (SQ). Tornados and waterspouts are encoded as +FC, while a funnel cloud is
           always encoded as FC. Only moderate or heavy intensity are ascribed to sandstorm
           (SS) and duststorm (DS).
           13.8.3.1.2. Proximity Qualifier. VC (weather phenomena observed in the vicinity of,
           but not at the point of observation), will only be encoded in combination with fog
           (FG), SH, PO, BLDU, BLSA, BLSN, SS, DS and TS. Intensity qualifiers will not be
           encoded with VC. VCFG will be encoded to report any type of fog in the vicinity of
           the point(s) of observation. Precipitation not occurring at the point of observation but
           within 10 statute miles will be encoded as showers in the vicinity (VCSH).
        13.8.3.2. Descriptor Qualifier. Only one descriptor will be encoded for each weather
        phenomena group (e.g., -FZDZ). Mist (BR) will not be encoded with any descriptor.
           13.8.3.2.1. The descriptors shallow (MI), partial (PR), and patches (BC) are only
           encoded with FG (e.g., MIFG). For MIFG (shallow fog) to be encoded, FG must
           cover part of the station, extend no higher than 6 feet above the ground, with visibility
           more than 6 feet above the ground 5/8SM (1000 meters) or more, while the apparent
           visibility in the FG layer is less than 5/8SM (1000 meters). For PRFG (partial fog) to
           be encoded, FG must cover a substantial part of the station and extend to at least 6
           feet above the ground with visibility in the FG less than 5/8SM (1000 meters). For
           BCFG (fog patches) to be encoded, FG must randomly cover part of the station and
           extend to at least 6 feet above the ground with the apparent visibility in the FG patch
           or bank less than 5/8SM (1000 meters), while visibility over other parts of the station
           is greater than or equal to 5/8SM (1000 meters).
           13.8.3.2.2. The descriptors low drifting (DR) and blowing (BL) is only encoded with
           dust (DU), sand (SA), and snow (SN) (e.g., BLSN or DRSN). DR will be encoded
           for DU, SA, or SN raised by the wind to less than 6 feet above the ground. When
           BLSN is observed with SN falling from clouds, both phenomena are reported (e.g.,
           SN BLSN). When, because of BLSN, the weather technician cannot determine
           whether or not SN is also falling, then only "BLSN" will be reported. BL may also
           be encoded with spray (PY).
           13.8.3.2.3. SH is encoded only with one or more of the precipitation types of rain
           (RA), SN, PL, GS or GR. The SH descriptor indicates showery-type precipitation.
           When showery-type precipitation is encoded with VC (VCSH), the intensity and type
           of precipitation is not encoded.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                83


        13.8.3.2.4. The descriptor TS may be encoded by itself, i.e., a TS without associated
        precipitation, or it may be encoded with the precipitation types of RA, SN, PL, GS,
        GR. For example, a TS with SN and GS would be encoded as "TSSNGS."
        13.8.3.2.5. The descriptor freezing (FZ) is only encoded in combination with FG,
        drizzle (DZ) or RA (e.g., FZRA, FZFG, FZDZ).
     13.8.3.3. Precipitation. AMOSs may have one type of precipitation per observation and
     augmented stations may have up to three types of precipitation encoded in a single
     present weather group. They will be encoded in decreasing predominance based on
     intensity. Only one intensity indicator (+ or -) may be encoded and it will refer to the
     first type of precipitation reported.
        13.8.3.3.1. Precipitation types are DZ, RA, SN, IC, PL, GS, GR and snow grains
        (SG). Precipitation is reported whenever it occurs.
        13.8.3.3.2. GR is reported when the diameter of the largest stones observed is 1/4
        inch or more. GS is reported when the diameter of the largest hailstones is less than
        1/4 inch.
     13.8.3.4. Obscurations. With the exception of Volcanic Ash (VA), DRDU, DRSA,
     DRSN, MIFG, PRFG, and BCFG, obscurations are encoded in the body of the report if
     the surface visibility is less than 7 statute miles (9999 meters). Reportable obscurations
     are FG, Mist (BR), Smoke (FU), VA, Widespread Dust (DU), Sand (SA), Haze (HZ), and
     PY.
        13.8.3.4.1. BR is reported when the obscuration consists of water droplets or ice
        crystals and the visibility is at least 5/8 SM (1000 meters), but less than 7 statute
        miles (9999 meters).
        13.8.3.4.2. FG is reported when the obscuration consists of water droplets or ice
        crystals (FG or FZFG) and the visibility is less than 5/8SM (1000 meters). FZ is only
        reported with FG when visibility is less than 5/8 SM (1000 meters) and temperature is
        less than 0 degrees Celsius.
        13.8.3.4.3. VA is always reported when present.
        13.8.3.4.4. PY is encoded only when used with the descriptor BL.
     13.8.3.5. Other Weather Phenomena.
        13.8.3.5.1. SQ is reported when a sudden increase in wind speed of at least 16 knots
        is observed, and is sustained at 22 knots or more for at least 1 minute.
        13.8.3.5.2. Funnel clouds are encoded as FC. Tornadoes or waterspouts must be
        encoded as +FC.
        13.8.3.5.3. Sandstorms are encoded as SS, duststorms as DS. Report a moderate
        SS/DS when visibility is reduced to less than 5/8 statute mile (1000 meters) and
        greater than or equal to 5/16 statute mile (0500 meters) due to BLSA/BLDU. Report
        a +SS/+DS if visibility is less than 5/16 statute mile (0500 meters) due to
        BLSA/BLDU.
        13.8.3.5.4. Well-developed sand or dust whirls are encoded as PO.

13.9. Sky Condition Group (NsNsNshshshs or VVhshshs or CLR). The standards and
procedures for observing sky condition are described in Chapter 9.
      13.9.1. Sky condition is encoded in the format, NsNsNshshshs, where NsNsNs is the amount of
      sky cover and hshs hs is the height of the layer. There is no space between the amount of sky
      cover and the height of the layer.
      13.9.2. Sky condition is encoded in ascending order up to the first overcast layer. At
      mountain locations, if the cloud layer is below the observation location elevation, the height
      of the layer will be reported in the body of the METAR or SPECI as "///."
      13.9.3. No more than six layers will be reported. If more than six layers are observed during
      back-up, weather technicians will use Table 13.4 to help determine which layers are to be
      reported.

Table 13.3. Priority for Reporting Layers
                  Priority                  Layer Description
                  1                         Lowest few layer
                  2                         Lowest broken layer
                  3                         Overcast layer
                  4                         Lowest scattered layer
                  5                         Second lowest scattered layer
                  6                         Second lowest broken layer
                  7                         Highest broken layer
                  8                         Highest scattered layer
                  9                         Second lowest few layer
                  10                        Highest few layer
      13.9.4. Vertical visibility is encoded in the format, VVhshs hs, where VV identifies an
      indefinite ceiling and hshs hs is the vertical visibility into the indefinite ceiling in hundreds of
      feet. There is no space between the group identifier and the vertical visibility.
      13.9.5. Clear skies are encoded in the format, CLR, where CLR is the abbreviation used by
      all AMOS locations to indicate no clouds are present.
      13.9.6. Each layer is separated from other layers by a space. The sky cover for each layer
      reported is encoded by using the appropriate reportable contraction from Table 9.1 The
      report of clear skies (CLR) is reported by itself. The abbreviations FEW, SCT, BKN and
      OVC will be followed, without a space, by the height of the cloud layer.
      13.9.7. The height of the base of each layer, hshs hs, is encoded in hundreds of feet above the
      surface using three digits IAW Table 13.5
      13.9.8. A partial obscuration will be encoded with the reportable layer construction
      corresponding to the amount of the sky that is obscured followed by the layer height. A
      surface-based obscuration will have a layer height of 000. A remark will also be appended
      for any surface-based obscurations. For example: fog obscuring 2/8ths of the sky would be
      encoded in the body of the reoprt as FEW000 and clarified in the remarks as FG FEW000.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     85


Table 13.4. Increments of Reportable Values of Sky Cover Height
             Range of Height Values (feet)         Reportable Increment (feet)
             5,000                                To nearest 100
             > 5,000 but 10,000                    To nearest 500
             > 10,000                              To nearest 1,000
13.10. Temperature/Dew Point Group (T'T'/T'dT'd). The standards and procedures for
observing temperature and dew point are described in Chapter 10.
   13.10.1. The temperature is separated from the dew point following it by a solidus (/).
   13.10.2. The temperature and dew point are encoded as two digits rounded to the nearest
   whole degree Celsius. Subzero temperatures and dew points will be prefixed with an M. For
   example, a temperature of 4C with a dew point of -2C is encoded as "04/M02." A
   temperature of -0.5C is encoded as "M00." Exception: On the electronic (Excel ®) 3803, use
   a minus sign (-) rather than an M to indicate below zero temperature/dew points. The form
   macros will automatically convert the minus sign to an M on the form while retaining the
   numerical value of the temperature/dew point for calculations.
   13.10.3. If the temperature is not available, the entire temperature/dew point group will not
   be encoded. If the dew point is not available, the temperature is encoded followed by a
   solidus (/) and no entry will be made for dew point. For example, a temperature of 1.5C and
   a missing dew point would be reported as "02/."
13. 11. Altimeter (APHPHPHPH). The standards and procedures for observing altimeter are
described in Chapter 11. The altimeter group always starts with an A (the international indicator
for altimeter in inches of mercury). The altimeter is encoded as a four-digit group immediately
following the A using the tens, units, tenths, and hundredths of inches of mercury. The decimal
point is not encoded.
13.12. Remarks (RMK). Remarks generally elaborate on parameters reported in the body of
the report, and will be included in all METAR and SPECI observations, if required in
Attachment 3. Remarks will be separated from the altimeter group by a space and the
contraction RMK. If there are no remarks, the contraction RMK will not be entered.
   13.12.1. METAR/SPECI remarks fall into 2 major categories: (1) Automated and
   Augmented; and (2) Additive and Maintenance Data. Attachment 3 gives an overview of
   remarks and their order of entry.
   13.12.2. Remarks will be made IAW the following:
       13.12.2.1. Use of Contractions and Abbreviations. Where plain language is called for,
       authorized contractions, abbreviations and symbols will be used to conserve time and
       space. However, in no case should an essential remark be omitted for the lack of readily
       available contractions. In such cases, the only requirement is that the remark be clear.
       For a detailed list of authorized contractions, see the list of abbreviations and acronyms in
       Attachment 1 and FAA Order 7340 Series, Contractions.
       13.12.2.2. Time Entries in Remarks. UTC time entries are made in minutes past the hour
       if the time reported occurs during the same hour the observation is taken. UTC hours and
 86                                                      AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


         minutes are used if the hour is different from the hour of the observation or this manual
         prescribes the use of hour and minutes.
         13.12.2.3. The reporting of Additive Data information will be IAW 24-hour UTC time
         for AMOS locations. If required, report snow depth during normal airfield operating
         hours and if a heavy snow warning is in effect. If required, report in the 0000, 0600,
         1200 and 1800 UTC observation or MAJCOM specified reporting time for your
         installation, whenever there is more than a trace of snow on the ground and more than a a
         trace of precipitation (water equivalent) has occurred within the past 6 hours.
         13.12.2.4. Location Entries. Phenomena encoded in the body of the report as vicinity
         (VC) may be further described, (e.g., direction from the observing location, if known).
         Phenomena beyond 10 statute miles of the point of observation may be reported as distant
         (DSNT) if the actual distance is unknown but believed to be beyond 10 statute miles,
         followed by the direction from the observing location. If known, the distance in statute
         miles (CONUS) or meters (OCONUS) may be included in the remark. In the case of a
         tornado, the exact location should be included, if possible.
         13.12.2.5. Movement Entries. Movement of clouds or weather, if known, will be
         encoded with respect towards the direction the phenomenon is moving. For example, a
         thunderstorm 9 statute miles north moving toward the northeast would be encoded as ―TS
         9N MOV NE.‖
         13.12.2.6. Direction. Directions will use the eight points of the compass encoded in a
         clockwise order beginning with north. In the event that the reported phenomena is north
         but also extends northwest and northeast, record the phenomena in a clockwise direction
         (e.g., TS 10NW-NE).
13.13. Dissemination. All observations will be disseminated local and longline in the
METAR/SPECI code format. Most EUs will use an ADS as the primary local and longline
dissemination system. During periods when the ADS system is unavailable, EUs should use
AFW-WEBS, the Secure Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN-S),
OWS or another EU to disseminate observations longline. Figure 13.2 contains example
METAR/SPECI augmented observations.
13.13.1. Pressure altitude (PA) and density altitude (DA) are normally only disseminated
locally. When required, disseminate PA (e.g., PA +130) or DA (e.g., DA +3680) following the
last element or remark in the observation, with the exception of runway condition remarks which
are reported last.
      13.13.2. As capability exists, EU will configure ADS systems to provide an URGENT alert
      to users on the local weather dissemination network upon receipt of reports for Tornadic
      Activity and Volcanic Eruptions, and for other reports of severe weather that could cause an
      immediate threat to life or property.
      13.13.3. Corrections (COR) to Transmitted Data. When correcting observations, the COR
      will be disseminated in the same manner as the observation being corrected. Disseminate
      CORs as soon as possible whenever an error is detected in a transmitted report. However, if
      the erroneous data has been corrected or superseded by a later report (with the same or more
      complete dissemination), do not transmit the corrected observation. Transmitted corrections
      will consist of the entire corrected observation. Use the original date and time of the
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  87


   observation as the date and time in the COR'd observation, along with a remark containing
   the UTC time of transmission. See Attachment 3.

   13.13.4. Local Dissemination. During ADS outages or if ADS is not available, disseminate
   observations first to ATC. For further dissemination, establish procedures locally in an order
   of priority that is consistent with local requirements and scheduled file times for longline
88                                                        AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     transmission. Coordinate local dissemination procedures to include code form, format and
     content with local customers and document in the local weather documentation. Locations
     without an ADS should disseminate observations locally as follows:
        13.13.4.1. Precede reports of tornadic activity, volcanic eruptions and other reports of
        severe weather that could cause an immediate threat to life or property, with the term
        URGENT.
        13.13.4.2. Disseminate wind direction in degrees magnetic (unless otherwise specificed,
        see Chapter 5) using three digits.
        13.13.4.3. Disseminate all other plain language remarks as required by local agencies
        after the last element of the observation.
        13.13.4.4. Maintain a copy of all observations disseminated locally.
     13.13.5. Voice Dissemination. Maintain instructions outlining priorities and procedures to
     follow for local dissemination of observations by voice relay (e.g., read back by the person
     receiving the data). Disseminate all observations immediately to local ATC agencies (e.g.,
     tower, Radar Approach Control, Ground Control Approach), then to other users as
     established locally. Also maintain a record (written or recording) of all the following when
     voice is used to disseminate locally during outages of the primary system:
        13.13.5.1. Actual time of observation (UTC).
        13.13.5.2. Time (in minutes past the hour) the observation was transmitted to the tower
        and other local ATC agencies.
        13.13.5.3. Single element LOCALs for Altimeter setting, PA or DA (where required).
        13.13.5.4. Initials of the weather technician making the dissemination and the initials of
        the receiver at the supported agency.
     13.13.6. Supplementary Identification of Observations. At limited-duty EUs and gunnery
     ranges, identify the last observation of the day (METAR or SPECI) by adding the term
     "LAST" following the last element in the observation text (e.g., TCU SE LAST), and include
     the remark on the 3803/3813, as applicable.
     13.13.7. Delayed Reports. Transmit the contraction NIL at the standard time when it is
     evident that a weather report will not be completed in time for scheduled transmission.
     13.13.8. Reports Filed But not Transmitted. When an augmented observation is not able to
     be transmitted longline before the next METAR or SPECI is required, transmit only the latest
     observation longline. Enter "FIBI" (contraction for Filed But Impractical to Transmit) in
     parenthesis in column 13 (FIBI). Include FIBI in a METAR only if a later observation
     containing all elements of a METAR is available for transmission.
     13.13.9. When a SPECI is not transmitted longline, transmit subsequent SPECI only when
     the change between the last transmitted report and the current report meets the criteria for a
     SPECI. Otherwise, enter (FIBI) in remarks for the current report and only disseminate it
     locally.
AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             89


13.14. Reports of a Volcanic Eruption. Reports of a Volcanic Eruption are disseminated
regardless of the delay. Use any reasonable means to disseminate the report.
13.15. Communication Failure. If all longline communication services have failed (e.g., ADS
and no Internet connection), telephone the METAR or SPECI during the failure to the nearest
OWS or EU with communication capability.
13.16. Longline Dissemination by other EUs. Enter a record of longline dissemination by
another EU in parentheses in column 13 of AF 3803/3813. Identify the EU that transmitted the
observation longline and the initials of the individual that received the data (e.g., (BY
KGRF/DR), (BY 25 OWS/MS)).
13.17. Quality Control of Observations. EUs will establish procedures to check all manually
entered surface weather observations for erroneous data before dissemination and again after
dissemination before the next observation to verify that no errors were generated during the
dissemination process.

Terms
At the Station—Used to report present weather phenomena when within 5 statute miles/8000
meters of the point(s) of observation.
 96                                                     AFMAN15-111 27 FEBRUARY 2013


Aviation Routine Weather Report—The WMO METAR code format used worldwide to
encode weather observations.
Distant from the Station—Used to report present weather phenomena more than 10 statute
miles/16 kilometers from the point(s) of observation.
Eyes Forward—EU technicians are the eyes forward for the OWS forecasters and integrate
weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning detection readouts, and non-
standard weather data systems (vertical profilers, mesonet data, etc.) to create an integrated
weather picture and near-term trend forecasts for the OWS. Eyes forward yields meaningful
meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the servicing OWS and is an
integral part of the meteorological watch for an installation or contingency operating location.
File Time—The specific time or specific time block a weather message or bulletin is scheduled
to be transmitted.
Freezing Rain—Rain that falls in liquid form but freezes upon impact to form a coating of glaze
upon the ground and on exposed objects. While the temperature of the ground surface and
glazed objects initially must be near or below freezing, it is necessary that the water drops be
supercooled before striking (AMS, Glossary of Meteorology, 1989).
Glaze—A coating of ice, generally clear and smooth but usually containing some air pockets,
formed on exposed objects by the freezing of a film of supercooled water deposited by rain,
drizzle, fog, or possible condensed from supercooled water vapor. Glaze is denser, harder and
more transparent then either rime or hoarfrost. Its density may be as high as 0.8 or 0.9 gm per
cm3. Factors that favor glaze formation are large drop size, rapid accretion, slight supercooling,
and slow dissipation of heat fusion (AMS, Glossary of Meteorology, 1989).
ICAO Identifier—A specifically authorized 4-letter identifier assigned to a location and
documented in ICAO Document 7910.ICAO.
International Civil Aviation Organization—A United Nations organization specializing in
matters dealing with international aviation and navigation.
Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET)—JET consolidates and integrates key capabilities from
several familiar systems (N-TFS, OPS-II, JWIS, AOS, IWWC, IWEDA, IMETS…) used in
OWSs, EUs, AOCs, and even deployed into one seamless application.
Limited—Duty Exploitation Unit—A EU that provides less than 24-hour a day forecast
service.
Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)—A timely notice containing information concerning the
establishment, condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazards,
essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
Observed—Indicates reported weather information was determined visually by weather
personnel, or weather sensing equipment, or by using radar.
Pilot Report (PIREP)—A report of in-flight weather provided by an aircraft crewmember.
Severe Weather—Any weather condition that poses a hazard to property or life.
Vicinity—Used to report present weather phenomena 5 statute miles/8000 meters to 10 statute
miles/16 kilometers from the point(s) of observation.

                      period prior to the METAR. For example, a peak wind of 45
                      knots from 280 degrees that occurred at 15 minutes past the

                      following the time if it is reasonably certain that the wind
                      shift was the result of a frontal passage. There is a space
                      between the remark identifier and the time and, if applicable,
                      between the time and the frontal passage contraction. For
                      example, a remark reporting a wind shift accompanied by a
                      frontal passage that began at 30 minutes after the hour would
                      be encoded as "WSHFT 30 FROPA."

         Visibility        tower visibility are less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters)
                           and differ by a reportable value from the surface visibility.
                           There is a space between each of the remark elements. For
                           example, the surface visibility is 1 statute mile (1600 meters)
                           and tower visibility is 1 1/2 statute miles (2400 meters) you
                           would encode TWR VIS 1 1/2 (TWR VIS 2400).
7        Variable          Encode variable prevailing visibility (visibility < 3 statute    X        X                        X

                           VIS_vnvnvnvnvnVvxvxvxvxvx, where VIS is the remark
                           identifier, vnvnvnvnvn is the lowest visibility evaluated, V
                           denotes variability between two values, and vxvxvxvxvx is the
                           highest visibility evaluated. There is one space following the
                           remark identifier; no spaces between the letter V and the
                           lowest/highest values. For example, a visibility that was
                           varying between 1/2 and 2 statute miles would be encoded
                           "VIS 1/2V2."

                           defines the sector to 8 points of the compass, and vvvvv is
                           the sector visibility in statute miles or meters, using the
                           appropriate set of values. For example, a visibility of 2 1/2
                           statute miles (4000 meters) in the northeastern octant would
                           be encoded "VIS NE 2 1/2" (VIS NE 4000).

                           specific location of the visibility sensor(s) at the EU. Include
                           the remark only when the condition is lower than that
                           contained in the body of the report. For example, a visibility
                           of 2 1/2 statute miles (4000 meters) measured by a second
                           sensor located at runway 11 would be encoded "VIS 2 1/2
                           RWY11" (VIS 4000 RWY11).

12       Beginning and Encode beginning and ending of thunderstorm(s) in format, X             X                            X
         Ending of        TSB(hh)mmE(hh)mm, where TS indicates thunderstorm, B
         Thunderstorms denotes the beginning, E denotes the ending, and (hh)mm is
                          the time of occurrence (only the minutes are required if the
         (See Note 1)     hour can be inferred from the report time). There are no
                          spaces between the elements. For example, if a thunderstorm
                          began at 0159 and ended at 0230, the remark would be
                          encoded "TSB0159E30." AMOSs automatically provide a
                          remark both when the thunderstorm begins and ends (e.g.,
                          TSB1635 indicates a thunderstorm began at 1635Z).
13       Thunderstorm Encode thunderstorm(s) in format, TS_LOC_(MOV_DIR), O
         Location         where TS identifies the thunderstorm activity, LOC is the

                          EU, and MOV_DIR is the movement with direction, if
                          known. For example, a thunderstorm 8 statute miles
                          southeast of the EU and moving toward the northeast would
                          be encoded "TS 8SE MOV NE."

                          identifier and [size] is the diameter of the largest hailstone.
                          The hailstone size is encoded in 1/4 inch increments. For
                          example, "GR 1 3/4" would indicate that the largest
                          hailstones were 1 3/4 inches in diameter. If GS is encoded in
                          the body of the report, no hailstone size remark is required.

                          ceiling height evaluated, V denotes variability between two
                          values, and hxhxhx is the highest ceiling height evaluated.
                          There is one space following the remark identifier; no spaces
                          between the letter V and the lowest/highest ceiling values.
                          For example, ―CIG 005V010‖ would indicate a ceiling that
                          was varying between 500 and 1,000 feet.

                       Language] where CB or CBMAM is the cloud type, LOC is
                       the direction from the observing location, and MOV_DIR is
                       the movement with direction (if known). Separate the cloud
                       type entries from each other with a space. For example, a CB

                         through west of the observing location would be encoded
                         ―ACSL SW-W‖; an apparent rotor cloud northeast of the

                         hectopascals would be encoded as "SLP982." The FMQ-19
                         reports SLP on SPECI and METAR observations. If SLP is
                         not available, it is encoded as "SLPNO."

                         more than a trace of precipitation (water equivalent) has
         (METAR only) fallen in the preceding 24 hours. The amount of precipitation
                         is encoded by using the tens, units, tenths, and hundredths of
                         inches (water equivalent) for the 24-hour period. If more

                       in the format, 4/sss, where 4/ is the group indicator and sss is
         (METAR only) the snow depth in whole inches using three digits. For
                       example, a snow depth of 21 inches will be encoded as

                       1 if the value is below 0°C and 0 if the value is 0°C or
                       higher. The temperature and dew point is reported in tens,
                       units, and tenths of degrees Celsius. There will be no spaces
                       between the entries. For example, a temperature of 2.6°C
                       and dew point of -1.5°C would be reported in the body of the
                       report as "03/M01" and the TsnT’T’T’snT’dT’dT’d group as
                       T00261015". If dew point is missing report the temperature;
                       if the temperature is missing do not report the temperature/

                       below 0°C and 0 if the maximum temperature is 0°C or
         (METAR only) higher. For example, a maximum temperature of -2.1°C
                       would be encoded "11021"; 14.2°C would be encoded
                       "10142."
