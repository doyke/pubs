1. Policy. The purpose of the JMB is to deter future misconduct by the juvenile, to rectify any harm done
to the Buckley AFB community and/or victim(s) of the misconduct and to recommend appropriate disci-
pline if necessary. This instruction seeks to minimize the possibility of juveniles becoming involved in
incidents of misconduct and other serious incidents, and to make parents or legal guardians aware of their
responsibility regarding their children's activities and whereabouts, and to enhance the good order and
discipline of this installation. (As used in this directive, a juvenile is a person under 18 years of age)
(exempt from this definition are military members and spouses) (Attachment 1). Each parent or legal
guardian should make their dependent aware of this instruction and exercise reasonable leadership to sup-
port the spirit and intent of this instruction. In addition to ensuring their dependent children adhere to all
Federal, State, and Civil laws, parents and legal guardians are responsible for ensuring that their depen-
dents adhere to all Air Force and 460th Space Wing (460 SW) directives.
   1.1. All JMBs will be convened at the discretion of the 460th Space Wing Commander (460 SW/CC).
   If 460 SW/CC determines a JMB should convene, the Board Chairperson will select a date and time
   to convene. All JMBs will be convened in the Buckley AFB Legal Office, Court Room, 510 South
   Aspen Street (Building 1030), Buckley AFB, CO.
   1.2. If circumstances prevent a formal JMB from convening, 460 SW/CC or 460th Space Wing Vice
   Commander (460 SW/CV) may convene an emergency JMB. An emergency JMB must have at least
   three of the five Board Officers present. An emergency JMB may be conducted via telephone confer-
   ence call.
   1.3. The juvenile and the juvenile’s sponsor may voluntarily participate in this program. If the juve-
   nile does not agree to participate, the juvenile’s case may be transferred to civilian authorities for pros-
   ecution.

2. Procedures.
   2.1. In accordance with standing regulations and instructions, the 460th Security Forces Squadron
   Office of Investigations (460 SFS/SFOI) or other investigative agency will conduct an investigation of

   2.2. In this report of investigation, the 460 SFS Commander (460 SFS/CC) will make recommenda-

   the 460 SW/JA, 460th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (460 MSG/CD), 460th Mission

   7.1. There are numerous considerations that the Juvenile Control Officer, the 460 SFS/CC, 460 SW/
   JA, and 460 MSG/CD or 460 MSG/CC must take into account when determining whether a juvenile
   is to be referred to civil authorities or to be entered into Buckley AFB Juvenile Misconduct Program.
   These considerations include but are not limited to:
       7.1.1. The juvenile must be at least 11 years old to enter the program.
       7.1.2. Whether the particular offense is considered a felony by Colorado law.
       7.1.3. Whether the particular offense is one of violence or subjects other members of the commu-
       nity to harm or potential harm.
       7.1.4. Whether the juvenile is a repeat offender on the installation, or has been formally entered
       into the civil Juvenile Probation or state Youth Authority Department.
       7.1.5. Whether the juvenile or his/her parents or legal guardians have shown themselves unable or
       unwilling to cooperate with non-authoritative agencies (i.e. Mental Health, Social Actions, etc.),
       or such treatment has failed in the past.
       7.1.6. Whether treatment service needed by the juvenile can only be obtained through the juvenile
       court and/or probation department.
       7.1.7. Whether the juvenile is in need of aid or protection of the court.

8. Community Service. In cases where community service is remanded by the Juvenile Review Board in
lieu of barment, or self-referred by the sponsor, the parents and/or legal guardian will:
   8.1. Fill out 460 SW IMT 4, Community Service Program Contract, with their juvenile dependent.
   Any failure to fill out 460 SW IMT Form 4 may preclude the dependent from performing community
   service and use of authorized facilities and services may be denied at Buckley AFB.
   8.2. Be responsible and ensure all community service is completed by the scheduled date or make
   other arrangements with the Juvenile Control Officer.
   8.3. Ensure all elements of the community service contract are being met (Attachment 4).

SUBJECT: Dependent Misconduct


1. On 1 Jan 03, your dependent daughter, Jane L. Doe, was involved in an incident of juvenile miscon-
duct. Specifically, she assaulted another dependent at the Base Exchange, causing her minor injuries.
This is in violation of Colorado Revised Statutes Section 18-3-202 (Assault).


2. Incidents of this nature violate Air Force Instructions and civil laws and will not be tolerated. I am
required to ensure appropriate action is taken to prevent a recurrence of unlawful incidents by Jane. Any
recurrence of unlawful incidents by Jane could result in court action being taken against her.


3. There is a wide range of corrective actions, which I could take as a result of this misconduct. I have
chosen to issue this “Dependent Misconduct Memorandum.” Since this is the first incident that Jane has
been involved in, I will only be revoking her privileges ____(list)_____ for _____ month(s). If she is
involved in any future misconduct, I will recommend that more severe actions be taken. These actions
may include removal of your family from base housing as applicable and/or barment of Jane from this
installation.


4. The 460 SWI 31-201, Juvenile Misconduct Program, sets policy on the conduct and control of juve-
niles. You should make Jane aware of this instruction and exercise reasonable leadership to support the
spirit and intent of the instruction. If you consider the severity of the above-required actions to be inap-
propriate (based upon the extent of Jane’s involvement in the incident), you may submit a rebuttal to me
in writing through the 460 SFS/CC within 10 days.


5. A copy of this memorandum will be forwarded to your respective organizational commander.
Acknowledge receipt via first endorsement below within 5 working days of being notified by the 460th
Security Forces Squadron.

1. On (--date--), (--state misconduct that occurred and where--), security forces investigated the (--state
misconduct--) and (--state the result or outcome of investigation--).


2. The security forces investigation has not been turned over to the local juvenile authorities for action.
While this is still a possible recourse, I would prefer to convene a Juvenile Misconduct Board in accor-
dance with 460 SWI 31-201, Juvenile Misconduct Program, dated (XXXXX) (attached). The Juvenile
Misconduct Board will address the alleged misconduct and determine what corrective action, if any,
should be taken to ensure there is no recurrence.


3. The board’s decision will be based on the security forces investigation, (victim’s name) input and any
other relevant information that may be provided. This may include any written and/or oral statement that
you and/or your dependent submit regarding the incident. The determined corrective action will be ren-
dered as a recommendation for voluntary compliance on the part of the dependent.


4. I have set the Juvenile Misconduct Board to convene at (hours), on (--date--), (day of the week) at the
Court Room in Building 1030. If you or your (son or daughter) are unable to attend, please contact my
office immediately at (720) 847-XXXX to reschedule.

         18401 East A-Basin Avenue (Stop 96)
         Buckley AFB, CO 80011-9524


SUBJECT: Juvenile Misconduct Board (JMB)


1. As the 460th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander at Buckley AFB, it is my responsibility to
decide on issues of misconduct that occur on this base. AFI 36-3026, Identification Cards for Members
of the Uniformed Services, Their Family Members, and Other Eligible Personnel, and 460 SWI 31-201,
Juvenile Misconduct Board (JMB), dictate that juveniles who commit acts of misconduct can have their
base privileges suspended, curtailed, or revoked. In extreme or repeat cases, the juvenile may be barred
from the base, which could prevent the family from residing in base housing. Restriction of privileges is
one way to deal with juvenile misconduct; referral of this case directly to Arapahoe County juvenile
authorities is another.


2. The board’s actions are designed to make juveniles more responsible for their actions and offer parents
a more formal approach to discipline. The program requires the full support of the parents to be effective.
Unless diverted to the local county authorities, each juvenile accused of misconduct will meet the JMB,
which will evaluate the case, along with any voluntary input from the juvenile and the parents/sponsors.
The board is comprised of representatives from various agencies and will recommend action. All board
actions are rehabilitative attempts and usually include community service, drug testing, counseling, loss
of privileges for the youth and/or writing essays and speaking to various groups on lessons learned, iden-
tifying values, providing information, and suggesting alternatives. Each sanction is based upon the cir-
cumstances of the misconduct. While the board may recommend that the case be turned over to civilian
authorities, the board itself is not a criminal proceeding.


3. You will have the opportunity to make a presentation to the board. If a board meeting is scheduled to
review your dependent’s case, you will be notified by mail if you are a civilian or by your first sergeant or
commander if you are a military member. You will be required to attend with your dependent, and if a
board presentation is not possible, you may direct your request for a waiver to the board through (Juvenile
Control Officer).

4. The Buckley JMB is not meant to take the place nor do away with your part in disciplining your depen-
dent, but provides a more formal rehabilitative tool to help you and your dependent. Your active involve-
ment in this program can weigh heavily in your favor if further disciplinary actions are considered.




5. If you have any questions or comments concerning the board, please contact the 460th Security Forces
Squadron Reports and Analysis Office (460 SFS/SFAR) at (720) 847-5297.

          Buckley AFB CO 80011-9518


SUBJECT: Welcome Letter to Parents and Guardians


1. Welcome to Buckley AFB. We at the 460th Security Forces Squadron hope you and your family have
an enjoyable and safe tour. Buckley’s location often presents special challenges to our community youth
and their parents. There are some special rules on base for juveniles and I would like to make you aware
of them. Some areas of the base are not safe and healthy for unsupervised children and should be avoided.
Children are specifically not allowed in the following areas:


  a. Driving Range/Golf Course, during hours of darkness.


  b. Camana Club, except designated teen nights.


  c. The BX and Commissary complexes and parking areas during non-operating hours.


   d. All dormitories and other bachelor quarters, except with permission of the unit commander or first
sergeant.


2. To ensure your stay is as pleasant as possible, I would like to remind you of some additional responsi-
bilities concerning the conduct and control of your dependents. Juveniles generally enjoy the same privi-
leges on Buckley AFB as adults, however certain controls apply. The 460 SWI 31-201, Juvenile
Misconduct Program, sets the policy on the conduct and control of juveniles. It defines parental respon-
sibilities to control juveniles, outlines the limits of juvenile activity, and identifies possible administrative
actions, which may be imposed if the instruction is violated. A juvenile is defined as someone less than
18 years of age. Each parent or legal guardian should make their children aware of the instruction, and
