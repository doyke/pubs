SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
contains significant changes to this policy directive; makes administrative changes to the title of
the publication, duty titles and office symbols; and incorporates DoD initiatives to promote
telework and financial literacy education.          The original Attachment 1, MEASURING
COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY, has been deleted and the former Attachment 2, GLOSSARY OF
REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION, has been renumbered.

1. Policy. The United States Air Force is committed to improving workforce efficiency while
promoting quality of life for its civilian workforce. Attracting and retaining valued employees
requires flexible and responsive programs to balance the need for uniformity with flexibility
when appropriate. It is Air Force policy to:

1.1 Promote the use of flexible work arrangements, to include compressed work schedules,
flexible work schedules with credit hours, and telework for eligible civilian employees.
Consistent with workload and mission requirements, Installation Commanders, Tenant
Commanders, and Heads of Activities should attempt to overcome artificial barriers and permit
flexible work arrangements that allow employees to better balance their work and family
responsibilities on a daily basis, to regularly promote their use throughout their organizations for
eligible employees, and remind supervisors to inform applicants of available work/life
flexibilities when filling vacancies. Commanders and Heads of Activities should also
incorporate plans for telework arrangements into their Continuity of Operations (COOP) plans.

1.2. Value the health and fitness of all personnel and empower individuals and organizations to
actualize those values and achieve optimal health as a means to enhance mission readiness and
unit performance. As workload and resources allow, Commanders and Heads of Activities
should implement programs designed to promote healthy lifestyles and disease or injury
prevention to include authorizing excused absence from duty to participate in physical fitness
activities and providing health fairs/ health-promotion opportunities to employees.

1.3. Support civilian employees by appropriate use of compensation incentives, e.g., foreign
language proficiency pay and various premium pays, consistent with mission needs.
Commanders and Heads of Activities should ensure overtime work occurs only as necessary to
accomplish an essential mission. Installation Commanders, Tenant Commanders, and Heads of
Activities may utilize any of these flexibilities/incentives that will ensure the accomplishment of
the Air Force mission while enhancing the quality of life of their civilian employees consistent
with government-wide, DoD, and Air Force policies.

1.4. Promote the safety and well-being of all employees and their families. Installation
Commanders, Tenant Commanders, and Heads of Activities should establish procedures within
their organizations to account for the status and whereabouts of individuals assigned therein in
the event of disasters, ensure all personnel to be accounted for have current emergency contact
AFPD36-8        10 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                           3

information on file and are provided the necessary information and guidance regarding when and
how to check in.

1.5 Ensure Commanders provide an initial assessment and counseling, when applicable, for
employees with substance misuse problems if services are available within the installation and/or
referrals for community-based assessment and treatment services as appropriate. The Air Force
also recognizes that other work or family pressures and job stress can adversely affect employee
performance, reliability, or personal health and, therefore, encourages Installation Commanders
or Heads of Activities to provide and promote Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) for
personal counseling needs of their civilian workforce.

1.6 Provide retirement planning and financial literacy education information to the civilian
workforce via electronic or other means to assist employees in planning their career-long
investment and retirement strategies. As budget and mission requirements allow, Installation
Commanders and Heads of Activities may also provide lectures/seminars to employees covering
work/life issues of retirement, benefits, and financial planning.

1.7. Ensure that the civilian benefits, entitlements, and work/life programs are administered
without unlawful discrimination because of race/color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital
status, disability, political affiliation, sexual orientation, reprisal, or other non-merit factors. The
Air Force must provide a workplace free of sexual harassment for all employees. Applicable
policies and procedures must be consistent with government-wide, DoD and Air Force policies;
formalized in writing; and communicated to employees.

2. Responsibilities and authorities. This directive establishes the following responsibilities
and authorities:

2.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR)
serves as an agent of the Secretary and provides guidance, direction, and oversight for all matters
pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets
addressing civilian employee benefits, entitlements, and work/life programs.

2.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Personnel (AF/A1) executes personnel policy
and develops, coordinates, and approves essential procedural guidance for civilian compensation,
benefits, accessions, assignments, retention, separation, and retirement programs.

3. See Attachment 1 for references and supporting information.

4. Adopted Forms.
