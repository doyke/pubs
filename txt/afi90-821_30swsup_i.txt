This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-8,
Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Program. It describes the Air Force Hazard
Communication (HAZCOM) Program that puts into effect the requirements of the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200
for the Air Force. All records created as a result of this publication must be maintained and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

Unless otherwise noted, the guidance and procedures outlined in this AFI apply to all U.S. Air
Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals, and indirect hire foreign
employees at Air Force installations within the United States, its territories, and in foreign
countries, and geographically separated units (GSU). Additionally, this AFI applies to the Air
Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units (DRU) and field operating
agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations. Government-owned, contractor-operated
(GOCO) operations within the continental United States (CONUS) or United States (US)

This publication revises Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard 161-21,
Hazard Communication, dated 23 January 1989. Changes include placing primary responsibility
for hazard communication (HAZCOM) training and worker awareness on the work area/shop
supervisor, and clarification of supporting training and technical consultation roles. Employee
training consists of comprehensive AF HAZCOM training conducted upon initial assignment,
and supplemental training made necessary when a new chemical hazard or exposure have been
introduced into the work area/shop.

(30SW) AFI90-821, Hazard Communication, 30 March 2005, is supplemented as follows.
This supplement applies to all assigned, attached and tenant units who use or handle hazardous
chemicals within the confines of Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), and are required to
maintain a HAZCOM program. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1974 as amended in 1996
affects this publication. Refer recommended changes and questions about this instruction to 30
MDOS/SGOAB, 338 South Dakota Blvd, VAFB CA 93437-6307 using AF Form 847,

Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Paragraph 2.5 has been amended to allow OCONUS locations to maintain documents meeting
the intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) when documents consistent with that regulation cannot be
obtained from an OCONUS supplier. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

(30SW) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It has been
converted from a standalone wing instruction to a supplement of the Air Force Instruction.
Conversion to a supplement format reduced the amount of information conveyed to the reader
regarding the Vandenberg AFB specific hazardous material procurement and distribution system.
Significant items retained by the supplement are a mandatory HAZCOM program binder and a
template for the written HAZCOM program. A significant item added is a separate written work
area/shop specific training template.

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview.

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including
aircraft and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support
functions. This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational
illnesses and injuries in the workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the
health and physical hazards associated with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when,
using or handling hazardous chemicals in work area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred
to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program, and is not to be confused with other
separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program (HMMP).
HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop
hazards.
1.2. Scope.
   1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for
   those work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All
   employees that work in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a
   manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable
   emergency, will be provided information about the hazardous chemicals to which they are
   exposed. This information shall be provided by means of a hazard communication program,
   including but not limited to material safety data sheets (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of
   warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material
   Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey letters] and
   training.
   1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
       1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals,
       and indirect hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental
       United States (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as
       established in accordance with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
       1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units
       (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be
       potentially exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in
       contractor facilities. Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the
       contractor’s Federal compliant hazard communication program. The Air Force retains
       ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel participation and oversight.

       1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated
       facilities when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the
       following exceptions:
           1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific
           contracts, from their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM
           regulation or any applicable State and local requirements.
           1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with
           Federal HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are
           not authorized to use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
    1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force
    installations even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
    1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication
    Program description contained in Para. 2.2
    1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in
    sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction
    applies to these operations only as follows:
       1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals
       are not removed or defaced.
       1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
       maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals
       received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
       1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work
       area/shop, and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a
       hazardous chemical from a sealed container.

                                          Chapter 2

                       HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except
as stated in Para. 2.2 below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner
employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program
requirements do not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is
   formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s)
   dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under
   normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or
   trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does
   not pose a physical hazard or health risk to employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs,
   e.g., pills or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier
   toner, etc (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical
   manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
   exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be
   experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended).
      2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program
      and require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation
      with BE. For example:
          2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not
          require this training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner
          daily will require training.
          2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require
          training; however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel
          using the same cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.

2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the
supplier or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air
Force activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include
hazard determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained
on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing
organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to AFIOH.
     2.4.1. (Added-30SW) For additional information on hazard determination, please review
     the MSDS, NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards, or consult with BE.
2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by
the chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid
procedures, and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be
prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will
maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29
CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCONUS supplier, a document meeting the
intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
     2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for
     every item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file
     must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In
     addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-
     hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which
     matched the old material, must be retained.
     2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to,
     the chemical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line
     or CDROM, or through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources, the
     BE Flight may be contacted for further assistance.
     2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
        2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have
        unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
        2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version.
        OSHA does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to
        immediate employee access" are created.
        2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be
        determined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker
        to obtain an MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally
        splashed with a hazardous chemical.
        2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
        access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up
        system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
        another non-impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or
AFI90-821_30SWSUP_I 4 FEBRUARY 2010                                                          17


      BE Flight. Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a
      case-by-case basis.
      2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of
      the MSDS to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and
      planning, and will be available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of
      MSDSs.
      2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g.,
      their work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line
      operations), the MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this
      situation, the supervisor shall ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required
      information in an emergency.
   2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is
   protected and used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health
   hazard education. During the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will
   discuss trade-secret limitations with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors
   using materials with trade-secret information are encouraged to be familiar with requirements
   and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i). When requesting proprietary information, the
   BEE may be asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement regarding a manufacturer’s proprietary
   information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure criteria are not clear.
2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial
   distributors to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal
   HAZCOM standard. Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the
   supply system or through local purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTs will ensure incoming containers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to identify any containers received
   without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
   2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows
   [See 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
      2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
      Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic
      Substances Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
      2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary
      device or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products
      (e.g., flavors and fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
      Cosmetic Act.
      2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for
      nonindustrial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
      and regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that
18                                                AFI90-821_30SWSUP_I 4 FEBRUARY 2010


        Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
        and Firearms.
        2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the
        Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when
        subject to a consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or
        regulations issued under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
        2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance
        with the Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the
        Department of Agriculture.
     2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
     area/ shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not
     obliterated or covered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container
     labels [refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
        2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
        2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical
        and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
        This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
     2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined
     purposes. If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements,
     the original label may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the information
     required by the Federal HAZCOM standard, information on the original label must remain
     legible.
     2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
        2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
        gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who
        made the transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to
        HAZCOM requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be under
        the control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container and
        only within the work shift in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain full
        control over the chemical or departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual material
        left in the portable container, this material shall either be disposed of under applicable
        local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or labeled in accordance with
        applicable regulations.
        2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a
        central distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other
        employees, then the portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance
        with HAZCOM requirements.
2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
     2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to
     hazardous materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on
     the AF HAZCOM program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards
AFI90-821_30SWSUP_I 4 FEBRUARY 2010                                                             19


  prior to the use of hazardous chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals
  (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and fire department) review and approve the shop specific
  hazard training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
  the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors shall be trained according to their
  specific contract provisions.
     2.7.1.1. (Added-30SW) Each shop’s HAZCOM program manager will develop a
     written work area/shop specific training program or plan. See Attachment 5 for the
     recommended template for the work area/shop specific training. If the program manager
     uses the template, only BE and Safety will need to review and approve the plan prior to
     implementation. If the template is not used, review and approval of the plan will need to
     be done by Fire and Public Health, as well as BE and Safety. The work area/shop
     specific training plan and any additional supplemental data must be reviewed and
     approved by BE and Safety at least once least every five years.
  2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior
  to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work
  area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change.
     2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
     their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training,
     at a minimum, will include the following:
         2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
         hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material
         used in association with work area/shop processes.
         2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical
         used (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards;
         including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g.,
         asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
         2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard
         communication program.
         2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
         2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
         2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal
         protective equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to
         hazardous chemicals specific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray
         painting process). Supervisors shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop
         survey reports for specific control requirements.
         2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental
         chemical release (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the
         locations of emergency eye wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
         2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank
         change-out every three months).
20                                                AFI90-821_30SWSUP_I 4 FEBRUARY 2010


        2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is
        required when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical
        is introduced. The training shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2
        Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of
        information to meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops
        either by assigned duties or location, work area/shopspecific training as described in Para.
        2.7.2.1 will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes in working
        conditions and potential exposures.
     2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities,
     such as GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7) or they may participate in
     that GOCO’s or other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the
     training meets the requirements of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
     2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM
     standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance
     with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to
     document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form
     55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external HAZCOM
     training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where
     applicable.
     2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a
     performance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be
     measured by assessing worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to
     include, but not be limited to:
        2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the
        nature of the hazard.
        2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
        2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
        2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what
        precautions (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use
        when working with hazardous chemicals.
2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
     2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the
     hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
     the work area/ shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
     area/shop). The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
     Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
     2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the
     nature of the chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the
     hazard communication program and training requirements appropriate for that work
     area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization
     process, controls which hazardous chemicals can be used in each work area/shop on an
     installation.
AFI90-821_30SWSUP_I 4 FEBRUARY 2010                                                            21


2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
       2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed
       infrequently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
       2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
       (AFSC) or job series.
   2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
   and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
   and controls, for the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1 OIs do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks
   and associated hazards and controls. Supervisors will ensure workers review these
   procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the gaining activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
       2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1 for workers not
       previously trained.
       2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific
       chemical hazards and associated controls.
2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses
hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in
an industrial shop) may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication
program and access to MSDSs must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR
1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM
information for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
program.
   2.10.1. (Added-30SW) The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for identifying when
   AF workers may be exposed to hazardous materials or processes used by contractor
   employees. The supervisor should then contact the appropriate VAFB quality assurance
   evaluator (QAE) to obtain appropriate MSDSs. Contact BE for assistance in evaluating
   potential AF worker exposures, if needed. BE will assist the supervisor in identifying
   whether additional worker protection or training is needed.
2.11. Forms Prescribed. Air Force Form 55 (AF55), Employee Safety and Health Record;
Air Force Form 3952 (AF3952), Chemical/Hazardous Material Request/Authorization Form

ESOH—MIS—An AF approved automated system to store and maintain all information
associated with environment, safety, and occupational health surveillance data and work
area/shop requirements.
Employee—A worker who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals under normal operating
conditions or in foreseeable emergencies. Office workers who encounter hazardous chemicals
only in non-routine, isolated instances are not covered.
Exposure—The intensity, frequency, and length of time personnel are subjected to a hazard.
Hazard Warning—Any words, pictures, symbols, or combination thereof appearing on a label
or other appropriate form of warning which convey the specific physical and health hazard(s),
including target organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the container(s).
HAZMART—As the customer service desk for the IHMP, it is the only entity on an installation
authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or
location where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs
are managed and tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation
where LRS personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have
at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander. The
HMMP team may designate additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs
performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities
include the receipt and entry of data on Government-wide Purchase Card purchases of
HAZMAT, and the receipt and entry of data on contractor usage of HAZMAT.
(30SW)HAZMART—At Vandenberg Air Force Base the HAZMART is divided between the
Environmental Support Office and the Base Supply Office.
Hazardous Chemical (HAZMAT)—Any chemical that is a physical or health hazard and
requires an MSDS as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, and all Class I
and Class II ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Also known as hazardous material or
HAZMAT.
Hazardous Material Management Process—A standard methodology used to manage and
track the procurement and use of HAZMAT to support Air Force missions, protect the safety and
health of personnel on Air Force installations and communities surrounding Air Force
installations from misuse of HAZMAT, minimize Air Force use of HAZMAT consistent with
mission needs, and to maintain Air Force compliance with environmental requirements for
HAZMAT usage. The HMMP is composed of three interdependent programs: the Installation
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Pharmacy Program (IHMP), the Weapons System Hazardous
Material (HAZMAT) Program (WSHP), and the ODS Program (ODSP).
Health Hazard—Includes materials which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents,
reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins,
agents which act on the hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or
mucous membranes
Immediate Use Materials—Any hazardous chemical that will be under the control of and used

Installation—For purposes of the Federal HAZCOM standard and this AFI, an installation is a
single geographic location with one or more work area/shops. The AF does not constitute one
installation and must have programs that address hazards at each installation. Note: 29 CFR
1910.1200 uses the term workplace instead of installation.
Label—Any written, printed, or graphic material, displayed on or affixed to containers of
hazardous chemicals.
Laboratory—A facility where relatively small quantities of hazardous materials are used on a
non-production basis. Use of hazardous materials must meet all of the following conditions: i)
chemical manipulations are carried out on a laboratory scale with all work with substances in
containers designed to be easily and safely manipulated by one person; ii) Multiple chemical
procedures or chemicals are used; iii) Procedures involved are not part of a production process,
nor in any way simulate a production process; iv) Protective laboratory practices and equipment
are available.
Laboratory Standard—OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1450, ―Occupational Exposure to Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories.‖ See AFOSH Standard 48-22, Occupational Exposure to Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories.
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)—Written or printed material concerning a hazardous
chemical that is prepared according to 29 CFR 1910.1200.
Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)—Substances that are primarily Class I or Class II ODS as
defined by the ―Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.‖
Physical Hazard—Includes materials for which there is scientifically valid evidence it is a
combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer,
pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water-reactive.
Produce—To manufacture, process, formulate, blend, extract, generate, emit, or repackage.
Responsible Party—Someone who can provide additional information on the hazardous
chemical and appropriate emergency procedures if necessary. This party is generally a
manufacturer’s representative.
Trade Secret—Any confidential formula, pattern, process, device, or information or compilation
of information that is used in an employer’s business and that gives the employer an opportunity
to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.
Use—To package, handle, react, emit, extract, generate as a by-product or transfer.
Work Area/Shop—A room or defined space in an installation where hazardous chemicals are
produced or used, and where employees are present. Note: Employees that often work outside
the physically defined work area, such as pest management personnel during pesticide
application or aircraft maintainers that take chemicals to the flightline, will have their hazards
addressed as part of the work area/shop program.
