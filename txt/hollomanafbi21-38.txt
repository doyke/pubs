This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance, and fulfills the requirements of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Aerospace
Equipment Maintenance Management, 26 July 2010, Paragraph 10.2. to develop a coordinated
wing instruction to control tools, equipment, and electronic devices from all wing agencies
dispatching to aircraft parking/runway/taxi areas or aircraft maintenance facilities. It applies to
all units assigned to the 49th Wing (49 WG) with the exception of the 49th Maintenance Group
(49 MXG) and the aircrew and life support sections of the 49th Operations Group (49 OG).
These excluded units will follow guidance in AFI 21-101, including applicable local and
MAJCOM supplements. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.myaf.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Contact supporting records managers
as required. Refer recommended changes and questions to the Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 49th Wing Foreign
Object Damage (49 WG/CVF), 490 First Street, Holloman AFB, NM 88330-8277.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The following changes
to the document have been made: References throughout this publication have been changed
from transportation to vehicle management. Paragraph 3.2.2: If the CTK/ITK is already
located on the airfield and is not used on a daily basis, it will be inspected prior to each use.

RATIONALE: To lessen man hours used inspecting CTK/ITKs that are not used on a
continuous basis. Attachment 2: Identifying code HSCEOFA – ALARM SHOP added.
RATIONALE: To correctly identify CE Alarm shop tools used on the airfield on a regular
basis.
1. Purpose. Positive control and accountability of tools, equipment and electronic devices used
on aircraft parking, runway and taxi areas is essential for the elimination of Foreign Object
Damage (FOD). FOD-related accidents cost the Air Force millions of dollars each year. The
purpose of this publication is to provide 49 WG agencies the necessary guidance to implement a
solid program to control tools and equipment taken onto the airfield. Due to the diverse nature of
49 WG agencies, one size does not fit all when it comes to tool control policy. Some units such
as Communication Squadron may have only a few items, while others, like Civil Engineering
and Logistic Readiness Squadron, have literally hundreds of pieces of equipment. To be in
compliance with this instruction, units must establish a program or demonstrate that existing
programs meet the intent of positive tool and equipment accountability and control.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. Tools: Devices/instruments used to perform maintenance and repair of Real Property
     facilities, roadways, airfields, power distribution systems, airfield lighting, aircraft barriers,
     and utility functions.
     2.2. Common Tools:        Commonly used items, such as wrenches, pliers, screwdrivers,
     hammers, sockets, etc.
     2.3. Special Tools: Tools designed to perform a specific task, not used or carried daily, such
     as utility valve keys, heavy-duty drills, saws, and special meters, etc.
     2.4. Composite Tool Kit (CTK): Tools or equipment stored in vehicles or controlled area,
     maintained on a shadow board, toolbox, or cabinet in order to maintain positive control and
     ease of inventory. Each tool or equipment item in the CTK has an assigned location; either
     inlay cut in the shape of the tool or shadowed layout.
     2.5. Individual Tool Kit (ITK): Common hand tools used everyday grouped together in a
     box, pouch, bucket or belt carried to the job site to perform assigned work. This includes
     grease guns, oil-cans, issued meters, leatherman type tools, mini-flashlights, and knives.
     2.6. Equipment: A device required to accomplish a task or carry out work, such as
     surveyors’ transit, portable generator, etc.
     2.7. Electronic Device: Portable items such as land mobile radios (LMR), cell phones, and
     laptop computers.
     2.8. Airfield: Includes all areas of the installation involved in aircraft operation such as
     taxiways, parking ramps, hardstands and the runway.
     2.9. Aircraft maintenance facilities (Hangars and industrial areas only).
3. Responsibilities
     3.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring an effective program is in place and
     compliance with this instruction for those sections that perform duties on the airfield or in
     aircraft maintenance facilities. Commanders must also ensure that contractors who work on
HOLLOMANAFBI21-38 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               3


   the airfield or on aircraft maintenance facilities understand the importance of tool control in
   these areas.
   3.2. Flight Chiefs/Section NCOICs (or equivalent) determine what tools, equipment and
   electronic devices fall under the scope of this instruction and will:
       3.2.1. Develop a system of inventory and control for all items brought out to the airfield
       or maintenance facilities to ensure they are returned to the section upon the completion of
       the job.
       3.2.2. CTKs and ITKs will be inventoried either at the start of the shift or before entering
       airfield environment. (added) If the CTK/ITK is already located on the airfield
       (continuously stored in a locked shelter) and is not used on a daily basis, it will be
       inspected prior to each use.
   3.2.3. All Tools will be marked and readily identifiable by squadron and shop or by CTK
   identifiers. (See attachment 2 for listing of identifying codes).
3.3. Lost or missing tool/equipment items within FOD critical areas need to be reported to the
work center custodian or supervisor immediately. Extreme measures should be taken with
locating missing item/s. If missing item/s are not located within two (2) hours, the supervisor
will contact the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) office at ext.2-3342 and MXG Quality
Assurance (QA) office at ext. 2-3148 immediately for instructions on further actions. CAF Form
145 will be completed by individual and given to the 49WG FOD Prevention NCO to be filed.
4. The following products are readily available on the Air Force publishing site:
   4.1. CAF Form 145, Lost Tool/Object Report (AF Publishing site). This report is
   mandatory to be completed anytime a tool is lost on the airfield. If this situation arises,
   immediately contact 49 MXG MOC.
   4.2. CAF Form 140 (Air Force publishing site), Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK) Inventory and
   Control Log, may be used to sign tool kits or other equipment out and to document return.
