                                             Chapter 1

                                     PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview.
     1.1.1. This instruction establishes Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Program (AFCDTP)
     objectives, policies, procedures, and implementing guidelines. The AFCDTP is designed to
     achieve a drug-free workplace, consistent with EO 12564 and 5 U.S.C. §7301.
     1.1.2. This instruction includes guidance and procedures for providing assistance to
     employees with suspected or identified drug abuse problems, employee education and
     training, and the identification of illicit drug use through drug testing in conjunction with AFI
     90-507, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program and AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug
     Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program.
1.2. Air Force Policy Regarding Illicit Drug Use by Civilian Personnel.
     1.2.1. The Air Force, as a result of its national defense responsibilities, and the sensitive
     nature of its work, has a compelling obligation to eliminate illicit drug use from its
     workforce. Civilian employees of the Air Force must refrain from illicit drug use whether on
     or off-duty. Performing duties under the influence of illicit drugs adversely affects personal
     safety, risks damage to government property, significantly impairs day-to-day operations,
     and exposes sensitive information to potential compromise. Use of illicit drugs is
     inconsistent with the high standards of performance, discipline, and readiness necessary to
     accomplish the Air Force mission.
        1.2.1.1. This policy is based on the Federal criminal statutes on controlled substances
        and is not affected by any State laws legalizing use of marijuana or other controlled
        substance.
     1.2.2. The Air Force is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful
     accomplishment of the mission, and the need to maintain high employee productivity. The
     intent of the Air Force is to offer assistance to those civilian employees who need it, while
     sending a clear message that illicit drug use is incompatible with Federal service.
     1.2.3. The performance of every Federal civilian employee must, at all times, support the Air

   Air Force may have a urine specimen tested for any drug listed in Schedule I or II of the
   Controlled Substance Act. Decisions regarding testing for use of Schedule I or II controlled
   substances shall be made based on adequate evidence by the employee’s second level
   supervisor, after consultation with the servicing Installation Staff Judge Advocate and
   CPO/HRO. (T-3)
   3.1.3. Types of Drug Testing (T-1)
       3.1.3.1. Tentative Selectee Testing (T-1)
       3.1.3.2. Includes all external applicants tentatively selected for assignment to TDP
       covered positions and current employees in a non-TDP tentatively selected for a TDP.
       For tentative selectees located within reasonable travel distance of the employing activity,
       a urine specimen for drug testing must be collected within 48 hours after the applicant
       accepts a tentative offer of employment and prior to actual appointment. (T-1) Tentative
       selectees currently in a TDP within the Federal or military services will not be required to
       take a drug test prior to moving to a new TDP. (T-1)
   3.1.4. Vacancy announcements must contain a statement informing applicants that drug
   testing is a condition of employment. (T-1) If vacancy announcements are not used, tentative
   selectees must be informed prior to finalizing the selection, and a written record of the
   notification must be maintained by the CPS/HRO and/or supervisor. (T-1) In addition, each
   tentative selectee will be notified that appointment to the position will be contingent upon the
   receipt of notification that the specimen did not reveal evidence of illicit drug use. (T-1)
   3.1.5. The Air Force will decline to extend a final offer of employment to any tentative
   selectee with a MRO verified/validated positive test result for illicit drugs and action may be
   initiated to bar such person from future employment with the agency under procedures
   specified in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Regulations. (T-1) Air Force
   objections to preference eligibles that are based on the results of a MRO verified/validated
   positive pre-employment drug screen are considered medical disqualifications or passovers.
   These objections are referred to OPM for adjudication. They SHOULD NOT be processed
   as suitability cases. (T-1) The CPS/HRO will notify the applicant that the employment is
   denied on the basis of failure to pass the drug testing requirement. (T-1) For those APF
   employees tested after appointment, procedures in AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse
   Actions or AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance Program as appropriate, must
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     21

     illicit drug without legitimate reason will immediately be temporarily reassigned and
     denied access to classified information. (T-0) The employee must be removed from the
     TDP. (T-0) However, following consultation with the Installation Staff Judge Advocate
     and CPS/HRO, the squadron commander equivalent or higher may, in his/her discretion,
     and as part of an employee rehabilitation program, allow an employee to return to duty in
     a sensitive position if the employee's return would not endanger public health or safety or
     national security. (T-0)
22                                                              AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


     3.1.8.3. The Air Force will randomly test civilian employees at a minimum rate
     consistent with guidelines established by ASD (HA). (T-0) AFMOA/SGHW will review
     drug testing utilization through reports generated from the drug testing laboratory. (T-0)
     3.1.8.4. Frequency of testing will be no less than two days per month. (T-1) Selection of
     test days will be randomized through use of the Air Force Drug Testing Program
     Software (AFDTPS). (T-1) The button must be pushed at least 8 times a month. (T-3)
     Exemptions from the use of this software must be approved by AFMOA/SGB. (T-1)
     Frequency of random drug testing must conform to levels established by the DoD and AF
     and must be based on a percentage of the TDPs end strength. (T-0) Installations with less
     than 24 TDPs may test less than two days per month as long as randomization and 50
     percent Fiscal Year (FY) requirement is met. (T-0)
     3.1.8.5. The DDRPM and DTPAM will ensure that the names selected under random
     selection, as well as the times and date(s) of the testing, are closely guarded to ensure
     confidentiality until the actual testing date(s). (T-1) Specimen collection is to be
     conducted on the day of selection. (T-1)
     3.1.8.6. The DDRPM or DTPAM will notify the employee’s commander/ directorate
     head or designated representative (trusted agent), who in turn will notify the employee’s
     immediate supervisor. (T-3) The supervisor will notify the employee in writing of the
     requirement to provide a urine specimen. (T-3) A sample notification letter is provided at
     Attachment 7.
     3.1.8.7. The supervisor will notify the employee of the requirement to provide a urine
     specimen within two hours of the time of notification. (T-3) Notification shall occur on
     the same day the test is scheduled, no earlier than one hour prior to the scheduled starting
     collection time. (T-3) The supervisor will explain to the employee that the employee’s
     name was selected randomly for urinalysis testing. (T-3)
     3.1.8.8. If the individual(s) selected for testing is/are not available, the lowest level
     supervisor available annotates a copy of the notification letter with an indication of the
     individual(s)’s status (leave, TDY, non-duty day) and forwards the status and return to
     duty date back to the DDRPM/DTPAM. (T-3) The DDRPM/DTPAM may require the
     notification letter be forwarded to the second level or higher supervisor to verify the
     individual(s)’s status. The appropriate supervisor returns a copy of the notification letter
     to the DDRPM or DTPAM with annotations indicating the individual(s) is in leave status,
     TDY, or non-duty day. (T-3) The DDRPM or DTPAM enters the employee’s return date
     in the random drug testing software program and sends another selection notification on
     the first scheduled testing day after the employee returns to duty. (T-3)
     3.1.8.9. Occasionally, selection and notification for collection of a urine specimen comes
     at a time when an employee is engaged in a mission critical task. Commanders and
     directorate heads may defer notification of selection until selected employees are no
     longer engaged in mission critical functions. For employees who are improperly
     deferred, the DDRPM/DTPAM should report the inappropriate deferral to the
     commander of the individual who made the improper deferment for appropriate action.

     above. (T-3)
         3.1.8.11.1. The DDRPM/DTPAM, after consulting with the CPO/HRO, will
         establish procedures (when necessary) for the testing of geographically-separated
         employees to include coordination as necessary with the DDRPM/DTPAM at another
         location to arrange for testing of employees who work at off-site duty locations. (T-3)
  3.1.9. Reasonable Suspicion Testing (T-1)
     3.1.9.1. Reasonable suspicion is a specific and fact-based belief that an employee has
     engaged in illicit drug use, and that evidence of illicit drug use is presently in the
     employee’s body, drawn from specific and particularized facts, and reasonable inferences
     from those facts. Employees, regardless of whether they are in TDP positions, may be
     tested based on a reasonable suspicion of illicit drug use on or off duty. If an employee is
     suspected of illicit drug use or in possession of drug paraphernalia, the appropriate
     supervisor will gather all information, facts, and circumstances leading to, and supporting
     this suspicion, then refer the employee to the DDRP office for testing. (T-1) Reasonable
     suspicion may be based on, but is not limited to, the following criteria: (T-1)
         3.1.9.1.1. Direct observation of illicit drug use or possession and/or physical
         symptoms of being under the influence of a controlled substance. Physical symptoms
         are based on the behavior, speech, appearance, and body odors of the employee. (T-1)
         3.1.9.1.2. A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior consistent with the use
         of illicit drugs where no other rational explanation or reason for the conduct is readily
         apparent. (T-1)
         3.1.9.1.3. Evidence of drug-related impairment supported by hearsay from identified
         or unidentified sources supported by corroboration from a manager or supervisor with
         training and experience in the evaluation of drug-induced job impairment. (T-1)
         3.1.9.1.4. Recent arrest or conviction for a drug-related offense, or the identification
         of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illicit drug possession,
         use or trafficking. (T-1)
         3.1.9.1.5. Information of illicit drug use provided either by reliable and credible
         sources or independently corroborated. (T-1)
 24                                                                 AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


           3.1.9.1.6. Evidence the employee has tampered with or avoided a recent or current
           drug test.
(T-1)
        3.1.9.2. A supervisor in the employee’s chain makes the determination, after
        coordination with the Installation Staff Judge Advocate, as to whether reasonable
        suspicion exists in any given case. (T-1) The supervisor will prepare a written
        memorandum in a timely manner to include, at a minimum, the appropriate dates and
        times of reported drug-related incidents, the reliable/credible sources of information
        considered (i.e., the rationale leading to the test). (T-1) The supervisor’s determination
        that a reasonable suspicion urinalysis is warranted must be coordinated with a higher
        level supervisor within the functional chain of supervision, the CPS/HRO, and an
        attorney from the servicing Installation Staff Judge Advocate office. (T-1) Once
        complete, the written memorandum supporting the reasonable suspicion urinalysis will be
        maintained by the DDRP office for at least two years. (T-1)
        3.1.9.3. The supervisor will notify the employee in writing of the requirement to provide
        a urine specimen (under direct observation). (T-3) The notice to the employee should
        specify that the basis for the test is reasonable suspicion of illicit drug use. (T-3) Include
        the requirement to provide the urine specimen under direct observation. (T-3) A sample
        notification letter is provided at Attachment 6.
        3.1.9.4. In the event the reasonable suspicion is for a drug not on the panel of substances
        routinely tested for: (T-1)
           3.1.9.4.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM will notify MRO of the reasonable suspicion test.
           (T-1) If after hours or time sensitive, the specimen can be collected and then contact
           with MRO made at the first opportunity. (T-1)
           3.1.9.4.2. The MRO will contact the AF Drug Testing Program Manager, who will
           contact the DDRPM or DTPAM to review the case. (T-1) The AF Drug Testing
           Program Manager will assist the DDRPM or DTPAM in locating a HHS-certified
           laboratory capable of testing for the suspected drug. (T-1)
           3.1.9.4.3. The DDRPM or DTPAM will coordinate with the identified laboratory on
           shipping and payment procedures. (T-2) Payment is the responsibility of the
           requesting unit. (T-2)
           3.1.9.4.4. DDRPM or DTPAM will submit copies of all documentation to the AF
           Drug Testing Program Manager. (T-2) AF Drug Testing Program Manager will
           forward appropriate documentation to HHS for future laboratory inspections. (T-2)
           3.1.9.4.5. For all mishaps defined as Class A, B, or nuclear by AFI 91-204, Safety
           Investigations and Reports, employees will be subject to testing for evidence of illicit
           drug use if the employee’s/member’s supervisor reasonably concludes an employee’s
           conduct may have caused or contributed to the mishap. (T-1) Supervisors should
           consult organizational medical, legal, and safety experts in making this determination.
           (T-1)
           3.1.9.4.6. A supervisor in the employee’s chain of command will gather all
           information, facts, and circumstances leading to and supporting this determination,
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                     25


         then refer the employee to the DDRP office for testing. (T-1) The appropriate
         supervisor will promptly detail for the record how the circumstances meet the criteria
         warranting testing. (T-1) A written memorandum will be prepared to include, at a
         minimum, the appropriate dates and times of the mishap, mishap classification, and
         the reliable/credible sources of information, leading to the conclusion that the
         employee’s conduct may have caused or contributed to the mishap. (T-1) This
         determination will be coordinated with a higher level supervisor in the functional
         chain of supervision, the CPS/HRO, and an attorney from the Labor/Law SJA's
         office. (T-1) The supervisor and collection site personnel will coordinate urine
         specimen collection with appropriate Safety personnel. (T-2) The supervisor will
         notify the employee in writing of the requirement to provide a urine specimen. (T-2)
         The notice to the employee should specify that it is a safety/mishap-related drug test.
         (T-1) A sample notification is provide in attachment 5.
  3.1.10. Voluntary Testing (T-3)
     3.1.10.1. Employees not in TDP may volunteer for unannounced random testing by
     notifying the HRR. The HRR must, in-turn, notify the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-3)
     3.1.10.2. Volunteers will be included in the pool of TDP subject to random testing and
     be subject to the same conditions and procedures as outlined in this AFI. (T-3)
     3.1.10.3. An employee who volunteers for the random testing program will remain in the
     TDP pool until the employee withdraws from participation by notifying the HRR. (T-3)
     Volunteers will remain in the TDP pool for the duration of the position which the
     employee holds, or until the employee withdraws from participation by notifying the
     program liaison (PL) of such intent at least 48 hours prior to being scheduled for a
     random test. (T-3)
  3.1.11. Rehabilitation (Follow-up) Testing (T-3)
     3.1.11.1. All employees referred for counseling or treatment for illicit drug use will be
     subject to unannounced testing for a minimum of one year from the time of initiated
     rehabilitation services. (T-3)
     3.1.11.2. Frequency and duration of testing will be determined by the Civilian
     Rehabilitation Team or as stipulated in an abeyance (last chance) agreement. (T-3)
  3.1.12. Consent Testing (T-3)
     3.1.12.1. After consultation with the Installation Staff Judge Advocate, a supervisor may
     ask any civilian employee to consent to provide a urine specimen for drug testing at any
     time. (T-3) The consent must be knowing and voluntary. (T-3) An employee who
     consents to providing a urine specimen whose specimen tests positive for an illicit drug
     without a legitimate medical reason is not exempt from disciplinary actions as defined in
     the Safe Haven Provision. (T-3)
     3.1.12.2. Whether collection of the specimen will be by direct observation will depend
     upon consent of the employee. (T-3) A sample consent letter for obtaining a consent
     urinalysis is provided in Attachment 15. (T-3)
     3.1.12.3. Consent testing must be annotated on the chain of custody form in step 1 under
     "Other." (T-3)
 26                                                               AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


3.2. Designation of Testing Designated Positions (TDP).
   3.2.1. Attachment 2 lists testing designated positions subject to random drug testing. These
   positions involve work that impacts national security, public health and safety, protection of
   life and property, or otherwise require a high degree of trust and confidence. (T-1)
   3.2.2. The Air Force Reserves the right to add and/or delete categories and types of positions
   in Attachment 2 based on applicable law and policy. (T-1)
3.3. Notice to Current Employees.

   TDP. (T-3) This notice is normally provided upon the selection or entrance on duty. For
   those employees who do not have a notice on file, one must be provided. (T-3) An employee
   whose position is newly designated as a TDP, or who moves from a non-TDP to a TDP, must
   be provided the appropriate notice specifically identifying the position to which he/she is
   being assigned. (T-3) For employees transferring from one TDP to another TDP, the HRR
   shall ensure notice is maintained on file and re-issue notice if it cannot be located. (T-3)
   3.3.2. The CPS/HRO must ensure a specific written notice is given to each employee in a
   TDP no later than 30 days before an installation’s drug testing program commences. (T-0)
   Employees who have an appropriate notification on file for the position they occupy need not
   be provided additional notification upon implementation of this plan since the 30-day
   advance notice period requirement has been satisfied. Random testing may continue without
   interruption. A sample acknowledgment for CPS/HRO use is provided in Attachment 8. (T-
   0)
   3.3.3. Employees who are currently not subject to testing and are tentatively identified for
   placement in a TDP will be provided written notice before the action to place the employee
   into the TDP is finalized (T-3) (See sample at Attachment 8). The employee will not be
   subject to random testing for 30 days from the date the notice of testing was acknowledged.
   (T-3)
   3.3.4. Vacancy announcements, if used for internal placements, must include a statement
   informing employees that drug testing is a requirement of the position being filled. (T-3) If a
   vacancy announcement is not used, candidates must be informed of the testing requirement
   prior to management making a final placement determination. (T-3) Failure to include this
   statement in the vacancy announcement will not preclude internal applicant testing, if
   advanced written notification is provided to the applicant. (T-3)
      3.3.4.1. To receive further consideration for the position, the employee must sign the
      notice and agree to submit to urinalysis testing (See sample at Attachment 8). (T-3)
      3.3.4.2. If after receipt of the notice, the employee refuses to provide a urine specimen as
      requested, or if illicit drugs are detected through a verified/validated positive test result,
      he/she will be denied further consideration for the position. (T-3) Current employees of
      the agency may be subject to disciplinary action, including removal, if warranted by the
      facts of the situation. (T-3)
   3.3.5. Contents of Notices: Written notification to employees informing them that a position
   is designated for random testing will include: (T-3)
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                         27


      3.3.5.1. Notice that the employee’s position, or one into which the employee is

   3.3.6. For those employees newly subject to random drug testing, notice that the employee
   will have the opportunity to voluntarily identify himself/herself as a user of illicit drugs and
   to receive counseling or treatment during the 30-day notice period under the safe haven
   provisions in Paragraph 1.28, and that the employee will be subject to random testing no
   earlier than 30 days following acknowledgment of new position designation as TDP. (T-3)
   3.3.7. Each employee in a TDP will acknowledge in writing that he/she has received and
   read the notice which states the employee's position has been designated for random drug
   testing and that refusal to submit to testing may result in disciplinary action, up to, and
   including removal. (T-3)
   3.3.8. Written employee notifications with signed statements acknowledging receipt by the
   employee will be forwarded by the HRR to AFPC for retention in the OPF. (T-3)
   3.3.9. If the employee refuses to sign the acknowledgment, the employee’s supervisor and
   additional witness will document on the acknowledgment form that the employee received
   the notice and refused to sign. (T-3) The notification will be forwarded by the HRR to AFPC
   for retention in the OPF. (T-3) A copy may also be maintained in the Supervisor’s Employee
   Work Folder. An employee's failure to sign the notice will not preclude testing that
   employee, or otherwise affect the implementation or execution of this program. (T-3)
3.4. Technical Guidelines for Drug Testing.
   3.4.1. The Air Force will adhere to scientific and technical guidelines for drug testing
   programs outlined by HHS consistent with the authority granted by EO 12564, and the
   requirements of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. (T-0)
   3.4.2. Air Force collection personnel will be trained in rigorous analytical standards, quality
   assurance requirements, and strict confidentiality requirements for urinalysis procedures. (T-
   3)
   3.4.3. All civilian specimens will be tested at an approved HHS-certified laboratory. (T-0)
   3.4.4. Unless covered by exception below, any individual subject to testing under this
   program will be permitted to provide urine specimens in private, in a rest room stall or
   similar enclosure, so that the employee is not directly observed while providing the sample.
   (T-1)
   3.4.5. Same-gendered collection site personnel (DDRPM or DTPAM or other trained
   observer) will observe the individual providing the urine specimen when collection site
   personnel have reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the
   specimen to be provided when the individual is being tested due to reasonable suspicion
   testing; accident or safety mishap testing; rehabilitation testing following a laboratory
   verified/validated result; the facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is an illicit
28                                                               AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


  drug user; facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is under the influence of drugs
  at the time of the test; the individual has previously been found by the agency to be an illicit
  drug user; facts and circumstances suggest that the individual has equipment or implements
  capable of tampering with or altering urine samples; the individual has previously tampered
  with a sample; or, the temperature of the urine specimen is outside the acceptable range as
  established by HHS. (T-0)
  3.4.6. The DDRPM or DTPAM.
     3.4.6.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM performs essential steps in conducting a urine
     specimen collection for drug testing as established in the HHS Mandatory Guidelines. (T-
     1)
     3.4.6.2. A specimen collector is an AF representative who instructs and assists
     individuals at a collection site and who receives and makes an initial examination of the
     urine specimen provided by those individuals. (T-3)
     3.4.6.3. DDRPMs and DTPAMs must meet the same job qualification requirements as
     delineated in AFI 90-507, Military Drug Demand Reduction Program. (T-1) DDRPMs
     and DTPAMs will have received training in collecting urine specimens IAW the HHS
     Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs. (T-1)
     3.4.6.4. In the interest of integrity, a donor cannot perform the functions of the DTPAM
     regarding his or her own urine specimen. (T-3) The supervisor of a donor cannot perform
     the functions of the DTPAM unless there is no feasible alternative, as determined by the
     commander, in consultation with the SJA. (T-3) The roles of the DTPAM and observer
     will be conducted in a way as to maximize integrity of the collection process. (T-3)
     3.4.6.5. When a collection must be performed under direct observation, the observer
     must be the same gender as the donor. (T-3) There is no exception to this requirement.
     (T-3)
         3.4.6.5.1. DDRP staff will ensure that the escort and/or observer receive the
         observer/escort briefing prior to testing. (T-3) See Attachments 9 and 10 for
         observer and escort briefings, respectively.
  3.4.7. The Collection Site.
     3.4.7.1. A collection site may be a permanent or temporary facility located either at the
     work site or at a remote site. The term collection site refers to the entire facility used to
     collect the urine specimen, that is, the rest room or toilet stall and the work area used by
     the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-1)
     3.4.7.2. A collection site must at a minimum: (T-0)
         3.4.7.2.1. Allow the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen. (T-0)
         3.4.7.2.2. Have a source of water or for washing hands with water only located
         outside of the immediate area (e.g., stall) used by employees to produce urine
         specimens. (T-0) The donor shall be instructed to wash with water only and to dry
         his/her hands prior to each urination attempt. (T-0)
         3.4.7.2.3. Have a work area for the DDRPM or DTPAM suitable to the needs of the
         operation that ensures specimen integrity is held intact. (T-0)
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                         29


        3.4.7.2.4. Allow the DDRPM or DTPAM to restrict access to the site during the
        collection. (T-1)
     3.4.7.3. Any of the following could be used to collect urine specimens provided the area
     can be arranged to satisfy the minimum requirements listed above: (T-3)
        3.4.7.3.1. All types of restrooms (e.g., male or female, employee, doctor’s office,
        hospital, and clinic). (T-3)
        3.4.7.3.2. Mobile facility (e.g., a vehicle with an enclosed toilet). (T-3)
     3.4.7.4. The DDRPM or DTPAM’s work area should be located outside the restroom.
     (T-3)
     3.4.7.5. To ensure security at a collection site while collections are being conducted, the
     following measures must be taken: (T-0)
        3.4.7.5.1. Restrict access to only authorized personnel. (T-0)
        3.4.7.5.2. Restrict access to collection materials/supplies. (T-0)
        3.4.7.5.3. Prohibit unobserved entrance/exit to/from the site. (T-0)
        3.4.7.5.4. Provide for secure handling/storage of specimens from collection until
        shipment. (T-0) Security and specimen handling procedures may vary significantly
        depending on whether the collection site is at a permanent or temporary location.
        When the collection site is a permanent facility that is used primarily for collections,
        all materials and supplies are readily available and there will normally be cabinets,
        lockers, or refrigerators that can be used to secure specimens prior to shipment to the
        laboratory. (T-0) Additionally, all records are maintained at the permanent site with
        appropriate copies of documents being sent to the laboratory, Air Force offices with
        appropriate need to know, and MRO. (T-0) For temporary or remote collection sites,
        all supplies are brought to the site and then the site is returned to its original condition
        and normal use. In these cases, the DDRPM or DTPAM will normally transport the
        records and specimens to another location (i.e., unless the specimens are shipped to
        the laboratory directly from the temporary collection site). This other location will
        then be used to store records, prepare specimens for shipment to the laboratory (if
        applicable), and distribute documents as required. (T-0) With the transfer of records
        and specimens, which may occur when a temporary site is used, a primary concern
        for the DDRPM or DTPAM is to ensure that chain of custody is maintained for the
        specimens. (T-0)
     3.4.7.6. In final preparation of the site, any water supply available in the collection site
     must be controlled to prevent the donor from attempting to dilute the specimen. (T-0)
     This includes any water supply in an immediately adjacent area to which the donor may
     have access prior to handing the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-0) A bluing
     agent must be added to the tank or toilet bowl that is accessible to the donor. (T-0) The
     restroom needs to be inspected by a DDR staff member or escort before and after each
     collection for drug paraphernalia. (T-0) The staff or escort will inspect the toilet bowl
     after each collection to validate bluing agent is intact, then flush it and re-blue water for
     the next collection. (T-0) The following are acceptable ways to control access to a water
     supply: (T-0)
30                                                               AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


         3.4.7.6.1. Use tape to prevent opening/turning faucet handles. (T-0)
         3.4.7.6.2. Close the shutoff valve for the water supply. (T-0) If access to a water
         supply in the rest room cannot be controlled, the DDRPM or DTPAM may tell the
         donor that he or she will be listening at the entrance to the rest room for any sounds
         associated with the donor attempting to use the available sources of water.
         Alternatively, the DDRPM or DTPAM may enter the rest room with the donor if the
         DDRPM or DTPAM is the same gender as the donor, but remains outside the toilet
         stall. (T-0)
  3.4.8. Collection Supplies.
     3.4.8.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM must ensure that the following supplies are available to
     conduct proper collections: (T-0) (All Section 1.11 is T-0)
         3.4.8.1.1. Clean (single-use) wrapped or sealed, specimen bottles with appropriate
         caps/lids. (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.2. Clean (single-use) wrapped or sealed, collection containers for each donor
         to urinate into. (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.3. Temperature strips that can be attached to the exterior surface of collection
         containers or specimen bottles to measure the temperature within four minutes after
         void. The temperature strips must be capable of temperature readings between 90-
         100 F (32-38 C). (T-0) If the temperature strip does not appear to be working
         properly, the DDRPM or DTPAM must take the specimen temperature with a
         temperature measuring device that has a sterile sleeve or other methodology to
         prevent contamination of the specimen. (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.4. Appropriate temperature measuring device that can be used to measure a
         donor’s body temperature if the temperature of the specimen is outside of the range
         listed in the Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs
         (32-38C/90-100 F). (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.5. Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms (CCF). (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.6. Tamper-evident labels/seals for the specimen bottles that have the same
         preprinted specimen ID number that appears on the CCF. (T-0) The appropriate
         labels/seals are provided with each CCF. The tamper-evident seal also serves as a
         label; therefore, it will be referred to either as the tamper-evident label/seal or as the
         label/seal. (T-0)
         3.4.8.1.7. Separate supply of tamper-evident seals. (T-0) Tamper-evident tape used
         for military testing is acceptable. Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal
         provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of
         environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature and specimen bottle material).
         When this occurs, the DDRPM or DTPAM should have a separate tamper-evident
         seal that can be used to seal the specimen bottle. (T-0) If after two attempts, the
         tamper-evident label/seal provided will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle
         because of environmental conditions then the sample will be disregarded and another
         opportunity to provide a sample will be scheduled. (T-0)

        3.4.8.1.8. Leak-proof plastic bags in which sealed specimen bottles are placed prior
        to shipment to the laboratory. (T-0)
        3.4.8.1.9. Absorbent material that is placed inside the leak-proof plastic bag in case
        the specimen bottle leaks during shipment. (T-0)
        3.4.8.1.10. Shipping containers/mailers that can be labeled for transporting
        specimens to the laboratory and that can be securely sealed to eliminate the
        possibility of undetected tampering. (T-0) The above items are supplied, as collection
        kits (i.e. each collection kit contains the items needed to collect a specimen from a
        donor and send it to a laboratory for testing).
        3.4.8.1.11. Bluing agent to add to water in the toilet bowl or tank to discourage
        adulteration or dilution of the specimen. (T-0)
        3.4.8.1.12. DDRPM or DTPAM should have appropriate ID. (T-0) The DDRPM or
        DTPAM is required to provide his or her ID if requested by the donor. (T-0) The
        DDRPM or DTPAM is not required to provide any certification or other
        documentation to the donor proving the DTPAM’s training in the collection process.
        3.4.8.1.13. Storage box, area, or place where specimens can be stored before
        shipment to the laboratory. (T-0) If a specimen is not immediately prepared for
        shipment after collection, chain of custody must be maintained by placing the
        specimen in a secured temporary location (e.g., inside a storage area that is always
        maintained within the line of sight of the DDRPM or DTPAM to ensure that no one
        has access to the specimen). (T-0)
        3.4.8.1.14. HHS requires the DDRPM or DTPAM wear single-use disposable gloves
        while handling specimens. (T-0) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
        (OSHA) published specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who may
        be exposed to potentially infectious body fluids (29 Code of Federal Regulations
        (CFR) Part 1910.1030). (T-0)
  3.4.9. Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF).
     3.4.9.1. All urine specimens must be collected while maintaining chain of custody. (T-0)
     Chain of custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling of
     a specimen from the time a donor provides the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM until
     the results are reported by the designated drug testing laboratory. (T-0)
     3.4.9.2. For all specimens collected, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
     approved CCF, must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection
     site. (T-0)
     3.4.9.3. The CCF consists of the following five copies. (T-0)
        3.4.9.3.1. Copy 1. Original. Must accompany specimen to the laboratory.
        3.4.9.3.2. Copy 2. MRO copy.

         3.4.9.3.5. Copy 5. Donor copy.
     3.4.9.4. The reverse side of Copy 5 and Attachment 3 of this instruction provide
     guidance on completing the CCF. (T-1)
  3.4.10. Donor Identification (ID).
     3.4.10.1. The donor must be positively identified as the individual selected for testing.
     Acceptable methods of ID are: (T-0)
         3.4.10.1.1. State or Federal government-produced official photo ID (e.g., driver’s
         license or ID card, etc.); or
         3.4.10.1.2. Positive ID by a supervisor.
     3.4.10.2. The following are not acceptable ways to identify the donor: (T-0, DHHS
     Specimen Collection Handbook)
         3.4.10.2.1. ID by a co-worker or another donor.
         3.4.10.2.2. Single non-photo ID card (e.g., social security card, credit card, union or
         other membership cards, pay vouchers, voter registration card).
  3.4.11. Collection Steps.
     3.4.11.1. The following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the
     Mandatory Guidelines as established by HHS. Errors or omissions in some of the steps
     may result in a specimen being unacceptable for testing at the laboratory, or the results
     being declared invalid, upon review by the MRO. (T-0)
         3.4.11.1.1. After preparing the collection site and when the donor arrives, the
         collector verifies the donors I.D. and begins the collection process without delay. (T-
         0) Do not wait because the donor states that he or she is not ready or is unable
         to urinate. (T-0) If the donor states that he or she is unable to provide a urine
         specimen, continue with the collection procedure. (T-0) Ensure the required
         information is provided in Step 1 of the CCF. This includes: (T-0)
             3.4.11.1.1.1. Submitting of unit’s name, address, and ID number (if applicable).
             3.4.11.1.1.2. MRO’s name and address.
             3.4.11.1.1.3. Donor’s social security number (SSN) or specimen ID number (if
             the individual refuses to provide the SSN). When using SSNs and sending the
             CCF to the MRO via email, ensure the email is encrypted and only use the last 4
             digits of the SSN, with Xs filling in the first 5 digits. (T-0)
             3.4.11.1.1.4. Reason for test (i.e., random, reasonable suspicion, etc.).
             3.4.11.1.1.5. Tests to be performed (i.e., drugs for which the specimen will be
             tested). When conducting reasonable suspicion, post-accident, or unsafe practice
             testing, the Air Force agency may have a urine specimen tested for any drug listed
             in Schedule I or II of the Controlled Substances Act. (T-0) See paragraph 1.5.1.
             for more information.

            3.4.11.1.1.8. Collector’s fax number.
     3.4.11.2. The DDRPM or DTPAM asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer
     clothing such as a coat or jacket that might conceal items or substances that could be used
     to tamper with or adulterate the donor’s urine specimen. (T-0) The DDRPM or DTPAM
     shall ensure that all personal belongings such as a purse or briefcase remain with the
     outer garments in a secured location. The donor may retain his or her wallet. (T-0) The
     DDRPM or DTPAM directs the donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items
     to ensure that no items are present that could be used to adulterate the specimen. (T-0) If
     nothing is there that can be used to adulterate the specimen, the donor places the items
     back into the pockets and the collection procedure continues. (T-0) If the donor refuses
     to show the DDRPM or DTPAM the items in his or her pockets, this is considered a
     refusal to test. If an item is found that appears to be brought to the collection site with the
     intent to adulterate the specimen, a direct observation procedure shall be used. (T-0) If
     the item appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site, the DDRPM or
     DTPAM shall secure the item and continue with the normal collection procedure. (T-0)
     3.4.11.3. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort instructs the donor to wash (with water only)
     and dry his or her hands, preferably under the DTPAM’s or escort’s observation. (T-0)
     The donor should not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could
     be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen. (T-0)
     3.4.11.4. The DDRPM or DTPAM gives the donor the collection container or specimen
     bottle. (T-0) If the container or specimen bottle is wrapped/sealed, either the DDRPM or
     DTPAM may unwrap or break the seal in the donor’s presence or the donor may unwrap
     or break the seal in the DDRPM or DTPAM’s presence. (T-0)
     3.4.11.5. The specimen collection container should be unwrapped at this time. (T-0) The
     specimen bottles should be unwrapped in the donor’s presence when the donor gives the
     specimen in the collection container to the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-0)
        3.4.11.5.1. If the collection container and specimen bottle are wrapped and/ or sealed
        together, only the collection container and/or specimen bottle should be taken into the
        restroom. (T-0)
     3.4.11.6. The donor takes the collection container and/or specimen bottle into the
     restroom, toilet stall, or partitioned area to provide the specimen in private. (T-0) The
     DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort instructs the donor not to flush the toilet or to use any
     source of water that could not be secured. (T-0)
     3.4.11.7. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort should remind the donor to leave the
     restroom, toilet stall, or partitioned area as quickly as possible after the donor has voided
     into the collection container/specimen bottle. (T-0)
     3.4.11.8. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or escort is required to read the temperature of the
     specimen immediately or NLT 4 minutes after the specimen is provided to determine if it
     is in the acceptable range. (T-0) The donor must minimize the time between voiding into
     the collection container/specimen bottle and leaving the restroom, toilet stall, or
     partitioned area. (T-0)
34                                                             AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


     3.4.11.9. The donor gives the specimen to the DDRPM or DTPAM immediately upon
     leaving the restroom, toilet stall or partitioned area. (T-0) The DDRPM or DTPAM will
     ensure the bottle is closed. (T-0) The DDRPM, DTPAM, escort, and donor will maintain
     visual contact of the specimen until the seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid by
     the DDRPM and/or DTPAM. (T-0)
     3.4.11.10. The DDRPM or DTPAM performs the following checks: (T-0)
        3.4.11.10.1. Checks the specimen’s color and look for any signs of contaminants. (T-
        0) Any unusual findings shall be noted on the CCF. (T-0)
        3.4.11.10.2. Checks the specimen volume to ensure there is at least 45 mL in the
        collection container, checks the temperature to ensure that it is within the acceptable
        range, and inspects the specimen for adulteration or substitution. (T-0) (Later this
        will be separated into 2 bottles, the first with 30 mL and the second with 15 mL).
            3.4.11.10.2.1. If the volume is less than 45 mL in the collection container and the
            temperature is within the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a
            second specimen is collected using a new kit. (T-0)
            3.4.11.10.2.2. If the volume is less than 45 mL in the collection container and the
            temperature is outside the acceptable range, the sample circumstances will be
            annotated in the remarks on the collection form, and the specimen forwarded to
            the lab for testing and a second specimen is collected under direct observation
            using a new kit. (T-0) A donor may volunteer to have his or her oral temperature
            taken by appropriate medical personnel to provide evidence to counter the reason
            to believe the donor may have altered or substituted the specimen caused by the
            specimen’s temperature falling outside the prescribed range.
            3.4.11.10.2.3. If the temperature is not within the acceptable range (i.e., 32-38
            C/90-100 F), another specimen is collected under direct observation and both
            specimens will be forwarded to the laboratory for testing. (T-0) A donor may
            volunteer to have his or her oral temperature taken to provide evidence to counter
            the reason to believe the donor may have altered or substituted the specimen
            caused by the specimen’s temperature falling outside the prescribed range. The
            DDRPM or DTPAM will use a new CCF for the second specimen and will use
            new specimen containers and bottles. (T-0)
            3.4.11.10.2.4. In either case when another specimen is to be collected, HHS
            guidelines permit giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink (an 8
            ounce glass of water every 30 minutes, not to exceed 40 ounces over a period of 3
            hours) to provide a second specimen, distributed reasonably through a period until
            the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine.
        3.4.11.10.3. Reads the specimen temperature within four minutes after void and
        checks/marks appropriate temperature box the CCF. (T-0) If the temperature is out of
        the acceptable range, record the actual temperature in the CCF remarks block. (T-0)
        If the donor voids into a collection container, the DDRPM or DTPAM reads the
        temperature before pouring the specimen into the specimen bottles. (T-0)
        3.4.11.10.4. Inspects the specimen for adulteration or substitution. (T-0)
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                      35


            3.4.11.10.4.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM will inspect the specimen for any
            unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material or other signs of
            adulteration. (T-0)
            3.4.11.10.4.2. If it is apparent on visual inspection that the donor has adulterated
            or substituted the specimen, the DDRPM or DTPAM will proceed to collect
            another specimen under direct observation following the above steps and both
            specimens will be forwarded to the laboratory for testing. (T-0) Under no
            circumstances is the DDRPM or DTPAM permitted to collect and add or combine
            urine from two separate voids. (T-0)
     3.4.11.11. The DDRPM, DTPAM, or donor pours at least 30 mL of the specimen from
     the collection container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle. (T-0) The
     DDRPM or DTPAM uses the A bottle, seal. (T-0) The DDRPM, DTPAM, or donor also
     pours at least 15 mL of the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle,
     places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the B bottle, seal. (T-0) The seal on each bottle
     must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without
     destroying the seal. (T-0) The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the
     specimen bottles. (T-0)
     3.4.11.12. Once sealed, the collector has the donor initial and date the seal of both
     specimen bottles, validating it is their specimen and the bottle was sealed in their
     presence. (T-0) The DDRPM or DTPAM will place the CCF seal on the specimen bottle.
     (T-0)
        3.4.11.12.1. Occasionally the tamper-evident seal provided with the CCF will not
        properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g.,
        moisture, temperature, and specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the DDRPM
        or DTPAM should still apply the tamper-evident seal provided with the CCF and then
        apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. (T-0) This
        second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF seal to avoid obscuring
        information on the CCF seal. (T-0) This second seal must be initialed and dated by
        the DDRPM or DTPAM and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., the donor will be
        present when it is apparent that the CCF seal is not properly adhering to the specimen
        bottle; however, a seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but
        after several minutes the seal begins to lift off along the edges). (T-0) The DDRPM
        or DTPAM must also provide any appropriate comment on the remarks line of the
        CCF stating why the second seal was used. (T-0)
        3.4.11.12.2. If while sealing and initialing the CCF seal the DDRPM or DTPAM or
        donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the DDRPM or DTPAM must apply a
        second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. (T-0) This second
        seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF seal to avoid obscuring information
        on the CCF seal. (T-0) This second seal must be initialed and dated by the DDRPM
        or DTPAM and initialed by the donor. (T-0) The DDRPM or DTPAM must also
        provide an appropriate comment on the remarks line stating why the second seal was
        used. (T-0)
36                                                             AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


        3.4.11.12.3. Since the specimen bottle is now sealed and does not have to be under
        the donor’s direct observation at this point, the donor may wash his or her hands with
        soap and water or alcohol-based solution if he or she desires to do so.
        3.4.11.12.4. The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 (Step 5) of the
        CCF, and certifies that the specimen identified as having been collected from him or
        her is in fact the specimen that he or she provided by signing the certification
        statement and providing his or her date of birth, printed name and work telephone
        number. (T-0)
        3.4.11.12.5. If the donor refuses to sign the form, the DDRPM or DTPAM must
        make a notation on the remarks line to that effect. (T-0) The same procedure must be
        followed if the donor refuses to initial the label. (T-0)
     3.4.11.13. The DDRPM or DTPAM completes the DDRPM or DTPAM certification
     section of the CCF by printing the name and address of the collection facility and the
     DDRPM or DTPAM’s duty telephone number; printing his or her name; signing the
     certification statement; and recording the date and time of the collection. (T-0)
     3.4.11.14. To facilitate the collection process, the DDRPM or DTPAM may fill in the
     name and address of the collection facility and the DDRPM or DTPAM’s business
     telephone number on the spaces provided in Step 1 prior to starting the collection
     procedure.
     3.4.11.15. In Step 2 on the CCF, the remarks block includes space to allow the DDRPM
     or DTPAM to record any remarks concerning the collection.
     3.4.11.16. The DDRPM or DTPAM signs the first line of the chain of custody block
     (Step 4) indicating he or she has received the specimen from the donor, prints his or her
     name, date and time of collection, and the name of the courier or shipment service being
     used to ship the specimen to the laboratory. (T-0)
     3.4.11.17. The DDRPM or DTPAM places the specimen bottle and Copy 1 of the CCF
     inside an appropriate leak-proof plastic bag that serves as a secondary barrier to prevent
     any leakage from damaging the shipping container or documents. (T-0)
     3.4.11.18. The DDRPM or DTPAM removes Copy 4 (Employer) and Copy 5 (Donor)
     and gives them to the donor. (T-0) Donor returns Copy 4 to their supervisor for inclusion
     in the employee work folder and keeps Copy 5 for their personal record. Any secured
     personal items are returned and the donor is permitted to leave the collection site.
     3.4.11.19. If the tamper-evident label/seal from the Federal CCF is broken on a specimen
     bottle after the donor leaves the collection site, the collection must be cancelled. (T-0)
     Notify Civilian Personnel office and the donor’s supervisor of the situation and schedule
     a new collection. (T-0)
     3.4.11.20. The DDRPM or DTPAM places the leak-proof plastic bag that contains the
     specimen bottle and CCF in an appropriate shipping container and seals the shipping
     container as appropriate. (T-0)
        3.4.11.20.1. If the shipping container is not transported to the laboratory on the same
        day that the specimen was collected, the DDRPM or DTPAM should store the
        shipping container in a secure location until it is shipped to the laboratory. (T-0) A
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                         37


           secure location is protected by double locks (e.g. locked cabinet in a locked room)
           with access limited to the DTPAM. Specimens are to be shipped within 24 hours
           after the collection or during the next business day. (T-0)
       3.4.11.21. The DDRPM or DTPAM sends Copy 2 to the MRO. Copy 3 is retained by
       the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-0).
       3.4.11.22. Following each urine specimen collection, the DDRPM or DTPAM should
       check the collection site to ensure that the donor did not leave anything that could have
       been used by the donor or could be used by the next donor to adulterate or dilute a
       specimen. (T-0)
   3.4.12. Shy Bladder Collection.
       3.4.12.1. When a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen, the donor may have
       intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site, could not provide a specimen
       as directed by the collector, has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a
       specimen, or has a "shy bladder.” The term "shy bladder" usually refers to an individual
       who is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby
       during the attempted urination. (T-0)
       3.4.12.2. If a donor tells the collector, upon arrival at the collection site, that he or she
       cannot provide a specimen, the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless
       of the reason given. (T-0)
       3.4.12.3. At the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor
       unwrap/open a collection container, the collector does the following: (T-0)
           3.4.12.3.1. Requests the donor to try to provide a specimen. (T-0)
Note: The donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor
comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container.
           3.4.12.3.2. Directs the donor to drink some fluids. (T-0)
Note: The donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably through a
period of up to 3 hours (an 8 ounce glass of water every 30 minutes, not to exceed 40 ounces
over a period of 3 hours), or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine,
whichever occurs first.
Note: The donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency
representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process. (T-0)
Note: If the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine
specimen, the collection procedure is discontinued and a "refusal to test" is noted on the
"Remarks" line of the CCF. (T-0)
           3.4.12.3.3. Instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a
           sufficient quantity of specimen. The collector uses the CCF from the first attempt. (T-
           0)
Note: It is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one additional
attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts.
 38                                                                 AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


           3.4.12.3.4. Maintains a record of the time of each attempt, whether there was no
           specimen provided or the quantity of specimen provided, and the total ounces of fluid
           given to the donor. (T-0)
           3.4.12.3.5. Discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was
           used for the void, but retains the CCF. (T-0)
Note: If there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt, the collection container may be
used for the next attempt.
           3.4.12.3.6. Discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a
           potential "shy bladder" situation if after a period of three hours (i.e., from the time the
           donor first demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of
           specimen) the donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen. (T-0)
           3.4.12.3.7. Indicates "Shy Bladder" on the "Remarks" line of the CCF and attaches a
           copy of the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen. (T-0) Copy 1 is
           discarded since no valid specimen was collected and the other copies of the CCF are
           distributed as appropriate. (T-0)
   3.4.13. Direct Observation Collections (reasonable suspicion, or accident, safety mishap,
   invalid sample, etc.).
       3.4.13.1. A direct observation collection procedure is the same as a routine collection
       procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor
       urinate into the collection container. The determination that direct observation is
       necessary must be based on an individualized determination that the visual monitoring is
       warranted under the circumstances. (T-0) The DDRPM or DTPAM shall review and
       concur, in advance, any decision with any collector to obtain a specimen under direct
       observation. (T-0) A direct observation collection must be conducted by a DDRPM or
       DTPAM, or other trained observer, of the same gender as the donor. (T-0) If the donor
       declines to have a direct observed collection, the collector reports a refusal to test to the
       DDRPM or DTPAM and contacts the CPS/HRO for appropriate action. (T-0)
       3.4.13.2. A direct observed collection procedure may only be used when: (T-0)
           3.4.13.2.1. A previous drug test provided by the employee was reported as being
           MRO confirmed drug positive, diluted, or otherwise adulterated, the donor had
           substituted another specimen as his/her own, invalid, or the specimen was unsuitable
           for testing.
           3.4.13.2.2. The drug test is a rehabilitation or follow-up test.
           3.4.13.2.3. The DDRPM or DTPAM believes that the donor may alter or substitute
           the specimen to be provided.
           3.4.13.2.4. During a routine collection, the temperature of the specimen collected is
           outside the acceptable range (32-38 Celsius/90-100 degrees Fahrenheit), the DDRPM
           or DTPAM observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct
           indicated a possible attempt to dilute or substitute a specimen, or the collector
           believes that the specimen has been adulterated (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits
           excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach).
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                        39


     3.4.13.3. Chain of custody for a direct observation collection. (T-0)
         3.4.13.3.1. There may be instances when the DDRPM or DTPAM is not able to serve
         as a direct observer (e.g., when the gender of the DDRPM or DTPAM is different
         from that of the donor). In these instances, the DDRPM or DTPAM must call upon
         another designated individual to act as the observer. (T-0)
         3.4.13.3.2. The collector checks the box for an observed collection in Step 2 of the
         Federal CCF and provides the name of the observer and the reason for an observed
         collection on the Remarks line in Step 2 of the Federal CCF. (T-0) If there is
         insufficient room on the Remarks line, the collector may attach a separate MFR
         explaining the use of an observed collection to the Federal CCF.
         3.4.13.3.3. The observer must never touch or handle the collection container unless
         the observer is also serving as the collector. (T-0)
  3.4.14. Documentation Errors/Fatal Flaws.
     3.4.14.1. When an HHS-certified laboratory receives a specimen bottle and its associated
     CCF, it checks to see if the specimen ID number on the specimen bottle seal matches the
     number on the CCF, that the specimen bottle seal is intact, and that the CCF has been
     properly completed by the DDRPM or DTPAM. (T-0)
     3.4.14.2. Per HHS guidelines, the following discrepancies are considered to be fatal
     flaws and the laboratory must stop the testing process and reject the specimen for testing
     and indicate the reason for rejecting the specimen on the CCF: (T-0)
         3.4.14.2.1. The specimen ID number on the specimen bottle seal does not match the
         specimen ID number on the CCF or the ID number is missing either on the CCF or on
         the specimen bottle seal.
         3.4.14.2.2. The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering on the
         specimen bottle from a single specimen collection or on the primary (Bottle A)
         specimen from a split specimen collection (and the split specimen cannot be
         designated as the primary (Bottle A) specimen.
         3.4.14.2.3. The collector's printed name and signature are omitted on the CCF; or
         3.4.14.2.4. There is an insufficient amount of urine for analysis in the specimen
         bottle from a single specimen collection or in the primary (Bottle A) specimen from a
         split specimen collection (unless the split specimen can be designated as the primary
         (Bottle A) specimen.
     3.4.14.3. Per HHS guidelines, the following discrepancies are considered to be
     correctable flaws: (T-0)
         3.4.14.3.1. If a DDRPM or DTPAM failed to sign the CCF, the laboratory must
         attempt to recover the DDRPM’s or DTPAM's signature before reporting the test
         result. (T-0) If the DDRPM or DTPAM can provide a MFR recovering the signature,
         the laboratory may report the test result for the specimen. If the laboratory cannot
         recover the DDRPM’s or DTPAM's signature, the laboratory must report a rejected
         for testing result and indicate the reason for the rejected for testing result on the CCF.
         (T-0)
40                                                               AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


         3.4.14.3.2. If a specimen is submitted using a non-Federal form or an expired CCF,
         the laboratory must test the specimen and also attempt to obtain a MFR explaining
         why a non-Federal form or an expired CCF was used and ensure that the form used
         contains all the required information. (T-0) If the laboratory cannot obtain a MFR
         from the DDRPM or DTPAM, the laboratory must report a rejected for testing result
         and indicate the reason for the rejected for testing result on the report to the MRO. (T-
         0)
         3.4.14.3.3. Once contacted by the laboratory, the DDRPM or DTPAM should
         immediately respond to the laboratory indicating whether he/she can or cannot
         provide a memorandum to recover the discrepancy and/or error of omission. (T-0)
         Responding slowly to a laboratory’s request for information regarding errors or
         discrepancies may lead to the laboratory discarding the specimen prior to testing.
  3.4.15. Failure to Appear for Testing.
     3.4.15.1. Failure to appear for testing without a deferral may be considered refusal to
     participate in testing and may subject an employee to the full range of administrative
     and/or disciplinary actions, including but not limited to removal, and an applicant
     tentatively selected for a TDP to the cancellation of an offer of employment. (T-0)
     3.4.15.2. If an individual fails to appear at the collection site at the assigned time, the
     DDRPM or DTPAM will notify the CPS/HRO. (T-0) The supervisor and HRR will
     determine the course of action. (T-0)
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                       41

                              PROCESSING TEST RESULTS

4.1. Confidentiality of Test Results.
   4.1.1. The laboratory may disclose MRO verified/validated laboratory test results only to the
   MRO or the representative of the MRO. (T-0)
   4.1.2. Any positive results the MRO verifies will be treated in a confidential manner. (T-0)
   4.1.3. Test results will be protected IAW all applicable Federal laws, rules and regulations
   regarding confidentiality of records, including the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 42 C.F.R.,
   Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 2. (T-0)
   4.1.4. The MRO may maintain only those records necessary for compliance with this
   instruction. Any records of the MRO, or the staff of the MRO, including drug test results,
   may be released to any management official for purposes of auditing the activities of the
   MRO, except that the disclosure of the results of any audit may not include personal
   identifying information on any employee. (T-0)
   4.1.5. The by-name or other identifier results of a drug test on the employee may not be
   disclosed without the prior written consent of such employee, unless the disclosure would be:
   (T-0)
       4.1.5.1. To the MRO.
       4.1.5.2. To any official whose duties necessitate review of the test results in an official
       capacity. Examples include but are not limited to: releasing information in order to
       investigate allegations resulting from grievances, appeals, and other complaints; to
       initiate or decide on disciplinary personnel action or to advise on such actions; or to
       initiate security clearance action against the employee. These officials commonly
       include: Installation Staff Judge Advocate/SJA, CPS/HRO, ADAPT, and
       commander/directorate head.
       4.1.5.3. Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or where required by
       the United States Government to defend against any challenge against any disciplinary
       action.
       4.1.5.4. Test results with all identifying information removed will also be made available
       to Air Force personnel, including the AFCDTP manager, for data collection and other
       activities necessary to ensure Air Force compliance with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
       1988.
       4.1.5.5. IAW the Privacy Act, 5USC 552a or as required by other Federal law.
       4.1.5.6. In the case of a drug test result verified as positive, diluted, substituted or
       adulterated by the MRO IAW the HHS MRO Manual, information collected during the
       course of the MRO’s interview with the donor may be disclosed to any official whose
       duties include shaping management’s response to evidence of the employee’s apparent
       illicit drug use. (T-0, DHHS Specimen Collection Handbook)
 42                                                              AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


4.2. Opportunity to Justify a Laboratory-Verified Positive Test Result, Adulterated
Specimen Result or Specimen Not-Suitable-for-Testing Result.
   4.2.1. When a laboratory-verified positive result is returned by the laboratory, the MRO will
   perform the duties outlined by HHS guidelines (MRO Manual for Federal Workplace Drug
   Testing Programs, CSAP Technical Report #15) in order to validate the results. (T-0) For
   example, the MRO may choose to conduct employee medical interviews, review employee
   medical history, or review any other biomedical factors. (T-0)
   4.2.2. HHS-MRO Interview Procedure (T-0)
      4.2.2.1. The MRO determines that the information on the CCF is correct and complete.
      (T-0) The MRO makes telephone contact with the specimen donor associated with a non-
      negative test result (drug positive, substituted, adulterated or invalid).
      4.2.2.2. The MRO conducts an interview to discern any legitimate and substantiated
      reason for the non-negative drug test result. (T-0)
      4.2.2.3. The MRO determines whether the drug test result should remain categorized the
      same as presented by the laboratory. (T-0)
      4.2.2.4. The MRO reports validated result to the designated point of contact (POC) at the
      donor’s Air Force Installation. (T-0)
      4.2.2.5. The MRO and POC maintain records of the result and donor information. (T-0)
4.3. MRO Review of Medical Records.
   4.3.1. The MRO must review all medical records made available by the individual in
   determining whether a laboratory verified positive test could have resulted from legally
   prescribed medication. (T-0) The MRO also may request the individual submit additional
   evidence to justify a laboratory verified positive drug test result received from a laboratory.
   Evidence to legitimize a positive result may include: (T-0)
      4.3.1.1. A valid prescription.
      4.3.1.2. A verification from the individual’s physician of a valid prescription.
   4.3.2. Individuals are not entitled, however, to present evidence to the MRO in a trial-type
   administrative proceeding, although the MRO has the discretion to accept evidence in any
   manner the MRO deems most efficient or necessary. (T-0, DHHS Specimen Collection
   Handbook)
   4.3.3. If the MRO determines there is no justification for the positive test result, the result
   will then become a MRO verified positive test result. The MRO staff will immediately
   contact the DDRPM or DTPAM upon obtaining a MRO verified/validated positive test
   result. (T-0, DHHS Specimen Collection Handbook)
4.4. Reporting of Results under the AFCDTP.
   4.4.1. The MRO staff will receive all laboratory test results and associated documents from
   the approved drug testing laboratory for all civilian employees in TDP, applicants, and
   quality control specimens. (T-3)
   4.4.2. The MRO staff will: (T-3)
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                         43


        4.4.2.1. Match-up the laboratory results with the appropriate individual tests or quality
        control specimens.
        4.4.2.2. Review laboratory reports, chain of custody forms, and associated
        documentation for collection or specimen deficiencies which indicate the validity of the
        results may be scientifically insufficient because certain procedures were not followed or
        standards were not fully met.
        4.4.2.3. Advise the AFCDTP manager of significant problems or concerns resulting from
        laboratory and collection site procedures or practices.
        4.4.2.4. Order a reanalysis of a specimen or special laboratory tests, if necessary.
        4.4.2.5. Recommend the AFCDTP manager arrange for retesting of employees or
        applicants tentatively selected for TDP when warranted.
        4.4.2.6. Review all laboratory verified positive laboratory results and contact/interview
        employees, applicants tentatively selected for TDP, physicians, and laboratory
        toxicologists as necessary to determine whether the results are consistent with the legal
        use of drugs.
        4.4.2.7. Obtain a copy of the laboratory quantitative result on all opiate positives before
        contacting the donor (this is intended as a review in order to ensure the laboratory box for
        morphine or codeine has been appropriately checked).
   4.4.3. Send the Air Force written reports on all MRO-verified positive drug test results and
   positive test results based on other than illicit drug use no later than the second business day
   after making such a determination. The MRO will verify all positive laboratory test results
   by interviewing the donor to determine whether there is an acceptable medical explanation.
   (T-3) If the MRO determines there is no medical explanation for a positive result (i.e., the
   result cannot be explained through non-abusive use of a prescription or over-the-counter
   medication) such a result will be considered an MRO-verified positive test result. (T-3) This
   MRO verified positive result will be documented as in writing and reported to the base-level
   DDRPM (or DTPAM).
(T-3)
   4.4.4. The MRO will prepare a separate written report on all MRO verified positive, invalid,
   unsuitable for testing, and adulterated results, including pertinent documentation, within
   three business days of receipt of all the information the MRO deems necessary to make a
   determination. (T-3)      The finalized report will be forwarded to the base-level
   DDRPM/DTPAM using secured and traceable methods such as certified or overnight mail.
   (T-3)
        4.4.4.1. The DDRPM/DTPAM, after consulting with the HRR, will establish procedures
        for the retesting of all individuals who tested non-negative or positive for drug use prior
        to the employee returning to work. (T-3)
4.5. Maintenance and Confidentiality of Records.
   4.5.1. AFCDTP records will be maintained IAW all applicable Federal laws, rules and
   regulations regarding confidentiality of records, including the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
   and 42 C.F.R., Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part 2, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC

                    FINDINGS OF DRUG USE REQUIRED ACTIONS

5.1. Finding of Drug Use.
   5.1.1. An employee may be found to have used illicit drugs on the basis of any appropriate
   evidence including, but not limited to: (T-1)
      5.1.1.1. Direct observation of drug use.
      5.1.1.2. Evidence obtained from an arrest or criminal conviction.
      5.1.1.3. A MRO verified positive test result for the presence of an illicit drug.
      5.1.1.4. An employee’s voluntary admission of usage of an illicit drug.
5.2. Mandatory Administrative and Disciplinary Actions.
   5.2.1. If the employee that used illicit drugs occupies a TDP, the employee must be removed
   from the position. (T-0) However, at the discretion of the commander/directorate head, and
   while making satisfactory progress in treatment, an employee may return to duty in a TDP, if
   there are reasonable grounds to believe the employee will not engage in further use of illicit
   drugs endangering public health, safety, or national security. If the employee is returned to
   duty in a TDP he/she may not be excused from random testing. (T-0)
   5.2.2. The supervisor directs an employee, in writing, to report to the EAP or ADAPT clinic
   (if EAP is unavailable) for initial substance abuse assessment subsequent to an MRO-
   verified drug positive test, a substance-related incident, or other reasonable suspicion of
   substance misuse. (T-0) The notification will provide specifics of the appointment and
   advise the employee that attendance is mandatory. (T-0) All notices will be coordinated with
   the servicing CPS/HRO. A sample notification letter is provided in Attachment 13. (T-0)
   5.2.3. Supervisors are required to take appropriate action against any employee found to use
   illicit drugs in coordination with the CPS/HRO. (T-0) Procedures must be consistent with
   applicable collective bargaining agreements and Air Force and DoD policy. (T-0)
      5.2.3.1. Disciplinary actions may include the full range of actions as provided in the
      regulation/instruction that applies, given the type of employee in issue (APF or NAF).
      For example, AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions, and AFI 36-1001, Managing

        SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING, ASSISTANCE AND REFERRALS

10.1. Overview
   10.1.1. To ensure maximum workplace productivity through an alcohol misuse and drug-
   free workforce accomplished through a combination of deterrence, detection, and
   rehabilitation. (T-1)
       10.1.1.1. Early intervention is essential to the effective operation of this program and the
       successful rehabilitation of employees. Therefore, supervisors must be alert to behaviors
       that could indicate a substance abuse problem (prior to the occurrence of alcohol-related
       misconduct or MRO-verified drug test positive) and advise employees they may
       voluntarily seek assessment and treatment referral services using the Safe Haven
       provision in section 1.26 of this AFI. (T-1)
          10.1.1.1.1. Rehabilitation shall be offered to all employees identified as having a
          substance abuse problem (defined as: alcohol misuse, a MRO verified drug positive
          test result, and/or self-identified with a drug or alcohol problem), regardless of other
          administrative actions that may be pending or taken. (T-0) Alcohol misuse is defined
          as alcohol-related misconduct that has a direct impact on work productivity. Even
          when the removal of the employee from the Federal Service is proposed, the Air
          Force will offer, at a minimum, assessment and treatment referral services. (T-0) The
          civilian employee will be provided a one-time mandatory assessment and referral
          appointment. (T-0) This assessment and referral appointment can be completed, at no
          cost to the civilian employee, through EAP or ADAPT, as space and services are
          available. At the employee’s expense this mandatory assessment and referral
          appointment can also be conducted by other appropriate healthcare providers (e.g.
          civilian healthcare providers). Follow-on counseling services, if needed, are available
          at the employee’s expense. The follow-up counseling services can be provided
          through the installation EAP (if available), through the ADAPT program (on space
          available as fee for service), or other appropriate private health care service providers.
          (T-0)
          10.1.1.1.2. Employees may be allowed up to one hour (or more as necessitated by
          travel time) of duty time for each assessment and referral session up to a maximum of
          three hours during the assessment/referral phase of treatment. This applies only to
          assessment/referral and not follow-up treatment. Absences during duty hours for
          rehabilitation or treatment must be charged to the appropriate leave category
          according to law and Air Force leave regulations. (T-1)
          10.1.1.1.3. Although the Air Force will encourage treatment and rehabilitation, it is
          the responsibility of every employee to refrain from substance abuse and take
          personal responsibility for rehabilitation when substance abuse problems occur. (T-1)
10.2. Referral Process.
   10.2.1. Supervisors will advise employees on the availability of services when there is any
   reason to believe that there may be a substance abuse problem. (T-1) This advice does not
 54                                                             AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


   require an employee to admit to any problem, but merely offers appropriate assessment and
   referral to counseling and rehabilitation services. (T-1)
      10.2.1.1. The DDRPM or DTPAM provides appropriate referral guidance to supervisors.
      (T-1) Supervisors must direct employees to report for initial assessment and referral-for-
      treatment any time drug use is MRO-verified/validated and/or there is alcohol-related
      misconduct and then follow up to ensure completion. (T-0) Verification and validation
      may also arise through the employee’s admission of substance abuse in addition to results
      from a substance abuse test authorized by this AFI. See Attachment 13 for a sample
      notice to the employee. (T-0)
          10.2.1.1.1. Supervisors will notify the commander when an employee refuses to
          comply with a mandatory referral for counseling. (T-1)
10.3. Employee Counseling and Assistance.
   10.3.1. EAP contractor personnel or ADAPT staff, provide and document initial substance
   abuse evaluation of all referred or self-identified employees. (T-1) Employees will be
   advised of options for substance abuse counseling and treatment through referral agencies.
   (T-1) To ensure that appropriate referrals are made, EAP and ADAPT personnel should
   consider the nature and severity of the problem, location of the treatment, cost of the
   treatment, intensity of the treatment environment, availability of inpatient/outpatient care,
   and other special needs, such as transportation, family issues, and child care. (T-1)
   Documentation of the initial assessment must be IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol Drug Abuse
   Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program and AFI 41-210, Patient Administrative
   Functions. (T-1)
      10.3.1.1. EAP and ADAPT personnel ensure medical and MH records of civilian
      personnel referred for assessment and/or treatment are appropriately updated to include:
      referral data, patient confidentiality and release of information, options for accepting or
      refusing treatment, assessment data, and appropriate treatment planning, case
      management, and/or clinical services provided. (T-3)
      10.3.1.2. If seen in ADAPT, information in the medical record should include a thorough
      initial note outlining the results of assessment, and employee consented to
      release/diagnostic procedures. (T-3) Subsequent contacts should also be reflected in brief
      notes in medical records indicating the nature and outcome of services provided. (T-3)
      10.3.1.3. Changes in status, diagnosis, or treatment plan; initiation or change in
      medication; or termination of services should be thoroughly documented in the medical
      record. (T-3)
      10.3.1.4. Referral Options. Employees may use a wide variety of treatment options to
      include: community-based treatment programs (for uninsured or underinsured
      individuals), private providers covered by the employee’s health insurance, or military
      benefits, if applicable. (T-3)
          10.3.1.4.1. Military-based counseling and/or treatment services may be provided on a
          space available, reimbursable basis depending on the eligibility status of the
          employee and IAW HHS/TRICARE guidelines outlined in AFH 41-11, Section E,
          Health Care for Eligible Civilians and Special Categories of Beneficiaries and Their
AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014                                                                       55


          Family Members. Employees are responsible for payment for these services which is
          generally accomplished by submitting claims to their Federal Health Benefits System
          health insurance provider. (T-3)
10.4. Counselor Responsibilities.
   10.4.1. The ADAPT or contract counselor counsels the employee on the scope of services
   available for counseling, assessment, and referral. (T-3)
       10.4.1.1. For the mandatory initial assessment appointment, the employee will be
       advised by way of documented initial informed consent that their supervisor will be
       notified that the employee attended the interview and the reporting and departing time of
       the employee. (T-3)
       10.4.1.2. The employee is advised of what information will be disclosed to the
       supervisor at the beginning of the initial interview. (T-3) At that time the counselor also
       tells the employee that strict rules govern the disclosure of substance abuse counseling
       information and how those rules apply to the position the employee holds. (T-3)
          10.4.1.2.1. The employee will be provided a copy of the form, Consent for Release
          of Patient Information During or After Treatment or Rehabilitation (Attachment 12).
          (T-3) The counselor will explain that the employee is not required to sign the release,
          but doing so will allow for the treatment provider to communicate progress back to
          the supervisor and the Civilian Rehabilitation Team. (T-3) The information may then
          be considered in deciding on the appropriateness of various actions including
          discipline and continued assignments to testing designated or other sensitive
          positions. Release of this information also furthers the rehabilitation process by
          ensuring that the supervisor is involved in the process and serves to justify the use of
          sick leave for treatment and counseling. (T-3)
   10.4.2. ADAPT personnel will advise employees that if they choose to use ADAPT services,
   a MH record and a medical record will be established to ensure professional accountability
   and to facilitate on-going assessment of the quality, appropriateness, and progress of
   rehabilitation. (T-3)
   10.4.3. Regardless of options selected, employees will be encouraged to authorize the
   release of information to appropriate management officials to facilitate support for their
   treatment. Employees will be advised that release of such information is not mandatory. (T-
   3)

but requiring AF/A1 written approval to designate additional positions; or Discretionary TDP,
which require Air Force to consult with DoD before approving TDP positions under this
category.
A2.2. Presumptive positions are identified by general criteria and specific occupational
series/codes when it is known that those positions meet the general criteria. Preferred positions
are identified by specific occupational series/codes. Positions in the applicable series/codes
identified below as Presumptive and Preferred will be TDP even if the employees are leaders or
supervisors.
A2.3. Positions identified as TDP under these procedures will be documented (T-2) on the
position description with the statement “This is a drug testing designated position. The
incumbent is subject to random testing for drug use.”
A2.4. Requests for revisions to TDP shall be forwarded from installation (T-2) personnel offices
to AFPC/DPIE to AF/A1. AF/A1 shall send AFMOA/SGHW, Air Force Legal Services
Agency/Central Labor Law Office (AFLSA/CLLO), and the Air Force Administrative Law
Division (AF/JAA) an information copy. AF/A1 will review the request and forward Air Force

        2. A copy of a current and properly executed job description must be provided, along
           with a schematic of the chain of supervision. The total number of employees covered
           will be provided. If the positions are being established or a change in the number of

           inclusion of a small number of employees be requested when rapid growth in that job
           class is forecast.

       3. MAJCOM/A1 and JA approval for each position under review prior to submission to
          AF/A1PC.

Justification: The use of illicit drugs demonstrates a disregard for the laws of the United States,
poor judgment, and exposes the individual to risks of extortion, thereby rendering such
individuals unsuitable for continued access to sensitive information. The Air Force elects to
identify all positions with routine access to truly sensitive national security information as TDP.
Such positions involve information that if disclosed could seriously damage national security
interests and jeopardize the lives of members of the United States armed services and allies.
Positions having access to official use, confidential or personally identifying information, not
meeting the truly-sensitive criteria, will not be designated. Additionally, positions will not be
designated for having “public trust” requirements or generalized requirements of integrity,
honesty, or responsibility.
A2.17. Type 6: Positions covered by the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).
All positions involving access to nuclear weapons or materials are covered by the personnel
reliability program (PRP) as described in AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability
Program. These positions are coded as part of the civilian record in the data system as code A -
critical position for nuclear weapons duty, or code D - controlled position for nuclear weapons
duty.

Justification: Positions involving access to nuclear weapons pose special risks to the national
security and safety. The consequences of any mishap are extraordinarily high and employees
must therefore be free of any substances, including but not limited to illicit drugs that could
impair judgment or performance.
A2.18. Category III -- Discretionary TDP.
Category III positions require the Air Force to consult with DoD and the Interagency
Coordinating Group (ICG) Executive Committee prior to identification as a TDP; therefore,
installations are prohibited from identifying any position which is not specifically identified in
this attachment by occupational series/code. These positions may not be designated as a TDP
without specific authorization from AF/A1. (T-2)
A2.19. Type 1: Protection of life and property.

APPROPRIATE LETTERHEAD
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
(Date)

MEMORANDUM FOR (Tentatively Selected Applicant Name - Non-Air Force Employee
Accepting TDP)

FROM: Civilian Personnel Flight/Human Resource Office

SUBJECT: Notice of Drug Testing as a Condition of Employment

1. The position of (Title, Series, and grade) for which you have been tentatively selected is
designated by the Air Force as a testing designated position (TDP) under the Air Force Civilian
Drug Testing Program. For the purpose of this program, TDP are those positions
sufficiently critical to the Air Force mission or to the protection of public safety to warrant
screening to detect the presence of drugs as a job-related requirement. Illicit drug use by
employees in sensitive positions presents a clear threat to the mission of the Air Force, national
security, or public safety.

2. To receive further consideration for this TDP, you must sign this notice and agree to submit to
urinalysis testing, if requested, in order to determine your fitness for appointment, prior to the
effective date of the appointment (or within three days of entry on duty where the
commander has authorized delayed testing).

3. If you sign this notice and then refuse to furnish a urine specimen as requested, or if illicit
drug use is detected through a Medical Review Officer (MRO) verified/validated positive
test result, the position offer will be withdrawn. In the event your applicant drug test is deferred
until after you report for duty and you either refuse to furnish a urine specimen as requested, or
illicit drug use is detected, your employment will be terminated, as your employment was
contingent upon successfully passing a drug test. You are given the opportunity prior to the
urine test to provide medical documentation detailing authorized prescription medication you
are taking. Additionally, if a laboratory verified positive test result is received, you will be
given an opportunity to submit medical documentation to the MRO to support your legitimate
use of prescription drugs prior to the validation of the test results.

4. If you are appointed to this TDP, the following employment requirements apply:

         (a) It will be mandatory that you refrain from the use of illicit drugs.
         (b) You will be subject to urinalysis testing under the following circumstances: (1) on an
         unannounced random basis; (2) when there is reasonable suspicion that you have used illicit
         drug;
 80                                                                   AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014




        (3) As part of a safety/mishap investigation; or (4) as part of or as a follow-up to counseling
        or treatment for illicit drug use.
        (c) After appointment, if you refuse to furnish a urine specimen, you will be subject to
        disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to removal.
        (d) After appointment, if illicit drug use is detected through a MRO verified/validated
        positive test result, you will be subject to disciplinary action, including removal from Federal
        Service. If you are found to have used an illicit drug, you will be reassigned from the TDP.
        Additionally, you will be removed from Federal Service if you fail to agree to participate in a
        counseling or treatment program. However, even if you agree to participate in and
        subsequently complete a counseling or treatment program, you may still be subject to
        disciplinary action, including removal, if warranted by the facts of your situation. Your
        agreement to participate in a counseling or treatment program will be one of the factors
        considered in determining the level of discipline or disciplinary action imposed.

 5. You will be allowed individual privacy while providing the urine specimen unless there is reason
 to believe the specimen will be or has been altered. The collection, handling, and testing of the
 urine specimen will be conducted under chain of custody procedures established by the Department
 of Health and Human Services to ensure accuracy of the test result. The quality of testing
 procedures is tightly controlled to ensure results will be handled with the maximum respect for
 individual confidentiality.

sufficiently critical to the Air Force mission or to the protection of public safety to warrant
screening to detect the presence of drugs as a job-related requirement. Illicit drug use by
employees in sensitive positions present a clear threat to the mission of the Air Force, national
security, and public safety.

2. To receive further consideration for this TDP, you must sign this notice and agree to submit to
urinalysis testing in order to determine your fitness for placement into this TDP, prior to the
effective date of the action.

3. If you sign this notice and then refuse to furnish a urine specimen, the position offer will be
withdrawn. If a laboratory verified positive test result is received, you will be given an
opportunity to submit medical documentation to the Medical Review Officer (MRO) to support
the legitimate use of prescription drugs. If illicit drug use is MRO verified/validated through the
test result, the position offer will be withdrawn and, as a current Air Force employee, you will
be subject to disciplinary action.

4. If you are placed into this TDP, the following employment requirements
apply:

        (a) It will continue to be mandatory for you to refrain from the use of illicit drugs,
        and you will continue to be subject to testing under the following circumstances: 1)
        when there is a reasonable suspicion that you use illicit drugs, 2) as part of a
        safety/mishap investigation, or 3) as part of or follow-up to counseling or treatment for
        illicit drug use.

        (b) You will be subject to urinalysis testing on an unannounced random
        basis.

        (c) If you refuse to furnish a urine specimen, or if you provide a urine specimen that
        ultimately reflects the use of an illicit drug, you may be removed from Federal Service.
 86                                                              AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014



       (d) If illicit drug use is detected through a MRO verified/validated positive test
       result, you may be disciplined, ranging from reprimand to removal from Federal
       Service. Additionally, you are subject to assignment to a non-TDP. You will be
       removed from Federal Service if you fail to agree to participate in a counseling or
       treatment program. However, even if you agree to participate in and subsequently
       complete a counseling or treatment program, you may still be subject to disciplinary
       action, which may include removal based on the totality of the circumstances of your
       situation. Your agreement to participate in a counseling or treatment program will be
       one of the factors considered in determining the level of discipline or disciplinary action
       imposed.

5. If you believe you may have a drug problem, you are encouraged to voluntarily seek
assistance by contacting the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at (provide phone number)
or, if an EAP is not locally available, the ADAPT Program Office (provide phone number
and modify as necessary for local situations).

APPROPRIATE LETTERHEAD
UNITED STATES AIRFORCE

(Date)

MEMORANDUM FOR (Employee Name - Incumbent of position newly designated as a TDP)
FROM: Civilian Personnel Flight
SUBJECT: Notice of Drug Testing as a Condition of Employment

1. The position of (Title, Series, and grade) to which you are assigned has been designated by
the Air Force as a testing designated position (TDP) under the Air Force Civilian Drug Testing
Program. For the purpose of this program, TDP are those positions sufficiently critical to the
Air Force mission or to the protection of public safety to warrant screening of the incumbent
employee to detect the presence of drugs as a job-related requirement. Illicit drug use by
employees in sensitive positions presents a clear threat to the mission of the Air Force, national
security, or public safety.

2. As a mandatory requirement for your continued employment in this TDP, it is required
you(a) refrain from the use of illicit drugs and (b) submit to urinalysis testing pursuant to
AFI 90-508, Air Force Civilian Drug Testing and Substance Abuse Program. You are
directed to read and become familiar with AFI 90-508. Therefore, 30 days after receipt of this
notice, you will be subject to urinalysis testing on an unannounced random basis.

3. You will receive specific instructions concerning when and where the test will be conducted
immediately prior to the test. You will be allowed individual privacy while providing the urine
specimen unless there is reason to believe the specimen may be or has been altered. The
collection, handling, and testing of the urine specimen will be conducted under chain of custody
procedures established by the Health and Human Services Technical Guidelines to ensure
accuracy of the test result. The quality of testing procedures is tightly controlled to ensure
results will be handled with the maximum respect for individual confidentiality.

4. If you refuse to furnish a urine specimen as directed, or if illicit drug use is detected through a
Medical Review Officer (MRO) verified/validated positive test result, you will have failed
to meet the mandatory employment requirement for this sensitive position. If you refuse to
furnish a urine specimen, or, if you provide a urine specimen that ultimately reflects the use of
an illicit drug you will be subject to disciplinary action, ranging from reprimand to removal.
If you are found to have used an illicit drug, you will be reassigned from the TDP.
Additionally, you may be disciplined, up to and including removal from Federal service, if you
fail to participate in a counseling or treatment program. However, even if you agree to
participate in and subsequently complete a counseling or treatment program, you may still
be subject to disciplinary action which may include removal, depending on the totality of the
circumstances of your situation. Your agreement to participate in a counseling or treatment
 98                                                                 AFI90-508 28 AUGUST 2014


program will be one of the factors considered in determining the level of discipline or
disciplinary action imposed. Prescription drugs authorized by a physician and verified by
appropriate evidence are excluded from such determinations. You will be given an opportunity
to submit medical documentation to the MRO in order to verify the legitimate use of specific
drugs before any action will be taken. Absent valid medical documentation, you may be
removed from the Federal Service.

5. If you believe you may have a drug problem, you are encouraged to voluntarily seek
counseling or referral services by contacting the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at
(provide phone number) or, if an EAP is not locally available, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program office at (provide phone number and modify as
necessary for local situations). If you do self-identify and agree to provisions described in
the civilian drug testing program during this 30-day notice period, you will not be subject to
disciplinary action for past use.

as possible and to prevent the testing designated employee from having an opportunity to
delay, circumvent or adulterate the urine collection process, THE SUPERVISOR MUST
ENSURE THE FOLLOWING:

   a. Provide a SAME SEX ESCORT to accompany the testing designated employee directly
   to the collection site and to remain with the employee until the collection procedure is
   completed. (The escort is not required, under normal circumstances, to actually observe the
   collection of the urine.)

   b. Ensure the employee and escort are fully aware that once they arrive at the collection site,
   THEY MAY NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE COLLECTION PROCEDURE IS COMPLETED.

   c. Ensure the employee is aware that he/she must have a PHOTO ID, e.g. Civilian ID Card
   or Driver’s License or Social Security Card in his/her possession when they arrive at the
   collection site.

   d. Ensure the employee has been briefed that the Civilian Drug Testing Program is an
   Air Force-directed program and an UNCOOPERATIVE OR ABRASIVE ATTITUDE will
   be reported by the DDRP staff through the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager
   to the employee’s supervisor and commander.

   e. Ensure the employee is aware that he/she should report to the collection site with a full
   bladder and be READY TO PROVIDE A URINE SPECIMEN in order to expedite the
   urine collection process. If the employee has recently voided, they should drink fluids prior
   to reporting to the collection site.

   f. A COPY OF THE NOTICE TO REPORT FOR RANDOM DRUG TESTING,
   SIGNED BY BOTH THE SUPERVISOR AND THE EMPLOYEE, MUST BE
   PROVIDED TO DDRP STAFF UPON ARRIVAL AT THE COLLECTION SITE.
   The original is filed in the Supervisor’s Record of Employee (971) as proof the employee
   was directed for testing by the supervisor.

2. Should the employee refuse to cooperate with the drug testing program, immediately notify
your supervisor, the undersigned, and your Employee/Management Relations Specialist.

3. Any questions may be directed to the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager or Drug
Demand Reduction Administrative Manager at [phone number].
