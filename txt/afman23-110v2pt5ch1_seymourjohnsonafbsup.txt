implements procedures and guidance in AFMAN 23-10, Volume 2, Part 5, Chapter 1, Standard Asset
Tracking System (SATS). This supplement establishes additional requirements not otherwise specified
in this publication. Maintain records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with
(IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) available from the Air Force Portal link. Contact supporting records
managers as required. Send comments and suggested improvements to this supplement on AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, or via official correspondence with flight commander
concurrence to 4 LRS/LGRSP, 1280 Humphreys St., Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Customer Service Section will update SATS database for authorization to receipt for classified property
and equipment using Attachment 2. Implements the reorganization of the Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) and all office symbols.
1.2.4. Security. User identifications and passwords will be established when a Standard Asset Tracking
System (SATS) Authorization Access Request form is received and endorsed by the applicable flight
chief /superintendent. The request form will include SATS privileges requested and will be endorsed by
supervisor prior to flight chief/superintendent. Refer to Attachment 1 of this supplement for the SATS
Authorization Access Request form. Systems Management Section will be responsible for maintaining
SATS request forms. Customer Service will be responsible for validating user-id & passwords on an
annual basis.
1.2.4.1. (Added) The Receipt Authorization for Classified Property List will be used to verify a
customer is authorized to sign for classified property to include the movement of materiel within LRS.
 2                 AFMAN23-110V2PT5CH1_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP 21 AUGUST 2008


An updated Classified and Equipment List will be available at all times with the driver in case SATS is
down or unavailable. Customer Service Section will update SATS database for authorization of
classified property and equipment.
1.3.4.1. (Added) SATS database will be the primary method to sign for property from LRS functions.
Only in the extreme exceptions will a DD Form 1348-1A be used to sign for property. Although, critical
mission needs will not prevent the movement of property from LRS to its customers, unit Commanders
must ensure their personnel submit SATS Database Requests Forms (refer to Attachment 2) well before
they are required to sign for property. Emphasis on SATS use as the primary method to sign for
property will prevent delay in meeting customer needs and maintaining the efficiency and manpower
savings of SATS.
1.3.5. Reports. Each work center in the warehouse will run the following reports daily: Items Not
Pulled, Items Not Put Away, and Items Not Received by Customer. Refer to paragraph 1.2.4, this
supplement, for requesting user privileges.
