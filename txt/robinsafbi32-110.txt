1. Policy
     1.1. Airfield Temporary Construction Waiver (TCW). An Airfield TCW is used to identify,
     coordinate and approve construction activity that violates airfield criteria on or near the
     airfield. The installation commander is the temporary construction waiver approval authority.
     An Airfield TCW applies to airfield systems, facilities, and on base facilities where
     construction will require equipment or stockpile areas that may violate airfield criteria.
     1.2. Construction Project Manager (PM)- requests an Airfield TCW from the installation
     commander for any construction projects that violate any airfield criteria during the
     construction of a project. Airfield TCW requests for construction projects must be submitted
     once the project is funded and must include the elements listed in paragraphs 1.3 through 1.9.
     NOTE: Emergency maintenance and repair requirements and routine maintenance activities,
     such as mowing and maintenance of airfield systems, are exempt from this requirement;
     however, the BCE will coordinate with the airfield management, flight safety, and flight
     operations offices to ensure implementation of appropriate safety measures, including
     Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) or Local NOTAMs.
     1.3. A construction phasing plan - describing any identifiable construction phases or closure
     periods to any area of the airfield using AFMC Form 300 (Attachment 2), Airfield
     Obstructions – Waiver Request.
     1.4. A site location map of the construction area on the airfield (Attachment 3);
     1.5. Submit FAA, Federal Aviation Administration, document 7460-1 to obtain an FAA
     Determination Letter (Attachment 4);
     1.6. Identification, justification, and appropriate Operational Risk Management (ORM)
     measures for each violation of airfield criteria and complete RAFB Form 301 (Attachment
     5);
     1.7. Identification, justification, and appropriate risk mitigation measures for each violation
     of airfield criteria and prepare Mitigation Letter (Attachment 6);
ROBINSAFBI32-110 10 JULY 2013                                                                 3


  1.8. Rationale for any deviations from the risk mitigation standards;
  1.9. PM maintains (for record) one copy of all pertinent documents relative to each Airfield
  TCW.
2. Airfield TCW PROCEDURES
     2.1.1. All projects starts with a requester submitting an AF Form 332 to 78 CEG
     Customer Service section. Customer Service logs the AF Form 332 into the ACES,
     Automated Civil Engineering System, which provides a work order number. A Project
     Manager (PM) is assigned to the project and this begins the project process.
  2.2. For construction projects within the airfield delineation (Attachment 7), Customer
  Service will request coordination by both Base Community Planning (CP) and the Airfield
  Manager’s Office (AM).
  2.3. CP and the AM will review the AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request and
  together make a determination as to whether the project has the potential requirement for an
  Airfield TCW. If so, the remarks block of the AF Form 332 will indicate ‘Project Manager
  must submit AFMC Form 300 to Base Community Planning section’.
  2.4. PM, upon receipt of the AF Form 332 then submits the electronic copies of the AFMC
  Form 300, AF Form 332 and a project construction drawing to the CP for a determination if
  an Airfield TCW is required. If the project does not violate any airfield criteria, the
  construction proceeds without waiver. If the project violates one or more airfield criteria,
  then the Airfield TCW process begins by the CP filling out Sections 3 and 5 of AFMC Form
  300 and returning the document to the PM.
  2.5. PM, upon receiving the AFMC Form 300 back from CP, begins the Airfield TCW
  package.
     2.5.1. PM records the Airfield TCW on the tracking sheet by project number/title and
     date. NOTE: Each step in the process the PM records the date sent/received on the
     tracking sheet located on the 78 CEG SharePoint.
     2.5.2. PM submits electronic FAA document 7460-1 on-line information to obtain a
     Letter of Determination from the FAA which takes an average of 45 days.
     2.5.3. PM fills out Sections 4 and 6 of the AFMC Form 300. These blocks require a
     description of work to be done, equipment to be used, and any phasing from the
     construction plan. Details as to any closure dates of runway, taxiway(s)/towway(s), or
     apron are included.
     2.5.4. PM prepares a site location map indicating where the construction is located on the
     airfield. The map is to illustrate the violation as described by the CP on the AFMC Form
     300.
     2.5.5. PM sets the meeting (Flight Operations, TERPS, Flight Safety, Community
     Planning, and any other organization(s) that will be affected by this construction project)
     for the preparation of the Operation Risk Management (ORM) process, AFI 90-901,
     Operational Risk Management. PM will complete the RAFB Form 301. The RAFB
     Form 301 will then be signed at the appropriate level as determined by the risk level and
     decision level matrix.

       2.5.6. AM then completes the Mitigation Letter which identifies the mitigating factors
       specific to the construction project. A plan developed by 78 OSS/OSA, Airfield
       Management and coordinated through 78 ABW/SE IAW UFC 3-260-01, Appendix B,
       Paragraph B1-2.2.1.1 demonstrating a mitigation (action) plan for all Airfield TCW.
    2.6. PM then ensures the Form 300, Site Location Map, FAA Determination Letter, RAFB
    Form 301, and Mitigation Letter are all correct and ready to be attached as tabs to an eSSS
    which constitutes the Airfield TCW package.
    2.7. PM then forwards the Airfield TCW package eSSS by workflow to obtain each flying
    units (as applicable) commander’s coordination.
    2.8. The eSSS Airfield TCW package is returned to the PM who now forwards through
    workflow to the 78 CEG/CL, 78 ABW/SEF, 78 OSS/CC, 78 OSS/OSA, 78 ABW/SC and
    AFMC/TERPS for 78 ABW/CC signatures on the AFMC Form 300 and the RAFB Form 301
    as applicable.
    2.9. Upon returned coordination from each of the above the PM, then sends eSSS Airfield
    TCW package through workflow to the Installation Commander for approval.
    2.10. PM monitors and tracks the Airfield TCW throughout the process to insure the
    package is moving in a timely manner. The tracking sheet for all Airfield TCWs is located
    on the 778 Civil Engineering Squadron Web Site under Airfield TCW. This process should
    take no longer than 60 days (depending on FAA Determination Letter duration) from date
    PM starts the package in para 3.5 until transmitted to stakeholders. NOTE: Throughout the
    various stages in the Airfield TCW process, each time the PM handles the Airfield TCW
    package there is an annotation to the tracking sheet in order to ensure the package is moving
    in a timely manner. No office should take longer than 5 working days to coordinate/sign as
    required.

Terms
Airfield TCW: An Airfield TCW is obtained when one or more elements of a construction
project (equipment, facilities, construction vehicles etc.) violate airfield and airspace
criteria in accordance with UFC 3—260-01. Airfield TCW should only be planned for the
duration of the planned construction project unless circumstances dictate otherwise. Additional
time may be added to the waiver time period to allow for potential weather delays or other
acceptable delays.
Airfield TCW Approval Authority: As required by UFC 3—260-01, Appendix B, Paragraph
B1-2.3.4, all TCWs for airfield construction must be approved by the Installation Commander.
Airfield TCW Requests: The PM will prepare waiver requests using AFMC Form 300 as
the approval document and coordinate with all affected installation organizations,
including those identified in UFC 3—260-01, Appendix B, Section 2. When coordination is
received, the PM will send the request to the installation commander for approval. When the
waiver request is approved by the installation commander, the PM will send notice to all
stakeholders that the Installation Commander has approved an Airfield TCW.
Violation description—: To include, but not limited to, dimensions, construction materials,
frangibility, supporting equipment, utilities and appurtenances, height above ground level,
facility use/contents and number of occupants. If there are multiple violations describe all
violations.
Violation(s) location—: Thorough description of the noncompliance with airfield design
criteria to include a clear statement of what the violation(s) are with applicable UFC references.
Provide distance(s) of violation(s) from runways, taxiways, aprons, or other applicable airfield
clearances, imaginary surfaces, or prohibited land use areas. Provide all data for each criterion
violated (e.g. show violations in the longitudinal and transverse directions for facilities sited in
clear zones).
Airfield TCW justification: Discuss all operational concerns that relate to the violation.
Include an operational risk analysis completed in accordance with AFI 90—901,
Operational Risk Management. The results shall include all known hazards associated with the
proposed action, a risk code using the risk assessment matrix for each hazard, and a description
of all risk control measures needed to minimize the associated risk involved with the proposed
action. Describe all safety precautions and mitigation measures that will be implemented to
minimize the risks associated with the violation.
Site construction plan/phasing—: Provide a site location map in PDF, JPG, or PowerPoint
Format showing the location of the proposed construction site and applicable violation(s). The
site plan(s) should portray all proposed and existing facilities, utilities, infrastructure, and
support equipment with respect to regulated airfield surfaces and imaginary surfaces. Site plans
must include all distances in feet from affected runways, taxiways, and aprons. Depict violations
protruding into transitional slopes in a graphic manner with dimensions in feet. Any
construction phasing (sectional periods of construction) should be delineated and construction
time tables for each phase noted. Closure of the runway or any taxiways will be predetermined
and the dates for closure included in the site plan. Mitigation closure of any portion of the
airfield will be mitigated by the 78 OSS Airfield Manager, who will work the closure period(s)
ROBINSAFBI32-110 10 JULY 2013                                                                 7
