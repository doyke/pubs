                                                     AICUZ OVERVIEW

1.1. Introduction. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program is a Department of Defense (DoD)
planning program which was developed in response to growing incompatible urban development (encroachment) around
military airfields. The Air Force AICUZ program policy is to promote compatible land use through participation in local,
regional, state and federal land use planning control and coordination processes.
1.1.1. Most Air Force installations were built in the 1940’s and early 1950’s and in relatively remote areas. Since then,
urban growth has extended toward the boundaries of many of these installations. Problems result when complaints over the
effects of aircraft operations (e.g. noise, low overflight, etc.) lead to operational changes which negatively impact the flying
mission. Incompatible encroachment has been a contributor to the cessation of flying mission and base closures at
installations such as Lowry AFB in Colorado, Chanute AFB in Illinois, and Laredo AFB in Texas.
1.1.2. As communities grow and expand, it is only natural that they become more interested in orderly development. This
should include adequate provisions to protect the Air Force facilities which are an integral part of the communities physical
and economic structure.
1.1.3. The Air Force has been successful in encouraging the adoption of enabling legislation for planning compatible
development around airfields in Arizona, Texas, and Alabama. Other states such as California have adopted legislation
after recognizing the need to protect all airfields from encroachment. The Air Force encourages the adoption of state
enabling legislation for this purpose, and will cooperate with the appropriate authorities regarding its implementation.

1.2. Program Objectives. The AICUZ program has two objectives. First to assist local, regional, state and federal
officials in protecting and promoting the public health, safety, and welfare by promoting compatible development within the
AICUZ area of influence. Then To protect Air Force operational capability from the effects of land use which are
incompatible with aircraft operations.
1.2.1. The AICUZ study must be consistent with current land use planning principles and procedures as well as current
techniques in noise assessment methodology. Also, it must adequately describe current air operations and procedures and
provide recommendations for compatible land use development based on nationally recognized standards. In some cases,
projections for future air operations are included in the AICUZ study if the community requests it. The inclusion of future
projections in the AICUZ must avoid releasing new information scheduled to be released through the Environmental Impact
Analysis Process (EIAP). If future projections are planned to be included, approval from the MAJCOM/CE is required.
The AICUZ should relate to state laws, enabling legislation, and local economic and political conditions. The AICUZ is not
an end in itself but rather one of many land use determinants used by local planners and decision makers. The AICUZ
study must have a factual and rational basis.

1.3. Regulatory Basis. Several documents provide the regulatory basis for the AICUZ program:
1.3.1. DoD Instruction 4165.57 establishes and requires the military departments to develop, implement, and maintain an
AICUZ program for installations with flying operations. This DoDI:
1.3.1.1. Sets forth DoD policy on achieving compatible use of public and private lands in the vicinity of military airfields,
1.3.1.2. Defines (a) required restrictions on the uses and heights of obstructions in the vicinity of air installations to provide
for safety of flight and to assure that people and facilities are not concentrated in areas susceptible to aircraft accidents, and
(b) desirable restrictions on land use to assure its compatibility, with the characteristics, including noise, of air installations
operations,
1.3.1.3. Describes the procedures by which the AICUZ may be defined, and
1.3.1.4. Provides policy on the extent of Government interest in real property within those zones which may be retained or
acquired to protect the operational capability of active military airfields (subject in each case to the availability of required
authorizations and appropriations).
1.3.2. The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Management Circular (FMC) 75-2 entitled “Compatible Land
Uses at Federal Airfields” requires federal agencies that operate airfields to work with local, regional, state, and other
federal officials on compatible land use planning. It requires other federal agencies to ensure their programs serve and
foster compatible land use according to plans (such as AICUZ) developed by the federal agency operating an airfield. It
requires HUD, VA, FHA and other Federal agencies to implement the AICUZ program as they are able under their
mandate.
1.3.3. AFI 32-7063, “Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Program” sets forth the policy, responsibilities, and
requirements of the program. Topics covered include program objectives, responsibilities, land use compatibility
guidelines, and AICUZ studies and updating.

1.3.4. AFJM 32-8008 (formerly AFM 86-14), “Airfield and Heliport Planning Criteria” provides standardized criteria for
all DoD service components for planning and developing the layout of runways, taxiways, aprons, and related facilities for
airfields and heliports. It provides criteria for establishing planes and surfaces of navigational airspace surrounding the
airfields and heliports for the purpose of controlling potential obstructions to aircraft operations.
1.3.5. AFMAN 32-7067 (formerly AFM 19-10), “Planning in the Noise Environment” is a Tri-Service manual which
discusses noise characteristics, noise sources, effects of noise, noise monitoring, tools for noise analysis and reducing noise
conflicts.
1.3.6. AFI 13-201, “Air Force Airspace Management” establishes practices to decrease disturbances from flight operations
that might cause adverse public reaction, and provides flying unit commanders with general guidance for dealing with local
problems. This instruction sets forth the AICUZ responsibilities of the flying operation organizations at Air Force
installations.

1.4. Evolution of the AICUZ Program. The military services, particularly the Air Force, have been advocates of noise
planning for a long time. Many aspects of the noise program presently used for civilian airports have their roots in the Air
Force’s experiences.
1.4.1. Background. As early as 1957, the Air Force began establishing procedures for estimating noise exposure and
gauging community reaction to aircraft operations. By 1964, the Air Force was working on the relationship between land
use planning and aircraft noise. Even at that early time, the Air Force recognized the need to address noise from a land use
planning perspective. The Air Force’s major concern is the threat posed to the flying mission at an installation as a result
of incompatible development.
1.4.1.1. The late 1960’s and early 1970’s was the beginning of the environmental movement. Emphasis on incorporating
environmental concerns into the planning process was a major push. Notable events included Air Force research on sonic
boom exposure in the 1960’s, FAA’s civilian aircraft certification in 1969, the National Environmental Policy Act in 1970,
and the Noise Control Act in 1972. These efforts only served to increase the awareness of the military on noise planning
issues and to provide the basis for institutionalizing its programs.
1.4.1.2. In 1971, the Greenbelt concept was initiated by the Air Force to address the growing problem of incompatible
development around airfields (encroachment). The idea behind “Greenbelt” was to establish a buffer zone around the
installation through the purchase of property. For obvious budgetary considerations, this concept proved to be economically
infeasible.
1.4.2. Noise Description. 1973 marked the year the AICUZ program, as it is known in the Air Force, was implemented.
The Air Force adopted the NOISEMAP computer program to describe noise impacts created by aircraft operations.
NOISEMAP is one of two EPA approved programs. The other is the Integrated Noise Model (INM) which is used by the
FAA for civilian airports. The Air Force continues to improve the NOISEMAP program.
1.4.2.1. The next significant event in the development of the military noise program was the 1974 EPA designation of the
noise descriptor “DNL”, or Day-Night Average Sound Level. DNL refers to the average sound level exposure, measured in
decibels, over a 24 hour period. A 10 decibel penalty is added to sound levels for operations occurring during the hours of
10 PM to 7 AM. This penalty is applied due to the increased annoyance created by noise events which occur during this
time. DNL is a quantity that can be calculated directly at a specific location. In 1974, the Administrator of the EPA, under
authority in the Noise Control Act of 1972 recommended to all federal agencies adoption of the DNL noise descriptor
system. The Air Force and EPA agreed upon an implementation procedure by which all future AICUZ studies would be
prepared in DNL.
1.4.2.2. The development of DNL was an important milestone in the AICUZ program. It provides a single descriptor for
the noise level. This reduced confusion, increased credibility and allowed for comparative research efforts on the effects of
noise. More details on the DNL concept are presented in Attachment 2.
1.4.3. Height Restrictions. Another aspect of the AICUZ program which is paralleled in the civilian community is the
height obstruction criteria. U.S. standard instrument approach and departure procedures (Joint Air Force, Navy, Army, and
FAA Criteria Handbook - AFM 55-9) prescribes flight path area and vertical clearances from terrain and manmade
obstructions. The restrictions limit the height of buildings and other structures in the vicinity of the airfield in order to
ensure the safety of pilots, aircraft and individuals and structures on the ground. AFJM 32-8008 provides more details on
the height restriction criteria.
1.4.4. Accident Potential Zones. Accident Potential Zones (APZs) are one aspect of the AICUZ program where military
application differs from civilian airfields. An analysis of aircraft accidents within 10 nautical miles of an airfield for the
period of 1968 - 1972 led to defining areas of high accident potential known as the Clear Zone (CZ), Accident Potential
Zone I (APZ I), and Accident Potential Zone II (APZ II). The majority of these accidents (62%) occurred either on or
adjacent to the airfield or within the CZ, while only about 8% occurred in APZ I and 5% in APZ II. It was concluded that
the CZ warranted special attention due to the high incident of accident potential that severely limited acceptable land uses.
The Air Force has spent approximately $65 million to acquire real property interests within the clear zones. The
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                     5

percentages of accidents within the two APZs are such that, while purchase is not necessary, some type of land use control
is essential. The Air Force recommendation is to limit the number of people exposed through selective land use planning.
Attachment 3 provides more detail on accident potential.
1.4.5. Land Use Guidelines. Most complaints are related to noise generated by aircraft operations. Noise around an
airport is a fact of life, however, as aircraft operations increase the noise exposure increases and complaints increase with
demands for noise reductions. In most cases, noise reduction is accomplished by restricting airfield or aircraft operations.
1.4.5.1. The Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON), published “Guidelines for Considering Noise in Land Use
Planning and Control” in June 1980. The committee, now called FICAN (Federal Interagency Committee on Aircraft
Noise) is made up of representatives from federal departments that include Transportation, Defense, Environmental
Protection Agency, Veterans Administration, and Housing and Urban Development. The purpose of these guidelines is to
encourage the best land use, consistent with community planning objectives, while minimizing exposure to excessive noise
levels. Table A4.1, “Air Force AICUZ Land Use Compatibility with respect to Noise and Accident Potential” in
Attachment 4, contains the official Air Force recommendations on land use within these zones.
1.4.6. Noise Reduction Efforts. Military and civilian noise planning efforts have benefited from mutual interest and
efforts. One area is research and development. Developing quieter engines for the KC-135, for example, came about
through commercial efforts to reduce fuel costs and noise impacts of the Boeing 707. Other efforts have gone into
developing engine test facilities, or hush houses, where engines can run at full power with dramatically reduced noise
effects to the surrounding environment. Noise abatement procedures are also practiced in Air Force flight scheduling and
aircraft operating procedures. Modifications to flight tracks, imposition of quite hours and use of preferential runways are
all techniques used by both the military and civilian airfields to reduce noise. At most installations, Air Force noise
reduction efforts have been used to their maximum degree, and land use planning and controls are the answer for further
protection of the community.
1.4.7. Conclusion. In summary, the differences between noise concerns for the military and the civilian sector continue to
decrease. The exchange of technical noise information and assistance is needed to address and solve similar problems.
Requests from the civilian side to jointly use military airfields are increasing. The Air Force presently has several joint use
airfields. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units operate from several major commercial airports across the
country. There are also large scale joint service operations that include activities at civilian airports. Therefore, both
civilian and military airfield operators need to understand each other’s mission requirements and their implication with
regard to noise and land use planning.
1.4.7.1. The overall goal of the Air Force AICUZ program is to reduce people’s exposure to high levels of aircraft noise
and accident potential through compatible land use controls adopted by the local communities. To this end, the Air Force
initiated a program to assist local communities in implementing AICUZ recommendations. This program is called the Joint
Land Use Study (JLUS) program and is described in Chapter 2. Meanwhile, the Air Force must continue to provide the
public with current information which will assist them in making prudent land use decisions, and work cooperatively
together to resolve the problems of growth and encroachment.

                                       THE FIVE PHASES OF AN AICUZ STUDY

2.1. Introduction. This chapter describes in detail the five phases or steps for preparing an AICUZ study. The five phases
to prepare an AICUZ study are:
     Phase I: Data Collection and Analysis
     Phase II: Data Review and Validation
     Phase III: Preparation of AICUZ Report or Amendment
     Phase IV: Public Release of AICUZ Report or Amendment
     Phase V: AICUZ Implementation and Maintenance
2.1.1. The five-phase AICUZ process is ongoing. Nearly all air installations have completed and released initial AICUZ
studies, although some installations remain exempt due to minimal flying operations or having a DNL 65 noise contour
which does not extend beyond the installation’s boundaries. Duties of the installation AICUZ Program Manager include
preparing and releasing updated AICUZ studies. The AICUZ data validation process occurs every two years or as part of
the NEPA process.
2.1.2. An accurate AICUZ study requires the full support and participation from all installation functions including the
Installation Commander, Civil Engineering, Bioenvironmental Engineering, Legal Office, Public Affairs, Base Operations,
the flying wings, Air Traffic Control, Aircraft Maintenance, Safety, Weather, Comptroller, and other appropriate functional
areas. The installation Environmental Protection Committee (EPC) coordinates the AICUZ process. Support and
participation by each functional area are particularly important during the data collection and analysis phase, but should
occur throughout the entire AICUZ process. These shared responsibilities are described in Chapter 3 as well as in AFI 32-
7063 and AFI 13-201.

2.2. Phase I -- Data Collection and Analysis.
2.2.1. Procedure for Data Collection. The AICUZ Program Manager is primarily responsible for coordinating the
collection of AICUZ data and ensuring an accurate data package is used in the preparation of the noise contours. Chapter 4
of this handbook describes in detail how to collect and format the data, personnel to contact, and the responsibilities of
specific Air Force personnel at installation level and higher headquarters. Once the data has been validated, the noise
contours can be produced using the computer noise modeling program, NOISEMAP. During the preparation of the noise
contours, the level of change in the AICUZ noise contour is analyzed, thereby determining the level of update required.
2.2.1.1. The AICUZ Program Manager should ensure the flight operational data obtained for the preparation of the noise
contours is a reasonable and accurate description of the flight operations at the airfield. The data collection process covers
both military and civilian aircraft activities at the airfield. The operations of aircraft assigned to the installation as well as
transient aircraft operations occurring at the installation should be taken into consideration. Throughout the data collection
process, a number of sources are contacted for information on operations of the assigned and transient aircraft. Sources of
this information include Air Traffic Control, flying organizations, base operations, flight schedules, and unit logs.
2.2.1.2. The AICUZ Program Manager reviews the AICUZ operational and maintenance data at least once every two years
or as part of an Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) evaluation. This review is required to determine the need
for an AICUZ update. By 1 July (each even year), each MAJCOM/CE must complete the biennial AICUZ Status Survey
(RCS: HAF-CEV (BE) 9426) containing an AICUZ status update and review schedule for the next two years for each
installation having an AICUZ requirement, as called for by AFCEE/EC. Each Base Civil Engineer (following EPC
coordination) must send the MAJCOM/CE either updated data on aircraft operations or a statement indicating the data used
for the current published AICUZ study or amendment is still valid. The MAJCOM/CE must send AFCEE/EC updated
operational and maintenance data on each installation in the major command or notification indicating current data is still
valid.
2.2.1.3. The installation AICUZ Program Manager, MAJCOM/CE and AFCEE/ECC maintain and update the AICUZ file
and any historic documentation. Policy requires most AICUZ data and information be permanently retained. AFMAN 37-
139, Records Disposition--Standards, includes regulations applicable to AICUZ file retention.
2.2.2. The Noise Screening Method. The threshold for AICUZ updating actions is a change in Day-Night Average Sound
Level (DNL) of 2 dB or more in a noise sensitive or controversial area from the last publicly released noise exposure map.
The noise modeling computer program, NOISEMAP, determines if the dB threshold has been exceeded at selected critical
locations. Appropriate data on aircraft operational changes should be prepared in accordance with Chapter 4 of this
Handbook. Collect the data and process in NOISEMAP on an annual basis, if possible, but at least every two years, or as
required by EIAP. The NOISEMAP processing will determine if the 2 dB threshold has been exceeded.
2.2.3. Land Use Issues. The installation AICUZ Program Manager or Base Community Planner is responsible for
maintaining current land use information. This information is derived from an analysis of all projects affecting land use
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                    7

within the AICUZ. An evaluation should be made of incompatible land use and population in the AICUZ to determine if
encroachment may affect the existing mission. The encroachment could impact both operational procedures and flight
tracks. Below are the descriptions or analyses:
       Existing land use in the AICUZ environs.
       Existing zoning in the AICUZ environs.
       Population within the noise contours in the AICUZ environs
       Future land use in the AICUZ environs.
       Planned developments in the AICUZ environs.
       Incompatible land use in the AICUZ environs.
2.2.3.1. Existing Land Use and Zoning. The installation planner should update the existing land use and existing zoning
maps used in the previously published AICUZ study or amendment. Existing land use is defined as the pattern and type of
actual development. The planner should obtain existing land use maps and reports from the local government agency.
Where local government maps are not available, the AICUZ program manager must develop the existing land use maps.
This may be accomplished by performing a ground survey and sketching existing land uses on a base and/or area maps or
by using aerial photography or other imagery to define land uses. In addition, existing zoning information (i.e., maps and
ordinances) and population within the noise contours should be obtained. Existing zoning may not be the same as actual
development. It represents what is currently permitted to be developed. It is important to obtain the full zoning ordinance
for both evaluation and reference.
2.2.3.1.1. The planner should obtain copies of the local ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, planned unit
development ordinances, etc. Furthermore, background reports or any documents describing existing conditions within the
community, which seem relevant to the broad purposes of AICUZ, such as planning background studies, school surveys,
economic reports, etc., should be obtained. Information on land ownership may also be useful. In addition, the planner
should conduct a visual survey of the area (i.e., take a drive) to identify new activity not in current maps or plans.
2.2.3.1.2. Maps or reports of the following data may also be useful: soils, topography, flood plain maps, hydrology,
surficial geology, physiographic features, other ecological data, and census or other demographic data.
2.2.3.1.3. For mapping purposes and to facilitate analysis for the AICUZ, the land use categories typically included in an
AICUZ document are:
2.2.3.1.3.1. Residential: This category includes all types of residential activity, such as single and multi-family residences
and mobile homes, at a density greater than one dwelling unit per acre.
2.2.3.1.3.2. Commercial: This category includes offices, retail, restaurants and other types of commercial establishments.
2.2.3.1.3.3. Industrial: This category includes manufacturing, warehousing, and other similar uses.
2.2.3.1.3.4. Public/Quasi-Public: This category includes publicly owned lands and/or lands to which the public has
access, including military reservations and training grounds, public buildings, schools, churches, cemeteries, and hospitals.
2.2.3.1.3.5. Recreational: This category includes land areas designated for recreational activity, including parks,
wilderness areas and reservations, conservation areas, and areas designated for trails, hikes, camping, etc.
2.2.3.1.3.6. Open/Agriculture/Low Density: This category includes undeveloped land areas, agricultural areas, grazing
lands and areas with residential activity at densities less than or equal to one dwelling unit per acre.
2.2.3.1.3.7. Miscellaneous: In addition to the above designations of land uses, the AICUZ document identifies important
complexes within the AICUZ, such as hospitals, schools, coliseum, or other areas identified by the installation.
2.2.3.1.4. Once the above maps have been obtained, an updated narrative summary of existing land use and zoning should
be prepared for the AICUZ area. This discussion should include, but not be limited to, the following: The location of major
developments, cities, or towns with respect to the installation. A review of the existing land uses by category (e.g.,
residential, commercial, industrial, etc.) and a general description of their location within the AICUZ. A review of the
zoning map and zoning changes (if applicable). This review should compare the amount of land zoned with the actual
amount of land within the AICUZ. In addition, significant zoning changes should be reviewed.
2.2.3.1.5. When reviewing local ordinances, some of the items to look for are:
2.2.3.1.5.1. Planned Unit Development Ordinances (may also be known as Planned Residential Development, Planned
Commercial Districts, or Cluster Zoning): These ordinances look at a development as being a single entity rather than a
collection of individual lots. In contrast to standard zoning, there are very few requirements for minimum lot dimensions,
rear yard size minimums, etc. Requirements are geared more towards the quality of the spaces, how usable yards are rather
than how big, and the dedication of open spaces and facilities for community use.
2.2.3.1.5.2. Site Plan Review Process: In the zoning ordinance, each development proposal is carefully scrutinized by the
planning staff on the basis of an expanded set of criteria. This allows the community greater control over certain uses.
Rather than set forth a “recipe” supposedly satisfying all situations, the planning board treats each development as a unique
project to be evaluated individually.
8                                                                                           AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

2.2.3.1.5.3. Bonus and Incentive Plans: A community attempting to improve the quality of development in the area may
implement a bartering system with developers. For instance, the community may relax density regulations (permitted
number of dwelling units per acre), if the developer provides playgrounds.
2.2.3.1.5.4. Use of Performance Standards Rather Than Specifications: This can evidence itself in building codes as
well as other regulatory ordinances. For example, a performance specification could require all interior water pipes be
copper and two inches in diameter. In contrast, a performance standard could require all interior pipes be capable of
handling a specific water pressure, whether they be copper and two inches in diameter or plastic and 1 1/2 inches in
diameter.
2.2.3.1.5.5. Historical Trends , of items reviewed above, should be discussed.
2.2.3.1.5.6. Summary Tables should be included.
2.2.3.2. Future Land Use. A future land use map will be developed. The main source for data is the local planning or
zoning commission. Other data should be available from appropriate agencies (i.e., school board, chamber of commerce,
water district, etc.). At the regional level, Councils of Government or regional planning commissions should be able to
provide necessary data. Data for state plans should be obtained from the appropriate state agency. In addition, the
following data may be obtained:
2.2.3.2.1. Local Comprehensive Plans: Maps and reports are available. The planner should obtain maps of sufficient
detail and scale to provide useful information. If area-wide maps of sufficient detail are not available, determine whether
sub-area plans have been or are being developed.
2.2.3.2.2. Regional Comprehensive Plans: Maps and reports are available. In many cases, comprehensive plans are
prepared by a jurisdictional regional body such as a council of governments or a regional planning commission.
Alternatively, the regional body may prepare the area-wide plans and the local jurisdiction may prepare the sub-area plans.
2.2.3.2.3. Other Local Plans: Maps and documents are available. Examples include housing, population, economic base,
income and employment studies, utility plans, transportation plans, school and other capital improvement programs, etc.
These plans will cover the various elements comprising the infrastructure necessary for the future community. Because they
often contain short-term programs as well as long-range plans, these plans should reflect growth patterns clearly.
2.2.3.2.4. Other Regional and State Plans: Maps and documents can be obtained. Any community may have elements
partially controlled or impacted by the actions of state or regional agencies. Example agencies include the highway
departments, parks and recreational departments, coastal zone management, water management, etc. These state or
regional agencies should be contacted for maps or plans relating to the AICUZ area.
2.2.3.2.5. Once this information has been obtained and analyzed, land use categorization within the AICUZ area can be
determined based on the land use categories described in section 2.2.3.1. An updated land use map can then be developed.
2.2.3.2.6. The next step is to create an updated analysis on future land use. As a baseline, the planner can use the Future
Land Use Analysis in the previously published AICUZ study or amendment. The analysis should include a summary of the
future land use and development plans for the jurisdictions surrounding the installation. Local jurisdictions to survey are:
municipalities, counties or parishes, regional councils, EO 12372 designated agencies and single points of contact, special
districts (schools, sewer, water, fire, flood control, soil conservation, etc.), and utility companies. The Directory of State
Environmental Planning Agencies lists and describes state agencies to contact. Also see Appendix A-4 of Volume II,
Interim Environmental Planning Bulletin 14. Volume II of Interim Environmental Planning Bulletin 15 contains guidance
for surveying federal agency plans. The Future Land Use Analysis should discuss the following for each jurisdiction
surrounding the installation:
2.2.3.2.6.1. An assessment of the realistic expansion of municipal services to undeveloped areas.
2.2.3.2.6.2. An assessment of the geophysical characteristics influencing growth. These include wetlands and flood plains.
2.2.3.2.6.3. A review of general determinants influencing area growth, such as economic development, completion of
proposed highways, and general marketability of the area.
2.2.3.2.6.4. Plans for designation of open space or recreation areas near the installation.
2.2.3.2.6.5. An assessment of the impact the installation has on the community’s rate of growth.
2.2.3.3. Land Use Compatibility Narrative Analysis. Once the planner has updated the zoning and land use maps, the
next step is to prepare the Land Use Compatibility Narrative Analysis using the analyses developed in the previously
released AICUZ as the baseline. Existing operations, future operations, existing civilian community, and future civilian
community are four main elements to consider when analyzing land use in the AICUZ vicinity.
2.2.3.3.1. The review and analysis of these four elements are essential in evaluating opportunities to reduce noise exposure
and propose usable recommendations to communities. Information on existing and future aircraft operations and
installation configurations are available within the Air Force. Land use information must be obtained from civilian
sources. AICUZ activities must anticipate and respond to the pressures and thrusts of the civil community. This can only
be accomplished by identification and analysis of both existing and future operations and existing and future land use.
Using the updated existing land use, existing zoning, and future land use maps, the degree and nature of existing and future
incompatible and conditionally incompatible land uses should be thoroughly discussed. Subjects to be addressed are:
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                    9

2.2.3.3.1.1. What are the determining land use factors?
2.2.3.3.1.2. What are the future land use alternatives?
2.2.3.3.1.3. How can the future land use be directed or redirected?
2.2.3.3.1.4. Who decides the future land use pattern?
2.2.3.3.1.5. What actions has the Air Force taken to reduce conflicts? What actions by the community?
2.2.3.3.1.6. What can the Air Force do to reduce incompatible land uses?
2.2.3.3.1.7. What recommendations should be made to other government agencies?
2.2.3.3.2. Wyle Research Report, WR 89-7, “Guidelines for the Sound Insulation of Residence Exposed to Aircraft
Operations” is a study which provides improved methods for attaining noise level reductions for various structures
mitigating impacts of high aircraft noise levels.

2.3. Phase II -- Data Review and Validation. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone program, like any successful
activity, is dependent on the quality, accuracy, and completeness of its database. A program like AICUZ requires more
comprehensive treatment than others because the data may be used for plans that could eventually be translated into local
law or ordinances. There is also the possibility the data could be challenged in a court of law. Phase II provides the quality
assurance the AICUZ program requires.
2.3.1. Objective. The purpose of Phase II of the AICUZ program is to provide quality assurance for data collected during
Phase I. During Phase II, the major command reviews the Phase I data package for adequacy. Data packages will vary
from installation to installation. A comprehensive review helps to identify and correct deficiencies before they are publicly
released. In some portions of the program, a significant degree of judgment must be exercised, particularly in the analysis
of land use compatibility. The analysis one installation submits may be adequate, while the same level of effort would be
unacceptable from another. Judgment should be based on an appraisal of the local situation. In addition to determining the
content and quality of Phase I data, Phase II offers the opportunity to identify instances where major command assistance is
required. Comprehensive land use planning is conducted throughout the phases of an AICUZ study. Errors or omissions in
Phase I can easily compromise subsequent phases.
2.3.2. There are five basic procedures in Phase II: First determine if all elements of Phase I have been completed. Second
review the nonoperational data elements in detail. Third review the flight and maintenance data elements in detail. Fourth
correct errors and augment insufficient data. Finally review results of item 4.
2.3.2.1. Review of Phase I for Completion. Using guidance from Chapter 4 of this Handbook and comparing previous
studies, the Major Command should review and evaluate each element of the submitted package. Table 2.1 can be used as a
guide to determine if all elements of Phase I have been completed:

Table 2.1. Items Completed During Phase I.

                                               Legal land use issues (court decisions)

2.3.3. Installations have been granted exemptions from the AICUZ program when the data collection and analysis resulted
in noise levels that did not extend beyond Air Force boundaries. Installations have received exemptions when fewer than 10
jet or 25 propeller aircraft operations occur per day. Some installations that released AICUZ studies in the past have since
received waivers allowing them to suspend AICUZ activities. However, having an AICUZ exemption or waiver does not
permanently end an installation’s AICUZ responsibilities. At least every two years, or whenever an Environmental Impact
Analysis Process occurs, or if a number of small operational changes cumulatively exceed the 2 dB threshold, an installation
with an AICUZ waiver should be reevaluated, to determine if the criteria used to establish the waiver remain valid. If the
waiver criteria are no longer valid, the installation must initiate Phase I AICUZ data collection.

2.4. Phase III--Preparation of AICUZ Report or Amendment. Phase III of the AICUZ program includes the
preparation of the final AICUZ report or amendment including production of all maps.
2.4.1. During Phase II, the major command has already reviewed and approved the operational and maintenance data used
to generate the noise footprint. If a new AICUZ is required, the final map graphics are produced for inclusion in the
AICUZ report. Zoning and land use overlays must also be completed using background maps overlaid with noise contours
and accident potential zones. These maps must be professionally reproduced using a minimum of two colors to distinguish
the contour lines from lines on the background map.
2.4.1.1. While final AICUZ maps are being prepared, the Base Civil Engineer initiates preparation of the AICUZ Study
and the Implementation and Maintenance Plan (IMP). Other installation offices such as comptroller, procurement, and
special services assist in preparing the study or amendment. The Public Affairs and Legal Offices assist the Base Civil
Engineer in preparing the AICUZ IMP.
2.4.1.2. The Base Civil Engineer coordinates these documents through the Environmental Protection Committee (EPC),
Legal Office, and Public Affairs in accordance with the guidance in this Handbook and any additional specific guidance
issued by the major command. The major command must approve all documents prior to any public involvement or release.
2.4.2. The AICUZ Study. Each installation with an active, Air Force owned and operated runway (see paragraph 2.4.4 for
joint use installations) prepares, publicly releases, and maintains an AICUZ study defining, and mapping aircraft noise
levels and accident potential areas around the installation. All operations, including those on secondary runways, must be
evaluated in these operational studies. An installation may receive an exemption if the AICUZ does not extend beyond the
installation boundaries or if fewer than 10 jet or 25 propeller-driven aircraft operations occur per day at the installation.
2.4.2.1. An AICUZ study typically reflects current aircraft operations at an installation. An AICUZ study may contain
noise contours based upon flying operations which are proposed in an approved Environmental Assessment (EA) or
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Environmental documentation approval is defined as an EA for which a Finding of
No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been executed or an EIS for which a Record of Decision (ROD) has been executed.
Under certain circumstances, in cooperation with local communities and with approval from MAJCOM/CE, long range
contours based upon true expansion potential of the installation may be included as part of an AICUZ study. Many factors
may go into long range noise contours including but not limited to: likely aircraft types, available apron area for expansion,
and mission and operational needs. To ensure realism in developing these future noise contours, the installation AICUZ
Program Manager must work closely with MAJCOM, Base Operations, Operations Group, Air Traffic Control, Airspace
Management, and Logistics Group. Future noise contours must contain a statement indicating the projected nature of the
contours. In every case where future noise contours are included in an AICUZ study, the study must also include noise
contours for current flying operations or flying operations from an approved EIAP document in order to provide full
disclosure to the public.
2.4.2.1.1. The Environmental Impact Analysis Process serves as a basic source for determining the need for updating an
AICUZ study. An EIAP analyzes proposed actions such as major operational or maintenance modifications, mission
realignments, or mission beddowns. EIAP requires aircraft operational and maintenance data for any change be validated
and fully analyzed (AFPD 32-70, AFI 32-7061, AFI 32-7063, AFI 13-201, and AFI 13-213). Alternatives to reducing noise
exposure may be considered in the process. During the EIAP, analysis will determine if there is a significant impact on the
AICUZ which would necessitate an AICUZ update.
2.4.2.1.2. Sometimes an AICUZ needs updating because a series of small modifications have been made in the flying
mission. Often these changes individually are of little consequence and have been Categorically Excluded (CATEXed)
from NEPA (AFI 32-7061). However, cumulatively, these changes may warrant updating the AICUZ study, particularly
when the 2 dB threshold is exceeded.
2.4.2.2. An AICUZ study typically contains specific land use compatibility recommendations based on analysis of the
relationships between aircraft operational effects and existing land use, existing zoning, and planned or anticipated land
use. The study should include narratives discussing existing and future compatible and incompatible land uses. The
AICUZ study and Implementation and Maintenance Plan (IMP) are prepared according to this AICUZ Handbook and
approved by MAJCOM. Each AICUZ study should contain the elements listed in Table 2.2.

 Implementation and Maintenance Responsibilities Including Public Release Procedures
 Points of Contact

2.4.2.2.1. The maps included in the AICUZ report, Volume 1, should be intermingled with the narrative. The AICUZ
report should include all three volumes, each as a separate volume. However, in some cases, it may be more cost effective to
combine Volumes 1 and 2 into a single volume. If this occurs, Volume 2 should be called the Appendices of Volume 1 and
Volume 3 should be designated Volume 2.
2.4.2.3. The installation may prepare a Citizens Brochure, summarizing the AICUZ process in nontechnical terms and
containing the noise contours and summarized land use compatibility recommendations. These brochures are used in
conjunction with the public release of the full AICUZ report. Sample formats for the AICUZ study, Appendices,
Implementation and Maintenance Plan and Citizens Brochure are provided in Attachment 5 and are also available from
MAJCOM or AFCEE/ECC.
2.4.3. AICUZ Amendments. The major command must approve each AICUZ amendment before public release. An
AICUZ amendment format may be employed in place of a full AICUZ study, if the following conditions are met: If the
current AICUZ study is less than four years old (release date). If changes are few and minor in nature. If little explanation
is needed. If no known controversy exist.
12                                                                                          AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

2.4.3.1. AICUZ studies will no longer include Appendix F, Sample Population Density Guidelines. Installations may
provide, as a separate document, the updated version of the SACOG population density guidance to local officials upon
request.
2.4.3.2. The AICUZ amendment consists of the following elements: Transmittal letter dated and signed by the Group or
Installation commander. Corrected pages for insertion into the latest AICUZ study.
2.4.3.2.1. The AICUZ amendment will be released as follows: First, public notification of mail out release is accomplished
through newspapers and other media two weeks in advance of the mail out. Second, copies mailed simultaneously to all
recipients of the latest public release of the AICUZ study. Finally, copies sent simultaneously to local libraries, agencies,
local governments, organizations, and individuals known to have an interest.
2.4.4. AICUZ Requirements at Joint Use Installations. AICUZ requirements also apply to installations owned and
operated by the Air Force where non-Air Force flying operations are conducted. All flying operations are included in the
AICUZ study.
2.4.4.1. Where the Air Force conducts aircraft operations as part of a joint use arrangement in which the Air Force does not
own or operate the runways, an AICUZ map showing noise contours based on both military and civilian operations is
prepared. The map is submitted to the airfield operator with a request to jointly prepare and publish an AICUZ or similar
study. If the airfield operator does not agree, all AICUZ materials are turned over to the airfield operator and all land use
compatibility matters are referred to the operator. The Air Force assists as required.
2.4.4.2. If an Air Force unit is located on an airfield neither owned nor operated by the Air Force, the MAJCOM/CE must
inform the airfield operators of the AICUZ program and encourage preparation of a joint AICUZ study or equivalent. If the
airfield operator requests an AICUZ study, the Air Force assists as required.
2.4.4.3. At major commercial airports, the NEPA noise requirement is met by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
analyzing noise contours developed using their methodology, the Integrated Noise Model (INM). If desired, AFRES or
ANGRC units at commercial airports can generate a NOISEMAP noise contour grid file based only on the Air Force
aircraft activity. The NOISEMAP grid file can then be combined with the FAA (INM noise contour) grid file using either a
Geographic Information System (GIS) or the plotting portion of NOISEMAP called NMPLOT. Where the commercial
airport operator has previously released airport noise contours, care must be taken to ensure any noise contours released by
the Air Force do not conflict with those published by the FAA.
2.4.4.4. During an EIAP action at a joint use airfield (not operated by the Air Force), a noise zone map is prepared for a
proposed operational or maintenance change, mission realignment, or mission beddown and then given to the airfield
operator once a FONSI or ROD has been signed. If a commercial airport operator has already published a noise map for the
airfield, the noise methodology (INM or NOISEMAP) used in the original release may be used to update the published noise
maps in the EIAP. If an AICUZ study has already been released, it must be amended to show the changes.
2.4.4.5. The only time the Air Force will use INM is when an Air Force installation is converting to civil aviation use only.
INM can not be use to adequately address ground runup noise and existing noise scenarios involving military only or joint
use operations. NOISEMAP can evaluate specific flying characteristics at specific bases, whereas INM is geared to routine
flying operations at typical airports.
2.4.4.5.1. When an Air Force airfield is proposed for conversion to civil aviation use, but will retain military activity, use
the NOISEMAP Model with minimum noise contour of 65 DNL. For California use Community Noise Equivalent Level
(CNEL) noise contours as well as DNL noise contours, all beginning with 60 dB. When the installation is converting to
civil use only use the Integrated Noise Model (INM).

2.5. Phase IV -- Public Release of an AICUZ Study or Amendment. Following the incorporation of reviewers’
comments and major command approval, Phase IV begins and the AICUZ study or amendment is released to the general
public and government officials.
2.5.1. Generally, the installation commander releases the AICUZ study or amendment in a public meeting. The installation
CE, DO, PA, and JA assist the commander in all phases of the public release. For unique cases, MAJCOM/CE may
consider waiving the public meeting requirement. To receive a waiver, the installation commander must prepare and
submit a waiver request along with full explanation and justification to MAJCOM/CE. If a waiver is approved, copies of
the amendment are sent simultaneously to all parties who would have been invited to the public meeting or who received a
previous study or amendment. Furthermore, advance notice of the release is placed in the media and copies of the AICUZ
study or amendment are made available to the general public (placed at local libraries, given upon request, etc.). Following
the public release, a copy of the AICUZ study or amendment is sent to each state single point of contact identified in EO
12372. Copies of the AICUZ study or amendment are also sent to other pertinent state and local review agencies designated
under the state process.
2.5.2. Phase IV places the AICUZ program into the public forum. During this phase, a coordinated team effort is
imperative to ensure those who may be affected by the AICUZ are brought into the planning process and to provide
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                  13

additional guidance and clarification, if needed. Chapter VI, Section B.2 and Appendix E-1 of the IICEP Handbook
covering Coordination with Civilian Agencies (IEPB 14) should be reviewed at this time and used as guidance.
2.5.2.1. Typically the public release meeting is held off base to encourage maximum participation and avoid the perception
of undue influence by the base. A good or bad location could set the tone for the entire meeting. All Air Force participants
need to provide clear, concise, and consistent information so the base’s goals and objectives are apparent to the public.
2.5.3. The appropriate Air Force Regional Compliance Office coordinates the release of the study or amendment with
appropriate federal regional officials. The Regional Compliance Offices are divisions of the Air Force Center for
Environmental Excellence and are located in Atlanta (AFCEE/CCR-A), Dallas (AFCEE/CCR-D), and San Francisco
(AFCEE/CCR-S).
2.5.3.1. HQ USAF/ILEV coordinates distribution of the study or amendment to federal agency and congressional officials
in Washington, DC. Prior to public release, congressional coordination is conducted through the Secretary of the Air Force,
Office of Legislative Liaison.
2.5.3.2. In order to ensure proper coordination with appropriate state and federal agencies and congressional delegations, it
is necessary to send the following to arrive at least 10 days prior to the public release meeting:
2.5.3.2.1. Twelve (12) copies of the AICUZ study or amendment, two (2) copies of the Citizens Brochure, and one (1) copy
of the AICUZ Implementation and Maintenance Plan (IMP) to HQ USAF/ILEV. Notification to HQ USAF/ILEV should be
made by telephone when the package is shipped.
2.5.3.2.2. Six (6) or the appropriate number of copies of the AICUZ study or amendment and one (1) copy of the IMP to
the appropriate Regional Compliance Office (AFCEE/CCR-A, AFCEE/CCR-D, or AFCEE/CCR-S).
2.5.3.2.3. Two (2) copies of the AICUZ study or amendment, one (1) copy of the IMP, and two (2) copies of the Citizens
Brochure to MAJCOM/CE.
2.5.3.2.4. One (1) copy of the AICUZ study or amendment, one (1) copy of the IMP, and one (1) copy of the Citizens
Brochure to AFCEE/ECC.
2.5.3.3. The actual public release date must be coordinated with MAJCOM/CE, HQ USAF/ILEV, and the appropriate
Regional Compliance Office (AFCEE/CCR-A, CCR-D or CCR-S). Federal agencies normally require at least a 21-day
advance notice of the public release date for their review and scheduling purposes.
2.5.3.4. At least 21 days prior to public release, the Regional Compliance Office will distribute copies along with a cover
letter announcing the date and location of the public release meeting to appropriate federal agency regional offices, each
state single point of contact identified in EO 12372 and other state and local contacts in accordance with state and local
Memoranda of Understanding.
2.5.4. Where possible or feasible, an updated AICUZ study or amendment should be prepared simultaneously with the
Environmental Assessment and/or Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Updated AICUZ studies should be publicly
released in accordance with AFI 32-7063 after a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been made or a Record of
Decision has been finalized.
2.5.5. Following release of the AICUZ study or amendment, the installation should forward periodic progress reports to
MAJCOM/CE, who in turn consolidates and sends progress reports to HQ USAF/ILEV, AFCEE/ECC, and the appropriate
Regional Compliance Office on the release status such as: recommendations implemented or possible litigation action. In
all cases where adverse governmental or public reaction occurs, HQ USAF/ILEV, MAJCOM/CE, AFCEE/ECC, and the
appropriate Regional Compliance Office should be notified and provided with details. Such information allows these
offices to achieve necessary coordination with other agencies and respond to questions in a timely manner.
2.5.6. At the installation, a copy of the AICUZ study or amendment is maintained in the Housing Referral Office, Public
Affairs, Legal Office, and Civil Engineering. An enlarged copy of the AICUZ map should be displayed in a conspicuous
location at the Housing Referral Office. This ensures Air Force personnel seeking off-base housing will be aware of the
noise or accident potential impacting adjacent land areas.

2.6. Phase V -- AICUZ Implementation and Maintenance. After the AICUZ study or amendment is prepared and
released, the installation is ready to begin the most important aspect of the program -- Implementation and Maintenance.
The basis for implementing AICUZ guidelines lies in the exercising of police powers by local governments to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare. Through conveyance of these powers from the state, local governments adopt and enforce
zoning regulations and other land use controls. These controls are the primary tools for protecting Air Force installations
from encroachment by incompatible development. The following sections discuss specific methods, strategies, and actions
for the Air Force to use in promoting implementation of AICUZ recommendations. Included is a discussion of the Joint
Land Use Study (JLUS) program, a method for promoting local community implementation of the Air Force AICUZ
program.
2.6.1. The success of the AICUZ program depends on its voluntary acceptance and use by local governments, private
individuals, and other agency officials. These groups and individuals must know, understand, and be convinced of the need
for the AICUZ program. This is accomplished through a series of steps taken by the installation as well as higher
14                                                                                        AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

headquarters. During this process, local governments, agencies, groups and individuals should continually be informed of
the need for compatible development. The installation must stay abreast of activities within the AICUZ area and, when
necessary, take a formal position on land use proposals. In Phase V, the primary emphasis is on developing an effective and
sustaining relationship with local communities on land use planning. The installation fully participates in the local and
regional planning and intergovernmental coordination and public information exchange. The Regional Compliance Offices
(AFCEE/CCR-A, CCR-D, and CCR-S) work through state legislative coordination processes while HQ USAF/ILEV
maintains interagency coordination with federal officials in Washington, DC.
2.6.2. AICUZ Implementation Strategies.
2.6.2.1. Step 1: Informing the Public and Government Agencies. AICUZ is primarily implemented through voluntary
action of local government officials and the policies of federal agencies (e.g., Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Veterans Administration, or Farmers Home Administration). These officials must know what the AICUZ
recommendations are before they can consider acting on them. The process of providing information to the general public
should continue after the formal release of the AICUZ study or amendment. The process of providing general AICUZ
information to local planning agencies, however, can begin before the formal release. Local planning officials should be
brought into the process at an early stage in order to improve the prospects for acceptance of the AICUZ recommendations.
2.6.2.1.1. Information can be exchanged on a government-to-government basis where local planning officials are given an
opportunity to review the AICUZ information and identify potential problems and solutions. Bringing the local planning
officials into the process early is a means to gain support for the AICUZ study process. However, draft AICUZ contour
maps must not be released to local agencies or the general public without prior approval of the MAJCOM/CE. Agency
personnel responsible for making land use decisions may change. When this occurs, new personnel should be briefed on
the AICUZ program and process.
2.6.2.1.2. There are a number of agencies and organizations with a potential interest in receiving AICUZ information. The
installation AICUZ Program Manager should determine which local governmental agencies and special interest groups to
brief on the program. The installation AICUZ Program Manager should determine which agencies are considering actions
which may potentially impact the installation. Table 2.3 (by no means complete) contains a number of agencies to consider
contacting.
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                 15

2.6.2.1.3. The installation AICUZ Program Manager should:
2.6.2.1.3.1. Establish both a formal and informal network of contacts to routinely exchange planning information.
Installations may develop Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with appropriate local planning and community
development agencies to establish a formal exchange of information on land use proposals. In addition to local agencies, it
is especially important to coordinate with federal agencies that directly subsidize housing, such as the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Administration, and Farmers Home Administration. Under Federal
16                                                                                            AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

Management Circular 75-2, these federal agencies, through their various housing support programs, are required to help
protect Air Force bases from encroachment. However, these agencies require Air Force assistance. The Regional
Environmental Offices provide copies of newly released AICUZ studies and amendments to these agencies. Nonetheless,
the installation AICUZ Program Manager must manage the day-to-day coordination on issues relating to the installation.
The installation should maintain an up-to-date list of contacts, addresses, and telephone numbers of each relevant agency
and organization.
2.6.2.1.3.2. Installation personnel should prepare a formal presentation of the AICUZ program. This presentation
can be given individually or collectively to local planning commissions, city councils, county legislatures, county planning
commissions, councils of government and other interested agencies. This presentation should inform the general public on
AICUZ issues, installation economic impact, and the need for responsible land use planning. The presentation may be
given to organizations (e.g., Chamber of Commerce, Board of Realtors, etc.) and at town meetings. Elected officials are
ultimately responsible for compatible land use development. However, they typically receive land use recommendations
from a planning commission (made up of appointed local citizens) who are advised by a planning department. The biggest
impact on the elected officials, however, comes from the concerns of the general public as well as vested interests.
2.6.2.1.3.3. Develop a skill for working with the public. Working with the public is an acquired skill, developed by
experience. There are documents available to help with this task. Techniques for dealing with the public are discussed in
information documents, such as FAA’s Community Involvement Manual (FAA-EE-90-03, August 1990, USDOT FAA,
Office of Environment and Energy, Washington, DC 20591 NTIS #ADA 081465), and Public Participation in Resource
Planning (U. S. Forest Service, Selected Literature Abstracts, April 1982). These manuals provide valuable information
and describe techniques for working with the public (meetings, hotlines, brochures, exhibits, open houses, etc.). Procedures
for conducting public meetings can also be found in Attachment 3 of AFI 32-7061.
2.6.2.2. Step 2: Identifying Incompatible Land Uses. To successfully monitor and evaluate off-base land use
development plans, installation personnel must establish and maintain contact with planning and other officials at
appropriate municipal and county offices where land use issues are handled. Lines of communication should be established
with other applicable government agencies (councils of governments, airport authorities, other military installations, utility
districts, etc.) as well area offices of as appropriate federal and state agencies (State Airport Board, State Real Estate
Commission, Office of Economic Planning and Development, HUD, VA, FHA, FAA, etc.). These agencies may have an
influence on proposed developments near air installations.
2.6.2.2.1. The Base Community Planner, accompanied by other installation experts, if possible, should attend and
participate at appropriate zoning commission, city council, county board, and other meetings and hearings where they may
potentially affect the installation. In order to obtain additional information on future development plans affecting the
installation, efforts should also be made to attend and participate at meetings of local airport authorities, council of
governments, utility districts, realtors' associations, homebuilders' associations, etc. Like any other landowner, the Air Force
has the right to express concern in planning and zoning issues. The Air Force needs representatives at these meetings to
look out for Air Force interests. The installation representative shall obtain prior clearance from Public Affairs before
stating any official or unofficial position or making a presentation at a public meeting.
2.6.2.2.2. Local changes in land use cannot be monitored solely from the desk. Installation personnel should make regular
field visits outside the installation to look for signs of development (surveyor stakes, For Sale signs, proposed zoning change
notices, development signs, digging, etc.) that could affect AICUZ. Installation personnel may identify development
proposals from several sources:
2.6.2.2.2.1. State or Local single point of contact
2.6.2.2.2.2. Local or Regional or State plans (e.g., county comprehensive plans, regional transportation plans, etc.)
2.6.2.2.2.3. Articles and notices in local newspapers
2.6.2.2.2.4. Agency newsletters
2.6.2.2.2.5. Advisory committee meetings of county and regional planning agencies
2.6.2.2.2.6. Informal discussions with local planners, transportation planners, utility companies, bankers, realtors, and
developers
2.6.2.2.2.7. In addition, the Air Force Regional Compliance Offices obtain information from federal regional offices about
plans, programs, and projects for which a federal agency has direct or indirect responsibility.
2.6.2.2.2.8. Planning or Zoning board agendas
2.6.2.2.3. Installations should take positive action to develop support in the community for the AICUZ study and for the
Air Force mission. The installation should stipulate the AICUZ recommendations to the community are only
recommendations. Installations should participate in the local planning process through pertinent organizations. Full
information regarding AICUZ requirements should be made available to local governments, civic associations, libraries,
school districts, and other concerned groups. Appropriate groups or individuals may be invited to the installation to
familiarize them with installation operations and mission. Membership representation on speaker bureaus and membership
in community organizations are additional opportunities to present the Air Force position in nonadversarial circumstances.
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                   17

2.6.2.2.4. Potential incompatible land use proposals may take many forms:
2.6.2.2.4.1. Request to a planning board for rezoning or a variance to permit an incompatible use, a higher density, or
removal of a height restriction.
2.6.2.2.4.2. Proposal for a major thoroughfare change or expressway development.
2.6.2.2.4.3. Proposal for a major extension of water, electric, or sewage lines.
2.6.2.2.4.4. Request for major flood control improvement or infrastructure construction.
2.6.2.2.4.5. Request to a planning board for approval of a subdivision.
2.6.2.2.4.6. Selection of a site for a community facility (e.g., school or hospital).
2.6.2.2.4.7. Request to the town engineer to approve a street map.
2.6.2.2.4.8. Request to a utility or sewer district for a new hookup.
2.6.2.2.4.9. Request to a state or regional agency for a coastal or wetlands permit.
2.6.2.2.4.10. Request to a state or federal agency for financial assistance.
2.6.2.2.4.11. Proposal to complete a comprehensive land use plan.
2.6.2.2.5. After identifying a potentially significant incompatible land use proposal, the installation should inform the
appropriate agency of why the proposal is considered to be incompatible. A multidisciplinary team approach will be most
effective in this endeavor. The installation should use its own expertise to help with encroachment issues. The Base
Community Planner identifies an initial encroachment issue, integrates the views of the Installation Commander, the Staff
Judge Advocate, the Public Affairs Officer, and Flight Operations Officer, and helps prepare the installation’s position to be
presented to the decision-making agency. Additional support could also be enlisted from the flying wings, base operations,
etc.    The Base Community Planner prepares an internal report describing the proposed changes in land use and
community-installation interactions. This report will provide written record of the AICUZ program implementation while
informing key installation personnel, major command, Regional Compliance Office, Air Staff and AFCEE/ECC of ongoing
developments. Complete records of all AICUZ actions should be maintained. AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition--
Standards, describes AICUZ file retention requirements.
2.6.2.3. Step 3: Opposing Incompatible Land Use Proposals. Once a land use proposal has been identified as
incompatible with the AICUZ guidelines, the installation must assess the impact and inform appropriate agencies of its
concerns. Direct discussions with the applicant will determine if modifications can be made to the proposal to avoid
impacting the installation’s operations. If a public hearing is held, an installation representative should attend the hearing
to voice the concerns. If a MOU is implemented, it should be utilized to provide opportunities for comments. If the
decision-making body is a board or commission, such as a local planning board, members should be briefed prior to the
hearing. Some boards hold executive sessions prior to a public hearing and the installation should ensure its views are
presented. The installation should provide information to the news media explaining the reason for opposition to the
proposal.
2.6.2.3.1. Presentation of the installation’s concerns should be a team effort involving the Installation Commander, the
Base Community Planner, the Public Affairs Officer, the Staff Judge Advocate, and the Airspace Manager. The team
should determine who should speak, what information should be released, and to whom it should be distributed. The
installation should negotiate with the decision-making body to achieve a result protecting the vital interests of the
installation. (A flow diagram summarizing the strategy for opposing incompatible land use is provided in Figure 2.1.)

                    NOTE: Chart refers to installation action unless otherwise noted

2.6.2.4. Step 4: Promoting Long Term Solutions. The installation should seek long term solutions to achieve land use
compatibility rather than dealing with problems on a case-by-case basis. In a case-by-case approach, some proposals may
succeed for reasons other than the merits of the issue. A long term solution may be easier to enforce, once adopted. An
important point to make to local officials throughout the AICUZ process is AICUZ inputs are just one of several planning
determinants a community considers in developing a comprehensive plan or evaluating a plan amendment. The AICUZ
land use guidelines describe land use compatibility based on aircraft operations only. Final land use plans and
implementing ordinances should address other land use determinants such as physiographic features, vegetation, soil
characteristics, existing land use, and economic and social demands. The general categories of long term solutions for
compatible land use are listed below:
     Plans and Programs
     Acquisitions
     Capital Improvements
     Land Development Controls
     Financing Restrictions
     State Legislation
     Land Swaps
     Building Codes
     Fair Disclosure
2.6.2.4.1. Table 2.4 list questions that should be used in developing the installation’s long term strategies for implementing
solutions for compatible land use within the AICUZ:

Table 2.4. Questions on Long Term Strategies.

                                             Does the public receive AICUZ information?

 Is the community reaction to and support of AICUZ positive?
 Are home buyers and renters advised of aircraft noise and airport hazards?

                                               Is there an AICUZ coordination process?

 In general, is there a cooperative and effective effort underway?
 Are Environmental Impact Statements relating to AICUZ properly coordinated?
 Is the EO 12372 process working? (EO 12372 is the executive order covering interagency/intergovernmental coordination for
 environmental planning)

                                           Is AICUZ included in USAF plans and programs?

 Plans:  Is AICUZ totally included in the Installation Comprehensive Plan?
         Is AICUZ partly included in the Installation Comprehensive Plan
         Is AICUZ included in other Air Force plans?
 Environmental Management Program:        Is AICUZ included in the Coastal Zone Management Program?

                                    Has there been land acquisition by civilian agencies for AICUZ?


                                        Has there been capital improvements used for AICUZ?


                                                 Are there local development controls?

 Land Use Plans:                Is AICUZ totally included in Land Use plans?
                                Is AICUZ partially included in Land Use plans?
 Zoning:              Is AICUZ totally implemented in zoning ordinances?
                      Is AICUZ partially implemented in zoning ordinances?
                      Are there any height and obstruction ordinances?
 Are there subdivision regulations used for AICUZ?
 Are there special use designations used for AICUZ?

 Do building codes incorporate noise level reduction?
 Is there an official map used for AICUZ?

                                           Are there financing restrictions used for AICUZ?


                                         Is there state legislation for airport/airfield planning?


                                                       Other Possible Questions

 Have incompatible development proposals been denied?
 Have developers voluntarily modified proposals for AICUZ?
 Are any actions pending?
 Is encroachment taking place on land zoned for AICUZ?

2.6.2.4.2. The installation should prepare a document entitled, “Long Term Land Use Compatibility Trends.” The
document should be a strategy paper describing the land use situation, proposing a strategy for compatible development, and
giving recommendations for implementation. This strategy paper should be presented to key installation personnel. The
paper should be evaluated by the group, modified when necessary and adopted as official installation policy. This policy
will help the installation avoid conflicting statement when different representatives discuss development issues with local
communities.
2.6.3. Clear Zone Issues. The only real property interests to be acquired by the Air Force are those necessary to prevent
incompatible land use in the Clear Zone (Certain joint-use installations are exempt from the Clear Zone Acquisition
20                                                                                            AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

Program). Clear Zones are safety areas, typically 3000 feet by 3000 feet, located immediately off the ends of active
runways. The overall risk for aircraft accidents in the Clear Zone is so high, the Air Force generally acquires off-base land
through purchase or easement to prevent development. MAJCOM/CE is responsible for acquiring real property interests
within the Off-Base portions. A real property interest must be acquired over all property within the Clear Zone.
MAJCOM/CE determines exceptions to the Clear Zone boundaries and the real property interest to be acquired on a case-
by-case basis. All real property interests are acquired per AFI 32-9001 guidance.
2.6.3.1. Land Use in the Clear Zone. Existing Air Force facilities and land uses may continue in the Clear Zone;
however, replacement facilities will be programmed as part of the normal planning and programming process and must be
sited outside the Clear Zone. People-intensive facilities and facilities for other than flight operations should be relocated
outside the Clear Zone where possible. Exceptions to this would be navigational aids and essential operational
requirements that, because of their functions, need to be sited within the Clear Zone for optimal performance.
MAJCOM/CE must approve alterations, minor additions, or improvements to facilities in the Clear Zone. The width of
Clear Zones may be based on highest accident potential area for specific runway and acquisition constraints. A Clear Zone
3000 feet wide should be observed for new construction of proposed Air Force facilities regardless of the established Clear
Zone dimensions. The installation must fully justify and the MAJCOM/CE must approve any deviation to this restriction.
2.6.3.1.1. The Air Force (or others under Air Force permit) must not plan, locate, or construct a new use or facility within
the boundaries of the Clear Zone. Acceptable uses within the Clear Zone are: agriculture; livestock grazing (excluding feed
and dairy lots); permanent open space; existing or new water areas provided they do not create bird strike hazards; rights-
of-way for single track railroads and fenced, two-lane highways without sidewalks or bicycle trails provided they do not
violate obstacle clearance criteria; rights-of-way for communications and utilities provided all facilities are at grade level or
underground; and essential navigation aids and operational facilities, provided there are no feasible alternatives. (This
requires MAJCOM/CE approval.)
2.6.3.1.2. The following uses are specifically prohibited within the Clear Zone (AFJM 32-8008 and AFI 32-70):
2.6.3.1.2.1. A use releasing any substance into the air, such as steam, dust, and smoke, which impairs visibility or
otherwise interferes with aircraft operations.
2.6.3.1.2.2. A use producing electrical emissions that interferes with aircraft operations, communications or navigational
aid systems, or aircraft navigation equipment.
2.6.3.1.2.3. A use that produces light emissions either direct or indirect (reflective) which might interfere with pilot vision.
2.6.3.1.2.4. A use unnecessarily attracting birds or waterfowl, such as operation of sanitary landfills, operation of
maintenance and feeding stations, or growth of certain crop or vegetation.
2.6.3.1.2.5. Explosives as described in AFMAN 91-201.
2.6.3.1.3. Buildings on newly acquired fee land within the Clear Zone must be demolished or relocated outside the Clear
Zone and rubble must be removed. Easement acquisitions must conform to the estate acquired. Through programming
avenues, the major command is responsible for any relocation of above-ground utilities, fencing, and any grading or
seeding. In addition, MAJCOM determines what should be done with roads and sidewalks terminating in the acquired
areas.
2.6.3.1.4. The building footprint for a shopping malls or centers will be considered as a single entity in all land use
compatibility analysis. Shopping malls and centers will not be subdivided into individual land use types for the purpose of
determining incompatible uses. Due to the concentrations of people associated with shopping malls and centers, these land
uses are considered as incompatible within all Clear Zones.
2.6.4. Land Use in the Accident Potential Zones. Accident potential zone I is less critical than the clear zone, but still
possesses a significant risk factor. This 3,000 foot by 5,000 foot area has land use compatibility guidelines which are
sufficiently flexible to allow reasonable economic use of the land, such as industrial/manufacturing, transportation,
communication/utilities, wholesale trade, open space, recreation, and agriculture. However, uses that concentrate people in
small areas are not acceptable.
2.6.4.1. Accident potential zone II is less critical than accident potential zone I, but still possesses potential for accidents.
Accident potential zone II, also 3,000 feet wide, is 7,000 feet long extending to 15,000 feet from the runway threshold.
Acceptable uses include those of accident potential zone I, as well as low density single family residential, and those
personal and business services and commercial/retail trade uses of low intensity or scale of operation. High density
functions such as multi-story buildings, places of assembly (theaters, churches, schools, restaurants, etc.), and high density
office uses are not considered appropriate.
2.6.4.2. High people densities should be limited to the maximum extent possible. The optimum density recommended for
residential usage (where it does not conflict with noise criteria) in accident potential zone II is one dwelling per acre. For
most non-residential usage, buildings should be limited to one story and the lot coverage should not exceed 20 percent.
2.6.4.3. The building footprint for a shopping malls or centers will be considered as a single entity in all land use
compatibility analysis. Shopping malls and centers will not be subdivided into individual land use types for the purpose of
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                       21

determining incompatible uses. Due to the concentrations of people associated with shopping malls and centers, these land
uses are considered as incompatible within all Accident Potential Zones (APZ’s).
2.6.5. Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) Program. The AICUZ program was established to provide information to local
communities about noise and accident potential from aircraft operations, and to encourage communities to adopt land use
controls that will ensure compatible development within the AICUZ area of influence. While some communities have
accepted these recommendations, others have not. In order to enhance the acceptance of the AICUZ recommendations the
Air Force initiated the Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) program in 1985.
2.6.5.1. JLUS is a cooperative effort between the installation and nearby communities. The objective of the program is
twofold: First to encourage cooperative land use planning between the military installation and the surrounding
communities so that future community growth and development are compatible with the training or operational missions of
the installation. Second to seek ways to reduce the operational impacts on adjacent land.
2.6.5.1.1. The JLUS program encourages communities and the installation to study the issues in an open forum, taking into
consideration both community and military viewpoints. Recommendations in these studies are used to guide local
jurisdictions in developing and implementing of land use controls. The intent of the controls is to ensure that future public
and private development around the installation will be compatible with both the military mission and the development
needs of the community. Participation in the JLUS program is voluntary. The Department of Defense, Office of Economic
Adjustment (OSD/OEA) coordinates and provides matching grants for preparation of this type of study.
2.6.5.1.2. The real success of JLUS is that the communities have been stepping forward to take positive action to control
incompatible development which could adversely impact the flying mission. The following are several examples:
2.6.5.1.2.1. Sacramento County modified its zoning ordinance to improve protection for local Air Force bases.
2.6.5.1.2.2. A zoning ordinance has been enacted by Hoke County, NC near Pope AFB.
2.6.5.1.2.3. Land use plans, zoning amendments and building code changes were implemented for the communities
surrounding Shaw AFB, SC.
2.6.5.1.2.4. Land use plan and zoning changes were implemented for jurisdictions surrounding Robins AFB, GA. Also,
the State of Georgia appropriated funds to purchase land in APZ I.
2.6.5.1.2.5. The State of South Dakota has agreed to move the interstate highway interchange serving Ellsworth AFB that
has caused the development of incompatible commercial uses in APZ I.
2.6.5.2. Air Force Procedure. The Air Force and OSD/OEA have agreed on the following procedures to be used to
provide grants, cooperative agreements, and assistance in developing joint land use studies:
2.6.5.2.1. An annual call letter is sent to the MAJCOMs from AFCEE/EC each June to solicit applicants for the JLUS
program. The MAJCOMs, AFCEE/EC and HQ USAF/ILEV narrow the field of applicants from which HQ USAF
nominates bases through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Environment, Safety and Occupational Health
(SAF/MIQ) to OSD/OEA. The Air Force will nominate installations based on analysis of:
2.6.5.2.1.1. The extent and pattern of incompatible development around the base
2.6.5.2.1.2. The potential for future encroachment.
2.6.5.2.1.3. The relationship between installation and community. Prior history of cooperation on land use issues.
2.6.5.2.1.4. Identification of existing state airport or other legislation that would facilitate planning around the installation.
2.6.5.2.1.5. Written assurance of base support in updating AICUZ studies and participation in the JLUS activities.
2.6.5.2.1.6. Other factors, such as a proposed mission change, that would require the support of JLUS.
2.6.5.2.1.7. Description of the implementation status of the last AICUZ release and any plans for future releases.
2.6.5.2.2. A prioritized list of candidate installations will be provided by SAF/MIQ to OEA by the end of August. OEA
grant approval for a community JLUS program should occur before May the following year, otherwise the Air Force will be
asked by OEA to renominate the installation the following year.
2.6.5.2.3. SAF/MIQ consults with OEA to determine the number of installations to be nominated for a given year.
2.6.5.2.4. HQ USAF/ILE, will coordinate appropriate command support and require full base participation. The
installation is the primary DoD representative in the joint DoD-community planning and zoning effort.
2.6.5.3. OSD/OEA Procedures. OEA procedures relating to the JLUS are as follows:
2.6.5.3.1. A cost share basis is 50% local, 50% OEA.
2.6.5.3.2. Coordination with SAF/MIQ on the selection of candidate installations. Coordination with HQ USAF pertaining
to policy and guidance.
2.6.5.3.3. OEA will work with the communities to structure a joint DoD-community planning effort.
2.6.5.3.4. Provide assistance to the community and Air Force during the JLUS process. This assistance will include
community visits and review of study products.
2.6.5.3.5. Emphasize to local communities that the objective of the study is implementation through development control
mechanisms that protect the public’s health, safety and welfare, and the Air Force installation’s mission. An
implementation strategy is to be included in all studies.
22                                                                                         AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

2.6.5.3.6. Work with the President’s Economic Adjustment Committee (EAC) in implementing the recommendations of
the approved JLUS.
2.6.5.3.7. It is mutually agreed that policy correspondence from any element of OSD, USD(A&T)ES going to the
communities involved will be coordinated with the Wing Commander of the installation and MAJCOM/CE.
2.6.5.4. Installation Participation. For a successful JLUS, the installation’s Wing Commander and personnel must be
committed partners in the study. There are general requirements expected of the installation once they are approved for a
JLUS. The installation supporting staff needs to fully participate in all steps which culminate with implementation of the
study. The tangible gains of the Joint Land Use Study program far outweigh the commitments that the installation must
make to the program. Further information on the program can be provided by AFCEE/ECC.
2.6.5.4.1. Air Force policy does not permit land acquisition under the AICUZ program in order to prevent incompatible
land development, except in clear zones. JLUS proposals for Air Force land acquisition outside clear zones, must tactfully
be discouraged by installation personnel attending JLUS committee meetings. Installation personnel must participate in the
JLUS process and must emphasize achieving land use compatibility goals through AICUZ recommendations relating to
land use planning, zoning and other forms of land use controls.
2.6.5.4.2. If the JLUS committee proceeds with recommendations of Air Force land acquisition which are not permitted,
installations must endorse completed JLUS reports with the condition that the Air Force has a policy precluding land
acquisition outside clear zones, for the purpose of controlling land use. Furthermore, installations need to indicate to JLUS
committees that clear zone purchases, if still needed, are subject to standard Air Force project programming requirements
and current federal budgetary constraints.

                                          ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Introduction. AFI 32-7063 establishes roles and responsibilities for the AICUZ program. The instruction identifies
the MAJCOM’s as having the primary responsibilities for the program, however, they are given the latitude to delegate
responsibilities to the installations for their AICUZ program. This should be accomplished by issuing a supplement to AFI
32-7063. The greatest focus of activity for the AICUZ program is at the installation.
3.1.1. A team approach needs to be adopted to develop and maintain a good AICUZ program. Individuals from key
organizations need to participate in the continuing effort of the program and participate in local community meetings on
issues that affect their AICUZ program. The importance of working with local planning officials cannot be over
emphasized. This relationship is critical in order to achieve and maintain the desired goal of compatible land use controls
around the installation. Local officials and others in the community should be briefed on the status of the program and the
need for its continued maintenance. Credibility and acceptance of the program by the local community is paramount to the
program’s success. This credibility can be achieved by an open information exchange and involving the public officials in
the AICUZ process. The base AICUZ program manager, along with the base leaders, must make a commitment to promote
AICUZ if this program is to be successful. The following sections identifies the roles and responsibilities of personnel
involved in the AICUZ program.

3.2. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower, Reserve Affairs, Installations and Environment (SAF/MI).
Provides the policy oversight for the AICUZ program.

3.3. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF).
3.3.1. The Civil Engineer (HQ USAF/ILE). Oversees the AICUZ program execution. Develops and interprets policy.
Monitors policies, plans, programs and projects of other federal agencies at HQ level that may affect the AICUZ policies
and procedures. Advocates for resources required to support the AICUZ program. Coordinates with and distributes the
study or amendment to Federal agency officials and Congressional Officials in Washington DC. Resolves policy conflicts
and controversy.
3.3.2. The Judge Advocate General (HQ USAF/JA) provides legal advice on all aspects of the AICUZ program.

3.4. AFCEE.
3.4.1. Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence Regional Environmental Offices (AFCEE/CCR)
3.4.1.1. Monitors the activities, plans, programs and projects of State legislatures and Federal regional agencies that may
affect land use within the AICUZ.
3.4.1.2. Takes formal positions as required.
3.4.1.3. Assists MAJCOMs and installation, upon request, in implementing the AICUZ program.
3.4.1.4. Coordinates the study or amendment with appropriate Federal regional officials.
3.4.1.5. Keeps the installations, MAJCOMs, AFCEE/EC and HQ USAF informed of all significant AICUZ program
events.
3.4.1.6. Works with State legislatures and regional officials in developing legislation relevant to noise and land use
controls.
3.4.1.7. Supports the Joint Land Use Program.
3.4.2. Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence Environmental Conservation and Planning (AFCEE/EC) will:
Maintain the central archive for all AICUZ and EIAP noise studies, and other related noise information programming.
Provide technical assistance, quality assurance, data manipulation, and retrieval functions as requested. Notify
MAJCOM/CEs when outside agencies have requested information and/or assistance involving their installations. Provide
AICUZ training and inform MAJCOM/CEs of changes in the AICUZ program to include computer models.

3.5. Major Commands (MAJCOMs). As mentioned above, AFI 32-7063 establishes the MAJCOM’s as having the broad
responsibilities for implementing the AICUZ program. This requires full and continuous representation from the
installation civil engineer, operations, air traffic control, public affairs, legal, safety, maintenance, comptroller,
bioenvironmental engineering, weather, and other base personnel. MAJCOM’s may delegate responsibilities to
installations with the exception of MAJCOM approval, wavier, and exemption authorities. The following list of roles and
responsibilities, while identified as MAJCOM responsibilities, may be delegated to the individual installations for
implementing and maintaining the AICUZ program. The installation is where the responsibility for the AICUZ program

                                                  DATA COLLECTION

4.1. Introduction. Data collection is the most crucial step in the AICUZ process. The accuracy of aircraft operational and
performance data obtained for a NOISEMAP computer run is critical to the prediction of accurate noise contours.
Information is gathered from pilots, unit commanders, and operations and maintenance personnel on the number and type
of aircraft operations conducted at the installation. Interviews with key personnel are usually the best means of obtaining
the required data. This information is entered onto AICUZ data sheets following the guidelines given in this chapter. The
data is then entered into the BASEOPS input program for processing in the computer noise model, NOISEMAP.
NOISEMAP is the Air Force approved noise modeling program which will be used for all studies to produce the noise
contours. The most current version of NOISEMAP is available from AFCEE/ECC.
4.1.1. This chapter defines the typical process used to collect and enter the data onto the Noise Survey data sheets. The
data requirements for NOISEMAP are extensive and it is the responsibility of the data collector to understand the data
requirements, sources of data, and where errors can occur. Assistance on AICUZ policy matters and procedures is available
through MAJCOM/CE and HQ USAF/ILEVP. Assistance concerning technical matters involving the data collection phase,
BASEOPS, and NOISEMAP is available from MAJCOM/CE and AFCEE/ECC.

4.2. Preparing For A Data Collection. A wide range of data must be collected to ensure noise contours are accurate.
These various types of data correspond directly to the AICUZ data sheets on which they are recorded. The data covers
assigned, transient and civil aircraft activities. The level of data required pertains directly to it’s impact on the noise
environment. The data collected include the following:
     Airfield information
     Aircraft summary
     Daily operations
     Individual flight track sketches
     Individual flight profiles
     Flight track inventories
     Ground run-ups
4.2.1. Initial Data to Be Collected. The AICUZ data collection process, involves several steps:
4.2.1.1. Determine all activities associated with the operation of aircraft at the installation. This includes Air Traffic
Control, Radar Approach Control, Base Weather Office, Aero Club, Transient Alert, Military Airlift Schedulers, Flying
Squadrons, and Engine Maintenance Personnel.
4.2.1.2. Develop an interview schedule for each activity allowing plenty of time for the interview process. (For example,
the interview with pilots of one type of primary aircraft requires a minimum of three hours. The interview with
maintenance personnel on maintenance procedures for one aircraft type requires about one hour.)
4.2.1.3. A data package with a cover letter should be sent to each organization to be interviewed, at least two (2) months in
advance of the scheduled interview. This gives the interviewees time to prepare. A follow-up call should be made to each
organization to ensure the data package was received and see if there are any questions. Immediately before the data
collection is to take place, a meeting should be held with representatives (preferably the interviewees) from all organizations
to discuss the process and answer any questions.
4.2.1.4. A conference room should be dedicated to the data collection team while at the installation for conducting
interviews and work sessions. The room requires a table that will seat 6 to 8 people and be large enough to lay out flight
track maps and sketches.
4.2.1.5. Obtain a vicinity map including the base and surrounding area. The map should be of sufficient scale for pilots to
recognize visual reference points. Transparent material (tracing paper, mylar, etc.) should be available to draw actual
ground tracks while noting the power settings, airspeeds and altitudes flown on the tracks.
4.2.1.6. Obtain a base map (C-1 Map or Aircraft Parking Plan) showing parking spots of aircraft and any other locations
where maintenance runs are performed (hush house, etc.).
4.2.2. General Airfield Data. The first data sheet of an AICUZ data package is the General Airfield Data, AF Form 3997,
(See sample data in Figure 4.1.) records the information listed in Table 4.1.
26                                                                                          AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

 Installation name and location              Standard TEMPERATURE and HUMIDITY at the airfield
 Date the data collection was accomplished Runway identifiers (IDENT)
 Glide slope (GS)                            Magnetic declination (MAG DEC) of the airfield
 Runway length                               Latitude and longitude of the midpoints of the runway thresholds
 Elevation (ELEV) of the installation        Navigational aids (NAVAIDS) identifiers
 Type of NAVAIDS                             Latitude and longitude of the NAVAIDS.

4.2.2.1. Some of the above data can be obtained from the DoD Flight Information Publication (FLIP),"High/Low Altitude
Instrument Approach Procedures." The latest version of this publication can be obtained from Base Operations. The FLIP
contains information on the installation’s airfield to include runway identifiers, runway widths and lengths, the elevation of
the base (identified inside a small box), and the magnetic declination. The glide slope (GS) will be given in the ILS
Approach Figure found in the FLIP. All of this information can usually be obtained from Base Operations.
4.2.2.2. Navigational aid data are contained in the FLIP, “IFR Supplement,” also obtainable from Base Operations. The
Air Installation Data Sheet requests the following information regarding the navigational aid (NAVAID): the identifier, the
type, and latitude/longitude coordinates. Types of NAVAIDs include TACAN, VOR, VORTAC, NDB, and VORDME.
These NAVAIDs can be used for visual feedback in the BASEOPS program. When a NAVAID is entered into BASEOPS,
the NAVAID will be displayed whenever a flight track is viewed to aid in the proper placement of the flight tracks.

4.2.2.3. The “standard day” temperature and relative humidity for the installation must be noted on an AF Form 3997,
General Airfield Data. Since weather is an important factor in the propagation of noise, identifying the temperature and
humidity conditions is critical to the accuracy of the final noise contours. NOISEMAP requires a medium air absorption
value to represent sound absorption on a “standard day”. This is determined using the Air Absorption Values chart in
Table 4.2. The procedure for determining the “standard day” temperature and relative humidity values for a specific
location for the purpose of “standard day” absorption values is as follows:
4.2.2.3.1. From the Base Weather Station, obtain a Air Weather Service Climatic Brief or Climatological Data Summary
for the installation. This report gives climatic data for each month of the year, usually averaged over a 30 year time period.
4.2.2.3.2. Determine the average monthly temperature and relative humidity for each month of the year.
4.2.2.3.3. For each month of the year, use the average temperature and humidity to determine the air absorption coefficient
on the following Atmospheric Absorption Coefficient Table, Table 4.2.
4.2.2.3.4. Once the absorption coefficient has been determined for all twelve months, rank the absorption coefficients in
ascending order from smallest to largest absolute values.
4.2.2.3.5. Select the sixth smallest value of absorption coefficient and use the average monthly temperature and relative
humidity corresponding to this absorption coefficient.
4.2.2.3.6. Where not given directly, monthly average values should be the arithmetic average (mean) of the “mean daily
maximum” and “mean daily minimum” temperatures, and the arithmetic average of the highest and lowest relative
humidity values listed for the month.
4.2.2.4. Only a rough estimate of latitude and longitude of the runway threshold at the centerline can be obtained from
linear interpolation of the latitude and longitude lines on a map. Sometimes when such data are used in BASEOPS (and
ultimately in NOISEMAP), crosswind runways will not be perpendicular to main runways or parallel runways may not be
exactly parallel. Accuracy of runway threshold at the centerline in degrees, minutes, seconds, and to hundredths of a
second are required to pin down the runway locations and assure proper orientation. Few maps will allow interpolation of
latitude and longitude of runway threshold at the centerline to that accuracy. Base Operations or the Base Civil Engineer’s
office may have the most accurate data on the latitude and longitude of the runway threshold at the centerline.

Humidity in dB per 1000 feet -- at 1000 Hz Frequency.




4.2.3. Noise Sensitive Location Data . The second page of the Data Collection Package is the AF Form 3998, Specific
Noise Sensitive Location (Figure 4.2.) This form records the location and Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) at
various locations I the vicinity of the installation which have been identified as noise sensitive areas. An area may be
considered a noise sensitive area if aircraft noise may interfere with the normal activities associated with the use of the land.
Noise sensitive areas include residential neighborhoods, educational, health and religious structures and sites and outdoor
recreational, cultural and historic sites. The threshold for updating the AICUZ report is a change in DNL of 2 dB or more
at a noise sensitive area. The noise modeling computer program, NOISEMAP, will compute the DNL at the selected
critical locations. Determining if the 2 dB threshold has been exceeded can be done by comparing the current (or projected)
DNL level to the previous DNL level at the spot.

4.2.4. Aircraft Data Summary. The Based Aircraft Operations, AF Form 3999 (See sample data in Figure 4.3.) should be
completed listing all of the aircraft that fly at the installation. This should include assigned aircraft as well as aircraft
which are deployed to the installation on a regular basis
4.2.4.1. The information to be included on the Bases Aircraft Operations form includes the following: aircraft type,
daytime and nighttime departures, daytime and nighttime arrivals, daytime and nighttime closed patterns, daytime and
nighttime takeoffs, daytime and nighttime landings, and daytime and nighttime total operations.
4.2.4.2. The following information should be used in calculating the daily operations for the Based Aircraft Operations
form (AF Form 3999):
4.2.4.2.1. Operation is defined as either one departure, one approach, or half of a closed pattern.
4.2.4.2.2. Approach is defined as a landing operation which may or may not be flown multiple times. An aircraft can
approach to a full stop, a touch-and-go, or to a low approach and climbout.
4.2.4.2.3. Departure is considered to be any non-closed pattern takeoff on a runway.
4.2.4.2.4. Arrival is considered to be any non-closed pattern landing or low approach to a runway.
4.2.4.2.5. Closed Pattern (flown as multiple approaches) is comprised of a departure segment and a approach segment
usually flown on the same runway. In some cases, a closed pattern may depart from one runway and land on or approach a
second runway. Keep in mind, each closed pattern is actually two operations, a departure from either a full stop, low
approach or touch-and-go and a approach to either a full stop, low approach or touch-and-go into another pattern.
4.2.4.2.6. Total Takeoffs are composed of all the departure operations plus the closed pattern departure segment
operations. Takeoffs = Departures + Closed Patterns Departure Segments
4.2.4.2.7. Total Landings are composed of all the arrival operations plus the closed pattern approach segment operations.
Landings = Arrivals + Closed Patterns Approach Segments
4.2.4.2.8. Total operations are the sum of the landing and the takeoff operations. In essence, one departure counts as an
operation, one approach counts as an operation, and one closed pattern counts as two operations. Total Operations =
Takeoffs + Landing
4.2.4.2.9. Sortie is an aircraft flight consisting of one departure, one approach, and any number of closed patterns. Sorties
can be referred to as mission sorties, local sorties, air refueling sorties, proficiency sorties, etc. Please note that one sortie is
made up of more than one operation. Without clarification, knowing the number of sorties per day does not provide enough
information to determine the number of operations per day. Be sure to discount those operations flown at other locations.
4.2.4.2.10. Daytime, for the purposes of noise modeling, is defined as the period from 0700 to 2200, except in California
where it is 0700 to 1900.
4.2.4.2.11. Nighttime is defined as the period from 2200 to 0700 hours. Because noise occurring at night is more
disruptive, a 10 dB penalty or weighting is applied to the noise level of flights occurring during this time period.
4.2.4.2.12. Evening is the period of time from 1900 to 2200 hours. The state of California requires a day to be divided into
three time periods for noise modeling purposes: daytime, evening, and nighttime. California considers daytime as the
period of time from 0700 to 1900 hours. In addition to the 10 dB penalty applied to nighttime operations (2200-0700
hours), a 5 dB penalty or weighting is applied to the noise of operations occurring during evening hours.

4.2.4.3. It is imperative that information regarding both day and night operations be collected. If evening operations are
applicable, information regarding operations during this time period should also be obtained and collected.
4.2.5. The Average Busy Day Concept. At an installation, the number of assigned, transient, and civil aircraft
operations will usually vary from day to day. BASEOPS requires that the number of operations for aircraft flying at the
installation be entered as a specific number of operations per day. The Air Force does not follow the Federal Aviation
Administration in its use of the “average annual day” in which annual operations are averaged over an entire 365-day year.
The Air Force also does not use the “worst-case day” since it typically does not represent the normal noise exposure either.
Air Force uses the “average busy day” concept, in which the operations entered into BASEOPS represent the average
number of operations that could occur on “routine, busy days.” Non-flying days (for example, weekends or holidays) are
not used in computing the “average busy day” operations.
4.2.5.1. For each assigned, transient, or civil aircraft flying at an installation, compute the number of “annual busy day”
operations by first determining the total yearly operations for the aircraft at the installation. For assigned aircraft, each
squadron usually maintains records of its sorties. Using the sortie count and information furnished by flying squadron
personnel during the interview process, the sortie records for the squadron can be used to compute the total yearly
operations for the aircraft. Once the total yearly operations for the assigned aircraft have been determined, the “average
busy day” operations for the aircraft are computed by dividing the total yearly operations by the number of flying days in a
year. The operations for the “average busy day” can be further separated into daytime and nighttime (and evening, if
required) operations based upon information furnished during the interview process.
4.2.5.1.1. Information on transient and civil aircraft operations can be obtained by examining monthly transient reports
such as Transient Alert logs, AMC terminal reports, maintenance depot records, or, for joint use airfields, the commercial
airline schedules. Using these reports, determine the “annual average day” operations for each transient or civil aircraft by
first computing its total yearly operations at the installation and then dividing the total by 365.
4.2.5.2. There are occasionally exceptions that require some special handling to determine the yearly operations. This
usually occurs because of heavy flying activity caused by events such as special exercises or escalated mission operations.
Yearly operations may also be affected by events such as runway repairs. During the interview process determine if
operations for the past year have been the norm or an exception.
4.2.5.3. The “annual average day” must be determined for each type of aircraft using the installation’s runways. The
information you arrive at should correlate with an average day based on the Air Traffic Control’s yearly count.

4.3 Data Collection Process. With an understanding of the various types of operational data that need to be collected, the
process for collecting the data is now discussed.
4.3.1. The first set of interviews should be with Radar Control, Air Traffic Control, and Base Weather Office. Information
from Radar Control and Air Traffic Control will be needed when interviewing the Flying Squadrons. other interviews
needed are with Transient Alert and Military Airlift Schedulers. Following is the type of information they can provide:
4.3.1.1. Base Weather - Local Climatological Data Summaries that will let you determine the average monthly
temperature and relative humidity needed by NOISEMAP.
4.3.1.2. Radar Control - Details on known flight restrictions or avoidance areas, the Standard Instrument Departures
(SID), Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) arrivals, and any hard altitude restrictions. Additional information needed includes
dimensions, heading and altitudes of the IFR patterns at the installation. Radar Control can also provide reports of number
of transient aircraft doing instrument approaches. These reports can be used as “sanity checks” against operational data
gathered from the interviews with flying organizations.
4.3.1.3. Air Traffic Control - Information on Visual Flight Rule (VFR) arrivals and departures, the VFR entry points, and
the dimensions, headings and altitudes of the VFR patterns. Although no written records are kept on patterns done by
transient aircraft, the Tower can provide the best estimate on the type and number of patterns done by transient aircraft
including aircraft using the installation runways for proficiency work only (some of these transients do not land and are not
serviced by Transient Alert). Air Traffic Control can also provide copies of monthly or yearly tower counts. These reports
will be used as a “sanity check” to substantiate operational data gathered from interviews with flying organizations. If
differences exist determine the reason for the discrepancies and document the rational for utilizing the data in the report.
4.3.1.3.1. The operational counts should also be compared to operational counts described in previous AICUZ studies.
4.3.1.4. Transient Alert - maintains a log of every transient aircraft making a full stop and serviced at the installation.
Transient Alert can provide a copy of the log that identifies transient aircraft by type and the time it arrives and departs
from the base on a day by day basis. Review this list and ask questions about aircraft which are unfamiliar (engine type and
number of engines).
4.3.1.5. Military Airlift Schedulers - A copy of a log, the Monthly Station Traffic Handling Report, that identifies
military airlift aircraft by type and time it arrives and departs from the base on a day by day basis.
34                                                                                            AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

4.3.2. Assigned Aircraft. Each flying squadron should be interviewed to find out where they fly, how they fly and how
often they fly. The primary source of information for assigned aircraft are the Stan/Eval pilots and the squadron schedulers.
They know the typical flying activities of their unit. The following should be noted by the data collector.
4.3.2.1. Aircraft model and type of engine
4.3.2.2. Number of primary assigned aircraft
4.3.2.3. The number of flying days per month
4.3.2.4. The frequency and schedules of special exercises that occur
4.3.2.5. The percent Runway Use
4.3.2.6. Any Runway displacement
4.3.2.7. The number of sorties flown in an average day or week and what type of sorties are flown ( example of sortie types:
Airlift support, refueling support, mission, local, low level, closed pattern proficiency work, etc.). Each type of sortie
should be investigated to determine the types and numbers of operations involved. Remember: one sortie is composed of
more than one operation (one departure, one arrival, and a number of closed patterns). To better determine the operations
information you will need:
4.3.2.7.1. The percentage of sorties that return to airfield and practice multiple approaches. Determine the types of
patterns flown and how many.
4.3.2.7.2. The percentage of training sorties (aircraft stay at airfield to practice multiple approaches only).
4.3.2.8. The percent of sorties that depart and/or arrive between 2200 and 0700 hours.
4.3.2.9. The percentage of departures that are standard instrument departures (SID) and the percentage that the pilot is
usually given clearance to fly direct
4.3.2.10. The percentage of departures in afterburner (if so equipped) or reduced thrust
4.3.2.11. The percentage of arrivals that are straight-in full stop. The arrivals may consist of an instrument approach
(PAR, ASR, ILS, TACAN, VOR, NDB) or a visual (VFR) approach to a straight-in full stop
4.3.2.12. The percentage of arrivals that include a pitchout or overhead approach and the percent of these arrivals that must
re-enter
4.3.2.13. Any special maneuvers required (Simulated Flameout (SFO), Functional Check Flights (FCF), etc.)
4.3.3. The term flight profile refers to the power settings, airspeeds, altitudes, and track distances used on a flight segment
by the pilot. One of the advantages in using the NOISEMAP program is custom profiles flown at a base can be input into
BASEOPS rather than using some "standard" way of flying. The result leads to more accurate contour predictions. This
additional accuracy requires the user to supply detailed flight profile data for each segment of each flight track. The
following explains technical terms used in pilot interviews:
4.3.3.1. Track distance refers to the cumulative distance measured from either departure end of runway or approach end of
runway to the location of the aircraft. It is a 2 dimensional representation of the actual three-dimensional flight track.
4.3.3.2. Distance for flight tracks is usually measured in terms of nautical miles (NM). For conversion purposes, 1 NM
=6080 feet but typically rounded to 6000 feet). The distance is usually measured from either the runway or a navigational
aid (NAVAID).
4.3.3.3. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) distance is the distance an aircraft is from a navigational aid (NAVAID).
In order to use the DME distance, you need to know which NAVAID the DME distance is measured from. The radial
measured off the NAVAID further pinpoints the location of the aircraft. DME should not be used unless it is measured
from a installation’s NAVAID.
4.3.3.4. Altitude is another part of the flight profile that must be determined. Altitude must be entered into BASEOPS as
Altitude Above Ground Level (AGL). Pilots will usually provide altitude information in terms of Altitude Above Mean Sea
Level (MSL). Pilots generally give altitudes below 1000 feet AGL in terms of AGL and above 1000 feet AGL in MSL. For
accuracy, ask the pilot if the altitude is AGL or MSL.
4.3.3.5. In order to get the flight profile information needed for BASEOPS input, interviews with the pilots must cover
every flight track the aircraft flies. Establishing the exact location of flight tracks is a very important step in the data
collection process since the contours are dependent on where, when, and how the aircraft fly each flight track.
4.3.4. All flight tracks and flight profile data describing how the aircraft actually flies in terms of power setting, airspeed,
and altitude must be determined for assigned, transient, and civil aircraft operations. To collect this information it will be
necessary to investigate (1) Departure Tracks, (2) Arrival Tracks and (3) Closed Patterns. When interviewing pilots focus
on only one of these three types of tracks at a time. While analyzing a specific type of track, the following procedures are
recommended:
4.3.4.1. Request the pilot draw each type of track (either departure, arrival, or pattern) on tracing paper over background
map or directly on a copy of the background map, remembering to get headings and distances.
4.3.4.2. Ask for percent of runway usage. This should add up to 100 percent for each runway.
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                                    35

4.3.4.3. Determine the percentage of time each track is flown. This should add up to 100 percent for the type of track
(departure, arrival, or pattern).
4.3.4.4. The percentage of operations on the track between 2200 and 0700 hours.
4.3.4.5. Remember to check to see if special procedures are performed such as Simulated Flameout (SFO) and Functional
Check Flight (FCF).
4.3.4.6. Remember, there are two ends of a runway and you need flight track information and profiles for each runway end.
4.3.4.7. Once all the tracks of one type (departure, arrival, or pattern) are drawn, have the pilot place the specific flight
profile information on each track. Each configuration change point (change in power setting, altitude, or airspeed) along
the track should be marked.
4.3.5. The following details listed in Table 4.3 should be included in interviews regarding the specific type of track
(departure, arrival, or pattern):

Table 4.3. Questions on Flight Tracks.
                                                   For Departures you will need to know:

 If the pilot is required to perform a preflight check at the hammerhead of the runway. If so, determine the power setting of the engines
 and the length of time the check takes. This information will be entered into BASEOPS as an engine run-up at the hammerhead
 The power setting of the aircraft at the runway threshold, immediately before brake release
 The time aircraft is at this power before releasing brake
 If the aircraft uses both Afterburner and Military Power or reduced thrust and full thrust departures, two separate power settings and
 airspeeds will be needed
 If more than one profile (military, afterburner, reduced thrust) is used for departures, what percentage of the time each is done
 Distance aircraft travels before rotating (lifting off). At this point you will need the power setting and airspeed
 Altitude, power setting, and airspeed of the aircraft at the end of the runway
 Distance to the next aircraft configuration change:            Power changes (afterburner off, thrust reduced)
                                                                Change in rate of climb
                                                                Change in rate of airspeed
                                                                Altitude
 Repeat this process until you have reached an altitude of 10,000 AGL or a minimum of 20 miles from the base. (The exception to the
 20 mile rule would be an aircraft descent into other airspace; i.e., low-level route. In that case, level the aircraft at its highest altitude
 prior to entry.) At each configuration change point, get the altitude, power setting, and airspeed of the aircraft.
 Determine if any special departure procedures are flown that were not disclosed.
 Some examples include:          Functional check flights
                                 Live ordnance departures
                                 Any other unordinary maneuvers
                                                      For Arrivals you will need to know:

 Power setting, airspeed, and altitude as aircraft crosses runway threshold.
 Location of each aircraft configuration change along the track.
 For arrivals, this may include:          When aircraft levels off
                                          When aircraft intersects glide slope
                                          When pilot puts power back
                                          When pilot puts power up
                                          When aircraft is one mile from approach end of runway
                                          When aircraft reaches initial and/or final approach fix
                                          When aircraft begins descent into local airspace

 Remember: You will need the power setting, airspeed and altitude at each configuration change point.
 Remember to check if there are other specialized maneuvers that were not disclosed, such as circling approaches or simulated
 flameout’s
 If more than one profile (precision, non-precision,) is done, what percentage is each
 For VFR arrivals, you will need a percentage for overhead versus straight-in full stops, if applicable
                                                For Closed Patterns, you will need to know

 The type of closed pattern flown. There can be several types of closed patterns because of the many type of approaches or maneuvers
 pilots are required to practice. Some examples are:
 Closed Inside Downwind (usually a racetrack).
 Closed Outside Downwind (also called a Reentry Pattern). This pattern will sometimes have a dogleg to a straight-in visual or to a
 pitchout.
 Rectangular Pattern (also called Conventional or simply VFR pattern). This pattern is similar to a closed inside downwind except
36                                                                                                   AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

 crosswind and base legs consist of four 90 degree turns and usually a short final.
 Radar pattern (may be called Successive IFR Pattern, Repetitive Ground Control Approach (GCA) Pattern). This pattern is flown with
 Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).
 Multiple VOR or TACAN approaches are considered closed patterns, not arrivals.
 The width of the pattern.
 Distance to each aircraft configuration change. For closed patterns, this may include:
 If aircraft touches down and rolls before lifting off (touch-and-go), you will need the distance of the roll and the power and airspeed
 when lifting off.
 If aircraft makes a low approach, you will need the distance traveled at the lowest altitude before beginning climb. You will need the
 power, airspeed, and altitude at the point where the climb begins.
 Change in rate of climb.
 Change in rate of airspeed (either a gain or loss).
 When level-off at pattern altitude is reached.
 When descent from pattern altitude begins.
 When aircraft configures for approach.
 The power and airspeed at approach end of runway.

 Remember: You will need the power setting, airspeed and altitude at each change.
 If more than one profile (precision, non-precision, visual straight-in) is done on a closed pattern, what percentage of the time is each
 done

4.3.6. Helocopter Aircraft. At some Air Force installations, a helicopter unit is stationed on or adjacent to the
installation. A visit to the helicopter unit is required to obtain information on the unit’s flying activities. Data collection
for helicopter information can be obtained using the same procedures used for gathering information on fixed-wing aircraft.
The helicopter data is recorded on the same data sheets as the fixed-wing aircraft.
4.3.7. Transient and Civil Aircraft. For transient aircraft, you will have to rely on the logs maintained by Transient Alert
and the closed pattern estimates Air Traffic Control can provide. The arrival and departure tracks used by transient and
civil aircraft can be obtained from Radar Control and Air Traffic Control. The logs obtained from Transient Alert and
Military Airlift should provide information on frequency of civil and transient military daily operations. In the case of joint
use airports, the Official Airline Guide (OAG) provides operations for each commercial aircraft as a function of time of day.
The OAG contains information on the type of aircraft flown and the dates and times of arrival and departure. Through the
interview process, the Aero Club management can usually provide information regarding the frequency of the club’s daily
operations. When collecting the operations data for any of the these aircraft, determine the number of flying days per week
or month.
4.3.7.1. Flight profile information will also need to be determined, if possible. Aero Club information can usually be
obtained from the Aero Club manager. You would follow the same interview process you used for the assigned aircraft.
The NOISEMAP program has default flight profile information which can be used for transient and civil aircraft. However,
when using the default profiles, you need to remember that it is generic data. Flight segment distances and altitudes may
vary at the installation and will need to be changed on the default profiles.
4.3.7.2. Once daily operations are calculated for the transient aircraft, enter the information on the Transient Aircraft
Operations Form, AF Form 4000 (See sample data in Figure 4.4).

4.3.8. Flight Track and Profile Data. All flight tracks must be determined for the assigned, transient, and civil aircraft
operations. Establishing the exact location of flight tracks is a very important step in the operational data collection process
since the noise contours are dependent on where the aircraft flies. The credibility of the AICUZ would be in question if the
report fails to represent a track where aircraft actually do fly. The interview process described above should include all the
flight tracks. Once this information has been gathered, the information must be transferred to AICUZ data sheets for entry
into BASEOPS.
4.3.8.1. Flight Track Sketches. All flight tracks must be sketched onto separate Flight Track and Flight Profile Data
Sheet, AF Form 3999. An example of a departure track is shown in Figure 4.5. It is necessary to provide track sketches
along with track distances for each segment of the flight path. When completing the Flight Track sketches, the following
information must be identified on the data sheet:
4.3.8.1.1. The runway used for the flight track.
4.3.8.1.2. The type of flight track (departure, arrival, closed pattern)
4.3.8.1.3. The 4-character flight track identification label (discussed below in 4.3.8.2)
4.3.8.1.4. A sketch of the flight track including magnetic headings (or angle, if known), radii of turns, and distances on
each leg of the track.
4.3.8.1.5. A brief written description of the flight track.
4.3.8.1.6 Once the flight track sketch is drawn and labeled with the above information, copies of the track should be made--
one copy for each aircraft type that flies the track. For each aircraft using the track, a copy of the AF Form 4001, Flight
Track and Profile (Figure 4.5) should be used to identify the following data about the flight profile flown on the track:
4.3.8.1.6.1. The type of aircraft
4.3.8.1.6.2. Location of each configuration change point along the track
4.3.8.1.6.3. At the configuration change point, give the cumulative distance along the track measured in the following way:
4.3.8.1.6.3.1. On departures, cumulative distance is measured from the beginning of the runway or break release point.
4.3.8.1.6.3.2. On arrivals, cumulative distance is measured from the approach end of the runway. This distance is
measured backwards from the way the track is flown.
4.3.8.1.6.3.3. On closed patterns, cumulative distance is measured from the beginning of the runway, since the departure
portion of the pattern will be entered into BASEOPS first.
4.3.8.1.6.4. At the configuration change point, give the altitude, power setting, and airspeed of the aircraft.
4.3.8.1.6.5. The daytime and nighttime daily operations for the aircraft on this track (also evening operations for California
installations).
4.3.8.1.6.6. A four-character alphanumeric label to identify the aircraft flight profile on the track.

4.3.8.2. Labeling Flight Tracks. For entry into BASEOPS, each flight track is labeled. The flight track designator is a
four-character alphanumeric code to identify the track. The preferred procedure for labeling tracks is as follows:
4.3.8.2.1. The first two characters identify the runway. For parallel runways drop the 10’s digit and use the 1’s digit with
an L (left), R (right) or C (center).
4.3.8.2.2. The third character identifies the flight track type. D for departures, A for arrivals, and C for closed patterns.
4.3.8.2.3. The fourth character will simply be the number of the flight track in sequential order. Use digits 1-9 and 0 and
then A-Z in the fourth character.
4.3.8.2.4. Using this procedure, track 21C2 would indicate a second closed pattern on runway 21. Track 09AC would
represent an arrival track on runway 09 (the thirteen arrival track on that runway). If an installation has three parallel
runways identified by 21R, 21L and 21C, track 1CD4 would represent a departure track on runway 21C.
4.3.8.3. Determining Daily Operations on Flight Tracks. The daily operations need to be determined for each flight
track profile. This is calculated from the information gathered during the interview process. Special care needs to be used
if a flight track has more than one profile on it for one aircraft type. For example, (1) the aircraft departs in both
afterburner and military power, (2) the aircraft uses straight-in and circling approaches on the track or (3) the aircraft flies
both precision and non-precision multiple approaches on the closed patterns. If a track has more than one profile for an
aircraft, that will need to be included when calculating the aircraft’s daily operations.
4.3.8.3.1. Additional information gathered during the interview process is used to determine the daily operations on each
flight profile. From the information given on sorties and percentage of use for both runways and tracks, the average daily
operations can be calculated for the various departures, approaches and closed patterns. This information includes:
4.3.8.3.1.1. Runway split (the percentage of time one runway is used over another).
4.3.8.3.1.2. Nighttime and daytime operations. Sometimes specific information can be gathered on nighttime flying
frequency. Sometimes a percentage is used to determine nighttime operations.
4.3.8.3.1.3. Mission requirements. For example, one squadron may do 80% of their sorties away from the base (counted as
arrivals and departures only), while 20% of their sorties are local proficiency sorties (counted as closed patterns).
4.3.8.3.1.4. Off station sorties.
4.3.8.3.2. Daily operations for transient and military airlift aircraft must also be determined. The logs obtained from
Transient Alert and Military Airlift should provide information on frequency of civil and transient military daily operations.
In the case of joint use airports, the Official Airline Guide (OAG) provides operations for each commercial aircraft as a
function of time of day. When calculating the daily operations for any of these aircraft, remember to determine the number
of flying days per week or month the aircraft could fly at the installation. Information obtained from the Aero Club
management can usually provide information from which the frequency of the club’s daily operations can be calculated.
4.3.8.3.3. Once the daily operations for each flight track profile flown by each aircraft is determined it should be recorded
on the profiled flight track sketch. It also will be recorded on the Flight Track Inventory Data Sheet.
4.3.8.4. Flight Track Inventory Data Sheet. The AF Form 4002, Flight Track Inventory (See example in Figure 4.6) is a
summary of the operations per flight track, itemized on a runway by runway basis. A separate data sheet should be
prepared for each runway. These data sheets indicate the number of daily operations during both daytime and nighttime
hours for each track. All departures, approaches, and closed patterns should be included on these sheets, remembering a
flight track may have more than one profile. All aircraft, (assigned, transient and civil) should be included on these flight
track inventory sheets.

4.3.9. Aircraft Maintenance and Engine Ground Run-ups. Engine maintenance can be a significant source of noise. In
order to predict the contributions of ground run-up activities, obtain information on both in-frame and out-of-frame engine
testing. Two types of data need to be acquired. The first type include the locations of the ground run-ups and the direction
of the nose of the aircraft at each location. The second set of data is a summary of the ground run-up procedure including
the duration of each run-up as a function of power setting and the number of operations (daytime and nighttime). Aircraft
maintenance personnel responsible for engine runs should be interviewed to find out where and how often maintenance
work is performed. The following information should be obtained by the data collector:
4.3.9.1. Aircraft model and type of engine and number of engines on the aircraft.
4.3.9.2. The locations and headings (direction of the nose of the aircraft) where engine maintenance runs are done( this
should be marked on a base map).
4.3.9.3. Test Cell, Test Stand, or Hush House locations (also marked on the base map).
4.3.9.4. Any special locations for power runs and any noise suppression used.
4.3.9.5. The maximum power the aircraft is permitted or authorized to run at in parking spots.
4.3.9.6. If engines require warm-up prior to flight or prior to maintenance runs.
4.3.9.7. If engines require cool down after flight or after maintenance runs.
4.3.9.8. If an engine requires scavenge (momentary increase in engine power prior to engine shutoff, required to expel
burned gases or other substances from engine cylinders).
4.3.9.9. Establish the types of maintenance runs. These may include:
4.3.9.9.1. Operational Checks (Idle Runs) such as: Starter and Operations Checks. Leak Checks. Oil and Fuel Pressure
Checks. Hydraulic System Checks.
4.3.9.9.2. Electrical and Environmental System Malfunctions (Power Runs): Pressurization Malfunctions. System
Component Checks. Electrical System Operational Checks.
4.3.9.9.3. Engine Performance Checks: Acceleration Checks. Engine Vibration Checks. Engine De-icing Checks.
Alignment Checks.
4.3.9.9.4. Engine Replacement/Malfunctions and Pre/Post-flight Checks.
4.3.9.10. For each type of engine run, the following information is required:
4.3.9.10.1. Length, location, and number of engines used during the runs.
4.3.9.10.2. Power of each engine. Determine if one or more engines go to power while others stay at idle.
4.3.9.10.3. Number of times a day, week, month the run is performed.
4.3.9.10.4. The percent of the engine runs occurring between 2200 and 0700 hours.
4.3.9.11. Test cells and hush houses usually have their own crews and those individuals should be contacted and
interviewed concerning the maintenance runs performed in these facilities.
4.3.9.12. Ground run-up locations and headings are recorded on AF Form 4003, Ground Run-up Locations (See the
example in Figure 4.7). The Pad ID is any four-character alphanumeric designator that can be used in BASEOPS to
identify the specific runup pad. If latitude and longitude is unavailable for the run-up pad, the coordinates of its location
can be determined by measuring its distance from the first runway entered into BASEOPS (called the primary runway).
Refer to the BASEOPS Users Manual for further information on measuring distances to locate run-up pads.
4.3.9.13. Data concerned with specific engine run-ups should be entered on the AF Form 4004, Engine Ground Run-up
Summary Data Sheet (Figure 4.8). When entering the information into BASEOPS, the computer operator will assign a
four-digit alphanumeric designator to the specific ground run-up procedure to identify it.

4.4. Conclusion. Once the data has been collected and inputted into BASOPS, the input summary files are printed out,
tracks and ground run-up locations plotted out at the scale of the background map. The data then is reviewed, confirmed
and coordinated on by the interviewee to ensure that the data is realistic and accurate. BASEOPS is a computerized
program for entering operational data needed to compute the total noise exposure around an installation. The BASEOPS
manual should be referred to for instructions on inputting the operational data. NOISEMAP is a group of computer
programs developed for prediction of noise exposure in the vicinity of an installation due to aircraft flight, maintenance, and
ground run-up operations. The NOISEMAP manual should be referred to for instructions on the use of the program.

 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP) FOR AIRCRAFT NOISE AROUND AIR FORCE
                                 INSTALLATIONS

5.1. Introduction. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law on 1 January 1970. NEPA
establishes national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment,
and it provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies.
5.1.1. The NEPA process evaluates the environmental effects of a Proposed Action, and alternatives. One of three levels of
analysis and documentation is required, based on whether an undertaking can significantly affect the environment:
5.1.1.1. A Categorical Exclusion (CATEX) determination
5.1.1.2. Preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA)
5.1.1.3. Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
5.1.2. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7061, the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), describes the procedural
requirements that must be followed by the Air Force in order to comply with NEPA. Figure 5.1 presents a block diagram of
the major steps in this process.

5.2. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of the steps needed to complete the aircraft noise
portion of an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), see Figure 5.2.
5.2.1. Data Requirements. EIAP purpose is to assess significant impacts of a proposed action on the existing
environment. The first steps in the process are associated with defining the Proposed Action and alternatives, and
identifying the data inputs required for the analysis (data collection phase). Two types of input data must be identified:
5.2.1.1. Description of the aircraft noise. Descriptions and analysis of the aircraft noise must be presented for both the
existing conditions and the proposed action. When assessing an EIAP action, Air Force policy requires that existing
(baseline) conditions be defined in a previously publicly-released noise contour map disseminated either through NEPA or
AICUZ. The baseline data will be revalidated, to ensure accuracy, by using the data collection techniques described in
Chapter 4 of this handbook.

5.2.1.2. Description of the affected environment (receivers). The second type of data input required in the problem
definition phase of the analysis is a description of the affected environment, often referred to as the receivers. The affected
environment category includes humans, animals and structures that may be affected by the change in the noise
environment. In addition to humans, NEPA and the EIAP include animals (wild and domestic) and structures as receiver
classes that must also be considered.

5.2.2. Noise Prediction. The prediction phase involves using the NOISEMAP computer program and the aircraft noise
information for the proposed action to predict existing and future aircraft noise levels at receiver locations. NOISEMAP is
used to perform noise exposure computations at specified locations and to develop the noise contours. Noise exposure
predictions are presented in terms of Day-Night Sound Level (DNL).
5.2.2.1. The existing and future aircraft noise environments are compared to obtain the expected effect on the receivers.
Effects on people include annoyance, sleep disturbance, and speech interference. Effects on animals include their ability to
reproduce successfully or other concerns, as in the case of wildlife, or they may involve potential economic losses, as in the
case of domestic animals such as cattle. Structural effects are normally associated with potential damage.
5.2.3. Impact Evaluation. When the existing and future effects are calculated, the differences are compared to establish
the degree of change. The user must determine how many people, animals and/or structures will be affected by the
proposed change within each noise contour range. The exposed population then must be evaluated against the available
models to determine the effects for existing and future noise. Comparison of existing and future effects leads to a
determination of impact. For example, the prevalence of annoyance model may predict that 20% of a population is “highly
annoyed” by existing operations. Noise generated by the Proposed Action may result in a prediction that 28% of the
population will be “highly annoyed.” The resulting change is the predicted impact of the Proposed Action (i.e., 20% vs
28%). When this change is substantial, it becomes a significant impact and requires additional study of alternative actions.
When the change is judged insignificant, then a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is made, as shown in Figure 5.2.
An EIAP Handbook is planned to be developed to help the user evaluate the impacts.
5.2.4. Mitigation. A determination of significant impact typically requires that mitigation strategies be pursued in the
form of alternative actions, and that steps associated with the preparation of an EIS be followed. This last phase of the
process, noise mitigation, may take many forms. For aircraft noise, these strategies include changing a flight track, profile
AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999                                                                                                  51

and/or alignment, decreasing the number of operations, modifications to runway usage and avoiding flying during certain
times of the day.
5.2.4.1. It is important to keep in mind that any mitigation strategy considered must first meet the operational requirements
of the mission being evaluated. Thus, it is important that the environmental planner work closely with the airspace
manager and/or the route planner when considering alternative actions.

                                                    DNL CONCEPT

A2.1. Noise Environment Descriptor. The noise contour methodologies used are the Day-Night Average Sound Level
(DNL) and the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) for the state of California. These systems describe the noise
environment. Efforts to provide a national uniform standard for noise assessment has resulted in adoption of DNL by the
Environmental Protection Agency as the standard noise descriptor. The Air Force uses the DNL/CNEL descriptors in
assessing the amount of aircraft noise exposure and as a metric for community response to the various levels of exposure.
The DNL values used for planning purposes are 65, 70, 75, and 80 dB. The state of California uses CNEL and employs a
60 dB value in addition to the others. CNEL was developed for the state of California and is very similar to the DNL,
except that it introduces an intermediate weighting for evening hours between 7:00 and 10:00 PM. The CNEL values are
generally only slightly higher than DNL in most situations.
A2.1.1. A noise environment descriptor should consider the annoyance of a single event, the effect of repetition of such
events and the time of day in which these events occur. The DNL and CNEL begins with a single event descriptor and adds
corrections for the number of events and the time of day over a 24 hour period. Since the primary concern is residential,
night-time events are considered more annoying than daytime events and are weighted accordingly.

A2.2. Noise Event Descriptor. The single event noise descriptor used in both the DNL and CNEL systems is the Sound
Exposure Level (SEL). The SEL measure is an integration of the “A” weighted noise level over a period of a single event
such as an aircraft flyover, in dB. Frequency, magnitude, and duration vary according to aircraft type, and power setting,
therefore, individual aircraft noise data is collected for various types at different power settings and phases of flight.
A2.2.1. In addition to the assessment of aircraft flight operations, noise resulting from aircraft engine maintenance checks
on the ground are incorporated. Data concerning the orientation of the noise source, type of engine, number of runs, the
power settings, their duration, and use of suppression devices are collected. This information is processed and the noise
contribution is added to the noise generated by flying operations to produce noise contours reflecting the overall noise
environment.

                                             ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONES

A3.1. Introduction. When the AICUZ program first began, there were no comprehensive studies on accident potential. In
support of the program, a study of Air Force accidents was accomplished. The initial study assessed aircraft data from 1968
to 1972 within 10 nautical miles of airfields. The study revealed that 369 accidents occurred within this area and 75% of
these accidents occurred on or adjacent to the runway, in a corridor 3000 feet wide, and extending from the runway
threshold along the centerline for a distant of 15,000 feet.
A3.1.1. Three zones were established based on the accident study: the Clear Zone (CZ), Accident Potential Zone I (APZ I)
and Accident Potential II (APZ II). The clear zone starts at the end of the runway and extends outward 3,000 feet. It has
the highest incident of accidents of the three zones. The Air Force adopted a policy of acquiring property rights to areas
designated as clear zones due to the high accident potential. APZ I extends from the clear zone an additional 5,000 feet and
APZ II extends from APZ I an additional 7,000 feet. Each area has a lesser accident potential.
A3.1.2. The risk of people due to aircraft accidents is small, however, an accident is a high consequence event and the
result is often catastrophic. Despite stringent maintenance requirements and countless hours of training, past history makes
it clear that accidents are going to occur. The Air Force does not attempt to base its land use recommendations on accident
probabilities, but by the fact that an aircraft accident is a significant catastrophic event and poses a higher risk of injury and
damage.

A3.2. Analysis. The potential for aircraft accidents differ between military and commercial/general aviation accidents
because of the variety of aircraft used, the type of missions, and the number of training flights. In 1973, the Air Force
conducted a aircraft accident hazard study in order to identify land near airfields with high risk of accident potential. The
study found that 61% of the accidents were related to landing operations and 30% were takeoff related. It also found that
70% occurred in daylight and that fighter and training aircraft accounted for 80% of the accidents.
A3.2.1. The purpose of the study was to define the accident hazards. The data was plotted in relation to the airfield and it
showed that the accidents were clustered along the runway and its extended centerline. Tables were developed to identify
the frequency of accidents as a function of distance. Tables A3.1 and A3.2 show the percent of accidents and the
cumulative percent of accidents, based on the 1973 accident study.
A3.2.2. Table A3.2 identifies an optimum width of the runway extensions, which would include the maximum percentage
of accidents in the smallest area, which is the 3,000’ width. The data in table A3.2 is then plotted as a distribution of
cumulative percentage of accidents versus the distance of the accident from the runway. Figure A3.1, Distribution of Air
Force Accidents (1968 - 1972), shows that the percentage of accidents rises rapidly from the end of the runway to 3,000
feet, rises gradually to 8,000 feet, continues at about the same increase to 15,000 feet where it almost levels off.

A3.2.3. Using the optimum runway extension width, 3,000 feet, and the cumulative distribution of accidents from the end
of the runway, zones were established which correlated minimum land area with maximum percentage of accidents. The
zone dimensions and accident statistics for the initial study are shown in figure A3.2.

A3.2.5. Using the designated zones and the accident data, a ratio of percentage of accidents to percentage of area size can
be calculated. The ratios in Table A3.3 show that the clear zone, with the smallest area size and the highest number of
accidents, has the highest ratio, followed by the runway and adjacent area, APZ I and then APZ II.

SLUCM - Standard Land Use Coding Manual, U.S. Department of Transportation.
Y - (Yes) - Land use and related structures are compatible without restriction.
N - (No) - Land use and related structures are not compatible and should be prohibited.
Yx - (yes with restrictions) - Land use and related structures generally compatible; see notes indicated by the superscript.
Nx - (no with exceptions) - See notes indicated by the superscript.

NLR - (Noise Level Reduction) - NLR (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation measures into
the design and construction of the structures.
A, B, or C - Land use and related structures generally compatible; measures to achieve NLR for A(DNL/CNEL 65-69),
B(DNL/CNEL 70-74), C(DNL/CNEL 75-79), need to be incorporated into the design and construction of structures.
A*, B*, and C* - Land use generally compatible with NLR. However, measures to achieve an overall noise level reduction do not
necessarily solve noise difficulties and additional evaluation is warranted. See appropriate footnotes.
* - The designation of these uses as "compatible" in this zone reflects individual federal agencies’ and program considerations of
general cost and feasibility factors, as well as past community experiences and program objectives. Localities, when evaluating the
application of these guidelines to specific situations, may have different concerns or goals to consider.

NOTES:
1. Suggested maximum density of 1-2 dwelling units per acre, possibly increased under a Planned Unit Development (PUD) where
maximum lot coverage is less than 20 percent.
2. Within each land use category, uses exist where further deliberating by local authorities may be needed due to the variation of
densities in people and structures. Shopping malls and shopping centers are considered incompatible use in any accident potential
zone (CZ, APZ I, or APZ II).
3. The placing of structures, buildings, or above-ground utility lines in the clear zone is subject to severe restrictions. In a majority
of the clear zones, these items are prohibited. See AFI 32-7060 (formerly AFR 19-9) and AFJM 32-8008 (formerly AFM 86-14) for
specific guidance.
4. No passenger terminals and no major above-ground transmission lines in APZ I.
5. Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution.
6. Low-intensity office uses only. Meeting places, auditoriums, etc., are not recommended.
7. Excludes chapels.
8. Facilities must be low intensity.
9. Clubhouse not recommended.
10. Areas for gatherings of people are not recommended.
11.
A. Although local conditions may require residential use, it is discouraged in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB and strongly discouraged in
DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB. The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined and an evaluation indicating a
demonstrated community need for residential use would not be met if development were prohibited in these zones should be
conducted prior to approvals.
B. Where the community determines the residential uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor Noise Level
Reduction (NLR) for DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB and DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB should be incorporated into building codes and considered in
individual approvals
C. NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning, and design and use of
berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor exposure, particularly from near ground level sources. Measures that reduce outdoor
noise should be used whenever practical in preference to measures which only protect interior spaces.
12. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range must be incorporated into the
design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the
normal noise level is low.
13. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range must be incorporated into the
design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the
normal noise level is low.
14. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 75-79 dB range must be incorporated into the
design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the
normal noise level is low.
15. If noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, the use is compatible.
16. No buildings.
17. Land use is compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.
18. Residential buildings require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range.
19. Residential buildings require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range.
20. Residential buildings are not permitted.

personnel.

SUBJECT: Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study

1. This Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for [NAME] Air Force Base is an update of the original
AICUZ study dated [Date] and updated [Date]. The update was initiated because of [provide reason for the study such as
flight track changes, operational changes, and mission changes]. It is a reevaluation of aircraft noise and accident
potential related to Air Force flying operations. It is designed to aid in the development of local planning mechanisms
which will protect the public safety and health, as well as preserve the operational capabilities of [NAME] AFB.

2. The enclosed report contains a summary description of the affected area around the base. The report outlines the
location of runway clear zones, aircraft accident potential zones and noise contours, and recommends compatible land use
for areas in the vicinity of the base. It is our hope that this information will be incorporated into your community plans,
zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, and other related documents.

3. The basic objective of the AICUZ program is to achieve compatible uses of public and private lands in the vicinity of
military airfields by controlling incompatible development through local actions. This update provides noise contours based
upon the Day-Night Average A-Weighted Sound Level (DNL) metric used by the Air Force. This report provides the
information necessary to maximize beneficial use of the land surrounding [NAME] Air Force Base while minimizing the
potential for degradation of the health and safety of the affected public.

4. We greatly value the positive relationship [NAME] AFB has experienced with its neighbors over the years. As a partner
in the process, we have attempted to minimize noise disturbances through such actions as: minimizing night flying,
avoiding flights over heavily populated areas, installing jet engine noise suppressers for maintenance activities, etc. We
solicit your cooperation in implementing the recommendations and guidelines presented in this AICUZ report.

                                           SECTION 1 PURPOSE AND NEED

1.1 Introduction

This study is an update of the [NAME] Air Force Base Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study. The update
presents and documents the changes to the AICUZ for the period of [YEAR of last AICUZ] to [YEAR]. It reaffirms Air
Force policy of promoting public health, safety, and general welfare in areas surrounding [BASE] AFB. The report
presents changes in flight operations since the last study, and provides current noise contours and compatible use guidelines
for land areas surrounding the base. It is hoped this information will assist the local communities, and serve as a tool for
future planning and zoning activities. The changes in the AICUZ are attributed to:

         [List reason and changes from last AICUZ]



1.2 Purpose and Need

As stated in the previous [NAME] AFB AICUZ Study, the purpose of the AICUZ program is to promote compatible land
development in areas subject to aircraft noise and accident potential. As the cities of [List the cities], towns of [List the
towns], and counties of [List the counties] prepare and modify their land use development plans, recommendations from
this updated AICUZ study should be included in their planning process to prevent incompatibility that may compromise
[NAME] AFB ability to fulfill its mission requirements. Accident potential and aircraft noise should be major
considerations in their planning processes.

Air Force AICUZ land use guidelines reflect land use recommendations for clear zones, accident potential zones I and II,
and four noise zones. These guidelines have been established on the basis of studies prepared and sponsored by several
federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Environmental Protection Agency, Air
Force, and state and local agencies. The guidelines recommend land uses which are compatible with airfield operations
while allowing maximum beneficial use of adjacent properties. The Air Force has no desire to recommend land use
regulations which render property economically useless. It does, however, have an obligation to the inhabitants of the
[NAME] AFB environs and to the citizens of the United States to point out ways to protect the people in adjacent areas, as
well as the public investment in the installation itself.

The AICUZ program uses the latest technology to define noise levels in areas near Air Force installations. An analysis of
[NAME] AFB’s flying operations was performed, including types of aircraft, flight patterns utilized, variations in altitude,
power settings, number of operations, and hours of operations. This information was used to develop the noise contours
contained in this study. The Department of Defense (DoD) NOISEMAP methodology and the Day-Night Average A-
Weighted Sound Level (DNL) metric was used to define the noise zones for [NAME] AFB.

1.3 Process and Procedure

Preparation and presentation of this update to [NAME] AFB’s AICUZ Study is part of the continuing Air Force
participation in the local planning process. It is recognized that, as local communities prepare land use plans and zoning
ordinances, the Air Force has the responsibility of providing inputs on its activities relating to the community. This study is
presented in the spirit of mutual cooperation and assistance by [NAME] AFB to aid in the local land use planning process.
This study updates information on base flying activities since [Year of last AICUZ]. Noise contours portrayed on the
AICUZ maps in this study are based on current mission plans.

Data collection was conducted at [NAME] AFB in [Month and Year]. Aircraft operational and maintenance data was
obtained to derive average daily operations by runway and type of aircraft. This data was supplemented by flight track
information (where we fly), flight profile information (how we fly), and ground run-up information. After verification for
accuracy, data was input into the NOISEMAP program to produce day-night average noise level (DNL) contours. Contours
were plotted on an area map and overlaid with clear zone and accident potential zone areas. Appendix A of Volume II
contains detailed information on the development of the AICUZ program.

2.3 Flying Activity

To describe the relationship between aircraft operations and land use, it is necessary to fully evaluate the exact nature of
flying activities. An inventory has been made of such things as the types of aircraft based at [NAME] AFB, where those
aircraft fly, how high they fly, how many times they fly over a given area, and at what time of day they operate.

Current aircraft activity at [NAME] AFB is summarized below.

        TYPE OF AIRCRAFT                              AVERAGE DAILY OPERATIONS
            [Aircraft]                                 [Number of Daily Operations]

In addition to these assigned aircraft, numerous transient aircraft from other military installations land and take-off from
[NAME] AFB.

[NAME] AFB aircraft use the following basic flight patterns:
    Straight out departure.
    Straight in approach.
    Overhead landing pattern.
    Instrument flight rules (IFR) or radar closed pattern.
    Visual flight rules (VFR) or closed pattern.
    Re-entry VFR pattern.

[NAME] AFB flight patterns (Figure 2) result from several considerations, including:
    Takeoff patterns routed to avoid heavily populated areas as much as possible.
    Air Force criteria governing the speed, rate of climb, and turning radius for each type of aircraft.
    Efforts to control and schedule missions to keep noise levels low, especially at night.
    Coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to minimize conflict with civilian aircraft operations.

To the maximum extent possible, engine run-up locations have been established in areas that minimize noise for people on-
base, as well as for those in the surrounding communities. Normal base operations do not include late night engine runups,
but heavy work loads or unforeseen contingencies sometimes require a limited number of nighttime engine runups.

Airfield environs planning is concerned with three primary aircraft operational/land use determinants: (1) accident potential
to land users, (2) aircraft noise, and (3) hazards to operations from land uses (height obstructions, etc.). Each of these
concerns is addressed in conjunction with mission requirements and safe aircraft operation to determine the optimum flight
track for each aircraft type. The flight tracks depicted in Figure 2 are the result of such planning.

                              SECTION 3 LAND USE COMPATIBILITY GUIDELINES

3.1 Introduction

The Department of Defense (DoD) developed the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program for military
airfields. Using this program, DoD works to protect aircraft operational capabilities at its installations and to assist local
government officials in protecting and promoting the public health, safety, and quality of life. The goal is to promote
compatible land use development around military airfields by providing information on aircraft noise exposure and accident
potential.

AICUZ reports describe three basic types of constraints that affect, or result, from flight operations. The first constraint
involves areas which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and DoD have identified for height limitations (see Height
and Obstruction Criteria in Appendix D of Volume II). Air Force obstruction criteria are based upon those contained in
Federal Aviation Regulation Part 77, Subpart C.

The second constraint involves noise zones produced by the computerized Day-Night Average A-Weighted Sound Level
(DNL) metric and the DoD NOISEMAP methodology. Using the NOISEMAP program, which is similar to FAA’s
Integrated Noise Model, DoD produces noise contours showing the noise levels generated by current aircraft operations.
The AICUZ report contains noise contours plotted in increments of 5 dB, ranging from DNL 65 dB to 80+ dB. Figure 3
shows current DNL noise contours based on current operations. Additional information on noise methodology is contained
in Appendix C of Volume II of this report.

The third constraint involves accident potential zones based on statistical analysis of past DoD aircraft accidents. DoD
analysis has determined that the areas immediately beyond the ends of runways and along the approach and departure flight
paths have significant potential for aircraft accidents. Based on this analysis, DoD developed three zones that have high
relative potential for accidents. The clear zone, the area closest to the runway end, is the most hazardous. The overall risk
is so high that DoD generally acquires the land through purchase or easement to prevent development. Accident potential
zone I (APZ I) is an area beyond the clear zone that possesses a significant potential for accidents. Accident potential zone
II (APZ II) is an area beyond APZ I having lesser, but still significant potential for accidents. While aircraft accident
potential in APZs I and II does not warrant acquisition by the Air Force, land use planning and controls are strongly
encouraged in these areas for the protection of the public. [NAME] AFB clear zones encompass areas 3,000 feet wide by
3,000 feet long. APZ I is 3,000 feet wide by 5,000 feet long, and APZ II is 3,000 feet wide by 7,000 feet long (Figure 3).
Clear zones and accident potential zones are established for each runway. These zones overlap at [NAME] AFB as a result
of the two parallel runways. Additional information on accident potential is contained in Appendix B of Volume II of this
report.

3.2 Land Use Compatibility

Each AICUZ report contains land use guidelines. Figure 4 lists land uses versus all possible combinations of noise exposure
and accident potential at [NAME] AFB, showing land uses that are compatible or incompatible. Noise guidelines are
essentially the same as those published by the Federal Interagency Committee on Urban Noise in the June 1980 publication,
Guidelines for Considering Noise in Land Use Planning and Control. The U.S. Department of Transportation publication,
Standard Land Use Coding Manual (SLUCM), has been used for identifying and coding land use activities.

3.3 Participation In The Planning Process

As local communities prepare their land use plans, the Air Force must be ready to provide additional inputs. The Base Civil
Engineer has been designated as the official liaison with the local community on all planning matters. This office is
prepared to participate in the continuing discussion of zoning and other land use matters as they may affect, or may be
affected by, [NAME] AFB.

                                                    NOTES

1.  Suggested maximum density of 1-2 dwelling units per acre, possibly increased under a Planned Unit Development
         (PUD) where maximum lot coverage is less than 20 percent.
2. Within each land use category, uses exist where further deliberating by local authorities may be needed due to the
         variation of densities in people and structures. Shopping malls and shopping centers are considered
         incompatible use in any accident potential zone (CZ, APZ I, or APZ II).
3. The placing of structures, buildings, or above-ground utility lines in the clear zone is subject to severe restrictions.
         In a majority of the clear zones, these items are prohibited. See AFI 32-7060 (formerly AFR 19-9) and AFJM
         32-8008 (formerly AFM 86-14) for specific guidance.
4. No passenger terminals and no major above-ground transmission lines in APZ I.
5. Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution.
6. Low-intensity office uses only. Meeting places, auditoriums, etc., are not recommended.
7. Excludes chapels.
8. Facilities must be low intensity.
9. Clubhouse not recommended.
10. Areas for gatherings of people are not recommended.
11.
         A. Although local conditions may require residential use, it is discouraged in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB and
                  strongly discouraged in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB. The absence of viable alternative development
                  options should be determined and an evaluation indicating a demonstrated community need for
                  residential use would not be met if development were prohibited in these zones should be conducted
                  prior to approvals.
         B. Where the community determines the residential uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to
                  indoor Noise Level Reduction (NLR) for DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB and DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB should be
                  incorporated into building codes and considered in individual approvals
         C. NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning,
                  and design and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor exposure, particularly from near
                  ground level sources. Measures that reduce outdoor noise should be used whenever practical in
                  preference to measures which only protect interior spaces.
12. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range must be incorporated
         into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
         sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
13. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range must be incorporated
         into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
         sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
14. Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 75-79 dB range must be incorporated
         into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise
         sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
15. If noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, the use is compatible.
16. No buildings.
17. Land use is compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.
18. Residential buildings require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range.
19. Residential buildings require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range.
20. Residential buildings are not permitted.
21. Land use is not recommended. If the community decides the use is necessary, hearing protection devices should be
         worn by personnel.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

                                            SECTION 4 LAND USE ANALYSIS

4.1 Introduction

Land use planning and control is a dynamic, rather than a "static" process. The specific characteristics of land use
determinants will always reflect, to some degree, the changing conditions of the economic, social, and physical
environment of a community, as well as changing public concern. The planning process accommodates this fluidity in
that decisions are normally not based on boundary lines, but rather on more generalized area designations.

[NAME] AFB was originally developed in a relatively undeveloped area in [County], [State].                In recent years,
however, intensive development has increased to the [directions] of the base.

Computer technology has enabled [NAME] AFB to more precisely display its flight tracks and noise contours for land
use planning purposes. This same technology has revealed the extent of [NAME] AFB’s region of impact extends into
the cities of [cities that are impacted].

For the purposes of this study, existing land uses have been classified into one of the following six categories:

      Residential: This category includes all types of residential activity, such as single and multi-family residences and
      mobile homes, at a density greater than one dwelling unit per acre.
      Commercial: This category includes offices, retail, restaurants and other types of commercial establishments.
      Industrial: This category includes manufacturing, warehousing, and other similar uses.
      Public/Quasi-Public: This category includes publicly owned lands and/or lands to which the public has access,
      including military reservations and training grounds, public buildings, schools, churches, cemeteries, and hospitals.
      Recreational: This category includes land areas designated for recreational activity, including parks, wilderness areas
      and reservations, conservation areas, and areas designated for trails, hikes, camping, etc.
      Open/Agriculture/Low Density: This category includes undeveloped land areas, agricultural areas, grazing lands and
      areas with residential activity at densities less than or equal to one dwelling unit per acre..

4.2       Existing Land Use

Existing land uses in the vicinity of [NAME] AFB are shown in Figure 5. The compatibility of existing land use in
each of the surrounding communities is discussed in detail in the following subsections.

4.5.3    Planning Considerations

AICUZ noise contours describe the noise characteristics of a specific operational environment, and as such, will change
if a significant operational change is made. Should a new mission be established at [NAME] AFB, adding a larger
number of airplanes or additional model types, the AICUZ could be amended.

With these thoughts in mind, [NAME] AFB has revised the [Year of last AICUZ] AICUZ Study and has provided
flight track, accident potential zone, and noise contour information in this report that reflects the most current and
accurate picture of aircraft activities.

                                         SECTION 5 IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the AICUZ Study must be a joint effort between the Air Force and the adjacent communities.
The Air Force’s role is to minimize the impact on the local communities by [NAME] AFB operations. The role of the
communities is to ensure that development in the environs is compatible with accepted planning and development
principles and practices.

5.1 Air Force Responsibilities

In general, the Air Force perceives its AICUZ responsibilities as encompassing the areas of flying safety, noise
abatement, and participation in the land use planning process.

Well maintained aircraft and well trained aircrews do much to assure that aircraft accidents are avoided. Despite the
best training of aircrews and maintenance of aircraft, however, history makes it clear that accidents do occur. It is
imperative that flights be routed over sparsely populated areas as much as possible to reduce the exposure of lives and
property to a potential accident.

By Air Force regulation, commanders are required to periodically review existing traffic patterns, instrument
approaches, weather minima, and operating practices, and evaluate these factors in relationship to populated areas and
other local situations. This requirement is a direct result and expression of Air Force policy that all AICUZ plans must
include an analysis of flying and flying related activities designed to reduce and control the effects of such operations
on surrounding land areas. Noise is generated from aircraft both in the air and on the ground. In an effort to reduce
the noise effects of [NAME] AFB operations on surrounding communities, the base restricts nighttime flying activities
and has routed flight tracks to avoid populated areas. Practice takeoffs/landings and instrument approaches are
conducted at times when individuals are normally awake. These activities are not scheduled between 10:00 P.M. and
7:00 A.M. During this time, only mission essential aircraft arrivals and departures are conducted. Whenever possible,
traffic patterns are all located away from the population centers, both on and off-base. Base maintenance run-up
activities are not performed between 10:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M., except for high priority mission requirements.

The preparation and presentation of this [NAME] AFB AICUZ Study is one phase of the continuing Air Force
participation in the local planning process. It is recognized that as the local community updates its land use plans, the
Air Force must be ready to provide additional inputs.

It is also recognized that the AICUZ program will be an ongoing activity even after compatible development plans are
adopted and implemented. Base personnel are prepared to participate in the continuing discussion of zoning and other
land use matters as they may affect, or may be affected by [NAME] AFB. Base personnel will also be available to
provide information, criteria and guidelines to state, regional and local planning bodies, civic associations, and similar
groups.

5.2 Local Community Responsibilities

Area residents and the personnel at [NAME] AFB have a long history of working together for mutual benefit. We feel
that adoption of the following recommendations will strengthen this relationship, increase the health and safety of the
public, and help protect the integrity of the base’s flying mission:

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

     Incorporate AICUZ policies and guidelines into the comprehensive plans of [List the cities, towns and counties]. Use
     overlay maps of the AICUZ noise contours and Air Force Land Use Compatibility Guidelines to evaluate existing and
     future land use proposals.

     Modify existing zoning ordinances and subdivision regulations to support the compatible land uses outlined in this
     study.

     Implement height and obstruction ordinances which reflect current Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration
     (FAA) Part 77 requirements.

     Modify building codes to ensure that new construction within the AICUZ area has the recommended noise level
     reductions incorporated into its design and construction.

     Continue to inform [NAME] AFB of planning and zoning actions that have the potential of affecting base operations.
     Develop a working group representing city planners, county planners, and base planners to meet at least quarterly to
     discuss AICUZ concerns and major development proposals that could affect airfield operations.

                       THE AICUZ CONCEPT, PROGRAM, METHODOLOGY, AND POLICIES


A.1       Concept

Federal legislation, national sentiment, and other external forces which directly affect the United States Air Force mission
have served to greatly increase the Air Force’s role in environmental and planning issues. Problems of airfield
encroachment from incompatible land uses surrounding installations, as well as air and water pollution and socio-economic
impact, require continued and intensified USAF involvement. The nature of these problems dictates direct USAF
participation in comprehensive community and land use planning. Effective, coordinated planning that bridges the gap
between the federal government and the community requires the establishment of good working relationships with local
citizens, local planning officials, and state and federal officials. This planning depends upon creating an atmosphere of
mutual trust and helpfulness. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) concept has been developed in an effort
to:

      Protect local citizens from the noise exposure and accident potential associated with flying activities.
      Prevent degradation of the Air Force’s capability to achieve its mission by promoting compatible land use planning.

The land use guidelines developed herein are a composite of a number of other land use compatibility studies that have been
refined to fit the [NAME] AFB aviation environment.

A.2       Program

Base Commanders establish and maintain active programs to achieve the maximum feasible land use compatibility between
air installations and neighboring communities. The program requires that all appropriate governmental bodies and citizens
be fully informed whenever AICUZ or other planning matters affecting the installation are under consideration. This
includes positive and continuous programs designed to:

      Provide information, criteria, and guidelines to federal, state, regional, and local planning bodies, civic associations, and
      similar groups.
      Inform such groups of the requirements of the flying activity, noise exposure, aircraft accident potential, and AICUZ plans.
      Describe the noise reduction measures that are being used.
      Ensure that all reasonable, economical, and practical measures are taken to reduce or control the impact of noise-producing
      activities. These measures include such considerations as proper location of engine test facilities, provision for sound
      suppressers where necessary, and adjustment of flight patterns and/or techniques to minimize the noise impact on populated
      areas. This must be done without jeopardizing safety or operational effectiveness.

A.3       Methodology

The AICUZ consists of land areas upon which certain land uses may obstruct the airspace or otherwise be hazardous to
aircraft operations; and land areas which are exposed to the health, safety, or welfare hazards of aircraft operations. The
AICUZ includes:

NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

      Accident potential zones (APZs) and clear zones (CZ) based on past Air Force aircraft accidents and installation
      operational data (Appendix B).
      Noise zones (NZs) produced by the computerized Day-Night Average A-Weighted Sound Level (DNL) metric
      (Appendix C).
      The area designated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force for purposes of height limitations in the
      approach and departure zones of the base (Appendix D).

The APZs, CZ, and NZs are the basic building blocks for land use planning with AICUZ data. Compatible land uses are
specified for these zones, and recommendations on building materials and standards to reduce interior noise levels inside
structures are provided in Appendix E.

As part of the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone program, the only real property acquisition for which the USAF has
received congressional authorization and the base and Major Commands request appropriation are the areas designated as
the clear zone (CZ). Real property interests are acquired by fee or easement giving the base control over the use of the
property. Fee land so acquired may be leased out for agricultural or grazing purposes. [NAME] AFB has acquired land use
control within its clear zones through easements. Compatible land use controls for the remaining airfield environs should
be accomplished through the community land use planning processes.

A.4       AICUZ Land Use Development Policies

The basis for any effective land use control system is the development of, and subsequent adherence to, policies which serve
as the standard by which all land use planning and control actions are evaluated. [NAME] AFB recommends the following
policies be considered for incorporation into the comprehensive plans of agencies in the vicinity of the base environs:

A4.1    Policy 1. In order to promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of
the inhabitants of airfield environs, it is necessary to:

      Guide, control, and regulate future growth and development.

      Promote orderly and appropriate use of land.

      Protect the character and stability of existing land uses.

      Prevent the destruction or impairment of the airfield and the public investment therein.

      Enhance the quality of living in the areas affected.

      Protect the general economic welfare by restricting incompatible land use.

A.4.2     Policy 2. In furtherance of Policy 1, it is appropriate to:

      Establish guidelines of land use compatibility.
      Restrict or prohibit incompatible land use.
      Prevent establishment of any land use which would unreasonably endanger aircraft operations and the continued use of the
      airfield.
      Incorporate the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone concept into community land use plans, modifying them when
      necessary.

      Adopt appropriate ordinances to implement airfield environs land use plans.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

A.4.3 Policy 3. Within the boundaries of the Clear Zone (CZ), certain land uses are inherently incompatible. The
following land uses are not in the public interest and must be restricted or prohibited:

    Uses that release into the air any substance, such as steam, dust, or smoke, which would impair visibility or otherwise
    interfere with the operation of aircraft.
    Uses that produce light emissions, either direct or indirect (reflective), which would interfere with pilot vision.
    Uses that produce electrical emissions which would interfere with aircraft communication systems or navigation
    equipment.
    Uses that attract birds or waterfowl, such as operation of sanitary landfills, maintenance or feeding stations, or growth
    of certain vegetation.
    Uses that provide for structures within ten feet of aircraft approach-departure and/or transitional surfaces.

A.4.4 Policy 4. Certain noise levels of varying duration and frequency create hazards to both physical and mental
health. A limited, though definite, danger to life exists in certain areas adjacent to airfields. Where these conditions
are sufficiently severe, it is not consistent with public health, safety, and welfare to allow the following land uses:

    Residential.
    Retail business.
    Office buildings.
    Public buildings (schools, churches, etc.).
    Recreation buildings and structures.

A.4.5 Policy 5. Land areas below takeoff and final approach flight paths are exposed to significant danger of
aircraft accidents. The density of development and intensity of use must be limited in such areas.

A.4.6 Policy 6. Different land uses have different sensitivities to noise. Standards of land use acceptability should
be adopted, based on these noise sensitivities. In addition, a system of Noise Level Reduction guidelines (Appendix E)
for new construction should be implemented to permit certain uses where they would otherwise be prohibited.

A.4.7 Policy 7. Land use planning and zoning in the airfield environs cannot be based solely on aircraft-generated
effects. Allocation of land used within the AICUZ should be further refined by consideration of:

    Physiographic factors.
    Climate and hydrology.
    Vegetation.
    Surface geology.
    Soil characteristics.
    Intrinsic land use potential and constraints.
    Existing land use.
    Land ownership patterns and values.
    Economic and social demands.
    Cost and availability of public utilities, transportation, and community facilities.
    Other noise sources.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

Each runway end at [NAME] AFB has a 3,000 foot by 3,000 foot clear zone and two accident potential zones (Appendix
B). Accident potential on or adjacent to the runway or within the clear zone is so high that the necessary land use
restrictions would prohibit reasonable economic use of land. As stated previously, it is Air Force policy to request Congress
to authorize and appropriate funds for the necessary real property interests in this area to prevent incompatible land uses.
Clear zone easements have been acquired for each runway at [NAME] AFB which effectively restrict incompatible land
uses.

Accident potential zone I is less critical than the clear zone, but still possesses a significant risk factor. This 3,000 foot by
5,000 foot area has land use compatibility guidelines which are sufficiently flexible to allow reasonable economic use of the
land, such as industrial/manufacturing, transportation, communication/utilities, wholesale trade, open space, recreation, and
agriculture. However, uses that concentrate people in small areas are not acceptable.

Accident potential zone II is less critical than accident potential zone I, but still possesses potential for accidents. Accident
potential zone II, also 3,000 feet wide, is 7,000 feet long extending to 15,000 feet from the runway threshold. Acceptable
uses include those of accident potential zone I, as well as low density single family residential, and those personal and
business services and commercial/retail trade uses of low intensity or scale of operation. High density functions such as
multi-story buildings, places of assembly (theaters, churches, schools, restaurants, etc.), and high density office uses are not
considered appropriate.

High people densities should be limited to the maximum extent possible. The optimum density recommended for
residential usage (where it does not conflict with noise criteria) in accident potential zone II is one dwelling per acre. For
most non-residential usage, buildings should be limited to one story and the lot coverage should not exceed 20 percent.

A.5       Basic Land Use Compatibility

Research on aircraft accident potential, noise, and land use compatibility is ongoing at a number of federal and other
agencies. These studies and all other compatibility guidelines must not be considered inflexible standards. They are the
framework within which land use compatibility questions can be addressed and resolved. In each case, full consideration
must be given to local conditions such as:

      Previous community experience with aircraft accidents and noise.
      Local building construction and development practices.
      Existing noise environment due to other urban or transportation noise sources.
      Time period of aircraft operations and land use activities.
      Specific site analysis.
      Noise buffers, including topography.

These basic guidelines cannot resolve all land use compatibility questions, but they do offer a reasonable framework within
which to work.

[NAME] AFB,[STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

A.6       Accident Potential

Land use guidelines for the two APZs are based on a hazard index system which compares the relationship of accident
occurrence for five areas:

      On or adjacent to the runway.
      Within the clear zone.
      In APZ I.
      In APZ II.
      In all other areas within a 10 nautical mile radius of the runway.

Accident potential on or adjacent to the runway or within the clear zone is so high that few uses are acceptable. The risk
outside APZ I and APZ II, but within the 10 nautical mile radius area, is significant, but is acceptable if sound engineering
and planning practices are followed.

Land use guidelines for APZs I and II have been developed. The main objective has been to restrict all people-intensive
uses because there is greater risk in these areas. The basic guidelines aim at prevention of uses that:

      Have high residential density characteristics.
      Have high labor intensity.
      Involve above-ground explosive, fire, toxic, corrosive, or other hazardous characteristics.
      Promote population concentrations.
      Involve utilities and services required for area-wide population, where disruption would have an adverse impact
      (telephone, gas, etc.).
      Concentrate people who are unable to respond to emergency situations, such as children, elderly, handicapped, etc.
      Pose hazards to aircraft operations.

There is no question that these guidelines are relative. Ideally, there should be no people-intensive uses in either of these
APZs. The free market and private property systems prevent this where there is land development demand. To go beyond
these guidelines, however, substantially increases risk by placing more people in areas where there may ultimately be an
aircraft accident.

A.7       Noise

Nearly all studies on residential aircraft noise compatibility recommend no residential uses in noise zones above DNL 75
dB. Usually, no restrictions are recommended below noise zone DNL 65 dB. Between DNL 65-75 dB there is currently no
consensus. These areas may not qualify for Federal mortgage insurance in residential categories according to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Regulation 24 CFR 51B. In many cases, HUD approval requires
noise attenuation measures, the Regional Administrator’s concurrence, and an Environmental Impact Statement. The
Department of Veterans Affairs also has airfield noise and accident restrictions which apply to their home loan guarantee
program. Whenever possible, residential land use should be located below DNL 65 dB according to Air Force land use
recommendations.

Most industrial/manufacturing uses are compatible in the airfield environs. Exceptions are uses such as research or
scientific activities which require lower noise levels. Noise attenuation measures are recommended for portions of buildings
devoted to office use, receiving the public, or where the normal background noise level is low.

[NAME] AFB,[STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

The transportation, communications and utilities categories have a high noise level compatibility because they generally are
not people-intensive. When people use land for these purposes, the use is generally very short in duration. Where buildings
are required for these uses, additional evaluation is warranted.

The commercial/retail trade, and personal and business services categories are compatible without restriction up to DNL 70
dB; however, they are generally incompatible above DNL 80 dB. Between DNLs 70-80 dB, noise level reduction measures
should be included in the design and construction of buildings.

The nature of most uses in the public and quasi-public services category requires a quieter environment, and attempts
should be made to locate these uses below DNL 65 dB (an Air Force land use recommendation), or else provide adequate
noise level reduction.

Although recreational use has often been recommended as compatible with high noise levels, recent research has resulted in
a more conservative view. Above DNL 75 dB, noise becomes a factor which limits the ability to enjoy such uses. Where
the requirement to hear is a function of the use (i.e., music shell, etc.), compatibility is limited. Buildings associated with
golf courses and similar uses should be noise attenuated.

With the exception of forestry activities and livestock farming, uses in the resources production, extraction, and open space
category are compatible almost without restrictions.

                                            ACCIDENT POTENTIAL ZONES

B.1      Guidelines For Accident Potential

Urban areas around airports are exposed to the possibility of aircraft accidents even with well-maintained aircraft and
highly trained aircraft crews. Despite stringent maintenance requirements and countless hours of training, past history
makes it clear that accidents are going to occur.

When the AICUZ program began, there were no current comprehensive studies on accident potential. In support of the
program, the Air Force completed a study of Air Force accidents that occurred between 1968 and 1972 within 10 nautical
miles of airfields. The study of 369 accidents revealed that 75 percent of aircraft accidents occurred on or adjacent to the
runway (1,000 feet to each side of the runway centerline) and in a corridor 3,000 feet (1,500 feet either side of the runway
centerline) wide, extending from the runway threshold along the extended runway centerline for a distance of 15,000 feet.

Three zones were established based on crash patterns: The clear zone, accident potential zone (APZ) I, and accident
potential zone (APZ) II. The clear zone starts at the end of the runway and extends outward 3,000 feet. It has the highest
accident potential of the three zones. The Air Force has adopted a policy of acquiring property rights to areas designated as
clear zones because of the high accident potential. APZ I extends from the clear zone an additional 5,000 feet. It includes
an area of reduced accident potential. APZ II extends from APZ I an additional 7,000 feet in an area of further reduced
accident potential.

The Air Force research work in accident potential was the first significant effort in this subject area since 1952 when the
President’s Airport Commission published "The Airport and Its Neighbors," better known as the "Doolittle Report." The
recommendations of this earlier report were influential in the formulation of the accident potential zone concept.

The risk to people on the ground of being killed or injured by aircraft accidents is small. However, an aircraft accident is a
high consequence event and when a crash does occur, the result is often catastrophic. Because of this, the Air Force does
not attempt to base its safety standards on accident probabilities. Instead the Air Force approaches this safety issue from a
land use planning perspective.

B.2      Accident Potential Analysis

Military aircraft accidents differ from commercial air carrier and general aviation accidents because of the variety of aircraft
used, the type of missions, and the number of training flights. In 1973, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) performed a aircraft
accident hazard study in order to identify land near airfields with significant accident potential. Accidents studied occurred
within ten nautical miles of airfields.

The study reviewed 369 major USAF accidents during 1968-1972, and found that 61 percent of the accidents were related to
landing operations and 39 percent were takeoff related. It also found that 70 percent occurred in daylight, and that fighter
and training aircraft accounted for 80 percent of the accidents.

Because the purpose of the study was to identify accident hazards, the study plotted each of the 369 accidents in relation to
the airfield. This plotting found that the accidents clustered along the runway and its extended centerline. To further refine
this clustering, a tabulation was prepared which described the cumulative frequency of accidents as a function of distance
from the runway centerline along the extended centerline. This analysis was done for widths of 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000
total feet. The location analysis found the following:

Figure B-1 indicates that the cumulative number of accidents rises rapidly from the end of the runway to 3,000 feet, rises
more gradually to 8,000 feet, then continues at about the same rate of increase to 15,000 feet, where it levels off rapidly.
The location analysis also indicates that the optimum width of the runway extension, which would include the maximum
percentage of accidents in the smallest area, is 3,000 feet.

Using the designated zones and accident data, it is possible to calculate a ratio of percentage of accidents to percentage of
area size. These ratios indicate that the clear zone, with the smallest area size and the highest number of accidents, has the
highest ratio, followed by the runway and adjacent area, APZ I and then APZ II.

         3. Percent total accidents divided by percent total area.
         4. Runway dimension are 2000’ X 10,600’.

B.3       Definable Debris Impact Areas

The Air Force also determined which accidents had definable debris impact areas, and in what phase of flight the accident
occurred. Overall, 75 percent of the accidents had definable debris impact areas, although they varied in size by type of
accident. The Air Force used weighted averages of impact areas, for accidents occurring only in the approach and departure
phase, to determine the following average impact areas:

          Average Impact Areas for Approach and Departure Accidents
          Overall Average Impact Area                 5.06 acres
          Fighter, Trainer and Misc. Aircraft         2.73 acres
          Heavy Bomber and Tanker Aircraft            8.73 acres

B.4       Findings
      Designation of safety zones around the airfield and restriction of incompatible land uses can reduce the public's
      exposure to safety hazards.

      Air Force accident studies have found that aircraft accidents near Air Force installations occurred in the following
      patterns:
          61% were related to landing operations.
          39% were related to takeoff operations.
          70% occurred in daylight.
          80% were related to fighter and training aircraft operations.
       25% occurred on the runway or within an area extending 1,000 feet out from each side of the runway.

       27% occurred in an area extending from the end of the runway to 3,000 feet along the extended centerline and
       3,000 feet wide, centered on the extended centerline.
        15% occurred in an area between 3,000 and 15,000 feet along the extended runway centerline and 3,000 feet wide,
        centered on the extended centerline.
   U.S. Air Force aircraft accident statistics found that 75% of aircraft accidents resulted in definable impact areas. The
   size of the impact areas were:
       5.1 acres overall average.

                                  DESCRIPTION OF THE NOISE ENVIRONMENT


C.1     Noise Environment Descriptor

The noise contour methodology used herein is the Day-Night Average A-Weighted Sound Level (DNL) metric of describing
the noise environment. Efforts to provide a national uniform standard for noise assessment have resulted in adoption by the
Environmental Protection Agency of DNL as the standard noise descriptor. The Air Force uses the DNL descriptor in
assessing the amount of aircraft noise exposure, and as a metric for community response to the various levels of exposure.
The DNL values used for planning purposes are 65, 70, 75, and 80 dB. Land use guidelines are based on the compatibility
of various land uses with these noise exposure levels.

It is generally recognized that a noise environment descriptor should consider, in addition to the annoyance of a single
event, the effect of repetition of such events and the time of day in which these events occur. DNL begins with a single
event descriptor and adds corrections for the number of events and the time of day. Since the primary development concern
is residential, nighttime events are considered more annoying than daytime events and are weighted accordingly. DNL
values are computed from the single event noise descriptor, plus corrections for number of flights and time of day (Figure
C-1).

                   Figure C-1 DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE A WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL (ONLY)


                                         NUMBER OF

       SINGLE EVENT                                                          DNL
           NOISE

                                         TIME OF DAY




As part of the extensive data collection process, detailed information is gathered on the type of aircraft, the number, and
time of day of flying operations for each flight track during a typical day. This information is used in conjunction with the
single event noise descriptor to produce DNL values. These values are combined on an energy summation basis to provide
single DNL values for the mix of aircraft operations at the base. Equal value points are connected to form the contour lines.

C.3     Noise Event Descriptor

The single event noise descriptor used in the DNL system is the Sound Exposure Level (SEL). The SEL measure is an
integration of an "A" weighted noise level over the period of a single event such as an aircraft flyover, in dB.

Frequency, magnitude, and duration vary according to aircraft type, engine type, and power setting. Therefore, individual
aircraft noise data are collected for various types of aircraft/engines at different power settings and phases of flight. The
following diagram shows the relationship of the single event noise descriptor (SEL) to the source sound energy.

                           VALUES                                                          VALUES

                                                         VARIATIONS




SEL vs. slant range values are derived from noise measurements made according to a source noise data acquisition plan
developed by Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc., in conjunction with the Air Force’s Armstrong Laboratory (AL) and carried
out by AL. These standard day, sea level values form the basis for the individual event noise descriptors at any location and
are adjusted to the location by applying appropriate corrections for temperature, humidity, and variations from standard
profiles and power settings.

Ground-to-ground sound propagation characteristics are used for altitudes up to 500 feet absolute with linear transition
between 500 and 700 feet and air-to-ground propagation characteristics above 700 feet.

In addition to the assessment of aircraft flight operations, the DNL system also incorporates noise resulting from
engine/aircraft maintenance checks on the ground. Data concerning the orientation of the noise source, type of aircraft or
engine, number of test runs on a typical day, power settings used and their duration, and use of suppression devices are
collected for each ground run up or test position. This information is processed and the noise contribution added (on an
energy summation basis) to the noise generated by flying operations to produce noise contours reflecting the overall noise
environment with respect to aircraft air and ground operations.

C.4       Noise Contour Production

Data describing flight track distances and turns, altitudes, airspeeds, power settings, flight track operational utilization,
maintenance locations, ground run-up engine power settings, and number and duration of runs by type of aircraft/engine is
assembled by each individual AFB. The data is screened by the MAJCOM and HQ AFCEE/ECC. Trained personnel
process the data for input into a central computer. Flight track maps are generated for verification and approval by the
base/MAJCOM. After any required changes have been incorporated, DNL contours are generated by the computer using
the supplied data and standard source noise data corrected to local weather conditions. These contours are plotted and
prepared for photographic reproduction. A set of these contours is provided in the body of the report.

                                       HEIGHT AND OBSTRUCTIONS CRITERIA

D.1       Height And Obstructions Criteria

D.1.1 General
This appendix establishes criteria for determining whether an object or structure is an obstruction to air navigation.
Obstructions to air navigation are considered to be:

      Natural objects or man-made structures that protrude above the planes or surfaces as defined in the following
      paragraphs, and/or;

      Man-made objects that extend more than 500 feet above the ground at the site of the structure.

D.1.2     Explanation of Terms

The following will apply (See Figure D-1):
      Controlling Elevation. Whenever surfaces or planes within the obstructions criteria overlap, the controlling (or
      governing) elevation becomes that of the lowest surface or plane.
      Runway Length. [NAME] AFB has two runways, and [Length of runway] feet of pavement designed and built for
      sustained aircraft landings and takeoffs.
      Established Airfield Elevation. The elevation, in feet above mean sea level for [NAME] AFB is [Elevation of the
      Airfield] feet.
      Dimensions. All dimensions are measured horizontally unless otherwise noted.

D.1.3     Planes and Surfaces.

Definitions are as follows:

      Primary Surface. This surface defines the limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the immediate vicinity of
      the landing area. The primary surface comprises surfaces of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones
      and extends 200 feet beyond the runway end. The width of the primary surface for a single class "B" runway is 2,000
      feet, or 1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline.

      Clear Zone Surface. This surface defines the limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the vicinity contiguous
      to the end of the primary surface. The length and width (for a single runway) of a clear zone surface at [NAME] AFB
      is 3,000 feet by 3,000 feet.

      Approach-Departure Clearance Surface. This surface is symmetrical about the runway centerline extended, begins as
      an inclined plane (glide angle) 200 feet beyond each end of the primary surface of the centerline elevation of the
      runway end, and extends for 50,000 feet. The slope of the approach-departure clearance surface is 50:1 along the
      extended runway (glide angle) centerline until it reaches an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield
      elevation. It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point 50,000 feet from the start of the glide angle. The
      width of this surface at the runway end is 2,000 feet; it flares uniformly, and the width at 50,000 feet is 16,000 feet.

106                                                                                             AFH 32-7084 1 MARCH 1999

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

      Inner Horizontal Surface. This surface is a plane, oval in shape at a height of 150 feet above the established airfield
      elevation. It is constructed by scribing an arc with a radius of 7,500 feet above the centerline at the end of the runway
      and interconnecting these arcs with tangents.

      Conical Surface. This is an inclined surface extending outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner
      horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 7,000 feet to a height of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.
      The slope of the conical surface is 20:1.

      Outer Horizontal Surface. This surface is a plane located 500 feet above the established airfield elevation. It extends
      for a horizontal distance of 30,000 feet from the outer periphery of the conical surface.

      Transitional Surfaces. These surfaces connect the primary surfaces, clear zone surfaces, and approach-departure
      clearance surfaces to the outer horizontal surface, conical surface, other horizontal surface, or other transitional
      surfaces. The slope of the transitional surface is 7:1 outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline. To
      determine the elevation for the beginning the transitional surface slope at any point along the lateral boundary of the
      primary surface, including the clear zone, draw a line from this point to the runway centerline. This line will be at
      right angles to the runway axis. The elevation at the runway centerline is the elevation for the beginning of the 7:1
      slope.

The land areas outlined by these criteria should be regulated to prevent uses which might otherwise be hazardous to aircraft
operations. The following uses should be restricted and/or prohibited.

      Uses which release into the air any substance which would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with the operation of
      aircraft (i.e. steam, dust, or smoke).

      Uses which produce light emissions, either direct or indirect (reflective), which would interfere with pilot vision.

      Uses which produce electrical emissions which would interfere with aircraft communications systems or navigational
      equipment.

      Uses which would attract birds or waterfowl, including but not limited to, operation of sanitary landfills, maintenance
      of feeding stations, or the growing of certain vegetation.

      Uses that provide for structures within ten feet of aircraft approach-departure and/or transitional surfaces.

D.2       Height Restrictions

City/County agencies involved with approvals of permits for construction should require developers to submit calculations
which show that projects meet the height restriction criteria of FAA Part 77 as described, in part, by the information
contained in this Appendix.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

                                              SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION


Considerable effort has been expended by HQ USAF, [PARENT COMMAND], and [NAME] AFB in developing
compatible land use guidelines for the land surrounding the base. An effective procedure for public release of the
information contained within the AICUZ Study is essential for encouraging local governments to use that information in
their planning efforts.

[NAME] AFB is responsible for informing local citizens of the need for taking positive action to prevent incompatible land
uses around the base. It is important to involve local officials and private citizens from all adjacent communities in the
AICUZ program. Participants in this effort should be aware that the AICUZ program is designed to protect the health and
safety of community residents, as well as to protect the airfield from encroachment.

Within the past few years some local governmental jurisdictions have restricted construction along flood plains, on steep
slopes, in potential earthquake hazard areas, and in areas with high water tables. In terms of safety and health, airfield
operations should be of equal concern to local planning agencies and should be included as a factor in land use planning.
The regulation of land use has traditionally been exercised by the state through delegation to local governments. Action
needs to be taken now to advise local governments that corrective measures are essential to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of the public from aircraft noise and accident hazards, and, in turn, to protect the military installation from the
adverse impacts of random urbanization of nearby lands.


                                           SECTION 2 CONCEPTS/ACTIONS


This AICUZ Public Release and Implementation Plan is designed to assist the base in its efforts to acquaint local
communities and their officials with the [NAME] AICUZ program. In addition, a well executed public release process will
give the base community planner a strong foundation for follow-on efforts.

The first step in providing AICUZ information is to initiate informal discussions with key officials and planning staffs of
the affected governmental units. These meetings are used to set forth the basic principles of the AICUZ program, i.e., that
it is a planning tool, that the program is based upon cooperative effort between the Air Force and local communities, and
that the role of the Air Force is to provide information for use in land use planning within the vicinity of [NAME] AFB. (It
is important to stress that it is not the intent of the AICUZ program to preempt the land use control prerogative of local
governments.) This initial step is accomplished through an AICUZ concept briefing which will be prepared by
representatives from Civil Engineer and Public Affairs. The informal briefing will be conducted by representatives from
Civil Engineer, Public Affairs, or the Command Section. The briefing should contain examples of AICUZ programs at
other bases and an update on the existing AICUZ study at [NAME] AFB. The date, setting, attendees, and procedures for
the public release of the study should also be discussed and established at this time.

Specific AICUZ data, including noise contour maps for [NAME], should NOT be made available to anyone outside the Air
Force prior to full public release. It is imperative that there is no possibility for any group to be given a special advantage
by receiving prior knowledge. Prior to public release, the AICUZ study is considered an internal working paper and under
the provisions of AFI 37-131, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

Prior to the actual public release, base personnel designated to attend the public release should conduct a thorough review of
the impacts the AICUZ program could have on local communities and landowners. These individuals, in their review,
should answer the following questions:

      What is the existing land use?
      What is the future planned land use?
      What factors determine future land use?
      What are alternatives for future land use?
      Who decides what future land uses are?
      Which property owners are involved?

This review should also include possible effects upon municipalities, counties, regional councils, water districts, utility
companies, highway/transportation planning agencies, etc. A determination should also be made concerning to what extent
the recommended AICUZ criteria is in agreement with current local land use planning and zoning ordinances. This
"brainstorming" will assist in answering questions which may be asked during the public release process.

The basic forum for full release of the AICUZ study is a public presentation meeting. Attendees should include appropriate
governmental officials, the general public, and the media. This meeting will also be the occasion for the first distribution of
the actual AICUZ study. The official release at this time will ensure that no one is excluded from the process, and that no
one single interested or impacted group is provided with information prior to others. A follow-on meeting to respond to
questions, if necessary, should also be arranged.

The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE RCO) will arrange for appropriate federal agency
representation at the initial public meeting. This is accomplished in accordance with AFI 32-7063.

Following the initial public meeting, the AICUZ study is forwarded to local and state clearinghouses as part of the
Executive Order 12372 process.

                                                SECTION 3 ORGANIZATION

The installation commander releases the AICUZ study or update during the public meeting. The briefer selected to explain
the AICUZ process should be thoroughly familiar with the base-specific data gathering and current base area compatible
and incompatible land uses, and the appropriate information contained within the documents. The Base Civil Engineer,
Operations Group Commander, Public Affairs, and Staff Judge Advocate assist the commander by developing and
implementing the public release and by participating at the public meeting. Complete awareness of the recommended
AICUZ criteria is essential because public misinformation or lack of information can be detrimental to objectives desired.
The Public Affairs Office (PAO) is responsible for all public news releases and responses to public inquiries. The PAO
should work with the media to ensure timely notice to the public of the date, location, and purpose of the AICUZ public
meeting.

Remember that presentations on the AICUZ program are given to inform and enlist the cooperation and support of local
political officials, special interest groups, and others. Groups which are formally briefed on the AICUZ study are reflected
in Section 4. A general schedule for presentations of the AICUZ study is included in Section 5. Those presenting the
AICUZ report must be well acquainted with the information contained within the AICUZ study. They should be able to
deal knowledgeably with the questions of laymen and professional alike.

[NAME] AFB, [STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________

The Air Force should state its views and recommendations with respect to what should be done to establish compatible land
use within the vicinity of the airfield, but this is expressed in a low-key manner and without any
pressure brought to bear on local governmental officials. Use of information contained within the AICUZ report is the
responsibility of local officials.


            SECTION 4 INDIVIDUALS/ORGANIZATIONS TO BE GIVEN AICUZ PRESENTATIONS

The Public Affairs Office will ensure that appropriate news releases are made. Many people may be affected by the AICUZ
study and it is important that local governmental leaders and planning bodies be the center of focus rather than the Air
Force. It is also imperative that this information be communicated in a low key manner as being one way of enhancing the
future development of [Relevant Counties].

All AICUZ program briefings are coordinated with the Public Affairs Office. Only speakers who are knowledgeable of the
AICUZ program and its intent, and are adept at public presentations, should be asked to speak.

Dear (See lists, Sect 4)

[NAME] AFB’s Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study has been updated and will be released in a public
meeting at [TIME] on [DATE] 199( ), at [ADDRESS]. The AICUZ study addresses aircraft noise and accident potential
zones created by current flying operations at [NAME] AFB. The study contains information on building height restrictions
and provides data for use in establishing land uses which are compatible with the current flying mission.

AICUZ data is intended for use by local citizens and governmental officials involved in land use planning and facility
development. The purpose of the AICUZ program is to help ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens in the
surrounding communities while preserving the operational capabilities of [NAME] AFB.

The presentation will outline the overall AICUZ program, its methodology, potential uses of the study, and Air Force and
community responsibilities for compatible land use. A question and answer period will follow the formal presentation.

As [Relevant Counties and Cities] continue to grow and prosper, we believe it is important that we join with government
and business leaders in a cooperative effort to implement mutually beneficial planning for the future. I hope you will be
able to attend this very important and informative meeting. In the event you are not able to attend, copies of the AICUZ
Report are available upon request by calling [NAME] Public Affairs Office at [Phone Number].

Sincerely,




                                                    [Commander Signature Block]

[NAME] AFB,[STATE]_______________________________________________________________________________
                          SECTION 8 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES


      Write transmittal letter to local government officials advising that the [DATE of Last AICUZ] AICUZ Report has
      been revised.

      Brief the AICUZ study to local and regional planners, county commissioners, and city council members prior to
      adoption or revision of any local comprehensive plan or before the onset of a Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) if
      applicable.

      Work closely with local and regional community planners. Follow development of comprehensive planning efforts
      within the area, and encourage use of the information provided in the AICUZ in decision-making, wherever possible.

      Add [NAME] AFB to the list of local, regional, state and federal intergovernmental coordination participants and
      continue to keep [NAME] AFB "in the loop". (Use AFCEE RCO, to assist in your IICEP efforts).

      Keep AFCEE RCO in the loop by providing informational copies of correspondence concerning ongoing AICUZ
      activities at [NAME] AFB. Under the IICEP program, AFCEE RCO will coordinate with and distribute AICUZ
      information to federal agency regional offices (HUD, VA, FHA, etc.), per their responsibilities to the AICUZ program
      as specified by FMC 75-2.


                                SECTION 9 AICUZ REVIEW STRATEGIES (ONGOING)

      AICUZ data should be reviewed and revalidated every two years (including re-run of an AICUZ noise map) unless
      required sooner in conjunction with an EIAP action.

      Every two years, conduct an analysis of land use compatibility within the vicinity of [NAME] AFB. Maintain a
      working relationship with surrounding communities to re-establish compatible land use designations as incompatible
      designations are identified.

          The base should conduct and submit to [Parent MAJCOM] a brief AICUZ survey on a biennial basis. This
          survey should summarize the status of the AICUZ program emphasizing foreseeable changes in the program
          including any issues involving civilian development which could impact on the mission (This survey is required by
          HQ USAF/ILEVP).

      The base should attend all zoning hearings which can potentially affect [NAME] AFB.

      The base should provide information to communities on modification of flight procedures that may affect noise in the
      area.

      The base should maintain constant, positive contact with key public officials.

      Keep senior base leaders fully informed on the AICUZ program.

    Closely monitor area comprehensive planning processes to ensure that [NAME] AFB’s interests continue to be
    represented.

CITIZEN’S BROCHURE                                                                                           [PAGE Number]

What is AICUZ?

                 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) is a program concerning people, their comfort, safety, and
                 protection. This brochure briefly summarizes the AICUZ study--an extensive analysis of the effects of noise,
                 aircraft accident potential, and land use and development upon present and future neighbors of [NAME] Air
                 Force Base. AICUZ seeks a cooperative understanding and a reasonable solution to this intricate problem.

Is there a problem?

                 Military airfields attract development to immediate surrounding areas. In the absence of compatible land use
                 controls, inappropriate uses may be made of property near or adjacent to the installation causing eventual
                 conflicts between flight operations and landowners. Because land close to [NAME] AFB is subject to high noise
                 levels and aircraft accident potentials, certain types of development are not suitable.

What has been done?

                 [NAME] AFB has attempted to be a good neighbor by restricting flying activities that could adversely affect its
                 neighbors. For example, flying operations are normally conducted between the hours of 7:00 AM and
                 10:00 PM. Practice approach and departure operations are normally conducted during daylight hours when
                 expected noise disruptions are less than they would be during evening hours. [NAME] AFB spent more than
                 $___ on a hush house in [DATE] and $__ million on [ITEM] in [DATE] to minimize the impact from the
                 noise of ground engine runups. Flight pattern altitudes and the runway approach angles have been adjusted over
                 the years in an effort to reduce noise impacts while maintaining safe operations. The base has demonstrated a
                 spirit of cooperation by participating with communities in the area-wide planning process. Continued
                 cooperation by [NAME] AFB, local governments, and the local populace will further reduce potential land use
                 conflicts. This action will help insure that future land use is compatible and beneficial.

What are the benefits?

                 In addition to protecting the public safety and health, primary benefits include protecting the taxpayer’s
                 investment in national defense provided by [NAME] AFB and protecting economic benefits to the surrounding
                 communities generated by base activities and employment. The local economy is enhanced by [NAME] AFB’s
                 expenditures for salaries, contracts, construction, retirement pay, tuition aid to schools, health insurance
                 payments, and off-base accommodations for travelers. [NAME] AFB employed over _____ people in fiscal year
                 [DATE] with an annual payroll of $__ million. Furthermore, [NAME] AFB spent approximately $__ million
                 on construction and service, equipment, and supply contracts. While shrinking budgets challenge the leadership
                 at [NAME] AFB, the base continues to be a strong partner in the economic future of the region.

Why AICUZ now?

              Land development in the vicinity of [BASE] AFB is ongoing and expected to accelerate. Modifications to flight
              operations at [NAME] AFB have resulted in changes to the noise contours outlined in the [DATE] AICUZ
              report. Information provided in the AICUZ report is intended to offer assistance to those planning the future of
              [RELEVANT COUNTIES] and their communities. By using the updated AICUZ map and information
              provided in the AICUZ Study, neighboring communities are better equipped to make land use decisions and
              adopt land use controls which are compatible with [NAME] AFB, yet able to accommodate growth.

What does AICUZ mean to me?

              AICUZ means protection of the public safety and health as well as protection of the Air Force’s national defense
              mission. The AICUZ itself is a composite of many factors: average noise levels, accident potential, and aircraft
              flight paths and altitudes. Noise and accident potential zones reflecting current conditions have been combined
              and displayed on the contour map shown on page [number].

              The numbers 65 dB through 80 dB indicate the average sound levels in decibels using the Day-Night Average
              A-Weighted Sound Level (DNL) metric for describing the noise environment. DNL is the energy-averaged
              sound level measured over 24 hours, with a 10 dB penalty applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) sound
              events to account for increased annoyance from late night noise.

              The clear zones and accident potential zones (APZs) are based upon statistical analysis of past DoD aircraft
              accidents. The clear zone, the area closest to the runway end, is the most hazardous. The overall risk is so high
              that DoD generally acquires the land through purchase or easement to prevent development. APZ I is an area
              beyond the clear zone that possesses a significant potential for accidents. APZ II is an area beyond APZ I having
              a lower, but still significant, potential for accidents. While aircraft accident potential in APZs I and II does not
              warrant acquisition by the Air Force, land use planning and controls are strongly encouraged in these areas for
              the protection of the public. An additional constraint involves areas which the Federal Aviation Administration
              (FAA) and DoD have identified for height limitations. Air Force obstruction criteria are based upon those
              contained in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 77, Subpart C.

              The accompanying generalized land use charts and AICUZ map provide a quick reference to the various noise
              and accident potential zones around NAME AFB. More detailed information can be found in the [NAME]
              AFB [DATE] AICUZ Study, Volume I.

The AICUZ report includes the following recommendations:

          The AICUZ report should be adopted as an official guideline for future planning.

          Zoning ordinances should be adopted, or modified to reflect the compatible land uses outlined in the[NAME] AFB
          AICUZ report.

          Fair disclosure ordinances should be enacted to specify disclosure to the public those AICUZ items directly related to
          operations at [NAME] AFB.

          Height control of structures near flight paths should be regulated by incorporating AICUZ recommendations into
          zoning ordinances.

          Comprehensive plans should include the land use recommendations of the AICUZ report.

          Subdivision regulations should reject new subdivisions not compatible with AICUZ land use objectives and provide
          controls for continued development in existing subdivisions.

          Building codes should be amended to require noise level reduction.

          Capital improvement programs should be carefully reviewed to discourage incompatible land use patterns, with
          particular emphasis on utility extension planning.

          The Joint Land Use Study (JLUS) should be completed, approved, and applied in all future land use decisions within
          areas affected by operations at [NAME] AFB. [IF APPLICABLE]
