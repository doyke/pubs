This instruction implements AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air & Space Expeditionary
Force (AEF), 30 April 2009. It provides guidance on stewardship of base plans, specifically
appointing the 27th Special Operations Wing Plans and Programs Division (27 SOW/XP) as
steward. It provides a standardized template for all plans to adhere to, in the absence of any
other higher headquarters guidance. Additionally, it provides for a master review schedule that
details what plans are in existence on the installation, who the functional Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) is for the plan, and when the plan was last reviewed and is due for the next
review. It also establishes a centralized repository for all wing plans. This instruction also
establishes a Plans Integration Working Group (PLING) to review, coordinate, prioritize and
manage wing plans. It codifies roles and responsibilities associated with the PLING, including
appointment requirements. It applies to all units assigned to the 27th Special Operations Wing
(27 SOW). This plan will be reviewed every two years to ensure currency. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records

                                         BASE PLANS

Section 1A—Purpose

1.1. Purpose. To define roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in the base planning
process at Cannon AFB. It also specifies the location where all base plans will reside, it
establishes a master review schedule of all base plans, and codifies a standardized format for all
base plans. In sum, this instruction lays out guidance that will ensure continuity and
standardization of all base plans at Cannon AFB, NM.

Section 1B—Guidance

1.2. Roles & Responsibilities. The following details the key roles and responsibilities
associated with the management of all base plans.
   1.2.1. 27 SOW/XP will:
       1.2.1.1. Function as lead Office of Coordinating Responsibility (OCR) on all base plans.
       1.2.1.2. Act as primary office for reviewing and coordinating base plans with all
       functional units and staff agencies, as well as outside agencies and Higher Headquarters
       (HHQ), as required.
       1.2.1.3. Draft appropriate staff packages for coordination, assign suspenses, identify
       units to coordinate on specific plans.
       1.2.1.4. Track comments provided during coordination and facilitate adjudication of
       those comments between the plan’s functional OPR and the unit that provided the
       comment.
       1.2.1.5. Provide guidance on format of base plans in order to (IOT) ensure
       standardization. Note: some plans have HHQ format requirements which will not be
       overridden at base level.
       1.2.1.6. Answer general questions on the plan as it relates to coordination and format.
       1.2.1.7. Establish and maintain an electronic repository for all approved base plans.
       1.2.1.8. Establish an index of all approved plans, to be posted in the electronic
       repository.
       1.2.1.9. Set an annual review schedule which prescribes when each plan is to be
       reviewed, in accordance with (IAW) plan requirements (annually, biannually, etc.).
       1.2.1.10. Inform functional units of any change in requirements that will impact the
       continued need for an existing plan, or the need to create a new plan.
       1.2.1.11. Serve as the chair for the Plans Integrated Working Group (PLING) and ensure
       procedures outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction are followed.
   1.2.2. The functional unit or staff agency that is OPR for the plan will:
 4                                                 CANNONAFBI10-100 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


        1.2.2.1. Provide the name(s) of (a) subject matter expert(s) (SME) to XP. The SME will
        serve as the point of contact (POC) responsible for adjudicating all comments to the plan
        and answering SME questions.
        1.2.2.2. Draft the actual plan contents IAW prescribed formats and coordinate the draft
        plan internal to their unit/agency prior to routing to XP.
        1.2.2.3. Lead meetings, briefings, working groups, et al., required to obtain plan updates
        and approval.
        1.2.2.4. Update/review the plan IAW established annual review schedule.
        1.2.2.5. Monitor and/or implement guidance that impacts the content, format and
        necessity of a given plan or guidance that requires a new plan outright. For example, if a
        particular plan is no longer required due to a change in AFI, it is the functional unit’s
        responsibility to inform XP, provide the necessary documentation (i.e., the AFI) and have
        it removed from the review schedule. Similarly, if an AFI directs the creation of a new
        plan, it is that functional unit’s responsibility to apprise XP of this requirement, at which
        time, XP will provide a suspense for the creation of this plan, should there not already be
        a HHQ suspense in place.
1.3. Plans Repository. All Cannon base plans will reside on a single webpage repository
located on the AFSOC sharepoint server and accessed at the following location:
https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/27SOW_XP/XPI/Cannon%20AFB%20Base%20Plans%20Libr
ary/Forms/AllItems.aspx. Navigation to this website may also be done by following this
organization tree, located on the 27 SOW Sharepoint Homepage: 27 SOW>27 SOW Staff
Agencies>27 SOW/XP>XPI>Cannon AFB Base Plans Library (listed under Site Libraries on the
XPI page).
     1.3.1. This webpage will serve as the sole access point for all base plans. All individuals
     assigned to Cannon will have read privileges on this website. Additionally, plan POCs, as
     designated in the plan, or appointed in writing by the functional commander who is the OPR
     for the plan, will have additional permissions allowing them to edit and upload changes to the
     plans.
1.4. Plans Master Review Schedule. A master review schedule will also be maintained on the
sharepoint website listed in paragraph 1.3 It will be titled Cannon AFB Plans Master Review
Schedule. 27 SOW/XP will be responsible for the maintenance of this schedule which will list
the following pieces of information:
     1.4.1. Title of the plan, including numerical designation, as necessary.
     1.4.2. Approval date (month and year) of the current plan.
     1.4.3. Office of primary responsibility for the plan.
     1.4.4. POC(s) for the plan, their office symbol and phone number.
     1.4.5. Required frequency of review (e.g., annual, bi-annual, tri-annual, etc.).
     1.4.6. Scheduled month and year of next review.
        1.4.6.1. This date will generally not coincide with anniversary date of the currently
        approved plan. This date is intended to reflect when initial functional review must begin,
CANNONAFBI10-100 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             5


      and will allow for that review period, plus anticipated coordination time. For example, if
      a plan is approved in May 2010, and has an annual review requirement, the scheduled
      month and year of next review will likely be sometime in January – March of 2011, to
      allow sufficient time for review and coordination. The length of time for review and
      coordination will vary with each plan, based on its complexity, length, number of units
      required to coordinate, etc.
   1.4.7. Current status of the plan (e.g., Current, Under Review, Pending Approval).
   1.4.8. Miscellaneous notes.
1.5. Standardized Format of Base Plans. All base plans will have a standardized format,
unless otherwise directed by HHQ guidance. Refer to Attachment 2 of this instruction for
further information.

                   PLANS INTEGRATION WORKING GROUP (PLING)

Section 2A—Purpose

2.1. Purpose. The Wing Plans and Programs Division, 27 SOW/XP, is the base level OPR for
plans management. To assist in this effort, XP will chair the Plans Integration Working Group
(PLING). The PLING will be comprised of representatives from each squadron and wing staff
agency who will help orchestrate the overall base planning effort.

Section 2B—Guidance

2.2. Roles and Responsibilities for PLING efforts.
     2.2.1. Unit Commanders (below Group*) and Staff Agency Chiefs will: (*below Group
     unless the Group has consolidated all planning efforts in a single organization (e.g., 27
     SOMDG in the 27 SOMDSS)).
        2.2.1.1. Appoint a primary and alternate unit/agency plans representative, in writing, and
        forward appointment letters to 27 SOW/XP. For continuity, plans representatives should
        be appointed for a minimum of one year. In addition, the representative should be
        familiar with plans for which their unit is OPR. A sample Appointment Letter is found at
        Attachment 3 of this instruction. Note: Staff agencies that are permanently manned by
        one person only need to submit a primary representative.
        2.2.1.2. Review the Cannon AFB Plans Master Review Schedule on the sharepoint
        website, listed in paragraph 1.3 of this instruction, for currency. In the event a specific
        plan, for which that commander’s unit is responsible for, is not listed there, ensure 27
        SOW/XP receives a copy of the most current approved version of the plan. If a plan is no
        longer required, provide written justification and documentation for removal from the
        schedule to 27 SOW/XP.
        2.2.1.3. Serve as the final review authority for all plans their unit is OPR for prior to
        sending to 27 SOW/XP for further review and coordination. In this capacity, provide a
        recommendation to XP, based on the extent of changes in the plan, as outlined in the
        summary of changes, on whether the plan is ready for 27 SOW/CC review, or if it
        requires full review within the wing. Reviews should be done IAW the scheduled review
        date for each plan, as listed on Cannon AFB Plans Master Review Schedule.
     2.2.2. Wing Plans (27 SOW/XP) will:
        2.2.2.1. Conduct PLING meetings at least once a quarter.
            2.2.2.1.1. Conduct of meetings involve all preparatory actions necessary to schedule
            the meeting, including notification to PLING representatives of date and time,
            building of appropriate briefing materials, and dissemination of applicable read-
            aheads. Additionally, meeting minutes will be kept by 27 SOW/XP, and will be
            published to all PLING representatives following the meeting, along with the
            anticipated date of the next meeting. Meeting minutes will be published to the
CANNONAFBI10-100 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                               7


          sharepoint website listed in paragraph 1.3 of this instruction as soon as possible,
          given mission requirements at the time.
          2.2.2.1.2. Meetings will consist of the following minimum elements: a discussion of
          all plans currently in review/coordination, a discussion of plans that were approved
          since the last PLING meeting, and a discussion of plans scheduled for review within
          the next 90 days. Additionally, any lessons learned or feedback related to the plans
          process will be shared with all working group members.
       2.2.2.2. Provide email notification to OPRs and PLING representatives (if different) to
       begin review of their appropriate plan(s) one month prior to the scheduled review date, as
       listed on the Cannon AFB Plans Master Review Schedule.
       2.2.2.3. Assist OPRs and PLING representatives (if different) as required during the
       review and coordination process. Ensure that procedures outlined in this instruction are
       adhered to.
       2.2.2.4. Evaluate the draft plan and summary of changes provided by the plan OPR to
       determine the level of coordination required.
       2.2.2.5. When approved, publish the final approved plan to the sharepoint website listed
       in paragraph 1.3 of this instruction, inform the plan OPR of the approval status, and
       update the Cannon AFB Plans Master Review Schedule.
   2.2.3. PLING Representatives will:
       2.2.3.1. Act as the unit/agency POC for all 27 SOW base plans issues.
       2.2.3.2. Ensure all drafts of plans are routed internally to squadron commanders or staff
       agency chiefs, IAW the scheduled review date for each plan, as listed on Cannon AFB
       Plans Master Review Schedule.
       2.2.3.3. Bring all planning conflicts which impact timely completion of scheduled
       projects to the attention of the PLING for resolution.
       2.2.3.4. Review the Cannon AFB Plans Master Review Schedule on the sharepoint
       website, listed in paragraph 1.3 of this instruction, for currency. In the event a specific
       plan, for which that unit is responsible for, is not listed there, ensure 27 SOW/XP
       receives a copy of the most current approved version of the plan. If a plan is no longer
       required, provide written justification and documentation for removal from the schedule
       to 27 SOW/XP, through the commander or staff agency chief.
       2.2.3.5. Attend all scheduled PLING meetings.
2.3. Plans Review Process: All SOW functional plans require the wing commander's
approval/signature and must be reviewed IAW the processes outlined in this instruction. All
plans must be reviewed IAW the schedule prescribed in the Cannon AFB Plans Master Review
Schedule. The determination of how extensive the review is can be made, in general, by
following the 10% change rule. If less than 10% of the plan’s contents are changed, then a
streamlined review process may take place. If greater than 10%, then the full review process
must take place. 27 SOW/XP also reserves discretion on whether to require a full review on any
plan, regardless of how much the plan contents are changed.
8                                                CANNONAFBI10-100 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


    2.3.1. PLING representative roles and responsibilities. The PLING representative’s role
    in reviewing and coordinating on a plan is determined by whether or not their unit is the OPR
    for the plan.
       2.3.1.1. Plans for which the PLING representative’s unit/agency is the OPR.
           2.3.1.1.1. If the unit/agency determines that the plan requires less than 10% change,
           the commander/staff agency chief may recommend to 27 SOW/XP that it is ready for
           SOW/CC signature. The commander/staff agency chief may also recommend full
           staffing, despite the paucity of change. In the former case, XP retains the right to
           concur or non-concur with this recommendation, based on their evaluation of the plan
           and the summary of changes. In the event XP non-concurs with the commander/staff
           agency chief’s recommendation, an explanation will be provided to that individual on
           why XP non-concurred. In the latter case, XP will always concur with the
           recommendation.
           2.3.1.1.2. If the unit/agency determines that the plan requires change greater than or
           equal to 10% of its content, the commander must recommend to 27 SOW/XP that the
           plan undergo full review and coordination through the wing.
       2.3.1.2. Plans for which the PLING Representative’s unit/agency is not the OPR. In
       this case, the PLING representative’s role will principally be limited to internal
       coordination within their unit, when tasked by 27 SOW/XP, and serving as a liaison to
       the plan OPR for questions on their unit’s comments and coordination. Reference
       paragraphs 2.3.2.10 and 2.3.2.11 of this instruction for further details.
    2.3.2. Process Flow. The following process, as depicted in Figure 2.1 of this instruction,
    will be used for all plan reviews.
       2.3.2.1. 27 SOW/XP will notify the plan POC and PLING representative, via email, that
       a plan’s schedule review date is approaching. Note: the plan POC may or may not be the
       same as the PLING representative. The POC will be the specific individual(s) named in
       the plan as the point of contact.
       2.3.2.2. The OPR will download the plan from the sharepoint website, as listed in
       paragraph 1.3 of this instruction. Note: the OPR is the office where the POC resides.
       The PLING representative might not reside in the same office as the POC.
       2.3.2.3. The OPR will build a draft plan, to bring the plan current. At a minimum, it will

                      STANDARDIZED FORMAT OF BASE PLANS

A2.1. Use AFMAN 10-401, Vol 2 for structuring your plan. Section C of the AFMAN,
including all pre-annex information and specified annexes will be adhered to for all base plans.
An example of this format can also be found at the end of this Attachment.
   A2.1.1. The use of appendices in Section C is optional. Deviation to appendix titles is
   allowed. These deviations are authorized as most base plans will not contain subject matter
   that is relevant to the particular appendices listed in the AFMAN. If an appendix listed in
   the AFMAN is not used in a particular base plan, it is not necessary to document that in the
   plan.
   A2.1.2. Should a base plan not use a particular annex from the AFMAN, it must still be
   included in the plan with the annotation ―This Section Not Used‖ on the relevant page.
A2.2. Microsoft Word is the word processing standard. Use the following formats to ensure
standardization (note: these instructions are written for Microsoft Office 2007):

        reached. Auto numbering of page numbers can be done on these pages only (to access,
        go to the Insert Tab and select page number).
        A2.2.3.3. Annex pages (must be manually entered):
        A2.2.3.3.1. Annex pages will start with page one and count consecutively.
        A2.2.3.3.2 Each new annex will reset the page numbers back to one, utilizing the
        following convention: Annex Letter, a dash, and the page number of that annex (e.g.,
        Annex A, page 1 of that annex will be marked ―A-1‖, with the next page being ―A-2‖,
        and so on; the first page of Annex B would then be ―B-1‖). Note: Appendices, Exhibits
        and other sections below an Annex do not require a change in this numbering convention.
        All pages in an annex will be numbered consecutively, starting with page one.
        A2.2.3.4. All page numbers will be centered in the footer, using Times New Roman 10
        font.

ANNEX B TO NAME OF YOUR PLAN

INTELLIGENCE (ANNEX SUBJECTS ARE PER AFMAN 10-401V2)

REFERENCES:              List documents providing intelligence required for planning, including related
                         annexes to this plan (such as Annex H, Weather Operations).

1.    MISSION AND CONCEPT OF INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS (PARA 1 WILL ALWAYS BE
MISSION AND CONCEPT OF THE PARTICULAR ANNEX)

  a. Mission. State concisely the intelligence mission as it relates to the planned operation. Refer to the
command mission statement in the basic plan. When Annex B is distributed separately, also include the
command mission statement from the basic plan.

   b. Concept of Intelligence Operations. Outline the purpose of intelligence operations. Summarize the
resources and agencies to be employed in directing, collecting, processing, producing, and disseminating
the necessary intelligence during normal and crisis periods prior to, as well as during execution of the
OpOrd.

2. SITUATION (PARA 2 WILL ALWAYS BE THE SITUATION THAT PERTAINS TO THAT ANNEX)

   a. Characteristics of the Area. Provide a summary of the physical, economic, political, medical, social,
and psychological aspects and conditions of the area of operations as they may influence the concept of
the plan. Don’t repeat information included in the general situation discussed in the basic plan. Include a
sufficient analysis of the area of operation to permit development of supporting plans. Include complete
CANNONAFBI10-100 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                                          15


information or preferably reference documents and reports which contain required intelligence
information.

    b. Weather and Terrain. Describe the environmental factors such as weather and terrain in the
projected deployment location that could impact planning and execution of the OPLAN and air operations
in general. For example, a detailed description of seasonal rainy seasons significantly affecting air
operations at a deployment location would be appropriate. Additionally, include a discussion of the
deployment area’s infrastructure. If detailed and lengthy, place the summarized climatic information in an
appendix to this annex. Include seasonal environmental factors such as:

      (1) Seasonal occurrence of adverse wind and seas (such as monsoons).

      (2) Seasonal occurrence of precipitation and other airborne contaminants (for example, dust, smog,
          and haze).

      (3) Seasonal occurrence of abnormal tides and currents that could impact on beach operations.

      (4) Seasonal temperature, humidity, and density altitude variations that could affect operations.

                           (THIS PAGE NUMBER WOULD GO IN THE FOOTER)




      (5) Other seasonal environmental factors that could limit operational capability.

3.       INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. Detail intelligence activities and task and specify the
intelligence resources to be used in collecting, processing, producing, and disseminating intelligence
required to support the operation plan. Specifically identify the supporting intelligence plans. (PARA 3
SHOULD BE RELEVANT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ANNEX)

4.    ASSIGNMENT OF INTELLIGENCE TASKS (PARA 4 SHOULD LIST SUBORDINATE UNITS
INVOLVED, IF ANY)

5.      COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2). Summarize those C2 systems and procedures to be used to
carry out the intelligence function or reference the appropriate paragraphs of Annex K. Discussion should
address interface and connectivity requirements between intelligence and C3 systems. Specifically,
describe intelligence systems required for executing the OPLAN. (PARA 5 WILL ALWAYS BE C2
FUNCTIONS)

6. MISCELLANEOUS INSTRUCTIONS. Use separate subparagraphs to include items not included
above, for example, deception, censorship, disclosure of intelligence, public relations, use of specialized
intelligence personnel, and composition of the IN staff. (PARA 6 WILL BE YOUR CATCHALL FOR
ANYTHING THAT DOESN’T FIT INTO THE OTHER PARAGRAPHS)
