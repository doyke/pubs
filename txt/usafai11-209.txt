1. Purpose. This instruction provides guidance on planning and coordinating aerial events at
USAFA. It emphasizes the distinction between a flyover, an aerial demonstration and an aerial
review and the procedures required to request them. Definitions are provided in Attachment 1.

    1.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful national occasions and must
    be approved by SAF/PAC, HQ USAF/A3OOB with final approval by OASD/PA.

    1.2. Launching rockets, balloons or other airborne projectiles on or over USAFA property,
    including Stillman Parade Field, is not considered an aerial event but requires prior
    coordination with 306 OSS/OSOA.

Terms (from AFI 11-209, pages 29-32)
Aerial Control Team—A qualified individual or team of individuals who oversee and control
USAF aerial participation, and aerial participation by other organizations, in selected public or
military events. ACT can be used synonymously with Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) for the
purposes of this instruction.

Aerial Demonstration—Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually
every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or military
events (except aerial review and flyover): aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft weapons
or tactics demonstrations, USAF vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams,
airdrop demonstrations of personnel or equipment, engine-running offload and aircraft backing

maneuvers, in-flight refueling demonstrations, AFPT performances, CSAR demonstrations and
helicopter flight demonstrations consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire
suppression, and personnel AIE. Aerial demonstration is synonymous with the phrases aerial
demo, aircraft demonstration, aircraft capabilities demonstration, and aircraft CAPEX.

Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial performances.

Aerial Review—Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four
aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service
or nation, regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements. An aerial review may
include civilian aircraft. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve precision
maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft,
formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations. A single element flyover
involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the same type from the same Military
Service is not considered an aerial review.

Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with
aircraft demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon systems. A
capabilities demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting maneuvers usually
associated with its employment and is common to the airframe being shown.

Flyover—Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight limited to one pass
by a single military aircraft, or by a single formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the
same type from the same Military Service over a predetermined point on the ground at a specific
time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations; however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees
are permissible and may be used if required to improve the spectator visibility of the aircraft.

SUBJECT: Request for Aerial Review Exception to Policy for 2008 USAFA Graduation Parade and Determination of
         “Military” or “Public” Event Status for the Event

References: (a) AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures
            (b) AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures

            (d) DODI 5410.19, Public Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation

1. USAFA requests an Exception to Policy (ETP) to conduct an Aerial Review during the Class of 2008 Graduation
Parade, 27 May 2008. The requested aerial review would consist of:

     a.     A 306 FTG capabilities demonstration (CAPEX) using USAFA-assigned, AETC-owned aircraft (powered and
glider aircraft) and the USAFA Wings of Blue parachute demonstration team. The CAPEX will showcase USAF Academy
cadet airmanship programs to parents, family members, friends, and distinguished military and civilian guests, and will be
conducted as part of normal training missions.

     b.    Flyovers of transient (non-USAFA assigned) aircraft representing a cross section of USAF combat, support and
training assets. Specifically:

         (1)   2X Fighter Aircraft
         (2)   1X Transport Aircraft
         (3)   1X Tanker Aircraft
         (4)   2X Trainer Aircraft
         (5)   1X Rotary Aircraft.

2. This Aerial Review has been conducted annually for more than 20 years during the USAFA Graduation Parade. These
flyovers showcase the operational Air Force assets the cadets may operate in their future careers and demonstrate the
capabilities of our Air Force. Attendance at the Graduation Parade is traditionally 10K-12K people, plus coverage by
local, regional and national media. The parade is open to the general public.

3. Over the past four years, OASD/PA has limited the participation levels of the transient aircraft to as many as 10 and as
few as four. The justification has been primarily that the event should be opened to the general public for a greater impact
and that the USAF had at one point placed a moratorium on flyover events nationwide. Further, OASD/PA guidance has
suggested the USAFA should not expect a greater complement of aviation assets for this event than they were willing to
provide at other similar events. The USAFA Graduation Parade does not have an equivalent or similar event. It is the
culminating event for the next generation of Air Force officers and leaders. This event, even with limited attendance (10K-
USAFAI11-209 10 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                                               13
12K) of military, DoD and invited civilian guests, impacts a significant cross section of the entire nation; and that impact is
not regionally constrained like many other DOD- and USAF-supported events (e.g., NASCAR races, NFL football games,
air shows, etc). All 50 States and most US territories are represented in the assembled Graduation Parade crowd, as well as
many foreign nations through their military exchange cadets and invited dignitaries. The Aerial Review allows those in
attendance to carry back to their communities, bases and even foreign countries the overwhelming impact and importance
of US Air Force operational airpower. Through these attendees, this one event becomes the catalyst across our own nation
to seek active support for the Academy, US Air Force and the entire DOD family (reference AFI 35-101, para. 1.8.3.2).

5. This event directly recognizes our senior cadets for their successful accomplishment of the USAF Academy mission,
“To educate, train and inspire men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the United States Air
Force in service to our nation.” USAFA does not conduct the traditional open house or air show, primarily because the
USAFA airfield control tower (KAFF) runway is too small to support most USAF aviation assets. The Graduation Parade,
in which the graduating cadets move out of the 4,300-person cadet wing and receive their first salute from their peers, is
conducted on Stillman Parade Field where viewing space and seating is also limited. With these factors considered,
USAFA is ensuring the greatest impact at this one event in keeping with the community relations efforts dictated by DoD
Public Affairs (reference DODD 5410.18, para. 4.1.1.1 and AFI 35-101, para. 1.8.2.1).

6. USAFA has maintained FAA-reviewed and -approved flyover procedures without significant change for more than 15
years. USAFA maintains an annual waiver from the FAA to conduct flyovers at 500 feet AGL, and up to 300 KIAS for
specific military and civilian aircraft. USAFA has a certified Aerial Control Team, SCENIC CONTROL, which conducts
more flyover events, including Aerial Reviews, annually than any other single location nationwide. This is primarily due
to the high-visibility national cemetery funerals and the numerous other large-scale military events conducted on the
Academy property each year (e.g., football games, cadet military training exercises, etc).

7. All transient aircraft that participate in this planned Aerial Review do so while conducting normal training missions en
route to USAFA, either before or after the event, and are not generated specifically for the purpose of the event.
OASD/PA has previously placed a restriction that transient aircraft should come from bases geographically closest to
USAFA (per email from Cynthia Minnick, 11 April 2007). While we seek support from the closest available units, this
restriction prevents numerous aircraft that regularly transit Colorado on previously assigned missions from better
supporting the event (reference DODD 5410.18, para. 4.2.2).

8. The referenced DOD directives and Air Force instruction indicate OASD/PA approval is required for “Public” event
Aerial Reviews only. USAFA considers its Graduation Parade a “Military” event and requests OASD/PA’s concurrence
with that interpretation (reference AFI 11-209, Atch 1, pg. 32, definition of “Military” event).

9. We would appreciate your response, both for the requested ETP and a determination as to whether this event qualifies
as a “Military” event by 15 February 2008 to allow enough time to work with the MAJCOMs to schedule aircraft (if
approved) or to prepare alternate plans for the Graduation Parade (if disapproved). POC for this request is Maj William
Ashworth, Acting Director of Communications, HQ USAFA/CM, DSN 333-7714 or (719) 333-7714,
