                                      INTRODUCTION


1.1. Purpose. This document describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for the
Blood Donor Center (BDC), Armed Services Whole Blood Processing Laboratory (ASWBPL),
Medical Expeditionary Blood Transshipment Center (EBTC), Medical Expeditionary Blood
Support Center (EBSC), and the Medical Expeditionary Frozen Blood Product Team (FBPT). It
describes command relationships, assigns tasks, and provides general guidance for EBTC,
EBSC, and FBPT teams assigned to support the full range of military operations. It provides a
source document for developing policies, standard operating procedures, and training programs
and for validating future requirements and revisions to planning and training concepts. Unit
Type Code (UTC) Mission Capability (MISCAP) statements are available for review on the Air
Combat Command (ACC) Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) Playbook.

1.2. Background. The blood capability developed during the Cold War centered on the
shipping capabilities of the Blood Transshipment Center (BTC) and Transportable Blood
Transshipment Center (TBTC) along with the frozen blood deglycerolization capabilities of the
FBPT. This monolithic approach relied on large, prepositioned assets that carried a large
footprint and were heavy in personnel, equipment, and supplies. It proved to be unusable in
terms of maintenance, rapid mobility, and flexibility.

   1.2.1. EBTC Background. The lessons learned in the Gulf War highlighted the need for a
   reengineered theater capability designed to meet the needs of future contingencies, while
   recognizing anticipated limitations in manpower and equipment funding. As a first step, the
   modular, building-block approach used by the Expeditionary Medical Support (EMEDS)
   system was used as a template for combining the BTC and TBTC into the EBTC outlined in
   this AFTTP.

   1.2.2. EBSC Background. The need for apheresis platelet (APLT) and whole blood
   collection in theater became apparent during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation
   Iraqi Freedom. The EBSC was formed to address the need for these expanded theater blood
   support capabilities. The EBSC functions primarily as an APLT collection team, but can
   switch operations to perform whole blood collection when required.

1.3. Blood Component Therapy. Blood component therapy is the recognized standard of
medical care in the continental United States (CONUS) and all Department of Defense (DOD)
medical treatment facilities (MTFs). It plays a significant role in combat-casualty trauma care.
The availability of blood components at a deployed medical facility (DMF) depends on several
factors, including CONUS blood supply, logistical support (e.g., blood transshipment, air-frame
availability, etc.), and the component utilization rate.

   1.3.1. Blood Products. Collected blood products include fresh whole blood (FWB), APLT,
   and apheresis fresh frozen plasma (AFFP). FWB provides red blood cells (RBCs) (oxygen-
   carry capacity), coagulation factors (to include factors V and VIII), plasma (proteins,
volume), and platelets. The freshly collected whole blood must be transfused within 24
hours of collection. In accordance with (IAW) the Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical
Practice Guideline, Fresh Whole Blood (FWB) Transfusion, all blood stored at room
temperature for more than 24 hours must be destroyed due to the risk of bacterial growth.
Whole blood refrigerated within 8 hours of collection may be stored up to 5 days. Blood
platelets are collected through a selective process called apheresis and are essential to
hemostasis (stoppage of bleeding). Once collected, the platelet product has a 5-day shelf life.

1.3.2. Frozen Blood Deglycerolization. RBCs are frozen at designated DOD sites in
CONUS in a cryoprotective agent (typically glycerol) to be stockpiled for use in deployed
settings to support the full range of military operations. Frozen red blood cells (FRBCs) can
be stored for 10 years from the time of collection. The FRBC units must be thawed and
deglycerolized before transfusion. Deglycerolization is the process used to remove the
residual glycerol concentration from the FRBC unit to a level of less than 1 percent and
replace it with isotonic solution (saline) before the blood is transfused. The shelf-life for
deglycerolized blood is 14 days, post thaw.
                                         CHAPTER 2

                                       CAPABILITIES


2.1. Blood Donor Center (BDC). BDCs provide blood and blood products in support of
peacetime and wartime contingencies. BDCs can collect, manufacture, and ship packed red
blood cells (PRBC); fresh frozen plasma (FFP); cryoprecipitate (CRYO); plasma frozen within
24 hours of phlebotomy (PF24); APLT; AFFP; apheresis red blood cells (ARBCs); and RBCs
destined for freezing (FRBC). The BDC is typically a fixed facility under the operational control
(OPCON) of the MTF commander at the installation where the BDC is located.

   2.1.1. Mission/Tasks. The BDC serves as the primary collection facility for PRBC, FFP,
   CRYO, PF24, APLT, AFFP, ARBC, and FRBC. The BDC ships the required quota of blood
   and blood components to the ASWBPL on a weekly basis. The weekly blood quota is set by
   the Air Force Blood Program Office (AFBPO) in coordination with the Armed Services
   Blood Program Office (ASBPO), Combatant Command (COCOM) Joint Blood Program
   Office (JBPO), and the Area Joint Blood Program Office (AJBPO).

   2.1.2. Manpower. The BDC teams are comprised of the team chief (laboratory officer) and
   medical laboratory technicians. BDCs may also be staffed by medical materiel technicians
   and administrative personnel. These teams are normally employed in-place at a BDC
   collocated with an MTF. All members are responsible for the full scope of team activities as
   directed by the team chief. The BDC can be augmented by additional BDC manpower teams
   or by EBTC personnel.

   2.1.3. Capabilities. BDCs provide blood products to the ASWBPLs on a continuing basis
   to support worldwide contingencies. They schedule and conduct blood drives to maximize
   the military donor base available to the Armed Services Blood Program. Donors are
   screened IAW the donor criteria specified in AFMAN 41-111, Standard for Blood Banks and
   Transfusion Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, and supplemental
   guidance from the ASBPO. Blood storage and shipping requirements are IAW TM 8-227-
   11/NAVMED P-5123/AFI 44-118, Operational Procedures for the Armed Services Blood
   Program Elements. BDCs have the following capabilities:

       2.1.3.1. Process and coordinate serological testing of all blood donations IAW current
       regulatory agency guidelines.

       2.1.3.2. Store liquid RBCs, FFP, PF24, and CRYO at the proper temperatures.
       Refrigerators and freezers used for storage have audible alarms, an emergency power
       source, and a continuous temperature recording system.

       2.1.3.3. Containers and a sufficient supply of cubed wet ice and absorbent materials to
       ship liquid RBC and maintain proper temperatures for 48 hours.
       2.1.3.4. Containers and a sufficient supply of pelletized dry ice to ship up to 15 units of
       FFP/PF24 or 30 units of CRYO and maintain a frozen state and proper temperatures for
       48 hours.

2.2. Armed Services Whole Blood Processing Laboratory (ASWBPL). The ASWBPLs
serve as the central receiving and shipment points in CONUS for blood shipments from the
BDCs. There are two ASWBPLs, one located at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New
Jersey (ASWBPL-East) and one at Travis Air Force Base, California (ASWBPL-West), to
facilitate blood shipments to MTFs in CONUS and around the world. They are operationally
controlled by the AFBPO.

   2.2.1. Mission/Tasks. The ASWBPLs accept, inspect, and store blood and blood products
   shipped from the BDCs and are responsible for shipping these products to the EBTCs, Army
   Blood Supply Detachments (BSDs), and other blood-related contingency operations. Liquid
   RBCs are also tested to confirm that the ABO and Rh blood typing are correct. The
   ASWBPLs are the centralized freezing and deglycerolization centers for FRBCs. They
   accept PRBCs for manufacture (glycerolization) into FRBCs, which are then stored or
   shipped. They can also thaw and deglycerolize the FRBCs for redistribution. The capability
   for shipment, receipt, and distribution of blood products must be included in deliberate
   planning and operation plans (OPLANs).

   2.2.2. Manpower. The ASWBPLs consist of nine tri-service staff (three per military
   service). The officer in charge (OIC) position is filled by the Air Force, and the non-
   commissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) position is filled by the Army. These positions are
   service-managed, special-duty assignments and are not covered by a UTC. In the event that
   quota requirements exceed 1,500-2,000 units per week, additional manpower may be
   required from the services, or an EBTC may be employed. All members are responsible for
   the full scope of team activities as directed by the team chief.

   2.2.3. Capabilities. An ASWBPL can store and process up to 1,000 PRBCs, 1,000
   FFP/PF24, 500 CRYO, and 500 FRBC units per week. An ASWBPL can also store an
   additional 1,000 FFP/PF24 and 2,000 FRBC units held in reserve for contingencies. The
   ASWBPL includes the following capabilities:

       2.2.3.1. Freezers with 24-hour monitoring and alarm capability that provide sufficient
       capacity to receive and store up to 5,000 units of frozen products.

       2.2.3.2. Refrigerators with 24-hour monitoring and alarm capability that provide
       sufficient capacity to receive and store up to 2,000 PRBC.

       2.2.3.3. Re-icing operations sufficient to produce and store 2,400 pounds of wet ice
       every 24 hours for the shipment of PRBC. Dry ice for shipping frozen products will be
       obtained through contract services.

       2.2.3.4. Frozen blood deglycerolization equipment and supplies to manufacture and
       further process deglycerolized red blood cells (DRBCs) for transfusion.
      2.2.3.5. Freezers and refrigerators require emergency backup power in case of a power
      outage.

2.3. Expeditionary Blood Transshipment Center (EBTC). The EBTC provides the capability
to receive, store, inventory, and ship blood products. EBTCs are normally located at major
airfields, with one or more EBTCs located in an area of responsibility (AOR). They are
operationally controlled by the COCOM JBPO or the AJBPO.

   2.3.1. Mission/Tasks. The EBTC serves as the central receiving and shipment point in an
   AOR for shipments from the ASWBPL. An EBTC can store and distribute up to 3,000 units
   of blood per week. The capability for shipment, receipt, and distribution of blood products
   must be included in deliberate planning and OPLANs. EBTC UTCs must be represented in
   Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDDs) for these OPLANs.

   2.3.2. Manpower. The EBTC personnel UTCs FFBP1, FFBP2, and FFBP3 are modular in
   design and capability. The addition of FFBP2 and FFBP3 to FFBP1 incrementally add
   throughput capability. The EBTC team’s manpower is comprised of the team chief
   (laboratory officer) as well as medical laboratory craftsmen and journeymen. The teams may
   be employed in support of other blood movement components such as an ASWBPL. All
   members are responsible for the full scope of team activities as directed by the team chief.

      2.3.2.1. EBTC Module 1 (UTC FFBP1) Manpower. FFBP1 personnel provide 24-
      hour operational support of the EBTC in the deployed setting. This module functions as
      an intermediate receiving, blood inventory management, re-icing, holding, and
      distribution facility for liquid and frozen products, including PRBC, FFP, CRYO, PF24,
      and FRBC. It can process up to 1,000 units of liquid and frozen blood products per week.
      The team is responsible for setting up and sustaining EBTC equipment.

       2.3.2.4. EBTC Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Substitutions. Lower-level
       grade/skill substitutions are not allowed for the medical laboratory positions. AFSC
       4T090 or above is the only authorized substitute for 4T071. AFSC 4T071 or above is the
       only authorized substitute for 4T051. Other AFSC substitutions are authorized IAW the
       War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1), Air Force Medical Service (AFMS)
       Supplement. Other grade/skill-level substitutions are authorized IAW AFI 10-403,
       Deployment Planning and Execution.

   2.3.3. Capabilities. The EBTC is capable of worldwide operations under extreme climatic
   conditions (-20F to 140F) where medical operations can be effectively employed. It
   includes the following capabilities:

       2.3.3.1. Freezers with 24-hour monitoring and alarm capabilities and sufficient capacity
       to receive and store up to 2,000 units of frozen products.

       2.3.3.2. Refrigerators with 24-hour monitoring and alarm capabilities and sufficient
       capacity to receive and store up to 1,000 PRBC.

       2.3.3.3. Re-icing operations sufficient to produce and store 2,400 pounds of wet ice
       every 24 hours for the re-icing of PRBC. Dry ice requirements for the shipment of frozen
       products will be obtained through contract services.

       2.3.3.4. Adequate administrative storage space and environmentally controlled work
       areas.

       2.3.3.5. Associated support equipment, including computer/data processing equipment,
       environmental control units/field deployable environmental control units (ECU/FDECU),
       support equipment, and alarm systems. Emergency power must be provided to ensure
       full mission capabilities and protection of stored blood products.

2.4. Expeditionary Blood Support Center (EBSC). The EBSC team expands blood support
capabilities in-theater by providing advanced capabilities in the collection and preparation of
blood components. EBSCs are not standalone and must be co-located with an Air Force Theater
Hospital (AFTH) or equivalent Joint DMF. The team is operationally controlled by the
AFTH/Joint DMF commander. For more information about AFTH/Joint DMF dependencies,
see paragraph 2.4.4.

   2.4.1. Mission/Tasks. The EBSC is a deployable laboratory team that is intended to
   augment an AFTH or equivalent Joint DMF. The team collects and prepares blood
components for transfusion to support emergency trauma situations. The goal of component
transfusion therapy is to provide the most appropriate blood component to the patient. This
ability to provide specialized blood components can greatly improve transfusion treatment
outcome. The capability for the shipment, receipt, and distribution of blood products must be
included in deliberate planning and OPLANs. EBSC UTCs must be represented in TPFDDs
for these OPLANs.

   2.4.1.1. Allogeneic Donor Selection and Screening. Blood component collection
   requires access to a large population to recruit potential donors. Once recruited, all
   potential donors will be prescreened IAW theater guidelines for blood donor collection.

   2.4.1.2. FWB Collection. Whole blood collection will be conducted when fresh, warm,
   whole blood is required for emergency transfusions related to traumatic coagulopathy, in
   the absence of component therapy, or when whole blood is deemed clinically necessary
   to save life or limb. FWB is not FDA-approved and is not intended for routine use. The
   decision to use FWB is a medical decision that must be made by a physician who has full
   knowledge of the clinical situation and the availability of compatible blood components.
   (See the Joint Theater Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline for FWB Transfusion
   for guidance.) Healthy donors will be recruited and phlebotomized using approved
   collection protocol to minimize bacterial contamination. EBSC personnel will test the
   collected whole blood to confirm ABO/Rh and to minimize the risk of transferring
   infection. This testing will be conducted in the AFTH/Joint DMF lab. Once testing is
   complete, the labeled unit will be issued for transfusion. The AFTH/Joint DMF can store
   up to 60 units of FWB. If refrigerated within 8 hours of collection, whole blood may be
   stored up to 5 days.

   2.4.1.3. APLT Collection. The selective removal of blood platelets from blood donors
   will be accomplished using commercially available apheresis instruments. Before APLT
   collection occurs, platelet donors must be tested using the full panel of FDA-licensed
   donor infectious disease tests and found to be negative for all tests. Once this donor
   prescreening is complete, platelets are collected following the manufacturer’s protocol.
   EBSC personnel will use quality control measures (e.g., platelet count, pH, and culture)
   to ensure product quality. These quality control measures will be performed in the AFTH
   lab.

2.4.2. EBSC (UTC FFLBB) Manpower. FFLBB provides medical laboratory personnel to
locally collect APLT and FWB in a deployed location. The team’s maximum collection
capability is 10 APLT units or 50 units of FWB within a 12-hour duty day. (For planning
purposes, note that the allowance standard [AS] provides 150 APLT kits and 200 whole
blood bags.) EBSC manpower is comprised of the team chief (blood bank officer) as well as
medical laboratory craftsmen and journeymen. Personnel must receive just-in-time skills
training in blood collection before deployment. All members are responsible for the full
scope of team activities as directed by the team chief.

       2.4.2.1. EBSC Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) Substitutions. The only authorized
       substitute for the blood bank laboratory officer is a biomedical laboratory officer
       (043T3A) with blood bank experience. AFSC 4T090 or above is the only authorized
       substitute for 4T071 (lower-level grade/skill substitutions not allowed). Other
       grade/skill-level substitutions are authorized IAW AFI 10-403.

       2.4.2.2. EBSC Augmentation. The EBSC is not staffed to concurrently meet the
       maximum daily throughputs for APLT and FWB collection. Apheresis collection is
       suspended during emergency FWB collection. The AFTH/Joint DMF commander should
       plan to augment the EBSC with staff/volunteers from the medical facility to support
       whole blood collection operations as needed.

   2.4.3. Capabilities. The EBSC is capable of worldwide operations under extreme climatic
   conditions (-20°F to 140°F) where medical operations can be effectively employed. It
   includes the following capabilities:

       2.4.3.1. Platelet incubators with 24-hour monitoring and alarm capabilities and sufficient
       capacity to manage and store up to 30-40 APLTs.

       2.4.3.2. Adequate administrative storage space and environmentally controlled work
       areas.

       2.4.3.3. Associated support equipment, including computer/data processing equipment,
       environmental control units/field deployable environmental control units (ECU/FDECU),
       support equipment, and alarm systems. Emergency power must be provided to ensure
       full mission capabilities and protection of stored blood products.

   2.4.4. AFTH/Joint DMF Dependencies. EBSCs rely on the AFTH/Joint DMF for basic
   hematology, chemistry analysis, and microbiology support. EBSC mission capabilities
   assume that the AFTH/Joint DMF laboratory has adequate space, supplies, and equipment to
   support the increased demand. EBSC team members require access to the AFTH/Joint DMF
   lab to perform quality control measures (e.g., platelet count, pH, and culture) on blood
   platelets. They also need lab access to perform required ABO/Rh testing of collected whole
   blood.

2.5. Expeditionary Frozen Blood Product Team (FBPT). The FBPT provides 24-hour
coverage to support the processing of pre-positioned frozen blood stocks. When liquid RBCs are
unavailable or below minimum advisable inventory levels, the team deglycerolizes FRBCs
stockpiled for mass casualty situations to remove the cryoprotectant. Special care is taken to
ensure optimal RBC recovery.
2.5.1. Mission/Tasks. The FBPT is responsible for receiving, thawing, washing,
deglycerolizing, re-icing, managing, and distributing pre-positioned frozen blood products.
They can deglycerolize up to 24 units of FRBCs in a 24-hour period (one unit every two
hours with two machines operating). These frozen stockpiles are good for 14 days and
provide the initial liquid blood units needed to sustain the collocated MTFs until the liquid
pipeline is fully operational.

2.5.2. FBPT (UTC FFBD1) Manpower. FBPT personnel are assigned to a unit that has AS
893F. The medical laboratory craftsman (4T071) is the team chief and functions under the
direction of the officer in charge of the in-place facility. Other personnel include medical
laboratory, medical materiel, and medical administrative personnel. All FBPT members are
responsible for the full scope of team activities as directed by the team chief.

AFSC 4T090 or above is the only authorized substitute for 4T071 (lower-level grade/skill
substitutions not allowed). Any 4XXXX AFSC may substitute for AFSC 4A051. No AFSC
substitutions are authorized for AFSC 4A151. Other skill-level substitutions are authorized
IAW AFI 10-403.

2.5.3. Capabilities. FBPT personnel deploy only to in-place facilities and, therefore, are
capable of fully performing their mission once in place. The AS includes sufficient
equipment and supplies to thaw or deglycerize 200 units of FRBCs with a maximum
throughput of 24 units per day.
                                         CHAPTER 3

                                       OPERATIONS


3.1. Deployment. The EBTC and EBSC are deployable war reserve materiel (WRM) assets.
These teams are deployed to provide advanced blood collection, preparation, storage, and
shipment support. The teams can be deployed to assist other Air Force medical deployed UTCs.
They may also be deployed to augment other theater teams to support joint force operations. The
teams deploy with their equipment packages, which can be assembled within 8 hours by as few
as 4 medical personnel. The teams rely on expeditionary combat support (ECS) for transporting
equipment and for other goods and services required to sustain operations. See Chapter 7 of this
AFTTP for more information about ECS requirements. See Chapter 10 of this AFTTP for more
information about equipment and supplies.

   3.1.1. Cargo Processing. The processing of deploying cargo begins immediately after a unit
   is tasked for deployment (notification stage) and continues until the cargo arrives at the
   deployed destination. The Deployment Control Center will publish a cargo processing
   schedule, which details the unit’s deployment process and critical deployment actions
   required to meet movement departure times. Each deploying unit should have a currently
   certified hazardous cargo courier.

   3.1.2. Equipment Preparation. When notified of a deployment tasking, equipment and
   supplies must be readied for transport. Units should have checklists or flowcharts to ensure
   that proper procedures are followed. Equipment mobility paperwork packages contain load
   and packing lists, hazardous materials declarations, and hazardous cargo placards IAW AFI
   10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution.

   3.1.3. Weapons Courier Requirements. Each UTC should have a currently certified
   weapons courier to accompany all shipments of weapons. Couriers must be fully
   knowledgeable of all aspects of weapons control and trained IAW DOD 5100.76-M, Physical
   Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunitions, and Explosives.

   3.1.4. Collective Protection (CP). If deploying to an area with a high chemical, biological,
   radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat, the EBTC and EBSC may deploy with FFCPS,
   Collective Protection Medical Tent. FFCPS provides the equipment and supplies needed to
   collectively protect one shelter and maintain operations for a maximum of 72 hours. See the
   Operation and Maintenance Manual for the Collectively Protected Expeditionary Medical
   Support/Air Force Theater Hospital (CP EMEDS) for more information. See AFMAN 10-
   2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
   Explosive (CBRNE) Environment, for more information on operating in a CBRN
   environment.

3.2. BDC Employment. The BDC is normally employed in conjunction with a fixed MTF and
serves as the primary collection facility for PRBC, FFP, CRYO, PF24, and FRBC. The BDC
ships blood and blood components to the ASWBPLs IAW the quotas established by the ASBPO,
COCOM JBPO, and AJBPO.

3.3. ASWBPL Employment. The ASWBPLs are CONUS-based facilities that provide
intermediate storage and shipment of blood products as designated by the ASBPO. The Air
Force is responsible for maintaining full-time peacetime operation and for providing
administrative support during peacetime and contingencies. The ASWBPLs are located near
major military air terminals to facilitate blood shipments worldwide. The ASWBPLs are capable
of expanding operations to meet blood support requirements as necessary.

3.4. EBTC Employment. The EBTC is normally employed in conjunction with an
EMEDS/DMF at an aerial port of debarkation and is available to support military contingency
operations. The EBTC is responsible for receiving blood products from the ASWBPLs, blood
product depot, or another EBTC. The EBTC receives, stores, inventories, and ships blood
products as requested by area BSDs. Real-time blood inventory management is vital. Proper
rotation of blood components ensures the best end dates going into the AOR. The EBTC also
issues blood products to designated BSDs based on daily allocations established by the
JBPO/AJBPO.

   3.4.1. Personnel UTCs (FFBP1, 2, 3) support expeditionary and fixed-site BTCs.

   3.4.2. ECS is required to connect this system to the base infrastructure. The EBTC team
   chief or designate should establish contact with ECS elements as soon as possible to ensure
   base services are provided. See Chapter 7 of this AFTTP for more information about ECS.

   3.4.3. EBTC personnel must initiate contact with the JBPO/AJBPO, Air Tactical Operations
   Center (ATOC), and the Joint Movement Center (JMC) to establish and coordinate the
   Department of Defense Activity Address Codes (DODAAC), Transportation Account Codes
   (TAC), and movement requirements.

3.5. EBTC Site Planning. EBTC staff and other medical personnel are responsible for erecting
the EBTC at the operating location. Optimal requirements for an EBTC site include a 100 x 100-
foot graded pad near the DMF. EBTC site requirements should be considered during the
installation’s bed-down planning.

   3.5.1. Tent Assembly. The EBTC is equipped with special flooring. Ensure this flooring is
   installed before installing equipment. See Attachment 4 for tent layout information.

   3.5.2. Ice Machine Assembly. Instructions for ice machine assembly are available on the
   ACC MEFPAK Playbook under FFBE1.

3.6. EBSC Employment. The EBSC is a deployable laboratory team that provides expanded
blood component collection and preparation capabilities to support casualty trauma treatment.
The team must be attached to an AFTH or equivalent Joint DMF.
   3.6.1. EBSC staff and other medical personnel are responsible for erecting the EBSC at the
   operating location. EBSC site requirements should be considered during bed-down planning.

   3.6.2. ECS is required to connect this system to the base infrastructure. The EBSC team
   chief or designate should establish contact with ECS elements as soon as possible to ensure
   base services are provided. See Chapter 7 of this AFTTP for more information about ECS.

3.7. FBPT Employment. The FBPT provides support and sustainment to in-place frozen blood
sites. FBPT personnel are only assigned to units that have AS 893F equipment packages in
place.

3.8. Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures. An effective QA program is essential for the
EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT to ensure blood products remain viable. Units should develop
operating instructions (OIs) to ensure compliance with AFI 44-118, Operational Procedures for
the Armed Services Blood Program Elements, JBPO/AJBPO, and local requirements. OIs
should cover, at a minimum, the receipt, storage, inventory, and shipment of blood and blood
products and the collection and first release of platelets and whole blood. Example OIs are
available for download on the ACC MEFPAK Playbook.
                                         CHAPTER 4

                     COMMAND AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS


4.1. Operational, Tactical, and Administrative Control of Medical Teams. In accordance
with AFDD 2, Operations and Organization, the supported Commander, Air Force Forces
(COMAFFOR) retains OPCON of assigned and attached Air Force forces, including Air Force
medical assets. When supporting Air Force operations, OPCON is normally exercised through
the Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) chain of command so that expeditionary
teams operate under the local direction of the deployed expeditionary unit commander (usually
the EMEDS or AFTH commander) to which they are attached. During day-to-day operations,
EBTC, EBSC, and FBTP personnel usually fall under the biomedical laboratory function’s chain
of command.

4.2. Roles and Responsibilities. The COCOM JBPO/AJBPO provides OPCON over the EBTC
mission, and the DMF commander has administrative control (ADCON). The EBSC is under the
OPCON and ADCON of the AFTH commander. FBPT personnel are under the OPCON and
ADCON of the commander at the fixed medical facility. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT team
chiefs will supervise operations and ensure that all personnel assigned are thoroughly familiar
with their responsibilities and adequately trained to perform their missions.

4.3. Team Chiefs. The EBTC team chief is the biomedical laboratory officer (043T3A). The
EBSC team chief is the biomedical laboratory – blood bank officer (043T3E). The FBPT team
chief is the senior medical laboratory craftsman (4T071). Each team chief is responsible for the
following duties:

   4.3.1. Ensure training is accomplished as required (see Chapter 9).

   4.3.2. Directly supervise the team’s operations.

   4.3.3. Identify manning and equipment shortfalls and other limiting factors to the deployed
   medical commander for resolution.

   4.3.4. Secure ECS for the team through the MTF or directly as needed.

   4.3.5. Prepare and submit operational reports to the supporting command and the
   JBPO/AJBPO.

4.4. Joint Operations. In joint operations, where an EBTC, EBSC, or FBPT team supports a
unit from another service, the COMAFFOR retains ADCON and is usually delegated tactical
control (TACON) by the JTF commander. The COMAFFOR normally exercises these
authorities through an air expeditionary unit (usually an Expeditionary Medical Group [EMDG])
in a direct support relationship.
4.5. Operation Plan (OPLAN)-Specific Command Relationships. Command arrangements
for individual units employed in support of contingency operations will be outlined in the
respective supporting OPLANs and execution orders and will be specific to the operation and
theater supported.

4.6. Reporting Requirements. The JBPO has established standardized blood reporting
requirements to effectively manage blood and blood products, project blood requirements,
request blood, report blood inventories, and provide information on the overall blood element
operations of all the service components. The JBPO determines the format, reporting frequency,
and transmission methods for these reports. See JP 4-02, Health Service Support, for more
information and report samples.

4.7. Team-Specific Reporting Requirements. EBSC personnel will report the number,
sources, and types of blood components collected and tested, as well as potential mission
implications, to the senior laboratory officer, attending physician, and other appropriate agencies.
Blood component inventory, capability, and requirements must be reported to the corresponding
theater JBPO. Additional coordination may be required with theater BSDs and EBTCs.
                                         CHAPTER 5

                                      INTELLIGENCE


5.1. Briefing Requirements. Accurate medical intelligence is critical to threat identification
and the application of appropriate preventive medicine. Before deployment, units, groups, and
individuals tasked to support an operation must receive deployment briefings IAW AFI 41-106,
Medical Readiness Program Management, and AFI 10-402V1, Mobilization Planning and
Personnel Readiness. During the employment stage of an operation, deployed personnel require
periodic briefings for their location and for areas they transit during medical operations.

5.2. Intelligence Collection. The public health officer normally serves as the medical
intelligence officer (MIO) for EMEDS/AFTH facilities. The MIO is responsible for collecting
and disseminating medical intelligence as appropriate and recommending courses of action to
leadership. The MIO relies on multiple information sources for medical intelligence, including
the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) and line intelligence personnel.

5.3. Dissemination of Medical Intelligence. Medical intelligence is disseminated to all
assigned units and personnel as prescribed by the COMAFFOR, Air Force Forces Surgeon
(AFFOR/SG), or installation commander’s policy. Wing and group commanders, IAW
operational directives, coordinate the communication of medical intelligence with other base
units, including the DMF.
                                         CHAPTER 6

           COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUPPORT


6.1. Communication Requirements. Communication links between supported units and
EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT operations are vital to overall mission success. Communications
within the blood distribution system will use standard ASBPO-approved Joint Interoperability of
Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTCCS). Due to the critical nature of blood product
requests, communication through command channels should be minimized. Direct
communication with the blood teams, coordination of communications with the AJBPO, and
informational communication with command and control elements is imperative.

6.2. Organic Communications Equipment. Communications systems are required for internal
communication within the AFTH/DMF and to link the AFTH/DMF to base communications, on-
call personnel, and satellite functions. Support for the blood teams will be identified and
coordinated with the assigned AFTH/DMF. The AFTH/DMF is equipped with organic
communications equipment (non-tactical radios). ECS is required for telephones and computer
network support. See Attachment 2 for more information about the organic communications
equipment issued to each UTC.

6.3. Computer Software Specifications. Laptop computers issued to the blood teams include
the DOD Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) and the Theater Medical Information Program
Air Force (TMIP-AF) package. TMIP-AF is an integrated software suite that includes mission-
essential medical software applications. See Attachment 3 for more information about the
required computer configuration and software specifications for each UTC.

   6.3.1. Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC). The SDC includes the Microsoft
   Windows operating system and the following administrative software:

          Adobe Acrobat Reader

          Internet Explorer
          Microsoft Office Suite
          WinZip

   6.3.2. Theater Medical Information Program Air Force (TMIP-AF). TMIP-AF includes
   the following applications:

       6.3.2.1. Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)
       Mobile. AHLTA is an enterprise-wide medical and dental clinical information system
       that provides secure online access to longitudinal health records. AHLTA Mobile is a
       handheld device that lets first responders immediately document injury, illness, and care
       and store medical data until it can be transferred to AHLTA Theater.
6.3.2.2. AHLTA Theater. AHLTA Theater extends AHLTA’s sustaining-base
electronic medical record capability to the theater of operation. It lets healthcare
providers document care, order laboratory services such as blood work, x-rays, and
medications, and store medical data until communications are available to send the data
to the Theater Medical Data Store and Clinical Data Repository.

6.3.2.3. Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS). DMLSS is an
automated and integrated information system that standardizes medical logistics
management across the military services. It provides a comprehensive range of medical
materiel, equipment, WRM, and facilities management functions.

6.3.2.4. Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System
(DOEHRS). DOEHRS is a web portal that provides access to exposure-based
environmental surveillance data for the industrial health, environmental health, and
hearing conservation communities. It provides support for capturing, analyzing, and
maintaining data on environmental and occupational hazards, tracking long-term
exposures, and reducing worksite hazards.

6.3.2.5. Joint Medical Analysis Tool (JMAT). JMAT provides joint medical planners
and decision-makers an automated tool for deliberate and crisis action planning. It
supports the calculation and generation of theater medical requirements, scenario
development for course-of-action analysis, and risk assessment for planning the
allocation of critical medical resources.

6.3.2.6. Joint Medical Workstation (JMeWS). JMeWS provides medical situational
awareness, medical surveillance, and force health decision support. It reports on medical
trends, analyzes the overall status of theater health, and shares medical intelligence with
the Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and Global Command and Control System
(GCCS).

6.3.2.7. Patient Movement Items Tracking System (PMITS). PMITS is a DOD
Military Health System application that electronically tracks the location and operational
status of the medical equipment needed to support patients during aeromedical
evacuations.

6.3.2.8. Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS). TMDS is the authoritative theater
database for collecting, distributing, and viewing service members’ pertinent medical
information. It updates the clinical data repository (CDR) where all service members’
electronic health records (EHRs) reside and lets users view, track, and disposition
patients through all levels of care.

6.3.2.9. TMIP Composite Health Care System (CHCS) Cache (TC2). TC2 lets
military health care providers document inpatient healthcare, order ancillary services
(such as laboratory, pharmacy, and radiology), and schedule outpatient clinic and
radiology procedures in theater.
   6.3.4. Specialty-Specific Clinical Applications. In addition to the medical applications
   included in TMIP-AF, blood teams may have access to the following specialty-specific
   applications.

       6.3.4.1. Defense Blood Standard System (DBSS). DBSS automates the standards and
       safeguards of the blood supply for the DOD Military Health System. It collects,
       processes, and tracks blood product inventory information, provides automated support
       for remote blood collections, and regulates blood product safety transfusion practices.

       6.3.4.2. Theater Medical Data Store (TMDS) Blood Management Module. The
       Blood Management Module of TMDS (also called the electronic mother of all
       spreadsheets [eMOAS]) is the designated computerized blood management system of
       record and will link the EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT with the worldwide distribution
       network. Units should outline in their OIs the procedures to follow when access to this
       module is not available.

6.4. Computer Security (COMPUSEC). COMPUSEC requirements are IAW AFI 33-200,

Force Privacy Program.

6.5. Secure/Non-Secure Communications. Classified information must be protected IAW
DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program. All classified information must be transmitted
by secure means. Situation reports (SITREPs), medical surveillance, site locations, and
compiled patient data are all examples of information that can be classified and need
safeguarding. Medical or casualty information becomes an operations security (OPSEC) issue
when linked to a particular military mission or operation. While medical information itself is not
normally classified in the context of a mission, it should be protected as part of the combatant
commander’s overall OPSEC program to deny information to the enemy.
                                         CHAPTER 7

                       INTEGRATION AND INTEROPERABILITY


7.1. In-Theater Integration and Interoperability. Medical deployed assets in a theater or area
of operation integrate and operate with the line elements of an Air Expeditionary Force (AEF),
components of the aeromedical evacuation system, joint medical counterparts, Special
Operations Forces (SOF) medical components, and other federal and civilian support systems.
In some instances, theater planners may request a DMF to support Army or SOF bed-down
locations not associated with typical AEF or ECS infrastructure. Logistical coordination,
integration with other medical assets, and an understanding of command and control
relationships are essential for a seamless casualty care continuum.

7.2. Medical Facility Integration and Interoperability. EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT personnel
augment existing capabilities within the medical facility and are not stand-alone. They must be
attached to a fixed or field medical facility (EMEDS/AFTH or other similar DMF) that has the
capability to support biomedical laboratory functions. Access to basic hematology, chemistry
analysis, and microbiology are required. The EBTC and EBSC teams deploy with an initial 30-
day supply of equipment and supplies, but for sustained deployments, they rely on the medical
facility’s logistics system for resupply. See Chapter 10 for more information.

7.3. ECS Requirements. Integration with line counterparts is particularly critical for ECS.
During deployments, ECS requirements for the EBTC and EBSC include but are not limited to
contract support for dry-ice supply and blood product disposal; messing and other consumable
materials; water; wet-ice; fuels; billeting; latrines; showers; laundry; waste management
(including hazardous and biomedical waste); transportation (to include equipment transport and
express specimen transport); non-medical equipment maintenance; general supplies; contracting;
information and communications systems support; and security. ECS should be arranged before
deployment by the COCOM planners, air component command planners, and JBPO/AJBPO.
See Attachment 2 for more information about ECS requirements.
                                          CHAPTER 8

                                           SECURITY


8.1. Security Responsibilities. Medical personnel and equipment are non-combatant assets as
defined by the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). Medical personnel
are authorized arms IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.
Security within the immediate area for patients, blood donors, and personnel at each deployed
medical site, with the exception of enemy prisoner of war (EPW) patients, is a medical
responsibility. In most deployment scenarios, the EBTC and EBSC deploy to secure locations.
Current threat assessments provided by the combatant commander and local threat conditions
established by the Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) commander dictate all local security
measures. As part of the AFTH/DMF, blood team personnel are required to provide site security
within the immediate area of their facilities. Protection of blood donors, patients, and personnel
is the responsibility of the AFTH/DMF commander.

8.2. Physical Security. Medical assets (personnel, equipment, and supplies) are protected in
accordance with AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense. Personnel are responsible for following all
personal protective measures as outlined in AFI 31-101, AOR security briefings, established
force protection requirements, and other guidance. All personnel should attend security and
terrorism response training. The AFTH/DMF commander and security forces provide technical
advice and recommendations on physical plant protection issues for the deployed EBTC and
EBSC.

8.3. Operations Security (OPSEC). To prevent an adversary from gaining a military
advantage, all staff must control mission critical information from inadvertent disclosure. All
staff should be aware of how to protect critical information that may be of intelligence value to
an adversary. Additionally, staff must understand what information is critical, how to protect it,
from whom to protect it, and for how long to protect it.

8.4. Security of Weapons and Ammunition. All members must comply with AFI 31-207,
AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, and local procedures when securing
weapons and ammunition. Personnel, other than security forces responding to a request for
assistance, should not be allowed to enter the medical facility with a loaded weapon.

   8.4.1. Staff Weapons. Normally, base security forces provide guidance and an armory to
   ensure the safe storage of the medical facility staff’s weapons and ammunition. However,
   medical personnel maintain issued weapons and ammunition when authorized by the
   AFTH/DMF commander at the direction of the AEW/Air Expeditionary Group (AEG)
   commander and IAW the LOAC and the Geneva Conventions.
8.4.2. Donor Weapons. Weapons and ammunition belonging to blood donors should be
transferred immediately to a member of the donor’s unit. When not possible, the medical
facility may temporarily store the weapons until the donor’s unit or AEW/AEG armory can
accept responsibility. Weapons must be properly cleared and secured in a locked container,
if possible.
                                          CHAPTER 9

                                          TRAINING


9.1. General Training Requirements. Personnel training must be accomplished IAW AFI 41-
106. Unit/team integrity should be maintained to the maximum extent possible. Ideally,
personnel who deploy together should train together before deployment.

9.2. Expeditionary Training Requirements for Ground-based UTCs. All personnel assigned
to deployable ground-based UTCs must meet the requirements in AFI 41-106, Attachment 3,
Medical Readiness Training (MRT) Matrix.

9.3. Readiness Skills Verification Program (RSVP). The RSVP is the readiness portion of
AFSC-specific sustainment training and applies to all individuals who hold a medical AFSC.
The RSVP documents an individual’s ability to perform required duties in support of military
operations and training events for enhancing and maintaining operational skills. This training
can include formal courses (i.e., Advanced Trauma Life Support [ATLS], Advanced Cardiac
Life Support [ACLS], Trauma Nursing Course, Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness
Skills [C-STARS]), as well as exercises. RSVP knowledge and performance items, along with
associated training sources, are listed on RSVP checklists, which are accessible in the Medical
Readiness Decision Support System Unit Level Training Readiness Application (MRDSS
ULTRA). Personnel will document completion of RSVP requirements in MRDSS ULTRA IAW
the guidance in AFI 41-106.

9.4. UTC Team Chief Training Responsibilities. UTC team chiefs must ensure that team
members receive the training required to be mission ready and maintain proficiency standards
IAW AFI 41-106. They ensure that this training is documented in MRDSS ULTRA. Team
chiefs conduct team training when required; establish a mechanism to identify individuals who
require make-up training; and ensure make-up training is conducted within the timeframe
established by the unit commander. Team chiefs maintain contact information for their team
members and must be familiar with local deployment recall procedures.

9.5. Formal Training. The formal training course for EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT personnel will
be conducted at an Air Force-designated training facility. The goal is for all personnel initially
assigned to an EBTC, EBSC, or FBPT UTC to attend the in-residence course before deploying.
Until a formal training course is developed, personnel should have a minimum of 30 days
experience (preferably deployed) performing their associated duties with the same team they are
tasked for. Ideally, formal training should occur between 60 to 90 days before deployment.
IAW AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, during the 60-90 days before
deployment, units should focus on specific deployment preparation activities and AOR-specific
events, if known. Air Reserve Component (ARC) UTCs not apportioned in an AEF will meet
formal UTC training requirements IAW AFI 41-106. When ARC personnel are unable to attend
formal training with their assigned units as a complete unit, they should attend training with
other units.
9.6. Cross Functionality. Assigned personnel must be able to adapt to changing training
requirements to meet the needs of the mission. Training to enhance multi- and cross-
functionality between AFSCs is encouraged; however, any training on tasks that are clearly
beyond the scope of practice of any enlisted medical AFSC, as listed in the Career Field
Education and Training Plan (CFETP), must have a scope of practice waiver submitted to the
appropriate major command surgeon (MAJCOM/SG).

9.7. Field Training. Field training, such as Operational Readiness Exercises (OREs), local
exercises, and joint exercises, gives EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT personnel an opportunity to
reinforce the skills learned during formal training. The ability to operate various vehicles (i.e.,
forklifts) requires qualification training. Any Air Force personnel, officer or enlisted, may train
for a vehicle license. Upon completion of EBTC, EBSC, or FBPT field training, each member is
issued an AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or equivalent to
document all training received.

9.8. UTC Sustainment Training. Sustainment training involves team training in the skills and
knowledge that a UTC must possess to fulfill MISCAP responsibilities. Sustainment training
should occur IAW AFI 41-106, Attachment 3. Sustainment training is expected throughout each
training cycle. Involvement of other medical and various support organizations should be
encouraged, as this enhances the value of training. Training exercises are intended to consider
the deployment, operational support, and supply aspects of a military contingency. It is the
responsibility of the unit to allocate funds for the activation.

9.9. CBRNE Defense Training (CBRNEDT). All EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT personnel will
receive CBRNEDT training IAW AFI 41-106 and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. All personnel should be familiar with
the concepts of the Air Force Counter-Chemical Warfare CONOPS as outlined in AFMAN 10-
2503.

9.10. Recommended UTC-Specific Training. Team training must be performed at an Air
Force-designated training center before deployment to give the team a theoretical and operational
understanding of the blood support mission. The team may also train AFTH/DMF staff to assist
in blood component collection and preparation as needed.

   9.10.1. Skills-Related Training. Skills-related training must include but is not limited to
   the following areas:

       9.10.1.1. APLT collection, whole blood collection, and FRBC deglycerolization.

       9.10.1.2. Technical, operational, troubleshooting, maintenance, and assembly/reassembly
       of collection and deglycerolization equipment.

       9.10.1.3. Allogeneic donor selection and blood collection.

       9.10.1.4. Computer-based training (CBT) on proper blood shipments, the Blood
       Management Module in TMDS, and Expeditionary Medical Logistics (EML) as needed.
   9.10.1.5. Review and implementation of new AFBPO, ASBPO, JPBO, and AJBPO
   training materials, policies, and procedures.

   9.10.1.6. Documentation acquisition, preparation, review, and submissions (DD Form
   1502, Frozen Medical Materiel Shipment; DD Form 1502-1, Chilled Medical Materiel
   Shipment; DD Form 573, Shipping Inventory of Blood Products; other applicable forms;
   blood inventory reports; etc.).

   9.10.1.7. Blood receipt (product-specific temperature, appearance, condition
   requirements).

   9.10.1.8. Blood product reicing.

   9.10.1.9. Quality control.

9.10.2. Additional Training. Personnel should receive hands-on training in the following
areas:

   9.10.2.1. Pallet build-up and inspection.

   9.10.2.2. Forklift operation.

   9.10.2.3. Vehicle acquisition (motor pool/transportation).

   9.10.2.4. Secure and non-secure communications (secret internet protocol router network
   [SIPRNET], non-secure internet protocol router network [NIPRNET], email, etc.).

   9.10.2.5. DODAACs used for ordering supplies and services through the supporting
   medical logistics account.

   9.10.2.6. TACs used for shipping supplies and blood products.

   9.10.2.7. Facility setup and shelter management.
                                       CHAPTER 10

                                        LOGISTICS


10.1. Operational Availability. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT must maintain a total materiel
availability percentage (MAP) of 95 percent and a critical equipment MAP of 100 percent to be
fully functional. Warehoused EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT equipment requires annual preventive
maintenance during storage. Routine preventive and corrective maintenance will be performed
by medical equipment repair activities assigned to the designated WRM account. Required
maintenance is identified by the device codes assigned to the equipment National Stock Numbers
(NSN).

10.2. Logistics Supportability and Readiness. EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT rely on the
AFTH/DMF to which they are assigned for consumable supplies. A separate Responsibility
Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) code for the EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT must be established for
funding purposes.

10.3. Supplies and Equipment. Each team’s necessary medical supplies and equipment are
documented in its AS. UTC team chiefs should contact their Medical Logistics Office for
assistance in reviewing their AS. Table 10.1 lists the equipment package UTCs and
corresponding AS for the EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT.

Table 10.1. Equipment UTCs and Allowance Standards

Mod 3

   10.3.1. Equipment Packages. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT equipment packages contain
   commonly used medical equipment and enough consumable supplies for 30-day operation
   before requiring resupply. The EBSC and FBPT equipment packages also contain specially
   developed medical equipment regulated by the FDA for screening donors, deglycerolizing
   FRBCs, and collecting platelets and whole blood. Consumable items for the blood team
   UTCs are, to the extent possible, standard DOD inventory items. EBSC and FBPT
   equipment can be considered joint-use assets when a memorandum of agreement (MOA)
   appropriately documents use and responsibilities. EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT equipment is
   classified as WRM. See AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics Support, Chapter 13, for guidance on
   WRM assets and their use.

   10.3.2. Initial Response Supplies. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT equipment sets contain no
   blood products. Once the EBTC and FBPT systems are online, they will require initial and
   ongoing blood product supplies to maintain capability. Additional equipment and general
   supplies are provided by the supporting medical unit.

   10.3.3. Resupply. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT should coordinate resupply through the
   Medical Logistics function at their assigned medical facility. Personnel who are deployed in
   support of regional plans and are not attached to an AFTH/EMEDS require self sustainment
   through the DMLSS or reachback process. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT must eventually be
   aligned with the host medical supply account established to support the AOR. When
   established, the DMLSS will be used. Medical logistics personnel should establish liaison as
   soon as possible, provide a list of items that require routine resupply, and establish a supply
   accounting system. The Air Force Medical Logistics Operations Center (AFMLOC) can
   provide assistance in establishing the DODAACs used for supplies and services and TACs
   used to ship blood products. In those limited operations where a single MAJCOM provides
   all or nearly all of the deploying Air Force forces, that MAJCOM must be prepared to
   coordinate, arrange, and provide logistics resupply.

   10.3.4. Standard Forms. Personnel do not deploy with the forms needed to ship and store
   blood products. The team chiefs will hand-carry all required forms. Team chiefs should
   contact the COCOM JBPO to coordinate the establishment of an International Council for
   Commonality in Blood Banking (ICCBBA) account to obtain blood labels.

10.4. Reagent Special Handling Requirements. The EBSC and FBPT UTC team chiefs
should coordinate with the BSD or EBTC on the shipment and packing of reagents that require
special handling (e.g., frozen storage). The UTC team chiefs should ensure sufficient volume
and reagent types are available and should contact the designated reagent repository once
mission needs are determined.

10.5. Transportation Support. Transportation and other resources are required on site,
especially during deployment and redeployment phases. The EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT do not
have their own transportation capabilities. ECS is required for transporting personnel and
equipment and for moving pallets of blood to and from the deployed site. A 10K all-terrain
forklift is required to set up the EBTC and EBSC at the deployed site. If the EBTC is not
collocated with an EMEDS/DMF unit, a dedicated vehicle is required for the transport of blood
products.

10.6. Equipment Maintenance and Repair. Deployed civil engineers are responsible for the
maintenance of major equipment (e.g., generators and ECUs) while the EBTC and EBSC are
deployed, per established MOAs. Other equipment maintenance and repair are handled by the
biomedical equipment technicians deployed with the AFTH/DMF.
10.7. Electric Power and Water. EBTC, EBSC, and FBPT equipment is designed to interface
with commercial, fixed installation, bare base, and tactical electric utility systems. EBTC and
EBSC operators should coordinate as soon as possible with the deployed base civil engineer or
bare base civil engineering commander to interface the EBTC and EBSC with base or civilian
power and water systems. MOAs are required and must be established immediately upon arrival
of the deployed EBTC and EBSC personnel.

10.8. Storage Requirements. The EBTC and EBSC equipment package is stored in a ready
mode for rapid deployment. EBSC and FBPT equipment should be stored in a central location
so that it can be quickly accessed during stressed times of blood bank inventory. All supplies
and equipment must be stored in a covered area with temperature and humidity control.
