         REQUESTING AND PERFORMING STUDIES INVOLVING X-RAYS

2.1. Qualifications to Request X-Ray Examinations.
   2.1.1. Requests for imaging examinations (orders) involving the use of x-rays shall be made
   only by physicians or other medical practitioners who are licensed in the United States or one
   of its territories or possessions. Properly trained individuals such as physician assistants and
   persons in postgraduate medical training status do not have to meet the above requirements,
   but must be under the general supervision of a licensed physician who does.
   2.1.2. In addition to the privileges for which broad qualifications are needed, there are a
   number of specialties which require only limited types of x-ray examinations. For example,
   Doctors of Dental Surgery or Dental Medicine may request appropriate examinations of the
   head, neck, and chest, although such requests are normally confined to the oral region.
   2.1.3. Variances to the above qualification requirements should occur only for emergency or
   life-threatening situations, such as natural disasters.
2.2. Qualifications for Performing and Supervising Studies.
   2.2.1. Responsible use of medical and dental x-ray equipment involves restricting its
   operation to properly qualified and supervised individuals.
      2.2.1.1. Radiological Medical Practitioner is a health professional, with education and
      specialist training in the medical uses of radiation, who is competent to independently
      perform or oversee procedures involving medical exposure in a given specialty. Within
      the Radiology department, this individual is typically a radiologist. Other individuals
      who use ionizing radiation for imaging, usually outside the Radiology department (e.g.,
      fluoroscopy in the operating room), are also considered Radiological Medical
      Practitioners. These individuals, when acting as a Radiological Medical Practitioner,
      have the same responsibilities for imaging protocols and for supervising equipment
      operation that would otherwise be assigned to a radiologist.
      2.2.1.2. Radiologist is a licensed physician who is certified in Radiology or Diagnostic
      Radiology by the American Board of Radiology or the American Osteopathic Board of
      Radiology, or has completed a diagnostic radiology residency program approved by the
      Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or the American Osteopathic
      Association. Within the Radiology department, the radiologist generally serves as the
      Radiological Medical Practitioner.
          2.2.1.2.1. In addition to interpreting imaging studies, radiologists set protocols for
          examinations involving x-ray systems and play a critical role in the performance of
          studies. Radiologists are a source of knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages
          of different imaging modalities and should be consulted when that expertise is
          needed.
      2.2.1.3. Radiological Dental Practioner is a health professional, with education and
      specialist training in the dental uses of radiation, who is competent to independently
      perform or oversee procedures involving dental exposure in a given specialty.
10                                                          59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


        2.2.1.3.1. Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist is a dentist specialized in the
        acquisition and interpretation of radiographic imaging studies performed for
        diagnosis of treatment guidance for conditions affecting the maxillofacial region.
        Specialization in OMR requires the completion of residency in an American Dental
        Association CODA accredited program. Training includes a thorough knowledge on
        techniques and interpretation for maxillofacial CT, CBCT, Magnetic Resonance
        Imaging (MRI), ultrasound and other pertinent modalities. OMRs may be further
        qualified by passing the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology exam.
     2.2.1.4. Diagnostic Radiologic Technologist (DRT) are the personnel who operate the
     imaging equipment, deliver the radiation to the patients and capture the diagnostic
     images. Operator competence is normally achieved by successful completion of a
     training program which provides both a didactic base and sufficient practical experience.
     The training program should be accredited by a mechanism acceptable to the American
     Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).
        2.2.1.4.1. The radiologic technologist must be familiar with and facile at utilizing the
        imaging systems and the techniques and technology available to them to reduce
        patient radiation dose while producing clinically diagnostic images. As a critical part
        of the healthcare team, they should be empowered to question techniques and
        requests when alternatives which would deliver lower doses are available.
        2.2.1.4.2. Technologists in training may utilize equipment only while under the
        supervision of a registered technologist or military radiology technologist with
        equivalent training.
     2.2.1.5. Dental Technicians that operator radiographic equipment must receive
     appropriate education and training in the areas of anatomy, physics, technique and
     principles of radiographic exposure, radiation protection, radiographic positioning, and
     image processing that are relevant to dental imaging. Proficiency can be demonstrated by
     award of the AFSC 4Y0X1, Skill Level 3 or satisfying existing state certification
     programs for dental auxiliaries.

             TECHNICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING

3.1. Quality Assurance Program.
   3.1.1. Each workplace performing medical or dental imaging with radiation must establish in
   writing and implement a technical quality assurance program. The program shall include all
   aspects of the imaging process from image acquisition through image display.
3.2. Testing By a Qualified Medical Physicist.
   3.2.1. A medical physicist may be considered a qualified expert when they are board
   certified or have had modality specific training and performed three surveys within the past
   36 months for a particular type of equipment under the supervision of a board certified
   medical physicist.
   3.2.2. The technical quality assurance program shall include testing by a qualified diagnostic
   medical physicist of all imaging equipment producing radiation (both medical and dental).
   The equipment shall be tested after installation but before first clinical use, annually
   thereafter, and after each repair or modification that may affect patient dose or image quality.
   Testing after repair or modification must be performed before clinical use of the equipment.
   The testing should include:

(a) Testing following repairs or modifications may be limited to features and parameters that
would be affected by the repairs or modification.
(b) Determine accuracy of detector exposure indices according to American Association of
Physicist in Medicine (AAPM) TG116 methodology (AAPM 2009) and manufacturer’s
recommendations if available.
(c) The review of CT protocols should be performed together by the radiologist, CT
technologist/technician, and medical physicist. Consider staggering annual reviews throughout
the year to maintain momentum without impacting schedules.
   3.2.3. The qualified diagnostic medical physicist may be assisted by other properly trained
   persons in obtaining test data for performance monitoring. These persons must be trained by
   the qualified diagnostic medical physicist in the techniques for performing the tests, the
   function and limitations of the imaging equipment and test instruments, the reasons for the
   tests, and the importance of the test results.
   3.2.4. The qualified diagnostic medical physicist must promptly review, interpret, and
   approve all data measurements and test results.
3.3. Diagnostic Reference Levels.
   3.3.1. Diagnostic Reference levels (DRLs) are values used as quality assurance and quality
   improvement tools. DRLs are used to help avoid radiation dose to the patient that does not
   contribute to the medical imaging task and help identify unusually high radiation doses or
   exposure levels. DRLs are a guide to good practice, but are neither dose limits nor thresholds
   that define competent performance of the operator or the equipment.
       3.3.1.1. These levels are based on exposure to a standard phantom or actual patient dose
       metrics for specific procedures measured at a number of representative clinical facilities.
       Reference Levels are set at approximately the 75th percentile (third quartile) of these
       measured data.
       3.3.1.2. When the patient dose metric data is provided by the modality it will be
       collected by each workplace and submitted to Medical Physics. The mean radiation dose
       for the exam will be compared to the reference level for that exam.
       3.3.1.3. If the mean radiation dose exceeds the reference level, equipment and clinical
       practices must be reported to the Clinical Dose sub-committee and be investigated in
       order to reduce radiation doses.
       3.3.1.4. Investigations are also appropriate where local values are substantially below the
       DRLs, as excessively low doses may be associated with poor image quality.
   3.3.2. An achievable dose (AD) is a dose which serves as a goal for optimization efforts.
   This dose is achievable by standard techniques and technologies in widespread use, while
   maintaining clinical image quality adequate for the diagnostic purpose. The achievable dose
   is technically set at the median value of the dose distribution.
   3.3.3. Table 3.2 provides the reference levels and ADs from the National Council for
   Radiation Protection Report 172. This listing is not comprehensive of all examinations but is
   the most complete as of the date of publication.

                                           Chapter 4

                               GUIDANCE BY MODALITY

4.1. Digital Medical Radiography.
   4.1.1. Equipment Considerations.
      4.1.1.1. Digital image receptors facilitate acquiring multiple images, which may
      encourage the acquisition of more images than are clinically necessary and thus
      additional patient dose.
      4.1.1.2. In digital radiography, an excessive exposure decreases statistical noise and will
      likely produce an image that is of higher quality than needed for the clinical task.
      Excessive exposures are especially likely when using manually selected technique factors
      instead of automatic exposure control. This is practice is often referred to as “dose
      creep”.
      4.1.1.3. Since it may not be apparent to either the technologist or the Radiological
      Medical Practitioner that the exposure was excessive, the judicious use of and adherence
      to exam protocols is paramount in limiting excessive patient dose.
   4.1.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.1.2.1. The x-ray system’s exposure indicator provides the capability to monitor the
      exposure to the image receptor from each individual imaging exposure. The exposure
      indicator relates to receptor exposure, and not directly to patient dose.
      4.1.2.2. Radiological Medical Practitioners and qualified medical physicists shall
      establish programs for monitoring indices of exposure to image receptors and target
      exposure index values and respective deviation index ranges by category of examination
      and patient population.
      4.1.2.3. Radiographic technique factors shall be established for common procedures and
      programmed into the x-ray machine or a technique chart should be immediately available
      to the operator.
          4.1.2.3.1. The technique factors for imaging protocols should be optimized for the
          age and size of the patient, and for the imaging task. For pediatric patients the
          operator should determine the need for an anti-scatter grid (if removable) and patient
          immobilization.
      4.1.2.4. Each workplace which produces medical radiographic images must have a
      written policy for the safe use of radiation equipment. This policy must address all
      available types of radiographic equipment, whether fixed or portable. This policy should:
          4.1.2.4.1. Require testing of the radiographic equipment by or under the direction of
          a qualified medical physicist.
          4.1.2.4.2. Require training all persons who operate and direct the operation of
          radiographic equipment.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                       15


          4.1.2.4.3. Specify procedures for the safe use of the equipment, including dose
          management and recordkeeping.
          4.1.2.4.4. Require a clinical quality assurance (QA)/Quality Improvement (QI)
          program for radiography.
      4.1.2.5. Equipment testing for quality assurance should be performed by or under the
      direction of a qualified medical physicist after installation but before first clinical use,
      annually thereafter, and after each repair or modification that may affect patient dose or
      image quality.
      4.1.2.6. The quality assurance measures for Digital Medical Radiography are listed

   4.1.3. Personnel.
       4.1.3.1. Radiological Medical Practitioner.
           4.1.3.1.1. Radiographic equipment will be operated under the general supervision of
           a physician who fulfills the responsibilities of the Radiological Medical Practitioner.
           Depending on the study, the responsible physician may be a radiologist, a surgeon, an
           urologist, or another medical specialist.
           4.1.3.1.2. This individual must be appropriately trained in the imaging modality, be
           familiar with the principles of radiation protection, and have a sufficient
           understanding of the medical imaging modality’s features to determine the
           appropriate protocol to evaluate the patient’s clinical symptoms.
       4.1.3.2. Technologist.
           4.1.3.2.1. The technologist is responsible for using workplace-approved imaging
           protocols and radiation protection measures. Technologists must be trained to
           produce adequate quality radiographic images and to assist in the quality assurance
           program.
           4.1.3.2.2. They should also be able to optimize various technique factors of the x-ray
           equipment to produce an adequate radiographic image at the lowest practicable
           patient dose and to use optimal procedures in working with patients and ancillary
           equipment to reduce to a minimum the number of repeat examinations.
       4.1.3.3. Others.
           4.1.3.3.1. Only personnel with specific, appropriate training will be permitted to
           operate radiation equipment. The use of radiation equipment by other individuals is
           warranted only in an urgent or emergent situation when qualified personnel as
           specified above are not available to perform the examination in a timely fashion.
   4.1.4. Procedures.
       4.1.4.1. A radiological medical practitioner provides general supervision in workplaces
       performing radiography. A board certified radiologist is preferred. It is the responsibility
       of any radiological medical practitioner to identify issues of radiographic image quality.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                       19


      4.1.4.2. X-ray examinations will only be performed in accordance with approved
      imaging protocols. The technologist will not perform any examination which has not
      been requested by an authorized person.
      4.1.4.3. Collimation restricts the useful beam to the clinical area of interest. Collimation
      to exclude body areas not being examined should be used to minimize unnecessary
      exposure. Masking will not be a substitute for proper collimation. Masking shall not be
      used when it covers any part of the anatomy that has been exposed to radiation.
      4.1.4.4. If it does not interfere with the examination, use leaded aprons or other shields to
      protect those parts of the patient that are particularly radiosensitive (e.g. gonads, breasts,
      etc.) and are within the primary beam. When shielding is used, an automatic exposure
      control sensor should be selected that is not within the shadow of the shield, or manual
      exposure control should be used.
      4.1.4.5. A written outline containing the minimum number of views to be obtained and
      the equipment to be used for each requested examination must be made available to each
      Radiological Medical Practitioner and equipment operator in every radiology workplace.
      Beyond the specified minimum views, the examination should be individualized
      according to a patient's needs.
      4.1.4.6. The outline of procedures should indicate who may authorize deviations from
      the standard set of views for any examination. The necessity of additional views, such as
      comparison views, shall only be determined by the Radiological Medical Practitioner.
4.2. Fluoroscopy.
   4.2.1. Equipment Considerations.
      4.2.1.1. Some fluoroscopic procedures can deliver a large radiation dose to the patient,
      even when used properly.
      4.2.1.2. Fluoroscopic procedures which have the potential to deliver an air kerma
      radiation dose at the interventional reference point exceeding 3 Gray(Gy) or a kerma-area
      product (KAP) above 300 Gy-cm2 will likely result in a temporary or permanent
      deterministic injury.
      4.2.1.3. Fluoroscopic procedures which have the potential to deliver an air kerma
      radiation dose at the interventional reference point below 3 Gy or a KAP below 300 Gy-
      cm2 are unlikely to produce a deterministic injury.
      4.2.1.4. It is highly desirable for all radiation data to be transferred automatically to
      PACS (picture archiving and communication system) as part of the study data (along
      with images and demographic information). The radiation data should include the peak
      skin dose, if available; the cumulative air kerma from both fluoroscopy and from image
      acquisition, if available; the kerma-area product, if available; or the cumulative
      fluoroscopy time and number of images or cine frames recorded.
   4.2.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.2.2.1. Each workplace which uses fluoroscopy must have a written policy for the safe
      use of fluoroscopic equipment. This policy must address all available types of
 20                                                           59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


      fluoroscopy equipment, whether fixed, mobile, or portable, e.g., mobile C-arm systems
      and mini C-arm systems. This policy should:
          4.2.2.1.1. Require testing of the fluoroscopic equipment by or under the direction of
          a qualified medical physicist.
          4.2.2.1.2. Require training and credentialing of persons operating or directing the
          operation of fluoroscopic equipment.
          4.2.2.1.3. Specify procedures for the safe use of the equipment, including dose
          management and recordkeeping.
          4.2.2.1.4. Require a clinical QA/QI program for fluoroscopy.
      4.2.2.2. Equipment testing for quality assurance should be performed by or under the
      direction of a qualified medical physicist after installation but before first clinical use,

     4.2.3.1. All fluoroscopic examinations must be performed by or under the direct
     supervision of a physician with demonstrated competence, which has received training in
     fluoroscopy and has been privileged by the facility to perform fluoroscopy.
     4.2.3.2. Every person who operates or directs the operation of fluoroscopic equipment
     must be trained in the safe use of fluoroscopic equipment, in order to optimize patient
     dose and minimize occupational dose. Initial training should include didactic training,
     hands-on training, and clinical operation under a preceptor.
        4.2.3.2.1. Didactic training should include the following topics: (a) physics of x-ray
        production and interaction; (b) the technology of fluoroscopy machines, including
        modes of operation; (c) characteristics of image quality and technical factors affecting
        image quality in fluoroscopy; (d) dosimetric quantities, units, and their use in
        radiation management; (e) the biological effects of radiation; (f) principles of
        radiation protection in fluoroscopy, (g) applicable federal regulations and agency
        requirements; and (h) techniques for minimizing dose to the patient and staff.
        Completion of this phase of training should include successfully completing a written
        examination. This training is only performed initially. Radiologists may fulfill the
        didactic portion of the initial training through the extensive training in radiation
        physics, radiation biology and radiation safety they receive during their residency.
        4.2.3.2.2. Hands-on training means operation of the actual fluoroscope that is to be
        used clinically (or an essentially similar fluoroscope), including the use of controls,
        activation of various modes of operation, and displays. This phase of training will be
        provided by the Medical Physics staff and will include demonstrations of the effect of
        different modes of operation on the dose rate to a simulated patient and could include
        demonstration of the dose-rates at various locations in the vicinity of the fluoroscope.
        This form of training is required both initially and annually.
        4.2.3.2.3. Clinical operation under a preceptor means operation of the fluoroscope
        for clinical purposes under the direct supervision of a preceptor experienced in the
        operation of the device. Completion of this phase of training should include written
        attestation, signed by the preceptor, that the individual has achieved a level of
        competency sufficient to function independently as a fluoroscopy operator. This
        training is only performed initially. This documentation shall be entered into the
        individual’s competency assessment folder.
     4.2.3.3. Training shall be conducted initially and annually thereafter. Records shall be
     kept of the training by Medical Physics. The records should include the date(s) of
     training, the name(s) of the person(s) providing the training, the topics included in the
     training, the duration of the training, the test questions, the names of the persons
     successfully completing the training, and the test scores of these persons. Annual
     refresher training will consist of the hands-on operator demonstration provided by the
     Medical Physics staff. Didactic training and a written exam may be used for make-up
     training for the annual refresher training. Medical Physics will provide a roster and
     copies of certification from the fluoroscopy user training course to the Credentialing
     Office on an annual basis.
     4.2.3.4. Each person who operates or directs the operation of fluoroscopic equipment
     will be credentialed by the medical facility. Credentialing shall be contingent upon
22                                                          59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


     successful completion of the initial training as described above. Maintenance of
     privileges shall be contingent upon successful completion of annual refresher training. In
     particular, it is not permissible for a physician or other medical professional who has not
     completed this training, and who is not credentialed, to direct the operation of a
     fluoroscopy unit even if it is operated by a radiologic technologist.
     4.2.3.5. During fluoroscopic cases, it is likely that the fluoroscopic user (the physician)
     will not be able to independently operate the fluoroscopic x-ray unit and will need the
     assistance of another individual to register the patient, position the device, make
     adjustments in operating parameters, and transfer digital images. It is desirable that all
     fluoroscopic equipment operation be supported by a DRT. In the event that a DRT is not
     available, other medical personnel such as nurses and medical technologists are eligible
     to assist a qualified fluoroscopic user if they meet the following conditions:
         4.2.3.5.1. The operation of the fluoroscope is for clinical purposes under the direct
         supervision of a qualified fluoroscopy user.
         4.2.3.5.2. The other medical personnel have received initial and annual radiation
         training from the Medical Physics office.
         4.2.3.5.3. The other medical personnel have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
         Superintendent of Radiology, or his designee, their knowledge of the operating modes
         and radiation safety features of the fluoroscopic equipment.
  4.2.4. Procedures.
     4.2.4.1. In fluoroscopy, the operator effectively determines, prescribes and delivers the
     required radiation dose to the patient in real-time. Fluoroscopic procedures should be
     performed so that procedure dose is optimized and skin dose is minimized.
     4.2.4.2. Record Keeping.
         4.2.4.2.1. A record must be kept of each fluoroscopic procedure. Whenever possible,
         this should be performed electronically, with automatic transfer of the necessary data
         from the fluoroscopy unit to a PACS. In addition to the patient’s electronic medical
         record, a log book must be maintained with each fluoroscopy unit that also includes:
            4.2.4.2.1.1. A description of the individual fluoroscopy unit, the date of the
            procedure, the procedure (e.g., barium enema, iliac artery angioplasty and stent
            placement), information identifying the patient, patient weight and the name of
            the physician operating or directing the operation of the device.
            4.2.4.2.1.2. The record should also list the cumulative air kerma from both
            fluoroscopy and from image acquisition, if available; the kerma-area product, if
            available; the cumulative fluoroscopy time and number of images recorded; and
            other dose metrics as they are developed.
            4.2.4.2.1.3. The log book data can also be entered or transcribed into an
            electronic format for data analysis.
            4.2.4.2.1.4. The log book data must be reviewed on a quarterly basis by either the
            RMP or a Medical physicist.
     4.2.4.3. Patient Management.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                   23


        4.2.4.3.1. Informed consent shall be obtained from the patient or the patient’s legal
        representative and appropriately documented prior to the initiation of any
        fluoroscopic procedure that is likely to expose the patient or fetus if the patient is
        pregnant, to any significant radiation risks and potential complications. When a delay
        in treatment would jeopardize the health of a patient and informed consent cannot be
        obtained from the patient or the patient’s legal representative, an exception to the
        requirement for obtaining informed consent is made. When obtaining informed
        consent for fluoroscopic procedures using ionizing radiation, an estimation of the
        anticipated risks from the radiation dose should be communicated to the patient as
        part of the overall discussion of risks. Refer to 59MDWI 51-302, Informed Consent
        Refusal of Treatment, Diagnostics and Blood or Blood Products for further guidance.
        4.2.4.3.2. When the dose to a patient’s skin may have exceeded the threshold dose
        for deterministic effects, the medical radiological practitioner who performed the
        procedure has the responsibility to advise the patient of this event, place an
        appropriate notation in the patient’s medical record, coordinate a consult with
        dermatology and notify the MRSO. The dermatology consult and the RSO
        notification must be within 24 hours.
        4.2.4.3.3. Device related deaths, including those related to radiation dose, must be
        reported by the device user facility to the device manufacturer and to the Food and
        Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with 21 CFR 803. Device-related serious
        injuries, including those resulting from radiation, must be reported by the device user
        facility to the device manufacturer or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA.
            4.2.4.3.3.1. A serious injury is one that is life-threatening, results in permanent
            impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
            necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent damage or
            impairment.
        4.2.4.3.4. If a patient’s skin receives an absorbed dose that meets the Joint
        Commission definition of a reviewable sentinel event (>15 Gy) from a
        fluoroscopically guided procedure, or a dose likely to result in a serious injury, the
        event also should be reported to the Radiation Safety Officer and the facility’s Patient
        Safety Manager within 4 hours.
     4.2.4.4. Fluoroscopy Staff Safety.
        4.2.4.4.1. Other than the patient who is being examined, only staff and ancillary
        personnel required for the procedure, or those in training, should be in the room
        during the fluoroscopic examination.
        4.2.4.4.2. No body part of any staff or ancillary personnel involved in a fluoroscopic
        examination should be in the primary beam. If primary beam exposure is
        unavoidable, it should be minimized.
        4.2.4.4.3. All personnel in the room during fluoroscopic procedures should be
        protected from scatter radiation by either protective aprons or whole-body shields of
        not less than 0.25 mm of lead-equivalent material. An apron with lead equivalence of
        at least 0.35 mm is recommended. Thyroid and eyes should be protected if the
 24                                                          59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


          potential exposure to the worker will exceed 25% of the annual regulatory dose limits
          for those organs.
          4.2.4.4.4. Pregnant individuals involved in fluoroscopically guided procedures
          generally do not need to limit their time in the procedure room to remain below the
          dose limit for the embryo and fetus, as long as they use appropriate protective
          garments and radiation protection methods, and their occupational exposure is
          adequately monitored.
      4.2.4.5. General safety requirements for fluoroscopy include using tight collimation,
      short irradiation times, pulsed fluoroscopy (when available) and minimal use of
      magnification that are consistent with clinical objectives. Always position the image
      intensifier as close to the patient as possible while maximizing the distance between the
      x-ray tube and the patient.
4.3. Medical Computed Tomography.
   4.3.1. Equipment Considerations.
      4.3.1.1. CT imparts some of the largest doses per procedure in diagnostic medical
      imaging.
   4.3.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.3.2.1. The quality control program will conform to the ACR CT Accreditation Program
      or equivalent guidance.
      4.3.2.2. Equipment testing for quality assurance must be performed after installation but
      before first clinical use, annually thereafter, and after each repair or modification that
      may affect patient dose or image quality.
      4.3.2.3. CT dose indices (Computed Tomography Dose Index volume and Dose Length
      Product) and patient weight shall be recorded as part of the patient record in the imaging
      study and in a log book at each CT console.
   4.3.3. Personnel.
      4.3.3.1. Radiological Medical Practitioner.
          4.3.3.1.1. CT equipment will be operated under the general supervision of a
          physician who fulfills the responsibilities of the Radiological Medical Practitioner.
          4.3.3.1.2. This individual must be appropriately trained in the imaging modality, be
          familiar with the principles of radiation protection, and have a sufficient
          understanding of the CT’s equipment features to determine the appropriate protocol
          to evaluate the patient’s clinical symptoms.
      4.3.3.2. Technologist.
          4.3.3.2.1. A CT system should only be operated by a Radiologic Technologist
          registered by the ARRT or equivalent, preferably with advanced certification in CT,
          operating under the supervision of a Radiological Medical Practitioner with
          appropriate training in CT physics, radiation safety and CT image interpretation.
   4.3.4. Procedures.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                     25


      4.3.4.1. Before performing the study, the technologist shall confirm that the technical
      parameters and the radiation dose metric are appropriate for the patient and planned
      study.
          4.3.4.1.1. Acquisition technical parameters may include pitch, collimation (beam
          width), kV, mA (constant or modulated), rotation time, physiologic gating, image
          quality factors, and reconstruction method. In addition, it is important to image only
          the area of anatomy in question and acquire only the necessary sequences
      4.3.4.2. Optimization of CT protocols is important for minimizing patient dose.
      Technique factors must be appropriate for the size (and not just the age) of the patient and
      the body part being imaged. In particular, adult technique factors should not be used for
      children and infants.
4.4. Bone Densitometry.
   4.4.1. Equipment Considerations.
      4.4.1.1. X-ray absorptiometers measure attenuation of two x-ray beams of well-separated
      average photon energies to discriminate between bone mineral and soft tissue. This
      method is called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA).
   4.4.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.4.2.1. Each bone densitometry workplace will have a quality assurance program. The
      procedures for this program must be documented in writing. The program should
      conform to manufacturer’s recommendations and recommendations of professional
      societies such as the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) and the
      American College of Radiology.
      4.4.2.2. The quality assurance program shall include daily assessments of accuracy and
      periodic assessments of precision. Cross calibration must be performed whenever the
      densitometer is repaired, modified, or replaced. This helps ensure proper measurement of
      bone mineral content, detection of osteoporosis, estimation of fracture risk, and changes
      over short and long periods of time (i.e., minutes and years) even as equipment is
      repaired, modified, or replaced.
          4.4.2.2.1. The accuracy check primarily measures equipment characteristics.
          Accuracy is the degree to which a measurement value estimates the actual value of
          the quantity being measured. Most densitometers will not allow a DXA scan to be
          performed unless the accuracy test is passed. Phantoms are available and an accuracy
          assessment shall be obtained daily.
          4.4.2.2.2. Precision studies should be conducted on subjects who are representative
          of the bulk of the population scanned at the particular facility.
             4.4.2.2.2.1. Each bone density workplace shall establish a range of acceptable
             precision performance and ensure that each technologist meets this standard. If
             there is more than one technologist, an average precision error combining data
             from all technologists should be used to establish precision error and Least
             Significant Change (LSC) for the bone densitometry department.
             4.4.2.2.2.2. For DXA, precision is affected by the positioning of patients.
26                                                           59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


             Therefore, precision assessments should be performed using repeated
             measurements of patients, with repositioning of the patients between
             measurements.
             4.4.2.2.2.3. Precision studies can be done on either 30 patients scanned twice
             (after the patient is repositioned in between scans) or 15 patients scanned 3 times,
             also after repositioning in between each scan.
             4.4.2.2.2.4. The precision results are then used to calculate the LSC to determine
             whether an observed change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) over a period of
             time is significant (higher than LSC) or not (less than the LSC). Retraining must
             occur if a technologist's precision is worse than values recommended by
             professional societies, e.g., ACR and ISCD.
         4.4.2.2.3. Cross-calibration Check.
             4.4.2.2.3.1. A cross-calibration check is a method to derive equivalent BMD
             values when measured on the original densitometer and a modified or new
             densitometer. Cross-calibration must be performed when repairing, modifying, or
             replacing the entire system or any portion of the system that might alter the
             absolute BMD value.
             4.4.2.2.3.2. The old and new densitometers must be cross-calibrated to establish a
             new baseline. Cross-calibration is conducted in-vivo by scanning 60 to 100
             patients with a wide range of bone densities (normal to osteoporosis) on both the
             old and new densitometer.
             4.4.2.2.3.3. A cross-calibration equation is then developed (by using linear
             regression methods), and can be used to predict the BMD value on the different
             densitometer.
     4.4.2.3. Precision and cross-calibration studies conducted by scanning patients are not
     research. Thus, these studies do not need approval of an institutional review board.
     However, the bone density section must obtain informed consent from each patient
     participating in a precision or cross-calibration study. Although each scan results in a
     low effective dose to the individual patient, radiation doses to the individual patient can
     be reduced by scanning a larger number of patients a fewer number of times and by not
     including a patient in both precision and cross-calibration studies. Patients or staff shall
     not be scanned solely for the purpose of training.
     4.4.2.4. Patient radiation dose will be determined by a qualified medical physicist after
     installation, after service that may affect the radiation dose, and at least annually
     thereafter.
  4.4.3. Personnel.
     4.4.3.1. Bone densitometry equipment will be operated under the general supervision of
     a physician who fulfills the responsibilities of the Radiological Medical Practitioner. The
     interpreting Radiological Medical Practitioner must be knowledgeable in bone
     densitometry.
     4.4.3.2. Technologists performing absorptiometry should have documented formal
     training in the use of the absorptiometry equipment they are operating, including
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                       27


       performance of all manufacturer-specified and facility quality assurance (QA)
       procedures.
       4.4.3.3. Each person performing bone densitometry should meet at least one of the
       following qualifications:
          4.4.3.3.1. Be a Diagnostic Radiologic Technologist (DRT).
          4.4.3.3.2. Be certified by the ARRT in Nuclear Medicine Technology.
          4.4.3.3.3. Be certified by the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board.
          4.4.3.3.4. Be certified by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry as a
          Certified Densitometry Technologist.
          4.4.3.3.5. Have ARRT post-primary certification in Bone Densitometry.
          4.4.3.3.6. Have state licensure or limited licensure in Bone Mineral Densitometry,
          when the licensure requires successful completion of the ARRT Limited Scope Bone
          Densitometry Examination.
   4.4.4. Procedures.
       4.4.4.1. Before the DXA scan, the technologist will:
          4.4.4.1.1. Ensure that the various quality assurance parameters have been fulfilled.
          4.4.4.1.2. Verify that there are no contraindications to the DXA scans. Pregnant
          patients or patients likely to be pregnant shall not have a DXA scan. It is also not
          recommended to scan patients whose weight exceeds the weight limit of the
          densitometer as the results may not be accurate and the densitometer table may be
          damaged.
4.5. Dental.
   4.5.1. Equipment Considerations.
       4.5.1.1. Fixed, mobile x-ray systems and hand-held radiology devices are used for intra-
       oral radiographic imaging.
          4.5.1.1.1. For fixed and mobile x-ray systems, the operator must stand a minimum of
          2 meters (6 feet) from the x-ray source and the patient. An operator barrier may or
          may not be required. That determination will be made by a qualified medical
          physicist.
          4.5.1.1.2. For hand held devices, dosimetry studies indicate that these hand-held
          devices present no greater radiation risk than standard dental radiographic units to the
          patient or the operator. No additional radiation protection precautions are needed
          when the device is used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These include:
               4.5.1.1.2.1. Holding the device at mid-torso height.
               4.5.1.1.2.2. Positioning the shielding ring at the outer most end of the cone and
               orienting the shielding ring parallel to the operator.
               4.5.1.1.2.3. Keeping the cone as close to the patient’s face as practical. If the
               hand-held device is operated without the ring shield at the outermost position, it is
 28                                                           59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


             recommended that the operator wear a lead apron with a thyroid collar.
          4.5.1.1.3. Hand-held devices must be secured properly when not in use to prevent
          accidental damage, theft or operation by an unauthorized user. Hand held units
          should be stored in locked cabinets, locked storage rooms or locked work areas when
          not under the direct supervision of an individual authorized to use them.
      4.5.1.2. In panoramic and cephalometric dental imaging, scattered radiation is typically
      low due to the narrow beam of radiation and the shielding incorporated into digital
      detectors. With a typical workload, operators can produce panoramic images without the
      use of shielding as long as they are at least 2 meters (6 feet) from the unit. An
      appropriate shield should be used if this distance cannot be maintained. This
      generalization must be confirmed for each specific workplace by a qualified medical
      physicist.
      4.5.1.3. CBCT scanners utilize a narrow, collimated cone beam of radiation that scans
      both the maxilla and mandible and/or skull at one time. Given these low radiation doses,
      the same radiation protection guidelines recommended for conventional dental imaging
      may be applied for CBCT. This generalization will again need to be confirmed for each
      specific workplace by a qualified medical physicist.
   4.5.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.5.2.1. Dental workplaces will monitor procedure repeat rates.
      4.5.2.2. Records listing the names of approved individuals who are granted access and
      use privileges for CBCT and hand held devices shall be prepared and made available to
      the MRSO.
      4.5.2.3. Radiographic technique factors shall be established for common procedures and
      programmed into the x-ray machine or a technique chart should be immediately available
      to the operator.
      4.5.2.4. Equipment testing for quality assurance should be performed by or under the
      direction of a qualified medical physicist after installation but before first clinical use,
      annually thereafter, and after each repair or modification that may affect patient dose or
      image quality.
      4.5.2.5. The quality assurance measures for Digital Dental Radiography are listed below:

   4.5.3. Personnel.
       4.5.3.1. Each dental radiology workplace will be operated under the general supervision
       of a dentist who fulfills the responsibilities of the Radiological Dental Practitioner.
       4.5.3.2. Dental Technicians that operator radiographic equipment must receive
       appropriate education and training. See section 2.2.1.5.
   4.5.4. Procedures.
       4.5.4.1. Dental radiographs will only be prescribed following an evaluation of the
       patient’s needs that includes a health history review, a clinical dental history assessment,
       a clinical examination and an evaluation of susceptibility to dental diseases. Panoramic
       radiograph of the teeth and jaw structure is justified in Dental Basic Trainee Processing
       for creation of baseline forensic dental record for military personnel.
 30                                                           59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


      4.5.4.2. The number of images obtained should be the minimum necessary to obtain
      essential diagnostic information. Postoperative radiographs should be taken only when
      there is clinical indication.
      4.5.4.3. Radiographic equipment designed for use with an intraoral image receptor shall
      be provided with a means to limit the x-ray beam.
      4.5.4.4. A holding device for intraoral dental imaging is recommended to be used
      whenever possible.
      4.5.4.5. Patient shielding shall be provided for children, and should be provided for
      adults, when it will not interfere with the examination.
4.6. Grenz Ray Therapy Systems.
   4.6.1. Equipment Considerations – Grenz Ray is a low energy (less than 50 keV operating
   potential) x-ray device used for the therapeutic treatment of superficial dermatological
   conditions.
   4.6.2. Testing and Quality Assurance.
      4.6.2.1. Annually the Grenz Ray unit must be calibrated by a qualified radiation therapy
      medical physicist and a signed report must be provided to the dermatology clinic. The
      report shall include: the date of the calibration, the manufacturer’s name, the model
      number and serial number of both the therapeutic machine and the survey meter used.
      This report must be provided to the MRSO and must be retained by the dermatology
      clinic for a period of seven (7) years.
      4.6.2.2. A technique chart will be provided that identifies clinical time settings to achieve
      a range of patient doses. Whenever a significant change in the operating characteristics
      of the system is identified (based on the previous year’s clinical timer settings), the
      system shall be removed from service until the cause can be determined and the unit
      repaired. A recalibration will be required before it is allowed to return to service.
   4.6.3. Personnel.
      4.6.3.1. Radiological Medical Practitioner. Grenz Ray equipment will be operated under
      the general supervision of a dermatology physician. This individual must be trained in
      the proper use of the Grenz ray unit, be familiar with the principles of radiation
      protection, and have a sufficient understanding of the unit’s features to determine the
      appropriate protocol for patient treatment.
      4.6.3.2. Grenz Ray Therapists are responsible for using workplace-approved protocols
      and radiation protection measures. All therapists who operate the Grenz ray unit require
      initial and annual training that includes the risks from exposure to ionizing radiation,
      regulatory requirements, workplace requirements, proper operation of the equipment and
      guidance for protecting the patient. The MRSO must be consulted and approve the
      training content.
   4.6.4. Procedures.
      4.6.4.1. When a patient must be held in position for Grenz ray therapy, mechanical
      supporting or immobilization aids should be used when possible.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                    31


     4.6.4.2. The tube housing assembly shall never be held during operation.
     4.6.4.3. A copy of the current operating and emergency procedures shall be maintained
     at the Grenz ray control console.
     4.6.4.4. It is the responsibility of any supervising dermatology physician to prescribe
     appropriate Grenz ray protocols for the safe and effective treatment of patients.
     Prescriptions that do not match the Clinical Timer Settings as referenced in the most
     current physicists report will not be authorized until calibration of dose can be confirmed.
     4.6.4.5. Grenz ray procedures will only be performed in accordance with approved
     protocols. The technologist will not perform any procedure which has not been requested
     by a dermatologist who meets the criteria as given for the RMP.
     4.6.4.6. A record must be kept of each Grenz ray procedure. Whenever possible, this
     should be entered into the patient’s electronic medical record. In addition to the patient’s
     electronic medical record, a log book must be maintained that includes:
        4.6.4.6.1. A description of the unit, the date of the procedure, the procedure,
        information identifying the patient, and the name of the physician operating or
        directing the operation of the device.
        4.6.4.6.2. The record should also list the estimate of dose and the clinical timer
        setting and other dose metrics as they are developed.
        4.6.4.6.3. The log book data can also be entered or transcribed into an electronic
        format for data analysis.
        4.6.4.6.4. The log book data must be reviewed on a quarterly basis by either the
        Dermatology RMP or a Medical physicist.

                EQUIPMENT, FACILITIES, AND ADMIN CONTROLS

5.1. Requesting New or Replacement Radiographic Equipment.
   5.1.1. Any request for new or replacement medical or dental radiographic equipment must
   have prior coordination with the 59 MDW RSC before a procurement request is submitted.
   This requirement ensures adequate radiation shielding will be projected to protect both
   equipment operators and members of the general public. The 59 MDW Medical Equipment
   Management Office will not accept TIGERS packages without RSC coordination and the 59
   MDW Facility Management Office will not accept Facility Utilization requests without RSC
   coordination.
      5.1.1.1. Structural Shielding.
          5.1.1.1.1. For the structural shielding of rooms containing radiation producing
          devices, the shielding design goal will be 1 one thousandth of a Gray (mGy) in a year
          and 0.02 mGy in any hour. The design of shielding for and acceptance testing
          surveys of imaging rooms must conform to National Council on Radiological
          Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Reports. The shielding design calculations,
          as-built shielding plans, and the report on the acceptance testing of the structural
          shielding must be kept for the duration of use of the room for radiation device.
          5.1.1.1.2. The preferred process is to have the shielding calculation and integrity
          checks performed by a qualified medical physicist acting as an agent of the
          equipment manufacturer. The shielding calculations will be independently reviewed
          by a member of the Medical Physics Flight who will also witness all integrity checks.
          5.1.1.1.3. The point of contact for shielding analysis is 59 RSQ/SG06P (210-292-
          7959).
5.2. Request to Relocate or Modify Existing Equipment.
   5.2.1. Any request to relocate or modify existing equipment requires a minimum of 30 days
   advanced coordination with the 59 MDW/RSC.
   5.2.2. Each activity utilizing radiation producing equipment must immediately report any
   malfunctions to Biomedical Maintenance, who will in turn notify the Radiation Safety Office
   in the event any radiation producing component is replaced or any significant adjustments to
   radiation output are required.
   5.2.3. In most cases, structural shielding will not be required for DXA devices designed for
   use only on the appendicular skeleton. Nonetheless, a qualified medical physicist should
   make a determination whether shielding is needed. After device installation, whether or not
   additional shielding is installed, dose measurements should be made in adjacent areas and at
   the operator’s station (which may be inside the room) and should be documented in a written
   report. This will help determine the need for occupational dosimetry and provide a historical
   record to ensure proper equipment functioning.
   5.2.4. A qualified medical physicist will make the final determination whether shielding is
   needed. After device installation, whether or not additional shielding is installed, dose
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                            33


  measurements must be made in adjacent areas and at the operator’s station and should be
  documented in a written report.

                                           Chapter 6

                      X-RAY RADIATION SAFETY PROCEDURES

6.1. Patient Protection.
   6.1.1. Patient Protective Equipment.
       6.1.1.1. The lens of the patient’s eye should be shielded with at least 2 mm lead
       equivalence during medical tomographic procedures that include the eye in the useful
       beam. (Not required for posterior-anterior projections).
       6.1.1.2. Gonad shielding of not less than 0.25 millimeters lead-equivalent material shall
       be used for patients during radiographic procedures in which the gonads are in the useful
       x-ray beam, except for cases in which this would interfere with the diagnostic procedure.
       6.1.1.3. Shielding of breasts for scoliosis radiographs and CT scans for pediatric patients
       should be used due to the sensitivity of breast tissue in young women and the number of
       images likely to be taken in a lifetime. The shields must be placed between the source of
       x-rays and the patient. If there no shields are available for scoliosis imaging a posterior-
       anterior view should be used.
   6.1.2. Pregnant Patients.
       6.1.2.1. No screening x-ray examinations (without clinical indication) shall be performed
       on the pregnant woman.
       6.1.2.2. Each workplace will establish and implement procedures to determine, before
       conducting an examination or procedure, whether a female patient of childbearing age
       may be pregnant.
          6.1.2.2.1. Each workplace will utilize their most current questionnaire/consent form.
          For medical radiography, fluoroscopy and computed tomography, that form will be
          scanned into the PACS as part of the exam.
          6.1.2.2.2. Signs must be posted in suitable locations, such as patient reception areas
          and procedure rooms, asking female patients to notify staff if they might be pregnant.
       6.1.2.3. If a patient is pregnant, the Radiological Medical/Dental Practitioner
       knowledgeable in the risk from the radiation exposure should work with the patient in
       making the decision whether to perform the examination or procedure. In instances
       where a study using ionizing radiation is deemed necessary, every effort should be made
       to avoid exposing the fetus to the direct radiation beam. There should be a discussion of
       the benefits and risks with a pregnant patient prior to the imaging unless an emergent
       need for the imaging or her condition precludes this.
          6.1.2.3.1. Consideration should be given to alternate tests or procedures, such as
          ultrasound, that would not directly expose the embryo or fetus to ionizing radiation,
          or to modifying the examination or procedure to reduce the radiation dose to the
          embryo or fetus.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                  35


     6.1.2.4. In cases where the patient is known to be pregnant before the medical procedure
     is performed, the referring physician shall contact the MRSO (210-292-7957) for a fetal
     dose consultation.
         6.1.2.4.1. All doses to a fetus shall be estimated. If the dose to the embryo or fetus
         could exceed 0.05 Gy (5 rad), a formal dose assessment should be performed prior to
         the exam by a qualified physicist and provided with consultation to the referring
         physician so that the patient can be advised accordingly. Doses at or above 0.1 Gy
         (10 rad) warrant discussions between the patient and her physician of potentially
         adverse fetal effects. All fetal dose assessment should be included in the medical
         record.
     6.1.2.5. Precautions should be taken for procedures imparting larger radiation doses to
     the abdomen or pelvic region of the patient. The physician might consider delaying the
     procedure until after pregnancy so as to avoid exposing the embryo or fetus. For
     procedures that may impart a dose to this region, and especially for those exceeding 0.05
     Gy (5 rad) such as fluoroscopy, the anticipated dose and associated risks must be
     included as part of informed consent and a serum pregnancy test should be obtained
     (unless the pregnancy can be excluded by documented surgical or medical history),
     unless a physician determines that the delay caused by performing the test would harm
     the patient.
     6.1.2.6. If the patient is discovered to be pregnant after the medical radiographic or
     fluoroscopic procedures have been performed; the referring physician will promptly
     (within 24 hours) contact the MRSO representative for a post-examination fetal dose
     estimate.
     6.1.2.7. Whether the pregnancy was identified prior to or after the medical radiation
     exposure, a Fetal Dose Consult will be prepared by Medical Physics will be returned to
     the requesting physician via the Composite Health Care System who can then provide
     counseling to the patient. Medical Physics personnel will not consult directly with the
     patient, but will provide recommendations to the referring physician for use in their
     consultation with the patient.
     6.1.2.8. The Radiation Safety Office shall notify the 59 MDW Risk Management Office
     within 24 hours of any single or cumulative fetal dose that exceeds 0.05 Gy (5 Rad).
     Notification will also be forwarded to the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General within
     7 calendar days after discover.
  6.1.3. Pediatric Patients.
     6.1.3.1. Children are more sensitive to radiation and also have greater expected
     remaining life spans than adults. As such, children represent a population at greater risk
     for subsequent development of radiation induced cancer than adults. This difference in
     the benefit to risk ratio should be considered in the prescription of medical imaging
     requiring ionizing radiation. Alternative imaging modalities that do not use ionizing
     radiation, such as ultrasound or MRI, should be considered for imaging children.
     6.1.3.2. Protocols for all ionizing radiation imaging (CT, fluoroscopy, radiography)
     should be “child-sized” or optimized so that the dose is appropriate for the size of the
     infant or child. For example, unlike abdominal CT studies performed in adults, pediatric
 36                                                           59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


      CT studies usually do not require multiple passes through the child’s body. This reduces
      the radiation dose to the child without compromising diagnosis. In fluoroscopy, the study
      is performed with the grid retracted, which decreases the radiation (i.e. dose) required to
      generate a suitable image
6.2. Radiation User Protection.
   6.2.1. There shall be a procedure for regular issuance and replacement of dosimeters for
   exposure evaluation, and records of the doses received shall be retained as required by
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations,
   Part 1910.1096, Ionizing Radiation. The dosimetry program management is managed in
   accordance with AFMAN 48-125, Personnel Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry. The MRSO will
   designate those personnel who are designated as radiation workers and give appropriate
   initial and annual training to all radiation workers. A radiation worker is any military,
   civilians and in-house contractors assigned to the 59 MDW who have the potential to be
   occupationally exposed to 1 mSv (100 mrem) in a year. Based on the type of use and the
   workload not all users of radiation equipment meet the criteria to be classified as a radiation
   worker. This designation will be made by the MRSO. The point of contact for personnel
   dosimetry registration and information at 59 MDW is the BEF (671-7061).
      6.2.1.1. When a radiation worker wears a protective apron, one dosimeter should be
      worn at the collar outside the apron. The second dosimeter should be worn on the
      abdomen under the apron. The two dosimeter method provides a more accurate method
      of assessing effective dose. When multiple dosimeters are issued, each dosimeter should
      be labeled to indicate the location on the body where it is to be worn.
      6.2.1.2. Each workplace shall ensure that radiation workers wear dosimeters as required,
      and in the designated locations; failure to do so can result in incorrect dose assessments.
      6.2.1.3. Periodic assessments and feedback to radiation users regarding their exposures
      are particularly important. If there is a question/concern, a representative sample of
      radiation users or dosimeters can be posted in the workplace in order to quantify the
      amount of radiation a person in those areas might receive.
   6.2.2. Pregnant Radiation Workers.
      6.2.2.1. When a radiation worker (see previous paragraph 1.2.2) formally declares her
      pregnancy (i.e., becomes a “declared pregnant woman”), her monitoring interval will be
      changed to monthly.
      6.2.2.2. The occupational dose equivalent to the embryo or fetus of a declared pregnant
      radiation worker shall not exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem) during the pregnancy. This limit does
      not pertain to the exposure of an embryo or fetus resulting from a medical procedure to
      the pregnant worker.
      6.2.2.3. If a pregnancy is confirmed, the MRSO will evaluate the individual's specific
      duties involving exposure to radiation and will make the determination for monitoring,
      restriction or removal of the woman from her radiation duties.
   6.2.3. All staff and ancillary personnel involved in any radiographic/fluoroscopic
   examination shall be protected such that no part of their body will be in the primary beam
   unless protected by at minimum 0.50 millimeters of lead-equivalent material.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                   37


  6.2.4. All staff and ancillary personnel involved in any medical radiographic/fluoroscopic
  examination shall be protected from scatter radiation by either protective aprons or whole-
  body shields of not less than 0.25 millimeters of lead-equivalent material.
  6.2.5. Eye protection in the form of leaded glass shields or leaded eye glasses should be used
  for clinicians with high fluoroscopic workloads.
  6.2.6. Individuals shall not be exposed to the useful radiation beam unless such exposure has
  been authorized by and is conducted under the direct supervision of a licensed physician or
  dentist. This provision specifically prohibits deliberate exposure of an individual for
  training, demonstration, or other non-healing arts purposes.
  6.2.7. Other than the patient being examined, only staff and ancillary personnel required for
  the radiological procedure, or those in training, shall be in the room during the radiographic
  examination.
  6.2.8. Portable/Mobile and hand held x-ray examinations (both radiographic and
  fluoroscopic).
     6.2.8.1. Portable/Mobile x-ray examination shall be performed only when it is
     determined that movement of the patient would jeopardize their welfare. When portable
     examinations are performed, the other patients should be removed from the room. If the
     other patients cannot be removed from the room, they shall be protected from scatter
     radiation by either a whole-body protective barrier of not less than 0.25 millimeters of
     lead-equivalent material. If shielding is not available or practical, the other patient(s)
     shall be positioned at least six feet away from the x-ray source and from the patient being
     imaged.
  6.2.9. Auxiliary support during radiographic examinations.
     6.2.9.1. Occasionally a patient image must be provided with auxiliary support during a
     radiation exposure. Mechanical positioning devices shall be used when the technique
     permits.    Written safety procedures shall provide instruction on selection of the
     appropriate holder and its proper use.
     6.2.9.2. Individual medical personnel should not have the responsibility of routinely
     holding patients during diagnostic radiology procedures. Patients should only be held
     after it is determined that available restraining devices are inadequate. Individuals
     holding patients for x-ray procedures should be a willing adult (over the age of 18)
     relative. The next best option is to have a non-radiation user. Only if there is no other
     alternative should a monitored radiation worker be selected to hold the patient. If so they
     should wear their assigned radiation dosimeter during the exam.
     6.2.9.3. Whomever is selected to hold the patient, they shall be provided with a lead
     apron and should be positioned so that no part of their body is exposed to the direct
     radiation beam. To assist in minimizing exposure, it is important for the radiologic
     technologist to collimate carefully to the area of clinical interest. Pregnant women or
     persons under the age of 18 should not be permitted to hold patients.
     6.2.9.4. Dental personnel should not hold image receptors in patients’ mouths. If a
     patient has to be restrained during exposure, a relative of the patient should do so. The
 38                                                             59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


      relative may be provided a lead apron and latex gloves if the image receptor is to be held
      in the mouth so they have protection during exposure.
6.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   6.3.1. PPE refers to devices used for either staff or patient protection as appropriate.
   6.3.2. Protective aprons, gloves and thyroid shields should be hung or laid flat and never
   folded, and manufacturer’s instructions should be followed.
   6.3.3. All activities utilizing medical/dental radiography equipment shall ensure that all PPE
   used within 59 MDW (government furnished or personal) such as leaded aprons, collars,
   gloves and mobile shields must be uniquely numbered, checked prior to use and annually for
   deterioration and stamped/tagged to confirm inspection.
      6.3.3.1. Lead personal protective equipment (e.g., aprons, gloves, thyroid collars) shall
      be evaluated at least annually for lead protection integrity using visual and fluoroscopic
      inspection. (Exception: Dental aprons require only visual inspection.)
      6.3.3.2. The MRSO will provide consulting support to sections performing this testing as
      appropriate. Any new purchase of PPE shall be coordinated with the RSO representative
      to update the existing inventory. Each workplace will be responsible for disposing of
      defective lead aprons. All protective devices deemed unusable that contain lead are
      considered hazardous materials and should be turned-in to the Hazardous
      Waste/Recycling Center (671-3658, 671-2470 or 671-4800) for proper disposal.
      6.3.3.3. The following steps will guide individuals through the survey of lead protective
      devices. If there are any questions, call 292-6840 or 292-3915.
          6.3.3.3.1. Place lead device/garment on fluoroscopy unit table. While fluoroscopy
          unit is on, slowly sweep the lead device through x-ray beam.
          6.3.3.3.2. A tear in the lead should appear bright. If a tear is found, the device has
          lost its lead integrity and should be taken out of inventory. Any protective device is
          considered a failure if a hole or tear (>0.5 cm) is found.
          6.3.3.3.3. The summary document must include the number of items inspected, date
          inspected, initials of individual who inspected the garments and if the lead protective
          passes or fails testing. Give completed summary document to MRSO representative
          and be prepared for a spot inspection.
      6.3.3.4. Reports from each workplace utilizing radiation PPE will be provided to the
      MRSO representative no later than 15 April of each year.
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                    39

                         RESEARCH INVOLVING RADIATION

7.1. Patients Enrolled in a Research Protocol.
   7.1.1. All research involving human subjects that is conducted, supported, or otherwise
   subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency must conform to the most current
   version of the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects. This policy requires
   approval of research protocols by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board (IRB)
   and obtaining informed consent from the patient.
   7.1.2. Many protocols use radiation that is medically indicated (also referred to as
   “standard-of-care”). Medically-indicated radiation is used to diagnose or guide treatment as
   a non-research medical procedure for clinical management of the research subject. The
   radiation dose from a medically-indicated procedure done as part of a research study will not
   require additional justification, review, and approval by an IRB.
   7.1.3. When the radiation exposure is described as indicated for research (the radiation use
   does not meet the criteria of “medically indicated”) it must be reviewed and approved. The
   IRB has responsibility for oversight of research involving human subjects, but will seek the
   advice of the Radiation Safety Committee regarding the radiation risk from any non-
   medically indicated radiation use that is a component of the research.
   7.1.4. Investigators assembling a radiation protocol application for submission to the IRB are
   encouraged to consult with the 59 MDW Medical Physics office (210-292-7959/3932) for
   assistance with the calculation of dose and a determination of stochastic and deterministic
   risk.
   7.1.5. See Attachment 2 for sample consent forms.

A2.1. The guidance in this attachment is suitable for research involving diagnostic and
interventional x-ray procedures. It applies to radiation use indicated for research involving
human subjects. Examples might include evaluating new mammography protocol using lower
kVp as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP),
virtual colonoscopy, and national lung screening trials. It excludes radiation oncology research,
in which radiation doses to subjects may be much higher. A discussion of the interplay among
human subjects research ethics, patient risk-benefit considerations, and the role of the IRB is
beyond the scope of this document, but is an essential process prior to the conduct of research
involving human subjects.
A2.2. The risk from research protocols involving radiation use indicated for research, as
described above, can be categorized into groups. A useful approach is to group risk as minimal,
minor to intermediate, or moderate. The templates on the following pages are adapted from
those used by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2012 [less than 1 mSv (100 mrem)
“minimal” and 1-50 mSv (100 mrem – 5 rem) “minor to intermediate”]. Doses above 50 mSv (5
rem) may be considered to range from moderate to substantial. The specific ranges and text may
be adjusted as required by the specific IRB (NIH 2001; NIH 2008a; NIH 2008b; NIH 2010).
Another approach to selecting the dose ranges and descriptors for these templates is shown
below.

                                               expected benefit)
A2.3. Minimal Risk.
   A2.3.1. Adapted from NIH TEMPLATE A. [Total effective dose less than or equal to 1 mSv
   (100 mrem.)]
   A2.3.2. This research study involves exposure to radiation from (insert type of procedure or
   procedures). Please note that this radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care
   and is for research purposes only.
   A2.3.3. The total amount of radiation you will receive in this study is from (insert maximum
   number) of (insert description of type of x-ray procedure). The Radiation Safety Committee
 44                                                            59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013


   has reviewed the use of radiation in this research study and has approved this use as
   involving minimal risk and necessary to obtain the research information desired.
   A2.3.4. You will receive a total of (XX) mSv or (YY) rem to your (insert highest-dosed
   organ, typically skin) from participating in this study. All other parts of your body will
   receive smaller amounts of radiation. Although each organ will receive a different dose, the
   amount of radiation exposure you will receive from this study is equal to a uniform whole-
   body exposure of less than (insert total effective dose value). This calculated value is known
   as the “effective dose” and is used to relate the dose received by each organ to a single value.
   A2.3.5. For comparison, the average person in the United States receives a radiation dose of
   3 mSv (300 mrem) per year from natural background sources, such as from the sun, outer
   space, and from radioactivity found naturally in the earth’s air and soil. The dose that you
   will receive from participation in this research study is about the same amount you would
   normally receive in (insert number) months from these natural sources.
Note: While there is no direct evidence that the small radiation dose received from participating
in this study is harmful, there is indirect evidence it may not be completely safe. There may be
an extremely small increase in the risk of cancer.
A2.4. Minor to Intermediate Risk:
   A2.4.1. Adapted from NIH TEMPLATE B. [1 mSv < Total effective dose = < 50 mSv) or
   (100 mrem < Total effective dose = < 5 rem).]
   A2.4.2. This research study involves exposure to radiation from (insert type of procedure or
   procedures). Please note that this radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care
   and is for research purposes only.
   A2.4.3. The total amount of radiation you will receive in this study is from (insert maximum
   number) (scans or repetitions) of (insert description of type of x-ray procedure). The
   Radiation Safety Committee has reviewed the use of radiation in this research study and has
   approved this use as involving low risk (more than minimal but less than moderate) and
   necessary to obtain the research information desired.
   A2.4.4. Although each organ will receive a different dose, the amount of radiation exposure
   you will receive from this study is equal to a uniform whole-body exposure of less than
   (insert total effective dose value). This calculated value is known as the “effective dose” and
   is used to relate the dose received by each organ to a single value. The amount of radiation
   you will receive in this study is less than the annual radiation dose of 50 mSv per year (5 rem
   per year) permitted for someone who works with radiation on a daily basis.
   A2.4.5. For comparison, the average person in the United States receives a radiation dose of
   3 mSv (300 mrem) per year from natural background sources, such as from the sun, outer
   space, and from radioactivity found naturally in the earth’s air and soil. The dose that you
   will receive from participation in this research study is about the same amount you would
   normally receive in (insert number) months from these natural sources.
   A2.4.6. The effects of radiation exposure on humans have been studied for over 60 years. In
   fact, these studies are the most extensive ever done of any potentially harmful agent that
   could affect humans. In all these studies, no harmful effect to humans has been observed
   from the levels of radiation you will receive by taking part in this research study. However,
59MDWI48-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                     45


  scientists disagree on whether radiation doses at these levels are harmful. Even though no
  effects have been observed, some scientists believe that radiation can be harmful at any dose,
  even low doses such as those received during this research.
  A2.4.7. While there is no direct evidence that the radiation dose received from participating
  in this study is harmful, there is indirect evidence it may not be completely safe. There may
  be a small increase in the risk of cancer.
  A2.4.8. Some people may be concerned that radiation exposure may have an effect on
  fertility or cause harm to future children. The radiation dose you will receive in this research
  study is well below the level that affects fertility. In addition, radiation has never been
  shown to cause harm to the future children of individuals who have been exposed to
  radiation. Harm to future generations has been found only in experiments on animals that
  have received radiation doses much higher than the amount you will receive in this study.
