                                AIRFIELD INFORMATION

2.1. Airfield Information. The airfield is defined as all areas including RWYs, TWYs (TWYs),
arm/de-arm areas, aircraft parking ramps and service areas, which are used for towing, taxiing,
takeoff and landing of aircraft. See Figure 2.1. for airfield layout.

Figure 2.1. Airfield Diagram.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                               9


   2.1.1. RAF Lakenheath’s (LKH) location is N5225.0/E0034.0 and airfield elevation is 32
   feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).
   2.1.2. Magnetic RWY headings. RWY 06/24: 059.5/239.5
   2.1.3. Slope gradients for LKH RWYs. RWY 06/24 have zero percent slope.
   2.1.4. RWY information.
      2.1.4.1. RWY 06/24 is 9000 feet long by 150 feet wide. RWY 24 is the primary
      instrument RWY.
      2.1.4.2. The first 500 feet of RWY 06 and the first 1000 feet of RWY 24 are grooved
      concrete. The remaining 7500 feet is a Porous Friction Surface (PFS).
      2.1.4.3. RWY 06 overrun is 997 feet long and RWY 24 is 938 feet long, both non-load
      bearing.
      2.1.4.4. To prolong the lifespan, reduce wear and prevent damage/shifting of the PFS
      runway, all turns on, onto, or off of the RWY for C-130s and larger aircraft (including
      tows) must only be accomplished on the concrete portion.
          2.1.4.4.1. Fighter-type aircraft and smaller are permitted to turn on the PFS as
          directed by Airfield Operations. Further specifics can be gained from Airfield
          Operations upon request.
          2.1.4.4.2. Short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft are not permitted to perform
          vertical takeoffs or landings on/over the PFS.
2.2. RWY Selection Procedures.
   2.2.1. LKH Control Tower (TWR) Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller (WS/SC) will select
   the RWY in use based on weather, availability of arresting gear, airfield lighting, opportunity
   for practice approaches, and mutual alignment with MLD (MLD). Due to ATC operational
   advantages and to reduce possible conflictions, LKH should remain aligned with MLD to the
   maximum extent possible.
   2.2.2. When TWR’s dual wind sensors malfunction or when conflicting wind information is
   received, the TWR WS/SC will select the RWY to be used based on information in
   paragraph 2.2.3. and the forecasted wind speed and direction. TWR WS/SC will pre-
   coordinate RWY changes with the Radar Approach Control (RAPCON), Supervisor of
   Flying (SOF), RAF Mildenhall (MLD) Tower, and 48th Civil Engineering Squadron Power
   Production (48 CES/CEOFP).
   2.2.3. 48 CES/CEOFP will request Fire Department (48 CES/CEF) assistance to reconfigure
   the cables when needed. 48 CES/CEF personnel must be in direct communication with TWR
   when assisting power production.
   2.2.4. Upon commencing a RWY change, TWR will inform RAPCON, AMOPS, 48 OSS
   Weather Flight (48 OSS/OSW), 48 CES/CEF, and MLD Tower. RAPCON and TWR will
   also broadcast an advisory on all appropriate frequencies. TWR will update the Automatic
   Terminal Information Service (ATIS).
   2.2.5. TWR will advise RAPCON, AMOPS, 48 OSS/OSW, 48 CES/CEF, and MLD Tower
   when RWY change is complete.

  2.2.6. AMOPS will advise Transient Alert (TA), 48 FW Command Post (48 FW/CP), and 48
  CES/CEOFP of RWY changes.
  2.2.7. RAPCON will notify London ATC Centre (Military) (LATCC Mil) of RWY changes.
  2.2.8. SOF will notify OG/CC and each Squadron Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) of RWY
  changes.
2.3. CMA/Non-Movement Area.
  2.3.1. CMA. See also LAKI13-202 Airfield Driving for vehicle operation procedures in the
  CMA, and a CMA diagram.
     2.3.1.1. The CMA is defined as the RWY, overruns, and all areas within 150 feet of the
     paved surface of the RWY and overruns. The areas between the RWY hold lines and the
     RWY are included in the CMA.
     2.3.1.2. TWR is responsible for controlling the movement of vehicles, equipment, and
     personnel in the CMA. TWR will continuously monitor the ramp net during airfield
     operating hours.
     2.3.1.3. Construction in the CMA.
         2.3.1.3.1. All construction must be pre-approved by the Airfield Manager (AFM).
         2.3.1.3.2. AMOPS will inform TWR of pertinent data, including radio call sign.
         2.3.1.3.3. Work personnel must follow all procedures listed in LAKI13-202.
         2.3.1.3.4. The 48th Civil Engineering Squadron (48 CES) will provide an escort
         vehicle for construction vehicles/personnel who do not have two-way communication
         with TWR.
     2.3.1.4. In the event of radio failure, all vehicles and personnel will exit the RWY and
     remain a minimum of 150 feet from the edge of the RWY or overruns until two-way
     radio communication with TWR is re-established.
         2.3.1.4.1. TWR will immediately notify AMOPS when two-way communications
         with any vehicle or personnel within the CMA is lost.
         2.3.1.4.2. AMOPS will respond to vehicles and personnel within the CMA when loss
         of two-way communications happens to provide an escorted departure from the
         CMA.
         2.3.1.4.3. If TWR is unable to reestablish two-way radio communication with
         personnel within the CMA, controllers shall flash the RWY lights on and off and/or
         use light gun signals to alert personnel to immediately vacate the area.
     2.3.1.5. AMOPS and 48 CES/CEF will continuously monitor the ramp and crash nets
     respectively.
  2.3.2. Non-movement area.
     2.3.2.1. The non-movement area is defined as TWYs (excluding the portion between the
     RWY and hold lines), aircraft parking areas, protected aircraft shelters and bubble
     parking areas.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             11


       2.3.2.2. The non-movement area is uncontrolled.
   2.3.3. RWY access for personnel and vehicles.
       2.3.3.1. Authorized vehicles are permitted to cross the RWY only when in direct two-
       way radio communication with TWR and verbal approval is granted by TWR.
       Authorized vehicles will only cross the RWY for mission-essential duties. To the
       maximum extent possible vehicles will use the airfield perimeter road to transit between
       the north and south sides of the airfield.
       2.3.3.2. Vehicles escorting a towed and/or emergency aircraft must be in two-way radio
       contact with TWR if a RWY crossing is required.
       2.3.3.3. Procedures for RWY access during TWR and AMOPS closures.
          2.3.3.3.1. When TWR closes, TWR will broadcast on the RAMP and CRASH
          NETS: ―ATTENTION ON THE NET, LAKENHEATH TOWER IS NOW
          CLOSED. FOR ACCESS TO THE RUNWAY, CONTACT EAGLE OPS ON THIS
          NET.‖
          2.3.3.3.2. All vehicles shall contact 48 FW/CP (call sign ―EAGLE OPS‖) when
          accessing and leaving the CMA.
          2.3.3.3.3. 48 FW/CP will monitor the RAMP and CRASH NETS and verify the
          airfield status for each vehicle, stating ―(CALL SIGN), EAGLE OPS, AIRFIELD
          CLOSED, PROCEED AT YOUR DISCRETION, USE CAUTION, REPORT OFF.‖
          or, if mistakenly called when the TWR is open ―(CALL SIGN), EAGLE OPS,
          AIRFIELD OPEN, CONTACT TOWER FOR CMA ACCESS.‖
          2.3.3.3.4. When TWR opens, TWR will broadcast on the RAMP and CRASH NETS:
          ―ATTENTION ON THE NET, LAKENHEATH TOWER IS NOW OPEN AND
          HAS CONTROL OF THE RUNWAY. ALL VEHICLES RESPOND WITH CALL
          SIGN AND POSITION IN THE CMA.‖
          2.3.3.3.5. AMOPS will conduct a RWY sweep prior to opening the airfield to ensure
          that all vehicles are accounted for in the CMA.
2.4. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   2.4.1. RWYs 24 and 06 have Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI), High Intensity
   RWY Lights (HIRL), RWY End Identifier Lights (REIL), High Intensity Approach Lights
   (HIAL), and sequenced flashing lights (SFL). An airfield beacon is located on the north side
   of the airfield.
   2.4.2. Lighting Inspections
       2.4.2.1. AMOPS will inspect airfield lighting, including obstruction lighting daily.
       2.4.2.2. 48 CES exterior lighting personnel will check the approach lighting system and
       sequenced flashing lights and report outages to AMOPS.
       2.4.2.3. AMOPS will document unserviceable light outages.
 12                                             LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


      2.4.2.4. AMOPS will contact 48 CES/CEF via telephone when outages render a lighting
      system unusable during night or low visibility flying operations outside 48 CES normal
      operating hours.
   2.4.3. 48 CES exterior lighting will report to AMOPS at 0800L hours every weekday
   morning the airfield is open to obtain the prior day’s outage report. They will also make
   every effort to repair all lighting deficiencies the same day and return to Airfield
   Management at the end of each duty day to report repairs, system status and any pertinent
   information.
   2.4.4. TWR has control of the airfield lighting panel and will operate airfield lights and
   visual aids in accordance with MMATM, FAAO 7110.65, and local operating instructions,
   for all aircraft operations.
   2.4.5. Inoperative HIAL system procedures:
      2.4.5.1. TWR will (if initially identifying the outages) advise AMOPS and all aircraft
      under their control of the outage.
      2.4.5.2. AMOPS will advise TWR, RAPCON and 48 FW/CP of airfield lighting outages,
      revised approach minima, and process a Flight Safety Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).
      2.4.5.3. RAPCON will advise LATCC Mil, and aircraft under their control, of the outage
      and revised approach minima.
      2.4.5.4. 48 FW/CP will notify 492 Fighter Squadron (FS), 493 FS, 494 FS, 56 Rescue
      Squadron (RQS) and OG/CC of the outage and revised approach minima.
      2.4.5.5. Upon restoration of the approach lights, all agencies will make the same
      notifications and advise that the normal minimums are again valid.
   2.4.6. When TWR is closed, changes to airfield lighting will be coordinated through 48
   CES/CEF who will coordinate changes with 48 CES airfield lighting personnel.
2.5. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
   2.5.1. Arresting systems are numbered one to six, starting at RWY 06-approach end E-5
   cable:
      2.5.1.1. E-5 cables (one and six) are located 95 feet into each overrun.
      2.5.1.2. Single system (50000 pounds (nominal) at 180 knots maximum) Barrier
      Arresting Kit-12s (BAK-12s) (two and five) are located 1,200 feet from the threshold on
      each end.
      2.5.1.3. Single system (50000 pounds (nominal) at 180 knots maximum) BAK-12s (three
      and four) are located 2,500 feet from the threshold on each end.
      2.5.1.4. BAK-12s are bidirectional and can be engaged from either direction. Note: The
      Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) will not be activated for practice cable
      engagements.
      2.5.1.5. BAK-12 cables are tied down across the RWY to prevent excessive cable
      bounce. A total of eight tie down straps are used per BAK-12 with four located either
      side of RWY centerline. If the cables are not tied down, 48 CES/CEOFP will notify
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             13


     TWR and AMOPS. TWR will ensure aircraft are notified, and AMOPS will issue a
     NOTAM as needed. Cables that are not tied down remain fully operational.
     Additionally, the prescribed number of tie-downs, outlined above as eight per each BAK-
     12, should be kept in use to the maximum extent possible. AMOPS will notify TWR
     and/or SOF when cable tie-downs are missing but will not suspend runway operations
     unless directed to do so by SOF, the Airfield Manager or 48 CES/CEOFP. Instead, cable
     tie-downs will be replaced as soon as possible on a non-interference basis with
     departure/recovery operations.
  2.5.2. Successive cable engagements on single system BAK-12s (cables two, three, four, and
  five) require a minimum interval of 15 minutes. No minimum time interval is established for
  successive E-5 cables (one and six). Engaged cables must be inspected, and recertified, by
  48 CES/CEOFP prior to successive engagements. Additional time may be required as the
  situation dictates. In extreme emergency situations, it is possible to have one aircraft
  engaging the departure end arresting system and a successive aircraft engaging an approach
  end arresting system. Approach end cables should not be engaged over a raised E-5 cable in
  the approach end underrun. The E-5 should first be removed. If feasible, the second aircraft
  should divert as directed by the SOF or 48 FW/CP.
     2.5.2.1. TWR must be notified of any nonstandard cable status and/or debris (cable tape
     connectors, etc.) left on the RWY.
     2.5.2.2. If a cable is needed for a subsequent engagement before checks are complete, the
     senior 48 CES/CEOFP official determines usability, and notifies TWR and AMOPS.
     2.5.2.3. Following a cable engagement with subsequent inbound emergency aircraft (that
     will not require a cable), the SOF may direct 48 CES/CEOFP to delay cable inspection
     and recertification until any emergency aircraft have landed.
  2.5.3. Normal cable configuration will be the last four cables for the RWY in use available,
  with the first two cables unavailable. The minimum arresting system requirement for fighter
  operations is at least one departure end BAK-12.
  2.5.4. Recovery of aircraft into arresting systems while other aircraft are still on the RWY
  will be at the discretion of the SOF.
  2.5.5. All cables must be removed prior to the arrival and/or departure of EC/RC-135s and
  U-2 aircraft.
  2.5.6. TWR will notify 48 CES/CEOFP when cables need to be reconfigured or if a system
  malfunction exists. Outside of normal duty hours, weekends and on holidays, TWR will
  notify 48 CES/CEF who will, in turn notify 48 CES/CEOFP.
  2.5.7. Approximately 20 minutes is required for cable reconfiguration.
  2.5.8. ATC will issue cable advisory information in accordance with FAAO 7110.65.
  2.5.9. Maintenance and inspection:
     2.5.9.1. 48 CES/CEOFP will:
         2.5.9.1.1. Perform    maintenance   inspections   using   the     applicable   technical
         orders/regulations.

  2.6.3. Airfield restrictions:
     2.6.3.1. Aircraft with a wing span greater than 63 feet are prohibited from taxiing on
     TWY Sierra, Uniform and south of the Cargo Deployment Facility located on TWY
     Victor due to the wingtip clearance required from security gates.
     2.6.3.2. No aircraft larger than A-10s (56-foot wingspan) can park on the northern
     portion of the Golf bubble due to inadequate wingtip clearance.
     2.6.3.3. Aircraft larger than an A-10 (56-foot wingspan) are prohibited from taxiing on
     TWY Whiskey when a transient aircraft larger than a C-130 (wingspan of 133 feet) is
     parked on TWY Whiskey.
     2.6.3.4. Due to the close proximity of the north-side perimeter road to TWY November
     (approximately 102 feet from centerline to road edge), aircraft with a wingspan 145 feet
     or greater (e.g. E-3) may not use TWY November while vehicles are on the road.
     2.6.3.5. Vehicular blocking procedures. When aircraft with a wingspan 145 feet or
     greater (e.g. E-3) require use of TWY November, vehicles traversing perimeter road must
     remain outside wingtip clearance requirements for TWY November.
         2.6.3.5.1. Upon notification of inbound/outbound aircraft, TWR shall notify AMOPS
         to pre-position for vehicular control.
         2.6.3.5.2. When the inbound aircraft reaches 10 mile final, or outbound aircraft calls
         for permission to taxi for departure, TWR shall turn on the perimeter road traffic
         lights and inform AMOPS to stop traffic on perimeter road.
         2.6.3.5.3. AMOPS will position themselves to stop traffic on perimeter road until the
         aircraft has taxied to park or taxied to the RWY for departure.
     2.6.3.6. In order to maintain adequate wingtip clearances aircraft with a wingspan greater
     than a C-130 (133 feet) are prohibited from taxiing off the RWY onto TWY November
     when there are aircraft in the North Arm/De-Arm areas. These aircraft shall be held on
     the RWY or given instructions to conduct a 180 degree turn on the concrete portion of the
     RWY and proceed to the opposite end Arm/De-Arm area if it is not in use.
     2.6.3.7. Security fencing north of TWY November is 141 feet from TWY centerline.
     Aircraft with a wingspan greater than 232 feet (e.g. AN-124) must have a wing walker to
     use TWY November between the Point 4 North Arm/De-Arm and Golf (see AFI 11-218,
     Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground).
  2.6.4. Heavy aircraft jet thrust avoidance procedures. There are no areas on LKH that
  require heavy jet thrust avoidance procedures. However, to avoid potential Foreign Object
  Damage (FOD) hazards, four-engine jet aircraft will shut-down/down-speed outboard
  engines on TWYs.
  2.6.5. To mitigate FOD hazards, the arm/de-arm area to the rear of a heavy aircraft executing
  a 180 degree turn on the runway must be free of aircraft.
     2.6.5.1. TWR will issue heavy aircraft the appropriate direction of turn so that aircraft
     thrust is directed toward an arm/de-arm area that is not occupied by aircraft.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                              17


       2.6.5.2. AMOPS will conduct a FOD check of the arm/de-arm area prior to that area
       being reopened for use.
2.7. ATC Facilities.
   2.7.1. Normal airfield, TWR, and AMOPS operating hours are Monday through Thursday
   0600 Local (L)-2200L and Friday 0600L-1800L. The airfield is closed on all United States
   (US) holidays and United Kingdom (UK) Bank Holidays.
   2.7.2. RAPCON operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week except as approved by the OG/CC.
   2.7.3. 48 FW/CP is the point of contact (POC) for initiating short-notice procedures to open
   the airfield outside normal operating hours.
       2.7.3.1. 48 FW/CP will request authorization from 48 OG/CC or designated
       representative.
       2.7.3.2. If authorization is granted, 48 FW/CP will then notify designated 48 OSS/OSA
       and 48 OSS/OSW representatives, who will in turn contact any additional personnel
       needed to open RAPCON (if closed), TWR, AMOPS, and 48 OSS/OSW.
       2.7.3.3. 48 FW/CP will notify any additional agencies required by the original requestor
       (e.g. TA, Fuels personnel, etc.).
       2.7.3.4. 48 OSS/OSA will identify designated representatives (see 2.7.3.2.) in writing to
       48 FW/CP.
       2.7.3.5. The response time for 48 OSS/OSA personnel to open facilities is 90 minutes.
   2.7.4. OG/CC approval is required for any wing or transient operation (including aircraft
   diverts from MLD) that requires the airfield be open outside of published hours. For
   operations during quiet hours, see paragraph 2.19. Note: OG/CC approval may be obtained
   via the approval of the flying schedule. Aircraft requiring the airfield be open more than 30
   minutes after the approved scheduled time will require separate approval (see paragraph
   2.7.3.). The airfield will not remain open, and no ATC instructions will be issued without
   OG/CC approval. TWR will issue an advisory that TWR and the airfield are closed, and
   recommend termination of operations if necessary.
       2.7.4.1. TWR and AMOPS will open the RWY 60 minutes prior to an aircraft’s
       Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) or Estimated Time of Departure (ETD).
       2.7.4.2. For departures, the airfield will remain open for 30 minutes after last departure
       or once the aircraft has exited RAPCON’s airspace.
       2.7.4.3. For arrivals, the airfield will remain open for 30 minutes after last landing or
       when advised by the pilot of engine shut-down whichever is first.
   2.7.5. Both TWR and AMOPS must be on-duty for aircraft operations except in accordance
   with Attachment 2, Uncontrolled Airfield Operations.

  2.16.3. AMOPS will verify the RSC by physically inspecting the RWY as required and
  when requested by the SOF or TWR and report it in accordance with AFI 13-204 Volume 3
  in addition to the methods outlined below.
     2.16.3.1. AMOPS determines whether the RWY is wet or dry by driving down the RWY
     20 feet on each side of the centerline. Methods used to check the RWY include
     physically touching the RWY surface for water, observing visible patches, ponding or
     standing water, observing spray off of a vehicle or observing pavement discoloration.
     When discoloration is noted moisture should be verified through physical means, i.e.
     touching runway surface.
     2.16.3.2. LKH’s Porous Friction Surface (PFS) has increased friction characteristics
     resulting in improved braking action during wet runway conditions when compared to
     normal concrete runway surfaces. The increased PFS friction characteristics have been
     validated with flood testing at a depth of up to 1mm through independent testing. Testing
     has shown that when the PFS is wet with 1mm of water on the surface it provides a
     friction level equivalent to RCR 20.
        2.16.3.2.1. Utilizing TOLD corresponding to the actual friction characteristics of the
        runway allows aircrew to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the PFS runway
        and operate with increased safety and effectiveness.
        2.16.3.2.2. Standardized RSC measurements are critical to ensuring aircrew use
        accurate TOLD data. Airfield Management will use the following criteria to help
        standardize the RSC status.
            2.16.3.2.2.1. ―Dry Runway‖- Observer should be able to see the texture of the
            runway. Moisture should not be present on any surface used to test the runway,
            i.e. hand, napkin, etc.
            2.16.3.2.2.2. ―Wet Runway‖- Observer should be able to see the texture of the
            runway. Moisture should be present on any surface used to test the runway, i.e.
            hand, napkin, etc. No standing water should be present.
            2.16.3.2.2.3. ―Wet Runway with Standing Water‖- At least 1 millimeter of water
            must be present when testing areas on the runway to constitute standing water.
            Only report standing water if 1 millimeter of water or more is present. When
            Airfield Management observes a reflection or glassy type surface instead of
            seeing the texture of the runway or when they observe evidence of raindrop
            splashes on the surface, they should test water depth and report RSC accordingly.
            Airfield Management personnel will not report depth of water in millimeters. If
            standing water is present, simply use the ―Wet Runway with Standing Water‖
            phraseology while estimating to the nearest 1/10 of an inch to remain IAW AFI
            13-204 Volume 3.
     2.16.3.3. RSC will always be provided for both surfaces of the RWY, due to their
     significantly different frictional characteristics. The first value will be for the concrete
     surface and the second value for the PFS. ATC will report RSC to aircraft stating,
     ―CONCRETE SURFACE (WET/DRY), POROUS FRICTION SURFACE
     (WET/DRY).‖

   2.16.4. AMOPS will determine RSCs and RCRs in accordance with AFI 13-204 Volume 3
   and relay information to TWR and 48 OSS/OSW.
   2.16.5. Locally assigned aircraft are not authorized to taxi, takeoff, or land when an RCR is
   less than 12, unless approved by 48 OG/CC or designated representative.
   2.16.6. ATC will issue RCR information in accordance with FAAO 7110.65.
   2.16.7. Every effort should be made to allow AMOPS personnel to check the RSCs and
   RCR during rapidly changing conditions. If AMOPS personnel feel the RSC or RCR value
   has potentially changed to become a hazard to operations, they should invalidate the previous
   reported condition and advise TWR.
2.17. Procedures/Requirements for RWY Inspections/Checks. In accordance with AFI 13-
204 Volume 3 and local checklists, AMOPS will conduct daily airfield inspections and
additional airfield checks (as required) in response to in-flight emergencies, to examine RCR,
FOD, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH), construction, daytime and nighttime airfield lighting
serviceability, and any other items affecting the status of the airfield.
2.18. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures.
   2.18.1. If the airfield is open, MOC will inform TWR of all engine runs and pass the aircraft
   tail number and location prior to start of engine run, and advise when engine run is
   terminated.
   2.18.2. When the airfield is closed, the agency responsible for conducting an engine run
   must notify SFCC. Note: Engine runs will not normally be approved during UK quiet hours.
   2.18.3. Transient aircraft engine runs.
       2.18.3.1. Transient aircraft engine runs will be pre-coordinated with the AFM. Engine
       runs up to 80 percent power will be performed on Victor Ramp or TWY Whiskey.
       2.18.3.2. If required, full-power engine runs will be performed on the RWY.
       2.18.3.3. AMOPS will notify TWR of all approved engine runs.
       2.18.3.4. Should an aircraft request an uncoordinated engine run, TWR will obtain
       location/power settings and coordinate with AMOPS.
2.19. Quiet Hours/Noise Abatement Procedures.
   2.19.1. UK quiet hour and noise abatement procedures are published in United States Air
   Forces Europe (USAFE) Instruction (USAFEI) 11-201, Flying Operations Conducted at
   USAF-Occupied Royal Air Force (RAF) Installations in the United Kingdom (UK). The
   following paragraphs are in addition to these procedures and in the event of any conflicts,
   USAFEI 11-201 takes precedence.
   2.19.2. All fixed-wing aircraft, including transients, are prohibited from flying VFR patterns
   between the end of civil twilight (after sunset) to the beginning of civil twilight (before
   sunrise) due to noise abatement considerations for base housing. IFR patterns, to include
   numerous practice approaches, are permitted during normal airfield operating times.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                           23


  2.19.3. Cross-country aircraft recovering on Saturday, Sunday, US or UK holidays are
  limited to one straight-in approach (Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) approach, visual straight-
  in) to a full-stop landing.
  2.19.4. Maximum performance takeoffs will not be made at LKH, or off-station, except for
  functional check flights and incentive flights. Additional exceptions require OG/CC
  approval for missions at LKH, or squadron commander (SQ/CC) approval when off-station.
  Note: Weather requirement for maximum performance takeoffs is at least a 2000 foot
  ceiling and 5000 meters visibility, and the ability to recover in Visual Meteorological
  Conditions (VMC).
  2.19.5. Aircrew will avoid over-flying local towns or villages below 3000 feet above ground
  level (AGL) (such as Ely and Ely Cathedral, Lakenheath, Thetford, Hockwold, Croxton Park
  and Weeting) when operating Visual Flight Rules (VFR). When operating in VMC under the
  direction of a controlling agency, pilots should request avoidance vectors.
  2.19.6. Aircrew will avoid over-flying Brandon or Santon Downham below 5000 feet AGL
  and will avoid this area laterally by half (½) a nautical mile (NM). This restriction is not
  required if the aircrew is established on a precision or non-precision final approach to RWY
  24 (VMC or Instrument Meteorological Conditions [IMC]).
  2.19.7. After departing RWY 24 aircrew will ensure that they are at least one Distance
  Measuring Equipment (DME) and prior to the cut out canal (a large drainage ditch located at
  approximately one DME from RWY 06 approach end) before turning.
  2.19.8. After departing RWY 06 via the ROCK 1 Departure Procedure (DP) off-route
  deviations may be approved upon all flight elements passing 10 DME, traffic permitting.
  2.19.9. After departing RWY 06 via the EAGLES 2 DP, off-route deviations may be
  approved passing 10 DME, traffic permitting.
  2.19.10. Special quiet hours.
     2.19.10.1. Special quiet hours are determined by the 48th Maintenance Group
     Commander (48 MXG/CC) and 48 OG/CC and are normally relayed through the SOF
     and by NOTAM. Special quiet hour procedures must be routed through 48 OSS/OSOS
     not later than (NLT) noon, three weeks prior to the event start date. The request must
     include the type of event, location, and expected start and end times (in Local and Zulu).
     Any changes to information submitted in the request must be forwarded to 48 OSS/OSOS
     as soon as possible or the change request may be disapproved.
     2.19.10.2. 48 OSS/OSOS will determine, based on the information in the request, what
     types of operations will be restricted to provide a reasonable balance between flying
     operations and reduced noise for the event. Before forwarding the request to the 48
     OG/CC and the 48 MXG/CC, 48 OSS/OSOS will assign a quiet hour code from the
     following list:
         2.19.10.2.1. Code A: No takeoffs, landings, engine runs, taxis, or Aerospace Ground
         Equipment (AGE) equipment operation. No noise on the airfield.
         2.19.10.2.2. Code B: No takeoffs, engine runs, AGE equipment operation or taxis on
         the south side of the RWY. Landings straight in to a full stop, hold on the north side
         of the RWY.

          2.19.10.2.3. Code C: No takeoffs or taxis on south side of the RWY. Landings
          straight in to a full stop, hold on the north side of the RWY. No engine runs or AGE
          equipment operation near (location of event).
          2.19.10.2.4. Code D: No takeoffs. Landings straight in to a full stop. (Used for
          LKH indoor events and MLD quiet hours).
          2.19.10.2.5. Code E: No takeoffs, multiple VFR patterns or MLD over flight. (Used
          for MLD quiet hours).
          2.19.10.2.6. Code F: No takeoffs or MLD over flight. (Used for MLD quiet hours).
          2.19.10.2.7. Code G: No MLD over flight. (Used for MLD quiet hours).
      2.19.10.3. Notifications when approved.
          2.19.10.3.1. 48 OSS/OSOS will notify the flying squadrons, 48 OSS/OSA, 48
          OG/OGV, MOC, and 48th Maintenance Operations Flight, Plans, Scheduling, and
          Documentation (48 MOS/MXOOP).
          2.19.10.3.2. 48 OG/OGV will ensure the SOF is aware of any restrictions during
          operations.
          2.19.10.3.3. 48 MOS/MXOOP will distribute the information to appropriate ―noise
          producing‖ units.
          2.19.10.3.4. AMOPS will send a NOTAM and relay times and/or restrictions to
          TWR, RAPCON, flying squadrons and pertinent aircraft.
      2.19.10.4. The SOF and/or MOC will determine if an activity (i.e. engine run, taxi) can
      be conducted during quiet hours. The SOF will contact OG/CC if any deviations to
      special event quiet hour policy are required.
          2.19.10.4.1. The SOF is the POC for aircraft ground (engine start and taxi) and flying
          operations.
          2.19.10.4.2. MOC is the POC for maintenance operations during quiet hours.
2.20. Precision Approach Critical Area Protection.
   2.20.1. See AFI 13-204 Volume 3 for weather minimums and specifics regarding protection
   of precision approach critical areas.
   2.20.2. In accordance with AFI 13-204 Volume 3, there are four critical areas to protect.
   ICAO standards are used to define the dimensions of the areas to be protected for the RWY
   24 glideslope and localizer. FAA criteria is used to define the dimensions of the areas to be
   protected for the RWY 06 glideslope and localizer. Note: Using FAA criteria for the RWY
   06 glideslope prevents protecting an area that would interfere with highway A1065 traffic.
   See Figure 2.1. for ILS critical areas.
   2.20.3. The ATIS may include instrument hold line restrictions to protect the ILS critical
   areas near point 4 north/south and PT 1 north/south. TWR will issue hold-short instructions
   to taxiing aircraft and place an advisory on the ATIS as required. When critical area
   protection is necessary, entry into the north side arm/de-arm areas may be restricted.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                              25


  2.20.4. Localizer Critical Areas: TWR will activate the loop road traffic lights to protect
  precision approach critical areas when aircraft are 6-mile final to RWY 24 on an ILS
  approach, until the aircraft has landed or gone missed approach. See AFI 13-204 Volume 3
  for protecting precision approach critical areas.
  2.20.5. Glideslope Critical Areas:
     2.20.5.1. Procedures for securing the glideslope critical area when the Critical Area
     Light is operational:
         2.20.5.1.1. TWR shall activate the ILS glideslope critical area lights and instruct
         taxiing aircraft to hold short of the instrument hold lines under the conditions detailed
         in AFI 13-204 Volume 3, for protecting precision approach critical areas.
         2.20.5.1.2. TWR will also make an appropriate notification on the ATIS broadcast.
     2.20.5.2. Procedures for securing the glideslope critical area when the critical area light
     is inoperative:
         2.20.5.2.1. 48 OSS/OSA will provide or coordinate for security detail personnel to
         stop vehicular traffic at all ILS hold lines/traffic lights for the RWY in use.
         2.20.5.2.2. TWR will:
         2.20.5.2.2.1. Advise AMOPS when critical area lights are inoperative and warrant
         activation of the critical area security detail.
             2.20.5.2.2.2. Establish radio contact with each member of the security detail on
             the ramp net.
             2.20.5.2.2.3. Instruct the security detail to ―SECURE THE CRITICAL AREA‖
             prior to an aircraft on an ILS approach reaching the final approach fix (FAF).
             2.20.5.2.2.4. Not allow an aircraft on an ILS approach to proceed past the FAF
             until the security detail advises ―CRITICAL AREA SECURE‖.
             2.20.5.2.2.5. Instruct the security detail to ―RELEASE THE CRITICAL AREA‖
             after subject aircraft has landed.
             2.20.5.2.2.6. Advise AMOPS when the security detail is no longer needed.
         2.20.5.2.3. AMOPS will:
             2.20.5.2.3.1. Supervise the security detail and conduct detailed augmentee
             training.
             2.20.5.2.3.2. Use appropriate number of personnel for RWY in use to assist in the
             ILS glideslope critical area security detail.
             2.20.5.2.3.3. Issue an frequency modulation (FM) radio to each member of the
             detail.
             2.20.5.2.3.4. Deploy the detail to the appropriate glideslope critical area security
             points.
             2.20.5.2.3.5. Ensure a member of the security detail establishes radio contact with
             TWR on the ramp net.

              2.20.5.2.3.6. Ensure each member of the detail stops all vehicle traffic from
              proceeding into the glideslope critical area when advised by TWR to ―SECURE
              THE CRITICAL AREA.‖
              2.20.5.2.3.7. Advise TWR ―CRITICAL AREA SECURE‖ when the vehicle is
              clear of the glideslope critical area.
              2.20.5.2.3.8. Allow traffic to proceed when TWR advises ―RELEASE THE
              CRITICAL AREA.‖
              2.20.5.2.3.9. Terminate the detail when advised by TWR it is no longer needed.
2.21. Restricted Areas on the Airfield. Restricted areas on LKH airfield are described in 48
FW Plan 31-101, Integrated Defense Plan (IDP).
2.22. Opening/Closing/Suspending RWY Operations.
   2.22.1. AMOPS, TWR WS/SC or the SOF have the authority to suspend operations to the
   RWY. See Para 9.4. for suspending RWY operations for emergencies.
   2.22.2. Because heavy aircraft movements may cause the RWY to be contaminated with
   foreign objects, TWR shall suspend runway operations immediately after a heavy aircraft (C-
   17, B-1, B-2, B-747, E-4, C-5, AN-124) arrival or departure (not including touch-and-go or
   low approaches). AMOPS shall conduct a FOD sweep and notify TWR when RWY
   operations may be resumed. Prior to a FOD sweep being completed, the SOF may authorize
   F-15 aircraft to cross the runway in areas where the heavy aircraft did not touch down; i.e. on
   the aircraft’s approach over the first thousand feet of RWY. However, the SOF does not
   have authority to waive a heavy aircraft arrival FOD sweep.
   2.22.3. In an emergency situation, AMOPS, TWR WS/SC or the SOF will suspend RWY
   operations. AMOPS must perform a visual inspection of the RWY surface after the
   emergency aircraft lands. The SOF has the authority to temporarily waive a RWY sweep
   (FOD check). If the SOF exercises this authority, he/she assumes responsibility for
   operations until FOD check has been accomplished. Para 9.4. also addresses suspending
   RWY operations for emergencies.
   2.22.4. Only the AFM or designated representative may open/close or resume operations
   after suspension of RWY operations except as described in Chapter 9.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             27


                                          Chapter 3

                                      FLYING AREAS

3.1. Local Flying Area/VFR Local Training Areas. The 48 FW local flying area is defined as
the airspace over the entire UK and the adjacent water area to the Flight Information Region
(FIR)/upper FIR boundaries including the Dutch Temporary Reserve Airspace (TRAs),
excluding all of Ireland.
3.2. Air Traffic Zone (ATZ).
   3.2.1. TWR is the controlling agency for the ATZ.
   3.2.2. ATZ dimensions are that airspace within 2.5 NM from the center of the airfield and
   from the ground to 2000 feet AGL.
   3.2.3. Unusual maneuvers are not authorized in LKH ATZ airspace except as specifically
   authorized by local operating procedures. Unusual maneuvers include any intentional
   maneuver involving an abrupt change in an aircraft’s attitude, an abnormal altitude, or
   abnormal acceleration not necessary for normal flight. Unusual maneuvers will not be
   approved unless they are essential to performance of flight in ATZ airspace. All requests
   must be coordinated through 48 OSS/OSA and approved by 48 OG/CC.
3.3. Combined Military Aerodrome Traffic Zone (CMATZ).
   3.3.1. RAPCON is the controlling agency for the CMATZ excluding airspace contained with
   LKH and Mildenhall ATZs.
   3.3.2. The CMATZ, shown in Figure 3.1., is the airspace within 5 NM of the mid-point of
   both LKH’s and MLD’s RWYs, from the surface to 3000 feet AGL. This airspace includes
   ―stubs‖ which are projected from the 5 NM radius aligned with the instrument final approach
   path and have a length of 5 NM. The stubs are 4 NM wide at LKH (2 NM either side of the
   centerline) and 7 NM wide at MLD (2 NM north and 5 NM south of centerline) and include
   the vertical airspace from 1000 feet above field elevation to 3000 feet above field elevation.
28                                             LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


Figure 3.1. CMATZ.




  3.3.3. Military aircraft intending CMATZ penetration must receive a clearance from
  Lakenheath Approach prior to entering the CMATZ. Caution: Civil aircraft may fly
  through the CMATZ without the prior knowledge or consent of Lakenheath Approach. Due
  to the close proximity of various airfields, aircrew should make every effort to see, avoid,
  and remain cognizant of other traffic, especially when LKH is using RWY 24 and MLD is
  using RWY 29.
  3.3.4. The CMATZ is encompassed by Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. RAPCON provides
  ATC services to aircraft upon request within the Class G airspace within a 40 NM radius
  from LKH at or below FL195.
  3.3.5. Control instructions from radar controllers to all military aircraft operating in or en
  route to the CMATZ are mandatory to ensure that the required separation minima is
  maintained.
  3.3.6. For formation recoveries when VFR pattern is closed, formation flight leads will
  advise LATCC Mil of formation recovery intention, i.e. formation or radar trail.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                              29


3.4. Types of Service.
   3.4.1. The airspace in East Anglia, including the Lakenheath CMATZ, is predominately
   Class G, which is uncontrolled airspace. Because of this, LKH RAPCON uses procedures
   outlined in the CAP 774 and FAAO 7110.65.
   3.4.2. The types of service available to aircraft in Class G airspace are Deconfliction Service
   (DS), Traffic Service (TS), Procedural service (PS), and Basic Service (BS) in accordance
   with CAP 774. LKH RAPCON uses a radar Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) chart for
   aircraft under DS and will not issue altitude clearances below the MVA. See Figure 3.2.
   Further, LKH RAPCON will not vector aircraft under TS when the aircraft is below the
   MVA. Note: Aircraft departing or free-calling RAPCON should expect TS until another
   radar service is agreed upon.

Figure 3.2. MVA Chart.

3.5. Separation from Adjacent Airspace. When coordinating traffic with an adjacent facility,
a minimum of 1000 feet or 3 NM separation may be applied between military facilities (LKH,
Marham, Wattisham, LATCC Mil, and Norwich Class D) and 1000 feet and 5 NM between a
military and a civilian facility (Norwich and RAF Wyton).
3.6. Separation of Aircraft.
   3.6.1. Regardless of service type, aircraft executing an instrument/IFR procedure will be
   afforded 1000 feet and/or 3 NM separation from other aircraft executing instrument/IFR
   procedure. Additional separation will be added for the required spacing and application of
   wake turbulence and/or formation flights. Note: The reduced vertical separation of 500 feet
   listed in MMATM will not be applied by LKH RAPCON controllers to 48 FW aircraft.
   3.6.2. Aircraft in the TWR pattern will be issued traffic information to the maximum extent
   possible, however, the provisions of paragraph 3.6.1. do not apply. It is the pilot’s
   responsibility to ―see and avoid.‖ Aircrew should remain vigilant of their proximity to the
   MLD approach/departure corridors to avoid possible Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance
   System (TCAS) resolutions.
   3.6.3. Aircraft receiving service from RAPCON will be provided the full separation standard
   required by the level of service being offered.
   3.6.4. During periods of surveillance radar outage, RAPCON will provide procedural service
   separation between known aircraft. During periods of surveillance radar outages, all aircraft
   can expect to recover to a full stop.

   4.1.3. International Flight Plans. All 48 FW flying units may fax their Department of
   Defense (DD) Form 1801, DOD International Flight Plan, to AMOPS for processing.
   Although a minimum of 2 hours prior to ETD is required to process flight plans, the Foreign
   Clearance Guide recommends international flight plans be filed at least one day prior.
4.2. Calculated Takeoff Time (CTOT). European airspace is overcrowded on most occasions,
and is especially saturated during the summer months and holidays. When required, and in order
to manage demand the Central Flow Management Unit in Brussels, Belgium calculates and
issues a CTOT to AMOPS (see 6.1.5.).
4.3. Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA).
   4.3.1. MARSA is a condition whereby the military services involved assume responsibility
   for separation between participating military aircraft in the ATC system. It is used only for
   required IFR operations, and the following guidelines will be followed when MARSA is
   employed:
       4.3.1.1. Flight leads must plan and brief/coordinate with all flights involved in the
       operation.
       4.3.1.2. Mission commanders will ensure all participants are familiar with 2 NM
       maximum spacing between elements of non-standard formations.
       4.3.1.3. Flight leads are encouraged to coordinate with ATC as far in advance as
       possible.
   4.3.2. MARSA cannot be invoked or denied indiscriminately by pilots or controllers.

                                    GROUND MOVEMENT

5.1. Aircraft Taxiing Routes/Restrictions.
   5.1.1. Taxi speed is restricted to 25 knots (or aircraft limits) on all TWYs, Taxilanes and
   Taxitracks. Do not exceed 15 knots ground speed in parking areas or ramps.
   5.1.2. Opposite direction taxi operations must be approved by the ground controller.
   5.1.3. Transient helicopters with wheels will land on the RWY and ground taxi to parking,
   unless otherwise approved for hover/air taxi by TWR.
5.2. Startup/Taxi Procedures.
   5.2.1. Monitor ground control frequency (CH 2/375.45) during engine start.
   5.2.2. Monitor ATIS (356.725) prior to calling for taxi instructions.
   5.2.3. Contact ground control for taxi prior to leaving the hardstands; state call sign, number
   of aircraft in flight, ATIS code, and parking locations.
       5.2.3.1. Notify ground control if any part of the flight will taxi separately.
       5.2.3.2. Acknowledge the active RWY issued in taxi instructions.
       5.2.3.3. Include call signs of flight members if not filed as a single flight.
   5.2.4. USAF aircraft will not depart without a flight plan on file at AMOPS. RAF and other
   foreign country aircraft may depart VFR without a flight plan on file, if the flight will remain
   within the confines of UK island mainland.
       5.2.4.1. The SOF may approve local aircraft to taxi without a flight plan on file. TWR
       will advise AMOPS of a ―no flight plan‖ aircraft.
       5.2.4.2. AMOPS will enquire with the appropriate FS, 48 FW/CP and/or SOF for
       resolution and further instructions if necessary.
   5.2.5. Pilots will not taxi/depart unless radio communications can be maintained with TWR.
   5.2.6. Taxi on TWY/taxilane/taxitrack centerline (staggered taxi not authorized.)
   5.2.7. Taxi direction in all protected aircraft parking areas will be clockwise unless approved
   by ground control. Note: Back taxiing on TWY Romeo is not authorized.
   5.2.8. Unless mission needs dictate otherwise, use arming area nearest departure RWY.

                      IFR/VFR DEPARTURE PROCEDURES (DPS)

6.1. General DPs.
   6.1.1. TWR is the approving authority for operations within the Lakenheath ATZ.
   6.1.2. LKH departures enter Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. IFR clearances are not issued
   for the portion of flight into uncontrolled airspace. IFR separation will be provided between
   known aircraft.
   6.1.3. Intersection departures are not authorized.
   6.1.4. TWR will relay amended departure instructions as issued by RAPCON departure
   controller.
   6.1.5. CTOT (see also chapter 4).
      6.1.5.1. AMOPS will coordinate General Air Traffic (GAT) CTOTs.
      6.1.5.2. Aircraft must takeoff within 5 minutes before or 10 minutes after a CTOT.
      6.1.5.3. If an aircraft is unable to meet its CTOT, AMOPS will coordinate for a new
      CTOT.
      6.1.5.4. Aircrew will inform ground control of a CTOT by stating ―CALCULATED
      TAKEOFF TIME‖ when starting engines.
   6.1.6. Aircrew requesting an unrestricted climb will coordinate with ground control prior to
   taxiing.
   6.1.7. All aircraft will remain on ground control frequency until a squawk is issued.
   6.1.8. A SOF is required for F-15 departures IAW AFI 11-418 Lakenheath Supplement,
   Operations Supervision.
   6.1.9. Locally assigned aircraft may only depart via radar vectors, DPs, 24V departure or
   VFR Low Level (VLL) departure.
   6.1.10. Protection of 360-degree overhead. All aircraft will maintain at or below 1000 feet
   until passing departure end of RWY, to protect the 360-degree overhead pattern.
   6.1.11. Locally assigned aircraft will notify TWR ten minutes prior to being ready for
   departure.
   6.1.12. 48 FW aircraft will:
      6.1.12.1. Establish a positive climb angle to reduce noise level in nearby communities.
      6.1.12.2. During formation join-ups, do not reduce the climb rate for acceleration and
      overtake.
      6.1.12.3. Terminate afterburner at 300 knots indicated airspeed if not carrying heavy
      weights or performing an unrestricted climb (all wingmen will comply).
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                            35


6.2. IFR Departure Procedures.
   6.2.1. IFR departures will be allocated squawks as assigned by LATCC Mil and RAPCON.
   6.2.2. Departure instructions will normally be ―(Aircraft ID) (ROCK1/EAGLES 2)
   DEPARTURE APPROVED.‖
      6.2.2.1. EAGLES 2 DP is for 48 FW fixed wing aircraft only. Controllers will only issue
      EAGLES 2 DP when RWY 06 is in use and STANTA is inactive or active up to 2500
      feet.
      6.2.2.2. When STANTA is active above 2500 feet MSL, RWY 06 departures shall be
      limited to the ROCK 1 DP to ensure clearance.
   6.2.3. Aircraft will maintain RWY heading at or below 1000 feet MSL until crossing the
   departure end of the RWY.
6.3. VFR DPs.
   6.3.1. VLL departure:
      6.3.1.1. ―(Aircraft ID) VFR LOW LEVEL APPROVED, SQUAWK 7001‖ indicates
      approval to depart the CMATZ via VLL Departure, see Figure 6.1.
      6.3.1.2. VLL departures will remain on TWR frequency, squawk mode three code 7001,
      climb and maintain 1300 feet MSL to Charlie and call departing the ATZ. Note: VLLs
      must be booked with AMOPS prior to taxi/departure. ATC will not make changes to
      flight plans when aircraft are taxiing or ready for departure. Aircrew can accomplish this
      by contacting squadron ops or SOF.
      6.3.1.3. Departing RWY 24, execute a right turn at 1 DME avoiding Lakenheath village.
      6.3.1.4. Departing RWY 06, execute a left turn at departure end and fly standard ground
      track to Charlie.
      6.3.1.5. To remain low level, pilots must have booked into the appropriate low fly areas
      and comply with the flow arrows. Aircraft canceling a DP and requesting VLL must
      have booked into low fly areas through their squadron operations.
      6.3.1.6. During Fen Restricted Pattern procedures, climb to 2500 feet MSL. Minimum
      weather is 3000-foot ceiling and 8000 meters visibility. Fen Restricted Pattern
      procedures are effective by 48 FW Safety Read File. Note: Aircraft departing on the
      VLL will not receive radar services from LATCC Mil.
   6.3.2. 24V departure, see Figure 6.1.:
      6.3.2.1. ―(Aircraft ID) 24 VICTOR APPROVED‖ indicates approval to depart the
      CMATZ via the 24V departure, see Figure 6.1.
      6.3.2.2. The 24V is a local procedure designed to expedite departures and available only
      to 48 FW assigned aircraft. When requested it allows aircraft to depart VFR on RWY 24
      to pick up the IFR portion of a flight plan when conflicting traffic inbound/outbound to
      MLD would normally cause an ATC ―hold for release.‖
      6.3.2.3. 48 FW aircraft may file for the 24V or if filed for a ROCK 1 departure, a 24V
      may be requested.
 36                                              LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


          6.3.2.3.1. 48 FW aircraft do not have to be booked through LATCC MIL to use the
          24V, they may request it at any time as long as the minimum weather requirements
          are available.
          6.3.2.3.2. 48 FW aircraft requesting the 24V must still wait for a LATCC assigned
          squawk before they receive departure clearance unless they waive LATCC service.
          Note: The only difference with the 24V is that it allows RAPCON to reduce the
          required radar cutoffs (which protect arrivals, departures and missed approach
          corridors at MLD).
          6.3.2.3.3. RAPCON may impose a ―hold for release‖ with aircraft requesting a 24V
          departure at their discretion.
          6.3.2.3.4. TWR must obtain LATCC Mil squawk from RAPCON.
          6.3.2.3.5. Depart on a heading of 240 degrees. Cross LKH 1 DME at or below 1000
          feet, turn right direct Charlie, cross Charlie at 1500 feet. Then, climb VMC to at or
          above 2000 feet. Upon passing Feltwell, turn to a track of 060 degrees to intercept
          LKH R-026, cross LKH R-026/13 DME at or below FL 190. Depart VMC or as
          instructed. Note: TS is the only service available until passing Charlie. Aircraft
          must remain VFR until DS is available.
          6.3.2.3.6. Avoid direct over-flight of the RAF Feltwell satellite tracking facility.
      6.3.2.4. During Fen Restricted Pattern Procedures, climb to 2500 feet MSL. Minimum
      weather is 3000-foot ceiling and 8000 meters visibility. Fen Restricted Pattern
      procedures are effective by 48 FW Safety Read File.
6.4. VFR Departure Weather Minimums.
   6.4.1. VLL weather minimums are at least 1800-foot ceiling and 8000 meters visibility.

6.5. Formation DPs.
   6.5.1. All formation departure (standard or non-standard) elements are MARSA.
   6.5.2. Upon initial contact, aircrews will advise Tower when requesting a formation take-off.
   6.5.3. A standard formation is defined as the formation elements are contained within 1 NM
   laterally, and at the same level or altitude within 100 ft vertically.
   6.5.4. Non-standard formation departure procedures are the ―norm‖ at LKH.
      6.5.4.1. Non-standard formation departures will be no more than 20 second spacing
      between each element. Lateral separation between the lead and last element will not
      exceed 3 NM for 2-ship, 6 NM for a 3-ship, 9 NM for a 4-ship, unless pre-coordinated
      and approved by ATC.

      6.5.4.2. Upon initial contact, aircrews will advise Tower of their element spacing (if
      other than as defined in 6.5.4.1), i.e. ―(Callsign), NON-STANDARD, (number MILE)
      TRAIL‖.
   6.5.5. Non-standard formation flight lead and last element will squawk their flights ATC
   assigned Mode 3A code.
6.6. Transient Departure Instructions.
   6.6.1. Departure instructions will be ―(aircraft ID), DEPART THE RAF LAKENHEATH
   MATZ VIA (DP name) DEPARTURE (or RAPCON assigned radar vectors and altitude),
   CROSS DEPARTURE END AT OR BELOW 1000 EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE
   EN-ROUTE. DEPARTURE FREQUENCY WILL BE 250.3/136.5, ADVISE 10 MINUTES
   PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FOR COORDINATION FOR SQUAWK‖ (as assigned by
   LATCC Mil).
   6.6.2. Airway joining clearances are obtained from the departure facility when departing
   aircraft join the airway within 10 minutes of departure.
   6.6.3. TWR will instruct transient aircraft to cross departure end of RWY at or below 1000
   feet (see 6.1.10.).
   6.6.4. Non-locally assigned aircraft VFR departures: State route of flight and altitude
   requested when taxiing. Departures must adhere to noise abatement procedures. TWR will
   instruct aircraft to advise 10 minutes prior to departure for RAPCON coordination. TWR
   will coordinate VFR requests with RAPCON. RAPCON must approve VFR departures due
   to aircraft transitions through the CMATZ. Expect frequency change to RAPCON on
   departure for traffic advisories, unless TWR has conflicting traffic.
      6.6.4.1. RWY 24: TWR will issue the following instructions: ―VFR DEPARTURE
      AUTHORIZED, AT 1 DME/MILE TURN RIGHT HEADING 360 FOR NOISE
      ABATEMENT, CONTACT DEPARTURE 250.3 FOR TRAFFIC ADVISORIES.‖
      6.6.4.2. RWY 06: TWR will issue the following instructions: ―VFR DEPARTURE
      AUTHORIZED, ON DEPARTURE FLY HEADING 075 FOR NOISE ABATEMENT,
      CONTACT DEPARTURE 250.3 FOR TRAFFIC ADVISORIES.‖
6.7. Aborted Takeoffs.
   6.7.1. Aborted takeoffs automatically cancel takeoff clearance for all remaining elements in
   the flight. Takeoff clearance for any remaining elements must be reissued prior to
   reattempting takeoff.
   6.7.2. Pilots will call ―Cable, Cable, Cable‖ on TWR/departure frequency if a barrier
   engagement is anticipated.

                            IFR/VFR ARRIVAL PROCEDURES

7.1. Arrival Procedures.
   7.1.1. The constraints of local controlled airspace and danger area airspace dictate that
   arrival and pattern procedures be followed diligently.
   7.1.2. Pilots returning to base, whether VFR or IFR, will contact Lakenheath Approach as
   soon as possible with intentions. Unless operational necessity exists, aircraft shall not exceed
   350 knots within 20 miles of LKH.
7.2. Aircraft Recall Procedures.
   7.2.1. During a wing recall, all F-15 aircraft can expect recovery via radar trail procedures.
   7.2.2. The SOF may direct full stop landings.
   7.2.3. In order to keep aircrew informed of changing situations that affect airborne aircraft,
   TWR will request RAPCON and LATCC Mil (through RAPCON) broadcast messages when
   advised by the SOF or 48 FW/CP. Additionally, Distress and Diversion (D&D) may
   broadcast on 243.0.
      7.2.3.1. Aircraft recall: ―ATTENTION ALL RAF LAKENHEATH AIRCRAFT, THIS
      IS A WEATHER RECALL.                  RETURN TO BASE IMMEDIATELY.
      ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE TO COMMAND POST, SOF, OR
      AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLING AGENCY.‖
      7.2.3.2. Change of alternate: ―ATTENTION ALL RAF LAKENHEATH AIRCRAFT,
      THE WEATHER ALTERNATE HAS CHANGED TO ________. ACKNOWLEDGE
      RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE TO COMMAND POST, SOF, OR YOUR AIR
      TRAFFIC CONTROLLING AGENCY.‖
      7.2.3.3. Aircraft accountability check: ―ATTENTION ALL RAF LAKENHEATH
      AIRCRAFT, THIS IS AN AIRCRAFT ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK.
      ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGE TO COMMAND POST, SOF, OR
      THROUGH YOUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLING AGENCY AND CONFIRM
      CALL SIGN.‖
      7.2.3.4. Aircraft diversions: ―ATTENTION ALL RAF LAKENHEATH AIRCRAFT,
      DIVERT IN PROGRESS. CONTACT COMMAND POST, SOF, OR YOUR AIR
      TRAFFIC CONTROLLING AGENCY IMMEDIATELY.‖
7.3. Approach Procedures Provided to 48 FW Aircraft.
   7.3.1. LKH RAPCON will provide approach services using the following procedures.
      7.3.1.1. Handoff from LATCC Mil: On initial contact, RAPCON shall assign the
      aircraft to channel 10 (LKH approach) normally accomplished 40 NM from airfield.
      7.3.1.2. Handoff to arrival: RAPCON shall instruct aircraft to contact LKH arrival on
      channel 11, normally accomplished 20 NM from the airfield.
 40                                              LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


   7.3.2. Aircraft executing a missed approach/standard climb-out will contact LKH arrival on
   channel 11.
   7.3.3. Flights desiring a single frequency approach must make such a request upon initial
   contact with LKH approach channel 10 or through coordination with LATCC Mil.
   7.3.4. VFR arrivals are initially assigned channel 10.
7.4. Radar Trail Procedures.
   7.4.1. Locally assigned aircraft may conduct airborne radar trail arrivals. Flight lead will
   notify RAPCON as soon as possible of intentions to conduct a radar trail arrival.
   7.4.2. Normal spacing between flight elements is 1.5 to 2 NM. To ensure flight integrity,
   TWR will not sequence VFR aircraft between radar trail flight elements, regardless of
   spacing.
   7.4.3. Unless otherwise directed, control instructions, including breakouts or go-arounds,
   apply to the lead element only.
   7.4.4. All aircraft in the flight will conduct the same type of instrument approach.
   7.4.5. Radar trail aircraft will be controlled individually for missed approach and lost
   communications.      See paragraphs 7.19. and 9.22. for missed approach and lost
   communications procedures.
7.5. Radar Traffic Patterns.
   7.5.1. See Figure 7.1. for LKH/Mildenhall radar traffic patterns.
   7.5.2. When RWY 24 is in use and STANTA is active above 2500 feet MSL, to include the
   south corridor, aircraft should expect recovery via the TWR pattern (weather conditions
   permitting). If the TWR pattern is closed, expect vectors for a visual approach, TACAN
   Alpha approach, or circling approach. In the event of an in-flight emergency, RAPCON has
   the ability to halt firing in STANTA to allow passage.
   7.5.3. During periods when STANTA is active 2500 feet MSL or above, the south corridor
   should be released to RAPCON for use. In that case, all aircraft will be vectored to intercept
   the LKH TACAN 062 radial to commence the TACAN or ILS approaches. Once established
   on the 062 radial, the aircraft is clear of the active portion of STANTA and descent through
   the south corridor is authorized.
   7.5.4. Radar traffic pattern RWY 24. The STANTA north corridor (1.6 NM wide) allows
   aircraft to fly a standard rectangular pattern to RWY 24 at 3000 feet MSL. Due to the north
   corridor configuration, a slightly extended downwind leg or vectors across final approach
   may be required.
   7.5.5. Transient Arrivals. LKH RAPCON will contact the Range Control Officer for the
   deactivation of STANTA Range (D-208) prior to any transient aircraft conducting an
   instrument approach to RWY 24. Solicitation of visual approaches (weather permitting) will
   be exercised to the maximum extent possible to avoid the deactivation of STANTA Range.
   7.5.6. Radar traffic pattern RWY 06. This pattern requires aircraft to be vectored north of
   the RWY 06 extended centerline normally at 3000 feet MSL. Base leg turn should be kept
   clear of Ely (town center) and Ely Cathedral at 2000 feet MSL or above to the max extent
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                                41


   possible. Descent will be given when aircraft are well clear of Ely or after conflicting traffic,
   arriving MLD RWY 11 or departing RWY 29, has been resolved.

Figure 7.1. Radar Traffic Patterns.
 42                                              LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


7.6. Radar Flight-Following Requirements. RAPCON shall flight follow with the Digital
Airport Surveillance Radar (DASR) as required.
   7.6.1. RAPCON will flight follow ILS and TACAN approaches under the following
   conditions:
      7.6.1.1. All military single-piloted turbojet aircraft when:
          7.6.1.1.1. The ceiling is below 1500 feet AGL and/or visibility is less than 8000
          meters.
          7.6.1.1.2. At night.
      7.6.1.2. RWY 24 in use and STANTA active to 2500 feet MSL or above.
      7.6.1.3. When requested by pilot.
   7.6.2. Pilots will contact TWR during landing roll out (i.e., ―TWR, Cougar 01, rollout‖) and
   monitor the local control frequency while on the RWY. Note: ATC will not issue
   communications transfer instructions to locally assigned aircraft unless TWR local control
   frequency is inoperative.
7.7. Non-radar Recoveries.
   7.7.1. Aircraft recovering to LKH during DASR outage will be cleared to the appropriate
   initial approach fix (IAF) and will be transferred from LATCC Mil on commencement of the
   approach.
   7.7.2. RWY 24: Aircraft will execute a HI/LO-ILS RWY 24 approach.
   7.7.3. RWY 06: Aircraft will execute the HI/LO-TACAN/ILS RWY 06 approach.
7.8. TACAN Alpha Procedures.
   7.8.1. TACAN Alpha will only be used when LKH is landing RWY 24, STANTA is active
   to 7,500 feet, the south corridor is ―HOT‖ and LKH TWR patterns are not available.
      7.8.1.1. TACAN Alpha approaches may be conducted with TWR WS/SC, RAPCON
      WS/SC, and SOF approval in accordance with TACAN Alpha proficiency days
      regardless of STANTA activity. SOFs shall coordinate with TWR and RAPCON
      WS/SCs if a TACAN Alpha proficiency day is determined prior to the start of flying.
      7.8.1.2. TACAN Alpha approaches may be approved by TWR WS/SC, RAPCON
      WS/SC, and SOF on non-proficiency days on a case-by-case basis.
      7.8.1.3. Aircrews requesting practice TACAN Alpha approaches on non-proficiency
      days should expect to be sequenced last due to the sterilization of the TWR patterns and
      sequencing from LKH Approach/Arrival along with other normal flow operations.
      7.8.1.4. If TWR WS/SC, RAPCON WS/SC, and SOF approve TACAN Alpha
      approaches in accordance with paragraphs 7.8.1.1. and 7.8.1.2., all TWR patterns will be
      closed until the last TACAN Alpha approach lands.
   7.8.2. The TACAN Alpha is limited to a single ship or 2-ship radar trail (no more than 2
   NM) full stops only. Formation approaches not authorized.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                                43


      7.8.2.1. Chase formations are authorized only during check rides in VMC (1500
      feet/5km) conditions only and for emergencies as needed. When tower patterns are
      closed, the first element of the formation must conclude the approach in a full-stop. The
      element conducting the chase maneuver must return to radar (local climb-out) for re-
      sequencing.
      7.8.2.2. SOFs will coordinate with TWR and RAPCON WS/SC with the call signs of the
      aircraft conducting check rides.
   7.8.3. Aircrew should plan for delays up to 15 minutes and monitor fuel status accordingly.
   7.8.4. RAPCON will normally transfer aircraft communications to TWR at 10 DME but
   NLT the FAF.
   7.8.5. ATC will reiterate to aircrews to execute a circle to the north for a right base for
   landing.
   7.8.6. Preceding TACAN Alpha aircraft or flight must be landing assured before subsequent
   TACAN Alpha aircraft cross the FAF.
   7.8.7. For departures, the last element of a departure flight must be in departure roll before
   inbound aircraft on the TACAN Alpha cross the FAF.
   7.8.8. The TACAN Alpha procedure will not be authorized when RWY 06 is in use.
7.9. Visual Approach.
   7.9.1. Requests for a visual approach or vectors to initial will be made with RAPCON.
   7.9.2. Radar service will be provided until visual contact with the airfield or traffic to follow
   is established.
   7.9.3. RAPCON controllers will retain control of aircraft conducting visual approaches to
   RWY 24 until clearance from STANTA is ensured.
   7.9.4. Pilots unfamiliar with LKH will be given an instrument approach when RWY 06 is in
   use.
7.10. Traffic Patterns and Protection of the 360-degree Overhead.
   7.10.1. Aircraft may enter the VFR patterns via initial, Delta/Bravo for initial, Charlie to
   downwind, TWR to TWR transfers, or following an instrument approach.
   7.10.2. Pattern altitudes are fixed-wing overhead 1,500 feet, fixed-wing closed 1500 feet,
   and fixed-wing straight-in 1000 feet. Weather requirements for overhead and closed traffic
   patterns are 2000 feet AGL ceiling and visibility 5000 meters. Weather requirements for
   straight-in is 1500 feet AGL ceiling and 5000 meters visibility. See Figure 7.2. for VFR
   traffic patterns.: While LKH has an established closed traffic pattern at 1500 feet, there is no
   established rectangular pattern.
   7.10.3. The closed traffic fixed-wing pattern will be flown to the south, inside the airfield
   boundary. Unless instructed by TWR, base leg should not extend beyond cut out canal. If
   crosswind for closed traffic pattern on RWY 24 cannot be initiated prior to abeam the TWR
   (the preferred procedure), it will be delayed until past departure end so as to avoid over-flight
   of base housing.
 44                                               LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


   7.10.4. TWR WS/SC will determine the available traffic patterns for locally assigned
   aircraft. Pattern selection will be based on weather, availability of arresting gear, airfield
   lighting, ATCALS, and visibility restrictions hampering TWR ability to sequence traffic. As
   deemed necessary, TWR WS/SC may close any or all VFR traffic patterns due to visibility or
   ceiling limitations. The TWR WS/SC will coordinate pattern restrictions with the SOF and
   RAPCON WS/SC.
   7.10.5. Protection of 360-degree overhead. All locally assigned aircraft (including those
   deployed to RAF LKH) will maintain at or below 1000 feet until passing departure end of
   RWY during VMC, to protect the 360-degree overhead pattern.
   7.10.6. Transient aircraft will be issued pertinent restrictions with departure instructions/
   climb-out/go-around procedures.
   7.10.7. All fixed-wing aircraft, including transients, are prohibited from flying VFR patterns
   between the end of civil twilight (after sunset) to the beginning of civil twilight (before
   sunrise) due to noise abatement considerations for base housing. IFR patterns, to include
   numerous practice approaches, are permitted during normal airfield operating times.
7.11. Entry to VFR Traffic Patterns. For aircraft entering the pattern via Bravo/Delta/Charlie
or initial, RAPCON will not descend aircraft below 2000 feet MSL unless prior coordinated with
TWR. If TWR deems the patterns too saturated, downwind entries will be denied and aircraft
can expect vectors for an instrument approach.
   7.11.1. Entry via Delta/Bravo:
       7.11.1.1. Weather minimums for vectors to Delta (LKH 096/6 NM, N52-24.0/E000-42.2,
       Olleys Farm midway between Elveden and Thetford) and Bravo (LKH 288/5 NM, N52-
       25.8/E000-24.7, Shippea Hill railway station) are ceiling 2500 feet and visibility 5000
       meters.
       7.11.1.2. Pilots vectored to Delta/Bravo must report the entry point or airfield in sight
       prior to being transferred to TWR.
       7.11.1.3. If traffic to follow is not in sight, aircraft will not descend below 2000 feet.
       7.11.1.4. At 3 DME or traffic to follow is in sight or not a factor, aircraft at 2000 feet
       will descend to 1500 feet, unless directed otherwise.
       7.11.1.5. NLT 5 miles or pilot reports airfield in sight, RAPCON will instruct
       ―CONTACT TWR‖.
   7.11.2. Entry via Charlie to Downwind:
       7.11.2.1. Aircraft arriving from the north may fly Charlie to downwind, weather and
       traffic permitting. Weather minimums for vectors to Charlie (LKH 333/4, N52-
       28.0/E000-29.3, Blackdyke Farm Bridge) are ceiling 2500 feet/visibility 8000meters.
       7.11.2.2. Requests for Charlie to downwind will be made on initial contact with
       RAPCON. After coordinating with TWR, RAPCON will direct aircraft to proceed to the
       airfield via Charlie and descend to 2000 feet. Aircraft will not descend below 2000 feet
       until over airfield or TWR approves downwind entry.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 45


      7.11.2.3. If Charlie or the airfield is not in sight prior to 5 miles, the aircraft will remain
      with radar and be re-sequenced to recover via an instrument approach.
      7.11.2.4. Fen Restricted Pattern Procedures
          7.11.2.4.1. Minimum weather is a 3500-foot ceiling and 8000 meters of visibility.
          7.11.2.4.2. Maintain a minimum of 3000 feet MSL until clear of inside downwind
          traffic.
          7.11.2.4.3. Fen Restricted Pattern procedures are effective by 48 FW Safety Read
          File.

Figure 7.2. VFR Traffic Patterns.




7.12. VFR Pattern Procedures.
   7.12.1. Closed traffic to either RWY is normally executed prior to abeam the TWR.
   7.12.2. The overhead pattern has left turns for RWY 24 and right turns for RWY 06.
   7.12.3. Pilots will proceed to initial from Delta or Bravo unless requesting a straight-in.
   7.12.4. Overhead: Aircraft will turn initial at 3 miles (4 DME, RWY 24), unless otherwise
   directed by TWR to ensure altitude separation with aircraft on final.
46                                              LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


  7.12.5. Overhead RWY 24: The normal break point is approach end with left turns. Break
  shall not be delayed in order to prevent last wingman from proceeding beyond the cutoff
  canal (approximately 1 DME). If necessary, reentry will be via a left-hand pattern to Delta.
  7.12.6. Overhead RWY 06: The normal break point is approach end with right turns. Pilots
  will, unless directed otherwise by TWR, turn base inside cutoff canal to avoid interfering
  with Mildenhall traffic.
  7.12.7. Flight lead of 4-ship formations should not delay break beyond midfield to alleviate
  wingmen having to reenter (unless otherwise instructed by TWR).
  7.12.8. Straight-ins: Pilots will fly the normal VFR pattern ground track for entry and at
  Bravo/Delta request a straight-in. If a straight-in is approved, pilots will descend to 1000 feet
  MSL, configure on base and turn to intercept a 2-3 mile final. If a straight-in is disapproved,
  pilots will proceed as directed by TWR.
  7.12.9. Charlie to downwind:
     7.12.9.1. On initial contact with TWR, pilots will state ―(CALLSIGN), CHARLIE TO
     DOWNWIND.‖ TWR will respond with either ―REPORT ONE MILE NORTH‖ or
     ―UNABLE, REPORT BRAVO (OR DELTA).‖
     7.12.9.2. Pilots call TWR one mile north of the airfield for Charlie to downwind
     approval.
     7.12.9.3. If downwind entry is approved, pilots will proceed to the downwind, then
     descend to 1500 feet.
     7.12.9.4. If TWR disapproves a RWY 24 Charlie to downwind entry, pilots remain at
     2000 feet until beyond the inside downwind, then descend to 1500 feet and report Delta.
         7.12.9.4.1. If TWR disapproves a RWY 06 Charlie to downwind entry at Charlie
         pilots will descend to 1500 feet and report Bravo.
         7.12.9.4.2. If TWR disapproves a RWY 06 Charlie to downwind entry at one mile
         north, pilots can expect to make a left 180 degree turn, intercept downwind to Bravo
         and maintain 2000 feet until clear of traffic or proceed direct to Delta at 2000 feet and
         hold for further instructions as directed by TWR (Delta will not be used if STANTA
         is active to 7500 feet/ROCK1 departure is being used).
         7.12.9.4.3. All Charlie to downwind entry ground tracks will offset to the departure
         end of RWY 06, with the western aircraft overflying the runway no further west than
         midfield. Additionally, the inside downwind ground track will be unchanged and
         crews should continue to make every effort to avoid over flight of Lakenheath village
         and base housing.
     7.12.9.5. Downwind entry maneuver not permitted by four-ship formations. Two-by-
     two ship recoveries permitted, but must be coordinated with TWR prior to Charlie.
     7.12.9.6. Fen Restricted Pattern Procedures
         7.12.9.6.1. Minimum weather is a 3500-foot ceiling and 8000 meters of visibility.

      7.21.3.3. If STANTA is active from 2500 feet MSL or above and an aircraft is on final
      for RWY 24, RAPCON may not be able to instruct aircraft to make an immediate right
      turn due to the proximity of STANTA and corridor restrictions. RAPCON will instruct
      the affected aircraft to expedite a climb above the STANTA danger height prior to
      issuing the turn. Example: ―EXPEDITE CLIMB TO 3000, UPON REACHING 3000
      TURN RIGHT HEADING 360.‖ Note: In the event of a formation approach in which
      the trail aircraft goes ―Lost Wingman‖ that pilot shall inform RAPCON immediately to
      effect coordination to stop firing within STANTA.

Figure 8.2. Helicopter VFR Arrival Procedures/Pattern.




8.5. VFR Traffic Pattern.
   8.5.1. Weather minimums for the helicopter VFR traffic pattern are 4800 meters visibility
   and a 700 foot ceiling or ceiling 500 feet above the desired altitude. Helicopters can expect a
   SVFR clearance IAW 8.8. Helicopters may be permitted by ATC to operate in lower
   visibility conditions if maneuvered at a speed that will give adequate opportunity to observe
   other traffic or any obstacles in time to avoid collision.
   8.5.2. The helicopter pattern will be flown to the north, right traffic to RWY 24 and left
   traffic to RWY 06. South Pattern may be flown with ATC approval, left traffic to RWY 24
   and right traffic to RWY 06. Downwind should be flown at 600 feet MSL and base legs will
   be flown at 400 feet MSL. HH-60 aircrew will request approval for other altitudes from the
   TWR. See Figure 8.2.
   8.5.3. Entry into the VFR pattern may be accomplished from one of the following:
      8.5.3.1. Departure from any point on the airfield.
      8.5.3.2. Via the Jolly North recovery.
      8.5.3.3. From a point one mile south of mid-field as outlined in the Jolly East/South
      recovery.
      8.5.3.4. Following completion of an IFR approach.
   8.5.4. To avoid the flow of fixed wing traffic, transitions from the VFR traffic pattern to
   Papa Bubble, TWY H, Golf South, and Mike 3 may be conducted at pilot’s request with
   TWR’s approval. It is the pilot’s responsibility to maintain obstacle clearance and avoid
   over-flying vehicles and aircraft. See para 8.4.4.

8.6. Practice Auto-Rotations.
   8.6.1. Practice auto-rotations are a helicopter unique maneuver which requires use of a
   TWY, RWY or SQ/CC approved area (coordinated with 48 OSS/OSA). As such, they will
   be worked into the helicopter VFR pattern and are authorized while other aircraft are in the
   VFR pattern but must deconflict with TWR for altitude and lateral separation.
   8.6.2. Practice auto-rotations shall recover above the surface in accordance with TO 1H-
   60(H)G-1, Flight Manual, USAF Series HH-60G Helicopter, and AFI 11-2HH-60 Volume 3,
   HH-60 Operations Procedures.
   8.6.3. Practice Low-Altitude Auto-Rotations (LAA). Pilots will coordinate LAA training
   with TWR prior to initiation of the maneuver. During practice LAAs, aircrew will follow
   current MAJCOM guidance and avoid over-flight of buildings, aircraft on the ground, and
   vehicles.
8.7. Hover Check Areas.
   8.7.1. The primary hover check area is Mike 3 and TWY H. The alternate areas are Golf
   Bubble South and Papa Bubble.
   8.7.2. Hover altitudes above 30 feet AGL shall be requested by the pilot and must be
   approved by TWR.
8.8. SVFR Operations.
   8.8.1. 56 RQS HH-60 aircraft are authorized to conduct SVFR operations at LKH when the
   ceiling is less than 1,000 and visibility is less than 4800 meters.
   8.8.2. Pilots and controllers will abide by all SVFR guidance found in FAAO 7110.65,
   local/host nation procedures, AFIs, and MAJCOM guidance.
8.9. Emergency Procedures.
   8.9.1. To the maximum extent possible, all HH-60 in-flight emergencies will recover to the
   mid-point of the RWY and exit at TWY Whiskey. If TWY Whiskey is occupied, then TWY
   Victor will be used.
   8.9.2. If it is the pilot’s desire to land at an alternate location, inform TWR in advance to
   allow for emergency response support at the desired location.
   8.9.3. For hot gun/hung flare procedures refer to 48 FW In-Flight Guide and AFI 11-2HH-60
   Volume 3 Lakenheath Supplement. Hot guns will be cleared by weapons personnel at Mike
   3 (primary) or Kilo/Golf Bubble hot gun areas (alternates) with affected gun pointed into the
   sand bag pit/barrier. If hung flares/chaff is suspected, HH-60 aircraft will land at Papa
   Bubble at the designated wheel spots.
8.10. Lost Communication Procedures.
   8.10.1. If lost communications are experienced while VMC, squawk 7600, turn on landing
   and strobe lights, and proceed with caution through the Jolly North, East, or South arrival.
   Follow TWR light gun signals to TWY H or Mike 3 North (if TWY H is occupied).

                              EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

9.1. General Information.
   9.1.1. Landing emergency aircraft will be directed to the north side de-arm area (see Figure
   2.1.) when possible, and park in a manner that allows 48 CES/CEF vehicles to park at 45-
   degree angles on both sides of the front of the aircraft.
   9.1.2. TWR will turn loop road light to red when the emergency aircraft has 10 flying miles
   to land or until TWR WS/SC deems no longer necessary. Refer to procedures in paragraph
   2.20.5.2. if the loop road lights are inoperative.
   9.1.3. Aircraft with unsafe gear indication, or requiring use of the landing gear emergency
   extension system to lower the gear, will normally stop on the RWY after landing to have its
   gear pinned prior to taxiing off the RWY.
9.2. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS)/Alternate Crash Alarm System (ACAS).
   9.2.1. The PCAS will be tested daily between 0800L – 0830L. The ACAS and tertiary crash
   phone are tested on Monday between 0800L – 0830L.
   9.2.2. The following agencies have two-way communication capability with TWR on the
   PCAS: AMOPS, 48 CES/CEF, Flight Surgeon’s Office and Hospital Emergency Room
   (ER). Alternate Crash Station has receive-only capability.
   9.2.3. TWR will activate the PCAS for, but not limited to, the following occurrences:
      9.2.3.1. Aircraft in-flight or ground emergencies. Note: TWR will relay the tail number
      of ground emergency aircraft when available and if there is a question of which aircraft is
      the emergency, e.g., more than one aircraft in de-arm area.
      9.2.3.2. Any time the WS/SC deems it necessary in response to an emergency situation.
      9.2.3.3. In support of base exercises, as appropriate.
      9.2.3.4. The PCAS is not activated to relay non-emergency related data, i.e. Force
      Protection Condition (FPCON) changes, disaster response group meeting locations, etc.
      Agencies must utilize other available means, i.e., giant voice, contact AMOPS for
      secondary crash net activation, etc.
      9.2.3.5. All agencies on the PCAS will remain on the system until TWR terminates the
      call (including tests). Emergency data often changes frequently and this procedure
      prevents additional time consuming notifications.
   9.2.4. If the PCAS fails or is out-of-service, the ACAS system will be tested immediately,
   and used in accordance with PCAS procedures.
9.3. Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   9.3.1. The SCN will be tested daily following the daily PCAS check.
   9.3.2. The following agencies have two-way communication capability with AMOPS on the
   SCN: 48 FW/CC, 48 FW/CP, 48 CES/CEF, Emergency Room, MOC, BDOC, 48
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                            59


   OSS/OSW, Public Affairs, 48 CES/CEOFP, Crash Recovery, 48 CES Readiness, and
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).
   9.3.3. The SCN will be activated for:
      9.3.3.1. In-flight emergencies and ground emergencies.
      9.3.3.2. When requested by 48 FW/CP for Emergency Operations Center recall.
      9.3.3.3. Daily check immediately following the daily PCAS test (must be logged in the
      events log).
      9.3.3.4. Relaying exercise messages.
      9.3.3.5. Relaying information critical to aircraft and airfield operations.
   9.3.4. Information received via the PCAS will be passed verbatim.
9.4. Emergency Response Procedures.
   9.4.1. In-Flight Emergencies:
      9.4.1.1. The Incident Commander (IC, i.e. Fire Chief or Assistant Chief for Operations),
      or designated representative, is in charge of ground response to an in-flight emergency
      until the emergency is terminated. The following applies:
      9.4.1.2. Emergency response vehicles will standby at designated points (PT) 1, 2, 3, or 4
      (see Figure 2.1) on the airfield and await TWR approval for RWY access.
      9.4.1.3. Normally, AMOPS will position their vehicle at the approach end of the RWY in
      use and await TWR approval for RWY access.
      9.4.1.4. TWR will suspend RWY operations and AMOPS must perform a visual
      inspection of the RWY surface after the emergency aircraft lands, with the exception of
      an emergency-fuel aircraft, aircraft commander discretion emergencies, or when the
      inspection is waived. SOF may waive the required inspection but assumes all
      responsibility for the safety and condition of the RWY until the visual inspection is
      completed.
   9.4.2. Emergency Fuel.
      9.4.2.1. Emergency fuel will be handled as an emergency and TWR will activate the
      PCAS. Emergency fuel aircraft do not warrant the suspension of RWY operations unless
      stranded on RWY. Fuel state must be declared with an ATC agency. Note: Only the
      term ―EMERGENCY FUEL‖ will be used. Other terms such as ―LOW ON GAS,
      BINGO FUEL, MINIMUM FUEL‖ etc., will not afford any ATC priority. Note:
      MINIMUM FUEL indicates that no undue delay can be accepted.
      9.4.2.2. Unless the IC directs otherwise, emergencies involving RAF LKH aircraft
      declaring ―EMERGENCY FUEL‖ will be handled as follows. (Note: Applies only to
      aircraft in an ―EMERGENCY FUEL‖ situation with no additional aircraft emergency
      conditions.) On landing rollout, TWR will ask the pilot if further assistance is required.
      If the pilot declines further assistance, and determines the fuel emergency is not caused
      by a fuel leak or system malfunction, but is instead caused by a miscalculation in the
      flight plan (e.g. diverting around bad weather), then the IC will work with the SOF to
60                                             LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


     allow the aircraft to exit the RWY on the south side or as directed by the TWR. This will
     be coordinated before the aircraft lands. The following applies:
         9.4.2.2.1. Response vehicles will not enter the RWY, RWY operations will not be
         suspended, and visual inspection of the RWY surface by AMOPS will not be
         required.
         9.4.2.2.2. Once the aircraft has exited the RWY and is in the location coordinated by
         TWR and SOF, it will be inspected by emergency crews. The IC will notify TWR of
         emergency termination time.
  9.4.3. Emergencies Under Aircraft Commander Discretion.
     9.4.3.1. Once an aircraft has declared an in-flight emergency, TWR will activate the
     PCAS, and the emergency aircrew will coordinate with the 48 OG SOF. During SOF
     coordination, the aircrew may request aircraft commander discretion regarding further
     assistance on landing rollout. The SOF will consider the nature of emergency, decide if
     the emergency declaration is consistent with discretionary assistance after landing, and
     then approve/disapprove. The SOF will then notify the IC, through the TWR controller,
     that aircraft commander discretion is requested. The ultimate decision to provide further
     assistance rests with the IC.
     9.4.3.2. Unless the IC directs otherwise, emergencies that are authorized aircraft
     commander discretion will be handled as follows:
         9.4.3.2.1. On landing rollout, TWR will ask the pilot if further assistance is required
         on the RWY. If the pilot declines further assistance on the RWY, the aircraft may
         exit the RWY on the north side or as directed by the TWR.
         9.4.3.2.2. Response vehicles will not enter the RWY, RWY operations will not be
         suspended, and visual inspection of the RWY surface by AMOPS will not be
         required.
         9.4.3.2.3. Once on the north side, the aircraft will be inspected by emergency crews.
         The IC will notify TWR of emergency termination time.
         9.4.3.2.4. The aircrew will coordinate with unit Ops Sup to determine follow-on
         actions for returning the aircraft to maintenance personnel.
  9.4.4. Ground Emergencies:
     9.4.4.1. The IC is in charge of ground response to a ground emergency until the
     emergency is terminated. If recovery operations (i.e. towing) are required, the crash
     recovery supervisor will be in charge of ground operations.
     9.4.4.2. The IC requests approval from TWR for vehicles to cross the RWY if necessary.
     9.4.4.3. TWR will hold all aircraft operations in the vicinity of the emergency aircraft.
     9.4.4.4. IC will coordinate with TWR to resume aircraft operations once all emergency
     response vehicles are on scene.
  9.4.5. Ground response procedures for off-base accidents are located in 48 FW PLAN 10-2,
  Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                                61


9.5. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures.
   9.5.1. External stores jettison will depend upon the location of the aircraft and the criticality
   of the emergency. Selective and combat jettisons should be attempted prior to considering
   emergency jettison of stores. Generally, jettison inert stores, if able, on any UK range.
   Radio contact should be established with the range control agency prior to jettison. Should
   there be a requirement for an RAF LKH aircraft to jettison live ordnance; the crew should
   utilize RAF Holbeach or Donna Nook Air Weapons Range (AWR). Having declared an
   emergency, the emergency jettison procedure to be used is as follows:
      9.5.1.1. RAF Holbeach (Donna Nook secondary) is to be contacted before the
      emergency jettison aircraft enters the Wash Weapons Airspace and, if circumstances
      allow, SOF is to contact the range commercial: 01406-550364 (Donna Nook: 01507-
      359126) to give advance notification.
      9.5.1.2. The Officer Commanding (OC) will clear the range of any aircraft operating in
      the AWR.
      9.5.1.3. If over land, the emergency jettison aircraft is to plan to join the range via radar
      base point depicted in the 48 FW In Flight Guide. Stores will be jettisoned on Holbeach
      heading 314 +/- 5 degrees, 300 feet north of target 8 (Donna Nook heading 334 +/- 10
      degrees 300 feet, east of target 3). Stores are to be jettisoned SAFE (not LIVE).
      Aircrew must have positive clearance from the range control officer to emergency
      jettison; however, aircraft commanders are ultimately responsible for clear range
      procedures.
      9.5.1.4. Following the emergency jettison, aircraft are to depart the range as required
      avoiding other ranges if active. The OC RAF Holbeach (Donna Nook) will inform SOF
      of the successful emergency jettison and departure of the aircraft.
      9.5.1.5. Fuel tanks will not be jettisoned at either Holbeach or Donna Nook AWRs.
      Jettison fuel tanks over deep water at least 12 NM off coast, clear of shipping and oil
      platforms, headed out to sea under control of radar agency.
   9.5.2. LKH RAPCON will provide radar assistance (upon request) to aircraft requiring
   vectors to Wash Weapons Airspace.
   9.5.3. LKH RAPCON shall not provide guidance to the emergency jettison target areas or
   when the emergency jettison aircraft is over the emergency jettison target area.
   9.5.4. If the above procedures for inert or live stores cannot be followed due to weather or
   communication problems, stores may be jettisoned over water clear of shipping and oil rigs.
   Jettison at least 12 NM out to sea under the control of a radar controlling agency if possible.
   Use all available systems to clear the impact area and mark the position and time of jettison.
   9.5.5. In emergency situations, jettison of external stores immediately after takeoff is
   authorized. A slight turn to the right at either departure end of RWY puts the aircraft over
   unpopulated areas. This procedure is not to establish a jettison area, but rather provides the
   aircrew with a way to minimize chances of injury to personnel or property damage in an
   emergency situation.

   9.7.2. For an approach end engagement with radio failure, comply with AFI 11-205, Aircraft
   Cockpit and Formation Flight Signals, procedures.
   9.7.3. If necessary, crash recovery will direct the aircraft’s engine to be shut down.
   9.7.4. TWR personnel can expect a 15 minute recovery time for BAK 12 engagements, if
   there are no complications.
9.8. Hot-Brake Area and Procedures.
   9.8.1. After notified of hot brakes, the TWR will activate the PCAS.            If required, 48
   CES/CEF will be in place for the engine shut down.
   9.8.2. Hot-brake areas are as depicted in Figure 2.1.
   9.8.3. Aircraft with hot brakes anywhere on the airfield other than the RWY will
   immediately notify ground control. They will hold their position if in a safe position (e.g.,
   aircraft at a PAS will remain there), or move to closest safe position, park into the wind and
   hold position. The IC will direct response and crash recovery personnel actions.
   9.8.4. Aircraft will not taxi past or near aircraft with hot brakes.
9.9. Abandonment of Aircraft/Controlled Bailout Area.
   9.9.1. The controlled bailout point for locally assigned aircraft is N52-55 E000-40. This
   point is near Brancaster Bay, 8.5 NM northeast of Sandringham, 20 NM east of RAF
   Holbeach, near Provost Martial Restricted (PMR) Area 225 (Wash Range Hold airspace).
   LKH (Channel 39) 010/31 or MLD (Channel 106) 013/34. Mandatory heading 360 +/- 10
   degrees, 10000 feet MSL, slowest available airspeed, no slower than 150 knots indicated
   airspeed (150-250 is the safe ejection regime; higher airspeeds may carry aircraft farther
   north out to sea). Throttles IDLE, autopilot engaged, if able, for wings-level (non-turning)
   flight and trim set for a 750-foot per minute descent.
   9.9.2. If IMC, pilots will request radar service to the bailout point (only used if the pilot has
   sufficient time and satisfactory control of the aircraft).
   9.9.3. In the event that an aircrew abandons their aircraft, the pilot should make every
   feasible effort to advise ATC of the aircraft’s position prior to abandonment. TWR will plot
   the advised or observed estimated position on the base crash grid maps.
9.10. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Procedures.
   9.10.1. Scheduled operational testing of beacons/Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELT)
   will be conducted during the first 5 minutes of the hour for no more than three audible
   sweeps.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                               63


   9.10.2. RAPCON/TWR will notify AMOPS upon receipt of an ELT.
   9.10.3. AMOPS will notify D&D, MOC, Kinloss Air Route Control Center and 48 FW/CP
   of an ELT signal. Additionally, 48 FW/CP will notify AMOPS of any distress beacons they
   receive including ELT signals, Personal Locator Beacon (PLT) signals, etc.
   9.10.4. MOC will direct the 48 FW Egress shop (48 MXS/MXMCG) to check if an ELT was
   inadvertently activated.
   9.10.5. MOC will advise AMOPS when an ELT is found or determined not to be on the
   airfield.
   9.10.6. AMOPS will advise TWR when an ELT is found or determined not to be on the
   airfield.
   9.10.7. If an ELT resulted from an aircraft mishap in the local area or a pilot/aircrew ejecting
   from an aircraft in the local area, TWR will activate the PCAS and relay all known
   information.
9.11. Hung Ordnance/Hot Gun Procedures.
   9.11.1. Any failed attempt to fire or release ordnance, or any known or suspected gun
   malfunction will be considered hung ordnance. TWR will activate the PCAS for live hung
   ordnance.
   9.11.2. Aircraft with hung ordnance (includes forward firing) will avoid over-flying
   populated areas. Landing will be straight-in full-stop. VFR patterns will not be flown with
   hung ordnance.
   9.11.3. Hung ordnance/hot gun will be de-armed as follows:
      9.11.3.1. Landing on RWY 24, forward firing ordnance will be de-armed in the Kilo
      Bubble facing the gun berm. All other ordnance will be de-armed in the normal areas.
      9.11.3.2. Landing on RWY 06, forward firing ordnance will be de-armed in the Golf
      Bubble facing the gun berm. All other ordnance will be de-armed in the normal areas.
   9.11.4. AMOPS will notify MOC, EOD, and SFCC when advised of arriving aircraft with
   hot guns, rockets or missiles.

   9.14.2. Procedures for lightning within 5 miles:
      9.14.2.1. The USAFE Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) or 48th Combat Weather
      Team (CWT) issues a weather watch when lightning conditions within 5 NM of the
      airfield are expected within 30 minutes.
      9.14.2.2. The OWS issues weather warnings/watches for lightning within 5 NM of the
      airfield when conditions are observed.
      9.14.2.3. ATC notifies aircraft of the weather advisories/watches/warnings.           TWR
      broadcasts on the ATIS.
      9.14.2.4. Aircrew responsibilities are outlined in the 48 FW In-Flight Guide.
      9.14.2.5. ATC will relay additional information as requested by the SOF.
9.15. Emergency Evacuation of Facilities Near the RWY.
   9.15.1. When an aircraft poses an imminent hazard to facilities near the RWY, TWR will
   activate the emergency evacuation alarm once an emergency aircraft reaches 10 NM final
   and directs non-emergency vehicles to vacate the CMA until deemed safe by TWR WS/SC.
   9.15.2. Tests are made weekly for the evacuation alarm at the glideslope, localizer and
   TACAN. Appropriate maintenance personnel for each facility are responsible for ensuring
   tests are conducted.
      9.15.2.1. TWR personnel will ensure all staffed facilities are warned prior to testing.

      9.15.2.2. Maintenance personnel advise TWR of results and ensure malfunctions are
      reported or repaired.
9.16. Overdue Aircraft. Follow procedures in AFI 13-202, Overdue Aircraft, and FAAO
7110.65. TWR and RAPCON will notify AMOPS of any aircraft 30 minutes overdue.
9.17. UHF Use during Emergency Recoveries.
   9.17.1. Follow procedures outlined in the Flight Information Handbook for using the UK
   emergency UHF-direction finding system during an in-flight emergency (PAN/MAYDAY)
   or a practice PAN.
   9.17.2. In order to provide command and control agencies up-to-date information during the
   recovery of emergency aircraft, a single frequency approach capability is available on
   frequency 369.25 (local channel 13) and is designated as the Emergency Recovery
   Frequency (ERF). This is intended to provide appropriate agencies the capability of listening
   as the aircrew, SOF, and ATC effect the recovery of emergency aircraft.
   9.17.3. Procedures:
      9.17.3.1. Use of the ERF for the recovery of emergency aircraft will be of the highest
      priority.
      9.17.3.2. Use of the ERF for normal recoveries will be avoided.
      9.17.3.3. All emergency recoveries that declare prior to hand-off to a LKH controller
      will be assigned the ERF. The frequency will be cleared if already in use.
      9.17.3.4. Changing frequencies after the aircraft is with LKH RAPCON will not be
      accomplished unless requested by the aircrew.
      9.17.3.5. The SOF may request that an emergency aircraft is changed to the ERF, but
      final approval rests with the appropriate ATC agency and the pilot.
      9.17.3.6. When feasible and as deemed appropriate by TWR, have aircraft remain on
      ERF for IC direct communications with aircrew, and notify IC that ERF is released for IC
      use.
      9.17.3.7. The IC shall release the ERF back to the TWR when the incident is terminated,
      or at TWR’s request (i.e. if higher priority ATC actions require it).
9.18. Locating and Recovering Distressed Aircraft.
   9.18.1. Locating and recovering distressed aircraft in the UK is the responsibility of D&D.
   To clarify and standardize actions required by LKH ATC facilities in assisting lost aircraft,
   the following guidelines are provided, in addition to those provided in the FAAO 7110.65
   and other appropriate directives. If an aircraft is directed to land at LKH by D&D during
   duty hours, park as directed by AMOPS.
   9.18.2. Should TWR or RAPCON receive a call from a lost aircraft on 243.0 or 121.5 apply
   the following procedures:
      9.18.2.1. Respond to the call and assist in any way possible.
      9.18.2.2. Inform D&D and verify they received the MAYDAY/PAN PAN call and that
      they are establishing a fix on the aircraft.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             67


       9.18.2.3. Alert the applicable facility of the emergency.
   9.18.3. Should TWR or RAPCON receive a call from a lost aircraft on a frequency other
   than 243.0 or 121.5 apply the following procedures:
       9.18.3.1. Respond to the call and assist in any way possible.
       9.18.3.2. Alert the applicable facility of the emergency and advise D&D.
       9.18.3.3. If the aircraft has encountered IFR conditions, inform pilot of the emergency
       safe altitude within 100 NM of RAF LKH (2700 feet).
       9.18.3.4. Instruct the pilot to squawk MAYDAY on code 7700.
       9.18.3.5. If the aircraft is not located immediately by one of the radar facilities and is
       able to change frequencies, instruct the aircraft to change to frequency 121.5 or 243.0 as
       appropriate, for direction finding service from D&D.
9.19. Hydrazine Procedures.
   9.19.1. When an F-16 Emergency Power Unit (EPU) is activated, possibility of hydrazine
   leakage may exist. See Figure 2.1. for hydrazine parking areas.
   9.19.2. Procedures are as follows:
       9.19.2.1. If able, aircraft will taxi to Golf south (RWY 06), spot ―Lima‖ (RWY 24) and
       park into the wind.
       9.19.2.2. TWR will activate the PCAS.
       9.19.2.3. IC will establish a 300-foot cordon around the aircraft and follow the guidance
       in T.O. 00-105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information

       105E-9, Aerospace Emergency Rescue and Mishap Response Information (Emergency
       Services).
9.20. F-16 Flame-Out Procedures. Neither RAF LKH nor MLD have Simulated Flame-out
(SFO) patterns. SFO operations are not authorized. Aircraft requesting a flame-out pattern shall
be treated as an emergency.
9.21. Anti Hijack/Unauthorized Aircraft Movements.
   9.21.1. Hijack prevention and initial action in the event the prevention has been unsuccessful
   will be in accordance with AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy, FAA Joint
   Order (JO) 7610.64, Special Operations, and 48 FW Plan 31-101, Integrated Defense Plan.
   9.21.2. Attempted hijacking or theft of a US military aircraft will be resisted by any means
   determined appropriate by the wing commander.
   9.21.3. Non-US aircraft with a declared hijack in progress will be discouraged from landing
   at LKH unless safety dictates, or hijackers demand a landing.
   9.21.4. In the event of an attempted or suspected hijacking, unauthorized aircraft movement,
   or an observation of unusual or suspicious activity endangering US Government assets, TWR
   will:

   9.21.6. The designated hijacked aircraft parking area is TWY W, coincident with the
   hazardous cargo parking spot. Alternate parking areas can be coordinated if the situation
   dictates.
9.22. Lost Communications Procedures.
   9.22.1. If no transmissions are received for 1 minute in the pattern attempt contact on LKH
   TWR on 338.925 (local channel 3) and proceed VFR. (Special instructions, if needed, will
   be transmitted.)
   9.22.2. If unable and already established on an instrument approach proceed with approach.
   If being vectored to RWY 24, squawk 7600, avoid Norwich Class D to max extent possible,
   proceed to ASRAM (LKH 062 radial at 17 DME) at 6000 feet and proceed with HI/LO-
   TACAN or ILS RWY 24 approach. If being vectored to RWY 06, squawk 7600, proceed to
   INPOT (LKH 282 radial at 13 DME) at 5000 feet and proceed with the HI-TACAN or ILS
   RWY 06 approach. CAUTION: Avoid entering STANTA.
   9.22.3. Prior to executing lost communication instructions, pilots shall attempt contact with
   RAPCON on the last assigned frequency. If negative contact on last assigned frequency,
   attempt contact on local channel 10. Note: See paragraph 8.10. for rotary wing lost
   communications procedures.
9.23. Quick Freeze Procedures. If a part is missing from an aircraft and was not previously
documented in the aircraft forms or is deemed to be a potentially significant hazard to aircraft,
Quick Freeze procedures should be implemented. If the general location of the mission object is
known, then the procedures can be localized to that area, however if the location of the missing
item cannot be determined all aircraft ground movement may be suspended until the exact
location can be specified.
   9.23.1. The appropriate Maintenance Superintendant (SUPER), crew chief or EOR crew
   will:
       9.23.1.1. Notify MOC to initiate a Quick Freeze.

         10.10.9.1.5. As soon as possible after receipt of an inbound on non-NVD aircraft
         from LKH RAPCON and advise NVD aircraft the lights are required to be turned on.
         10.10.9.1.6. TWR will state ―LIGHTS OUT‖ when issuing any clearance to
         participating NVD aircraft. This will serve as a reminder to aircrews and controllers
         of the blackout operations.
     10.10.9.2. Emergency aircraft operating with NVDs will coordinate with ATC if any
     change to lighting configuration is desired. In case of an emergency that requires
     blackout/NVD operations be terminated immediately, TWR shall make an advisory
     broadcast before changing the lighting configuration. ATC shall broadcast on all
     appropriate frequencies and nets, ―ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT/VEHICLES,
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                            75

10.21. SOF Operating from TWR.
   10.21.1. The SOF provides valuable technical assistance to the flying community and ATC,
   and serves as the OG/CC representative for flying related issues. The TWR WS/SC equally
   serves as the OG/CC representative for ATC related issues. Together, their goal is to ensure
   a safe efficient flow of air traffic at LKH.
   10.21.2. Responsibilities assigned:
      10.21.2.1. The SOF does not perform or direct ATC functions. However, the SOF may
      restrict wing assigned aircraft from any or all VFR traffic patterns.
      10.21.2.2. ATC manages traffic patterns, applies aircraft sequencing/separation standards
      and determines IFR versus VFR airfield status, opens/closes TWR patterns, and
      determines the RWY in use.
      10.21.2.3. TWR and RAPCON WS/SC are the SOF’s primary POC for ATC matters.
      The WS/SC shall discuss pertinent issues with the SOF as time permits.
      10.21.2.4. To promote a safe ATC environment, SOF must comply with ATC facility
      procedures.
   10.21.3. SOF Position Equipment:
      10.21.3.1. The SOF position equipment includes a preset UHF radio for ―RAMROD‖
      frequency, UHF multi-channel radio, jointly run CWT and OWS automated weather
      dissemination system, a multi-line phone and a computer connected to the Local Area
      Network, which can be used to access the LKH weather ICE page located at
      https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/48OG/OSS/OSW/.
      10.21.3.2. ATC may request use of the SOF multi-channel radio during equipment
      outages.    Conversely, the SOF may also request use of TWR multi-channel
      radio/telephones when necessary.
      10.21.3.3. The SOF should relay all equipment outages to TWR WS/SC, who will
      initiate repair actions.
   10.21.4. Coordination Procedures.
      10.21.4.1. To ensure a professional environment, questions and coordination must be
      accomplished between the SOF and either TWR or RAPCON WS/SC via intercoms or
      recorded lines as appropriate.
      10.21.4.2. Both TWR and RAPCON WS/SC will accommodate requests to the
      maximum extent possible.
      10.21.4.3. TWR WS/SC will inform the SOF of current airfield status, RWY in use,
      arresting cable status, NAVAID status, and any other issues that may impact wing flying.
      The TWR WS/SC will brief the on-coming SOF at the beginning of their assigned shift.
      10.21.4.4. Emergencies.
          10.21.4.4.1. ATC will advise the SOF of a locally assigned emergency aircraft.
          10.21.4.4.2. The SOF will advise TWR WS/SC with all available information
          anytime the SOF declares an emergency or is the first person notified.
 78                                              LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


          10.21.4.4.3. The SOF may request, through TWR/RAPCON WS/SC, that ATC relay
          information on any ATC assigned frequencies.
             10.21.4.4.3.1. ATC will preface SOF requests with ―RAMROD advises/directs.‖
             10.21.4.4.3.2. If the SOF deems that the information is too technical, and after
             coordination with the WS/SC, the SOF may communicate directly with an aircraft
             on the emergency discrete frequency (Channel 13). When this occurs, advisory
             instructions must be limited to that essential for flight safety and the prevention of
             a mishap.
      10.21.4.5. If a SOF commandeers an ATC frequency, he or she assumes aircraft
      separation responsibility.
      10.21.4.6. Should TWR/RAPCON need to transmit ATC instructions while aircraft are
      on the SOF frequency, the SOF must immediately instruct the aircraft to return to the
      ATC frequency.
      10.21.4.7. The SOF shall advise TWR WS/SC of the divert airfield. TWR will relay the
      data to 48 OSS/OSW and RAPCON. RAPCON will in turn advise LATCC Mil.
      10.21.4.8. The SOF will advise TWR WS/SC of Pilot Weather Report (PIREP)
      information, and ATC will relay PIREP information to the SOF.
      10.21.4.9. The SOF shall coordinate all RAPCON-related requests directly with the
      RAPCON WS/SC via the direct line.
      10.21.4.10. RAPCON WS/SC shall coordinate with the SOF when locally assigned
      aircraft divert, or whenever it is necessary to direct full stop landings/hold aircraft due to
      emergency situations.
10.22. Use of Backup Generators.
   10.22.1. The TACAN, ILS, ASR, ATC radio transmitter site, Airfield Lighting Systems,
   TWR and RAPCON have generators with auto-start features and will be run during power
   outages and maintenance checks.
   10.22.2. 48 CES/CEOFP provides initial and annual refresher generator training for all
   controllers as requested by ATC managers. 48 CES/CEOFP personnel will test the auto-start
   capability of ATC facilities monthly, normally during the first week of the month. 48
   CES/CEOFP personnel must always obtain permission from the on-duty ATC WS prior to
   transferring any ATC facility or NAVAID to/from primary power. The RAPCON WS on-
   duty will coordinate with 48 OSS/OSW and AMOPS prior to transferring to/from primary
   power. When the airfield is closed and the facility is placed on backup power, the RAPCON
   WS on-duty will notify the 48 FW/CP, who will in turn notify the standby 48 OSS/OSW
   personnel.
   10.22.3. 48 CES will pre-coordinate unscheduled transfer of power with 48 CS Operations
   Center, affected CS facilities, TWR, RAPCON, AMOPS and 48 OSS/OSW.
10.23. Notification of Fire and Crash Rescue Equipment Status.

   TA should expect aircraft to arrive on schedule and be in place accordingly.
   10.24.5. AMOPS will brief transient aircrew on noise abatement and engine run procedures
   listed in this instruction.
   10.24.6. LKH does not have a designated drag chute deployment area. Aircraft will be
   instructed to retain chute to parking. If unable to retain chute, aircraft will release chute at
   their discretion and TA will retrieve dropped chute.
   10.24.7. LKH RAPCON will contact the Range Control Officer for the deactivation of
   Danger Area 208 (STANTA) prior to any transient aircraft conducting an instrument
   approach to RWY 24. Solicitation of visual approaches (weather permitting) will be
   exercised to the maximum extent possible to avoid the deactivation of STANTA.
10.25. No-Notice Alternate Airfield Procedures.
   10.25.1. No-notice alternate airfield procedures will be used during wing flying operations
   when the RWY is closed, or when an alternate airfield is required after locally assigned
   aircraft have departed without an alternate requirement.

   aircraft due to airfield conditions or fuel status.
10.26. Practice Diversions. The RAPCON WS/SC will coordinate with TWR prior to
approving practice diversions to LKH. Approval or disapproval will be based on existing or
anticipated 48 FW flying. Practice diversions are not authorized during UK quiet hours. Either
RAPCON or TWR WS/SC may disapprove a practice divert.
10.27. Exercises and Practice Airfield Attacks.
   10.27.1. The AOF/CC must be briefed 48 hours in advance of exercises and practice airfield
   attack scenarios that involve any ATC facilities or the airfield movement area. Minimum
   information includes:
       10.27.1.1. Time of exercise
       10.27.1.2. Affected area of the airfield
       10.27.1.3. ATC facilities involved and their degree of involvement. Note: ATC does
       not participate in air attack/defense notifications or employ early warning procedures.
   10.27.2. During exercises, ATC facilities will include alarm conditions on the ATIS and
   advise aircraft under LKH control of changes until the ATIS is updated. ATC will broadcast
   the current alarm condition ―EXERCISE ALARM (color)/FPCON (code).‖

       and RAPCON.
   10.28.3. Taxi procedures:
       10.28.3.1. MINCOM aircraft will monitor the ATIS prior to taxi and start taxi within 5
       minutes of their planned taxi time.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             81


       10.28.3.2. If any MINCOM aircraft are unable to taxi within 5 minutes of planned times,
       they will coordinate a new time with the SOF on the secure radio who will relay this
       information to TWR WS.
       10.28.3.3. If TWR’s secure radio is unavailable, normal communications with ground
       must be used for clearance to taxi.
       10.28.3.4. Aircraft experiencing post-taxi maintenance problems will use UHF in-the-
       clear communications with the TWR ground controller.
       10.28.3.5. If some, or all aircraft in a flight are unable to make their flight-planned
       takeoff time +/- 5 minutes they must pass their requests for a departure time change to

                                        Attachment 2
                  UNCONTROLLED AIRFIELD OPERATIONS (UAO)

A2.1. General
   A2.1.1. During summer months, the fly window is often stretched up to and beyond the
   normal 12-hour fly window due to the necessity of the 56 RQS to maintain a 90-day NVG
   currency IAW AFI11-202v1. In addition, the airfield is required to be open anytime the 56
   RQS conducts hover checks. This often results in the airfield being opened on weekends
   while numerous Functional Check Flight (FCF) ground runs and hover checks are completed,
   further increasing the manning necessary to maintain operations.
   A2.1.2. UAO will only be conducted by LKH assigned HH-60 aircraft and crews. No divert
   aircraft will be allowed to utilize UAO.
   A2.1.3. TDY/Transient units may participate in UAO at LKH only if they have been briefed
   on RAFL UAO procedures and are operating in conjunction with or in support of 56 RQS
   aircrews.
   A2.1.4. 48th OSS Airfield Operations personnel can be recalled to open the airfield at any
   time IAW standard recall procedures outlined in paragraph 2.7. of this instruction, LAKI 13-
   201.
A2.2. Time/Airspace. UAO will occur when LKH airfield is closed and within the confines of
the CMATZ.
A2.3. RWYs/Helipad Usage.
   A2.3.1. UAO arrivals/departures will only be conducted to/from RWY 06/24, Mike 3 and
   Twy Hotel.
   A2.3.2. Engine runs and hover checks are permitted at Mike 3.
A2.4. Weather Minimums. When TWR is not operating, Lakenheath ATZ will be controlled
as part of the CMATZ by RAPCON. Aircraft conducting UAO will adhere to weather
minimums in accordance with AFI 11-2HH-60G Volume 3 and AFI 11-2HH-60G Volume
3_LakenheathSup_1. In no case will weather minimums be less than AFI 11-202 Volume 3
requirements.
   A2.4.1. Lakenheath RAPCON will continue to receive airfield weather reports from
   automated weather sensors. RAPCON will pass current weather as required.
   A2.4.2. Should the weather deteriorate below helicopter VFR minimums, the aircrew has
   several options, including, but not limited to: coordinating an instrument approach with
   RAPCON for a landing at LKH or MLD, or diverting to Marham. Worst case scenario, the
   crew can perform a precautionary landing in one of the Stanta landing zones and wait for the
   weather to clear.
A2.5. Departure/Arrival. Practice aircraft approaches and local pattern work may be
conducted to the landing areas listed in paragraph A2.3.1. and IAW A2.12. Additionally, all
sorties will comply with USAFE 11-201 Chapters 3-5 in reference to quiet hours.
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                           93


A2.6. Lighting. UAO may be conducted at night without operable airfield lighting provided the
aircrews are using NVG’s or Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) equipped aircraft.
   A2.6.1. Participating aircraft will display overt lighting during taxi, takeoff, departure,
   approach, and landing.
   A2.6.2. RWY/TWY lighting can be turned on or off during airfield closures in accordance
   with paragraph 2.4.6. of LAKI 13-201.
A2.7. Scheduling and Quiet Hour Responsibilities.
   A2.7.1. 56 RQS will make every attempt to coordinate UAO at least one week prior to
   planned operations. The requester will ensure all appropriate organizations are notified and
   permission has been granted by the 48 FW/CC prior to the commencement of UAO.
   Agencies the 56 RQS is required to coordinate include Airfield Operations, Command Post,
   Weather, Fire Department and Wing Scheduling.
   A2.7.2. The 56 RQS will be responsible for coordinating quiet hour waivers IAW USAFE
   Instruction 11-201.
   A2.7.3. When the transition between airfield hours and UAO occurs, communication
   between 56 RQS and Airfield Ops needs to be clear to ensure both parties understand when
   the airfield closes and when UAO commences. This will be done prior to the airfield closing.
A2.8. Daily Duty Officer (DDO) Responsibilities.
   A2.8.1. The DDO, callsign ―Jolly Ops,‖ is the focal point for operations conducted under the
   scope of this instruction. While conducting flying operations during UAO, the 56 RQS will
   have a duty officer on duty from 1.5 hours prior to scheduled departure/arrival until 30
   minutes after last departure or until last arrival shuts down in chocks.
   A2.8.2. Notify 48 FW/CP when departing aircraft are airborne, arriving aircraft are 20
   minutes out from landing, and when engines are shutdown.
   A2.8.3. The DDO shall not perform ATC functions or issue ATC instructions. (Note:
   Communications with 48 FW/CP and Jolly Ops are advisory only and will not provide any
   flight or taxi clearances).
A2.9. Airfield Operations Responsibilities.
   A2.9.1. AMOPS will issue NOTAMs for uncontrolled airfield operations once notification is
   received as outlined in paragraph A2.7.
   A2.9.2. AMOPS will notify Jolly Ops of construction activities on the airfield for the
   proposed UAO ops timeframe.
   A2.9.3. AMOPS will ensure that airfield driver training includes applicable UAO procedures
   and hazards.
   A2.9.4. RAPCON will notify 48 FW/CP if a NAVAID status changes from fully functional
   to maintenance required during UAO.
A2.10. 48 FW/CP Responsibilities.
   A2.10.1. Notify SFCC of aircraft authorized to arrive and/or depart when the airfield is
   closed and of any ―same day‖ schedule changes.
 94                                               LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012


   A2.10.2. Provide Jolly Ops with the status of any pertinent changes to airfield facilities or
   crash-rescue capabilities upon request.
   A2.10.3. Provide advisories to vehicles requesting access into the Controlled Movement
   Area IAW A2.14.
A2.11. Flight Procedures
   A2.11.1. Aircraft participating in UAO will use procedures for uncontrolled operations in
   accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 3, FLIP, AFI 11-2HH-60G Volume 3, and AFMAN
   11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures, and
   Volume 3, Supplemental Flight Information.
   A2.11.2. Crews must file a flight plan before departing on any flight.
   A2.11.3. Flight plans must be filed with AMOPS NLT the last duty day prior to UAO.
   AMOPS cannot file flight plans earlier than five days prior to scheduled departure.
   A2.11.4. Should aircraft be delayed more than one hour past the planned VFR departure, the
   DDO is responsible for re-filing/updating flight plan in the MILEAMS system at the
   squadron ops desk.
   A2.11.5. Departing aircraft will contact Lakenheath Approach/Departure prior to or
   immediately after takeoff for traffic advisories and weather.
   A2.11.6. Crews will maintain contact with Jolly Ops on squadron assigned operations
   frequencies in accordance with local squadron procedures.
   A2.11.7. Arriving aircraft will contact Lakenheath Approach prior to entry into the CMATZ.
A2.12. Pattern Procedures. Aircraft conducting UAO operations will fly standard patterns as
identified in this instruction. There are no restrictions to the type or amount of patterns that can
be flown.
A2.13. Emergency Procedures. In the event of an in-flight or ground emergency:
   A2.13.1. The aircrew will notify Jolly Ops who will in turn contact 48 FW/CP to activate the
   base emergency response. In the case of time-critical emergencies, aircrew or Jolly Ops may
   contact the fire department directly and then notify the 48 FW/CP at the earliest opportunity.
   A2.13.2. The affected aircraft will activate base emergency response by notifying the 48
   CES/CEF, notifying 48 FW/CP via radio or by notifying DDO 1.
   A2.13.3. When notified of an emergency, 48 FW/CP will implement the appropriate
   emergency procedures/checklists.
   A2.13.4. Maintenance or Jolly Ops may notify the 48 CES/CEF of a ground emergency via
   Fire Crash Net or via telephone (911 from on-base landline or 01638527911 from a cell
   phone).
   A2.13.5. Aircraft mishaps will be handled IAW existing Lakenheath Wing Plans and
   Instructions.
A2.14. Airfield Driving Procedures
   A2.14.1. As outlined in paragraph 2.3.3.3. of this instruction, LAKI 13-201, all vehicles
   shall contact 48 FW/CP (call sign ―EAGLE OPS‖) when accessing and leaving the CMA
LAKENHEATHI13-201 22 OCTOBER 2012                                                             95


   when the airfield/tower is closed. 48 FW/CP is notified of UAO ops and is therefore in a
   unique position to aid vehicle driver situational awareness during requests to access the CMA
   during UAO operations. Therefore, in addition to the procedures outlined in paragraph
   2.3.3.3., 48 FW/CP will notify all vehicle traffic requesting access into the CMA of UAO ops
   upon first contact.
   A2.14.2. 48 FW/CP is not responsible for notifying vehicle traffic of each
   approach/departure. 48 FW/CP instead will broadcast a blanket statement during UAO ops.
   For example, state (CALL SIGN for vehicle), EAGLE OPS, AIRFIELD CLOSED,
   PROCEED AT YOUR DISCRETION, USE CAUTION FOR 56TH RESCUE SQUADRON
   HELICOPTER TRAFFIC CONDUCTING UNCONTROLLED AIRFIELD OPERATIONS,
   REPORT OFF.
   A2.14.3. In the event 56th RQS aircraft will use the runway, DDO will contact Eagle Ops
   NLT 10 minutes prior to takeoff or landing to confirm status of vehicle traffic on the runway.
   A2.14.4. 56 RQS aircrew routinely perform taxi and flight ops outside of the CMA and are
   therefore accustomed to scanning operating areas for vehicle traffic. During UAO Ops, 56
   RQS aircrew are responsible for scanning the take-off/landing surface and assume
   responsibility for deconflicting themselves from uncontrolled vehicle traffic within the CMA.
   Furthermore, the unique capabilities of helicopters to hover or stop forward progress
   decrease the likelihood of vehicle vs. helicopter traffic conflicts within the CMA during
   UAO ops.
A2.15. UAO DDO QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING
   A2.15.1. 56 RQS Current Operations (56 RQS/DOO) is the OPR for the DDO training
   program. The 56 RQS/DOO will be responsible for developing DDO training materials and
   requirements, conducting DDO training and maintaining all training records.
   A2.15.2. Each DDO will obtain an airfield driver’s license (with no restrictions) and an
   appropriate restricted area badge.
   A2.15.3. Each DDO will receive or review a briefing prepared by the LKH Fire Chief on
   emergency operations when the airfield is closed.
A2.16. DDO Status and Currency. There are no UAO DDO duty currencies; however,
qualification expires upon PCS or when revoked. Qualified DDOs will review UAO procedures
and/or request re-training as necessary to maintain proficiency in UAO duties.
