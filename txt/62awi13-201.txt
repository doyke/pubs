                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Policy. Motor vehicle operations on the airfield are necessary for mission accomplishment.
Operating vehicles on the airfield, however, also creates a clear and present danger to aircraft
and personnel. Due to the lack of established vehicular traffic lanes in all areas, every means
possible must be used to provide for safe operation. Airfield driver carelessness and disregard of
safety standards are the primary causes of aircraft-vehicle collisions and cannot be tolerated.
1.2. Authorization. Motor vehicle traffic on the airfield is restricted to government-owned
vehicles (GOV) on official business. Privately owned vehicles (POVs) and rental vehicles are
not authorized on the airfield without OG/CC approval. Airfield Management (62 OSS/OSAA)
may authorize vendor/contractor vehicles to drive on the airfield if needed to support the airfield
mission.
1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. Wing Commander.
        1.3.1.1. Designates agencies to support the McChord Field Airfield Driving Program
        (ADP).
        1.3.1.2. May reinstate airfield driving privileges in writing to perform mission essential
        duties following suspension/revocation of base driving privileges. Authority must not be
        delegated.
     1.3.2. Unit Commanders.
        1.3.2.1. Appoint a primary and alternate unit Airfield Driving Program Manager
        (ADPM) in writing (Attachment 2) to manage training and testing requirements of unit
        personnel that are required to operate a vehicle on the airfield. Forward a copy of the
        appointment letter to the Deputy Airfield Manager (DAFM) within 5 days of initial
        appointment.
        1.3.2.2. Certify personnel are qualified to drive on the airfield.      Authority may be
        delegated in writing to unit ADPMs.
        1.3.2.3. Ensure unit assigned personnel complete the required training and testing
        requirements outlined in AFI 13-213 (Chapter 4) and this airfield driving instruction
        (ADI).
        1.3.2.4. Limit the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the absolute
        minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.
        1.3.2.5. Upon suspension/revocation of a unit member’s base driving privileges,
        suspend/revoke the member’s airfield driving authorization and notify the unit ADPM
        and DAFM in writing within 2 work days. Request for reinstatement must be processed
        according to paragraph 1.3.1.2.
        1.3.2.6. Review the Individual Incident Reference Record and Driver Record to

reliable mechanical condition. A map delineating the airfield, AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport
Signs and Markings (Attachment 6), and a copy of 62 AWVA 13-3, McChord Flightline
Driving Guide (Attachment 7), will be kept in each vehicle frequently used on the airfield. The
AFVA 11-240 may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of
the sun visor on the driver’s side so it can be flipped down for ready reference. Airfield drivers
will use the perimeter, infield, intermediate, perpendicular, or outer roads to reduce nonessential
vehicle movement on the airfield. Drivers shall contact AMOPS or reference the Airfield Status
slides (located on OSAA Share point) prior to entering the airfield for pertinent airfield activities
(i.e. runway closure, construction).

2.7. Ramp Net Operations. The AMOPS and Tower nets are the common nets for all agencies
conducting routine operations on the airfield, except for Fire Department, hospital, and Security
Forces vehicles. The Fire Department nets are restricted for the Fire Department's exclusive use.
Tower will control all vehicular traffic on either Tower net (Channel 13) or the Fire Department
net. Simultaneous radio broadcast will only be used when dictated by an emergency situation.
The AMOPS net (Channel 14) will be used by vehicles operating in the uncontrolled movement
areas.
2.8. Radio Discipline/Phraseology. Due to the variety of frequencies monitored by Tower, it is
imperative that all individuals use proper and concise phraseology. Tower has ultimate authority
over all vehicle/pedestrians entering the CMA and will issue, by radio or directional light gun
signals, specific instructions that approve or disapprove the movement of vehicles, equipment,
and personnel/pedestrians on the CMA.
   2.8.1. Airfield Radio Phraseology: ALL AIRFIELD DRIVERS MUST CLEARLY
   UNDERSTAND COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUES PRIOR TO BEING AUTHORIZED
   ACCESS TO THE CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA. Unit ADPMs will evaluate
   drivers on proper radio usage. The following definitions and examples will be used when
   communicating with Tower.
62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                           15


Table 2.1. Definition of Terminology.
 NOTE: The use of nonstandard terminology, such as ―go-ahead,‖ ―cleared,‖ ―10-4,‖ or other
 nonessential communications is prohibited due to the possibility of confusing individuals
 operating on the airfield frequencies. When operating on any frequency utilized to control
 aircraft or ground movement on the airfield, all radio communications will be kept to an
 absolute minimum.

   2.8.2. Key Points.
       2.8.2.1. The words ―clear‖ or ―clearance‖ or any other form thereof shall not be used
       over the radio by airfield drivers. This may be misunderstood by other vehicles or
       aircraft as permission to perform an action.
       2.8.2.2. Key words in Tower transmissions are PROCEED and HOLD (see paragraph
       2.8.1.1).
       2.8.2.3. Always repeat Tower’s directions when operating on or near the CMA to
       confirm that Tower’s message was received and correctly understood.
       2.8.2.4. Notify Tower when leaving the runway by stating, ―Tower, (your call sign) off
       runway.‖
       2.8.2.5. If Tower’s radio transmission is garbled or unreadable, DO NOT PROCEED ON
       THE CMA. Hold your position and ask Tower to repeat the last transmission.
       2.8.2.6. Before asking for permission to access or cross the runway, scan the sky for
       approaching aircraft. This will prevent any unnecessary transmission and interruption of
       air traffic control.
       2.8.2.7. Before proceeding onto the CMA, obtain Tower's permission and visually clear
       the area before proceeding.
2.9. Runway Crossing Points (Attachment 11). Runway 16/34 may be crossed at Taxiways
Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. NOTE: Outer Drive is designated as the primary means for all traffic
to gain access to areas east of the runway. When runway crossing is required during flying
operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
2.10. Communication Out Procedures. Should radio communications failure occur, vehicles
and work crews will immediately vacate the CMA using the most direct route. Remain off of the
CMA until communications are restored with Tower. Approval from the Tower must be
obtained prior to re-entering the CMA.
2.11. Emergency Removal of Vehicles from the Runway. Vehicle operators are responsible
for visually observing the Tower for light gun signal directions. The following procedures will
be used to recall vehicles or personnel from the CMA if an emergency situation occurs or normal
communications cannot be used:
   2.11.1. Tower will:
       2.11.1.1. Continuously cycle the intensity of runway edge lights.
       2.11.1.2. Issue a flashing red light gun signal.
62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                           17


       2.11.1.3. Broadcast simultaneously over all frequencies for all personnel and equipment
       to exit the CMA.
   2.11.2. Vehicles/personnel will:
       2.11.2.1. Immediately proceed at least 100 feet off the CMA. All vehicles will exit using
       the nearest surface that will support the vehicle’s weight.
       2.11.2.2. Remain off runways and CMA until permission is obtained from Tower for re-
       entry.
2.12. Control Tower Signals. Airfield drivers shall be alert for and obey light gun signals from
the control tower. AFVA 11-240, USAF Airport Signs and Markings (Attachment 5), will be
posted in plain view in all vehicles routinely using the airfield. The Tower's light gun signals are
as follows:

Table 2.4. Tower Light Gun Signals.
 COLOR AND TYPE:                       MEANING:
 Steady Red Light                      STOP - Vehicle must not move.
 Flashing Red Light                    Clear active runway/taxiway immediately.
 Flashing White Light                  Return to starting point immediately.
 Alternating Red/Green Light           General Warning - Exercise extreme caution.
 Steady Green Light                    Clear to cross; proceed; go.
   2.12.1. All airfield vehicle operators must know and comply with all airfield signs, markings
   and control tower signals. NOTE: The FAA Form 5280-7 is the FAA equivalent to AFVA
   11-240 and may be used by units located at share-use airfields.
2.13. Vehicle Call Signs: All vehicles operating a radio on the airfield will be assigned call
signs. All call signs will consist of a code word and may have a numerical suffix. The DAFM
approves vehicular call signs to ensure duplicate call signs are not used. The following call signs
are assigned:

  Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Users                Specify Call Sign with AMOPS before operating
                                               on the airfield.
  Contractors                                  Specify Call Sign with AMOPS before operating
                                               on the airfield.
2.14. Radios. Each unit required to operate vehicles on the airfield is responsible for providing
its assigned drivers ramp net capable radios. AMOPs may issue hand-held radios for special
activities. Vehicles operating in the CMA using hand-held radios must have a spare battery and
shall conduct a functional radio check with AMOPS or Tower prior to entering the airfield.
2.15. Vehicle Traffic (Attachment 12). All airfield vehicles will be operated IAW this
instruction, AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver (Chapter 25); and
AFOSH Standard 91-100, Aircraft Flightline-Ground Operations and Activities (Chapter 6).
   2.15.1. All airfield vehicle traffic will drive within designated road markings whenever
   possible. Vehicles are prohibited from random travel (e.g. not following the painted
   roadways). Use of the airfield for convenience is prohibited. No vehicle will use the airfield
   as a shortcut to any point that is accessible by roads outside the airfield area. NOTE:
   Vehicles are prohibited from driving over the ―red carpets‖ located at parking spots DV1 and
   DV2.
   2.15.2. Vehicle operators will use established vehicle traffic lanes (B, J, D, E ramps, and D
   ramp extension) or drive on the right side and in close proximity to existing main taxi lines.
   Vehicles traveling in established traffic lanes have the right-of-way over vehicles entering
   these lanes. Vehicles leaving the traffic lanes or taxi lanes must signal before making a turn
   to their destination.
2.16. Taxiing Aircraft. All vehicles will give way to taxiing aircraft. When overtaking or
passing an aircraft moving in the opposite direction, move to an area at least 25 feet away from
the wing tip of the aircraft, bring the vehicle to a complete stop and give the taxiing aircrew the
thumbs up signal to indicate taxi clearance (do not leave a paved surface unless it is an
emergency). No vehicle will pass between an aircraft and its ―Follow Me‖ vehicle and/or
Aircraft Marshal except during anti-hijack procedures.
2.17. Approaching an Aircraft. All vehicles will approach a parked aircraft with the driver’s
side of the vehicle towards the aircraft. The approach will always be made from the side and
front of an aircraft. NOTE: Vehicles may approach the aircraft from the non-driver’s side when
delivering ground power units.
 20                                                                  62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011


   2.17.1. Except for servicing operations, no vehicle will park or drive closer than 25 feet to
   the front and side of an aircraft or less than 200 feet from the rear of an aircraft whose
   engines are running or about to be started. (For C-5, C-17, and B-747 aircraft, no vehicle
   will operate closer than 500 feet behind aircraft with engines operating or being started.)
   NOTE: Aircraft with engines running or about to start can be identified by spinning
   propellers, engine exhaust and/or position lights illuminated.
   2.17.2. During aircraft engine runs, vehicle operators will observe the direction of the
   ground observer and wait until instructed to proceed.
   2.17.3. Vehicle operators performing on-the-job training for airfield duties will not operate a
   vehicle within 50 feet of an aircraft. This restriction does not apply to fire fighting vehicles,
   vehicles towing aircraft, vehicles loading/unloading materials, handling equipment, and
   aircraft servicing vehicles.
   2.17.4. Do not operate vehicles within 50 feet of aircraft being refueled/defueled or in the
   process of Liquid Oxygen servicing.
2.18. Parked Aircraft. Motorized vehicles will not pass under any part of an aircraft. Vehicles
will not be driven between the wing tips of aircraft parked on adjacent spots. Vehicles will not
be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet) of any aircraft, except as authorized for
operations such as loading or unloading, servicing, or towing. In no case will a vehicle be closer
than 10 feet, except for K-loaders that are loading or unloading. A spotter will be posted when a
vehicle is backed towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks and a guide will be used to
prevent the vehicle from backing into the aircraft. Positioning and parking of vehicles will be
accomplished IAW provisions established in AFJMAN 24-306 (Chapter 25).
2.19. Emergency and Exercise Operations.
   2.19.1. During an aircraft emergency or exercise situation all vehicles not directly
   responding to the situation will keep away. Vehicles will STOP and YIELD the right-of-way
   to emergency vehicles. Airfield emergency vehicles include: AMOPs, fire department,
   security forces, and medical response vehicles.
   2.19.2. Vehicle drivers will not drive between emergency vehicles and emergency aircraft,
   whether stationary or in-trail.
   2.19.3. Vehicle emergency lights will be on when responding to an emergency. Immediately
   yield the right-of-way to emergency, fire, and crash vehicles with rotating emergency lights
   in operation.
   2.19.4. Remain clear of crash roads and runway or taxiway access points until the
   emergency is terminated.
   2.19.5. Vehicle drivers, who are parked around an emergency aircraft, will move their
   vehicles 300 feet away from the aircraft as soon as possible and before the arrival of
   emergency vehicles.
2.20. Night Operations/Restricted Visibility. During the hours of darkness and reduced
visibility (i.e., smoke, rain, drizzle, fog, snow) vehicle operators will comply with the following:
62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                           21


   2.20.1. All vehicles in motion must use headlights and/or flashers from one-half hour before
   sunset to one-half hour after sunrise and during periods of reduced visibility (i.e., smoke, rain
   drizzle, fog, or snow).
   2.20.2. Vehicles parked on the airfield will use emergency flashers. Vehicles not equipped
   with emergency flashers will use parking lights. NOTE: A rotating or flashing light may be
   used instead of emergency or parking lights.
   2.20.3. Drivers will not approach the front of any moving aircraft. Drivers will also avoid
   approaching the front of an aircraft towed at night. If approaching an aircraft cannot be
   avoided, position the vehicle in a location that is well clear of the aircraft's intended taxi
   route, with headlights turned off, until the aircraft has passed. This will ensure that aircrew
   members will not be blinded or have their night vision impaired by vehicle headlights.
   Parking lights will remain on so location is known.
   2.20.4. Airfield drivers operating vehicles with daytime running lights (DRL) must exercise
   extreme caution. Never point headlights toward taxiing or towed aircraft.
   2.20.5. When visibility is less that 300 feet, refueling and explosive loaded (laden) vehicles
   will not be operated unless directed by the wing commander.
       2.20.5.1. When visibility is less than 100 feet, vehicles (except emergency vehicles) will
       not be operated on the airfield.
       2.20.5.2. When visibility is less than 50 feet, it is recommended that a walking guide
       equipped with a flashing or luminescent wand be used during emergency vehicle
       movement.
       2.20.5.3. Regardless of visibility, or time of day, all vehicles will hold short of the INST
       hold lines on Taxiway Bravo (east) and Taxiway E (see paragraph 2.27.2).
2.21. Night Vision Airfield Driving. Driving with night vision devices is not authorized on the
McChord airfield.
2.22. Blackout Conditions. Vehicle operators must use extreme caution when driving during
blackout conditions or while wearing gas masks as visibility is extremely reduced. The use of
spotters is highly encouraged.
2.23. Airfield Parking (in Other than Designated Parking Areas). Temporary parking on the
airfield is allowed if the vehicle is properly attended. Unless mission requirements dictate,
vehicles will not be parked within 25 feet of aircraft. During these operations, spotters will be
used to guide vehicles within 25 feet of the aircraft and chocks will be pre-positioned.
   2.23.1. Vehicles will not be parked pointed towards an aircraft. Park in front or behind the
   aircraft perpendicular to the fuselage or parallel to the main taxi line when aircraft is parked
   on angled parking spots. This will eliminate the possibility of striking the aircraft if the
   vehicle inadvertently rolls backward or forward. Vehicles will be parked so departing can be
   accomplished without backing.
   2.23.2. Under no circumstance will vehicles park in front of taxiing aircraft. Ensure there is
   adequate clearance for taxiing aircraft and do not block painted roadways or driving lanes.
   When the driver’s seat is vacated, the ignition will be turned off, brake set, and the gear lever
   placed in reverse (standard shift) or park (automatic).
 22                                                                   62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011


   2.23.3. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral
   braking system when they are parked unattended on the aircraft parking ramp.
   2.23.4. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment that do not have an integral
   braking system when they are parked unattended on the aircraft parking ramp. NOTE:
   Materials Handling Equipment (MHE) will be operated and parked IAW AFOSHSTD 91-46,
   Materials Handling and Storage Equipment.
   2.23.5. Aircraft-servicing support vehicles that require the vehicle engine to operate as the
   power source for auxiliary components may be left unattended while the engine is running.
   When the driver’s seat is not occupied, set the parking brake and chock the rear wheels.
   2.23.6. Keys will remain in the ignition of unattended vehicles.
   2.23.7. Vehicle operators will not leave vehicles unattended on the runway or LZ or within
   1000 feet from runway. Under special circumstances, the AFM may approve vehicles within
   1000 feet of the runway centerline but no closer than 200 feet.
   2.23.8. Vehicle operators will not leave vehicles unattended on taxiways or within 200 feet
   of any taxiway centerline. EXCEPTION: After coordinating with Tower Ground Control,
   62 CS Airfield Systems Maintenance personnel may perform required ground checks on
   equipment as long as they stay within 200 feet of the unattended vehicle. This will allow
   them to quickly vacate the area if so instructed (e.g. for an in-flight emergency).
   2.23.9. Vehicles will not be left unattended within 135 feet of the taxi lines on the west side
   of Juliet ramp or 165 feet of the taxi lines on Bravo ramp.
   2.23.10. Emergency vehicles that must remain in operation at the scene of an emergency
   may park with the engine running. When the driver’s seat will not be occupied, the driver
   must set the parking brake, place the transmission in neutral or park, and chock the rear
   wheels.
2.24. Aircraft Refueling. Fuel trucks will:
   2.24.1. Not be parked closer than 20 feet to the aircraft fuel intake or air vents, nor within 10
   feet of any part of the aircraft.
   2.24.2. Not be driven or parked under any part of an aircraft.
   2.24.3. Leave the vehicle door slightly ajar while servicing aircraft in case there is an
   emergency and/or the vehicle must be moved quickly.
   2.24.4. All other vehicles will not operate or park a vehicle with 50 feet of any fuel spill or
   any refueling operation (see T.O. 00-25-172).
2.25. Aircraft Towing. Vehicle operators will not approach within 50 feet of an aircraft being
towed. The tow vehicle will be driven by an authorized and qualified driver. There will be a
qualified individual in the aircraft cockpit to provide braking during all towing operations of
fixed wing aircraft. Aircraft will not be towed at more than 5 miles per hour. Wing walkers will
be used during towing operations when required as determined by maintenance personnel.
Towing without aircraft power will only be done as a last resort and can only be approved by the

                                           Chapter 3

                                      ENFORCEMENT

3.1. Policy. AIRFIELD DRIVING SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT TO SUPPORTING THE
MISSION AND VIOLATIONS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. The Airfield Manager (AFM)
is the governing authority concerning airfield driving violations IAW applicable AFIs and will
determine appropriate actions based upon the seriousness of violations. Unit Commanders,
ADPMs (for unit assigned personnel), AM and SF personnel have authority to revoke airfield
driving privileges. The following policy is used only as a guideline and is not intended to cover
all situations:
3.2. Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAVs). A CMAV is an airfield infraction
caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians entering a controlled area on the airfield without
specific Tower approval. A runway incursion is the most serious CMA violation. If an incursion
occurs or is suspected, personnel identifying the incident will immediately notify AMOPS. The
individual’s AF IMT 483 must be surrendered to AMOPS and airfield driving privileges revoked
until an investigation is complete. Minimum revocation period for a runway incursion is:
   3.2.1. First Violation. The AFM/DAFM will revoke the individual’s airfield driving license
   (AF IMT 483) for a minimum of 30 days and notify the driver’s unit commander.
   Depending on the seriousness of the violation, the individual’s airfield driving privileges
   might not be reinstated. If privileges are to be reinstated, the individual must be retrained
   and recertified (IAW Chapter 4) by the unit ADPM.
   3.2.2. Second Violation. A second offense will result in a minimum of 90 days suspension.
   The individual's airfield driving privileges will be reinstated at the discretion of the
   AFM/DAFM or designated representative, upon recommendation by the individual's unit
   commander. If privileges are to be reinstated, the individual must be retrained and recertified
   (IAW Chapter 4) by the unit ADPM.
   3.2.3. Third Violation. A third offense will result in airfield driving privileges being
   revoked permanently at McChord AFB.
3.3. Security Controlled Area Violations. The outer confines of the airfield are considered a
security controlled area and are marked by signs. Security Forces will be notified immediately
when any unauthorized person or vehicle is found in the controlled areas. These incidents will
be handled as security zone violations and processed by 62 SFS. (See Chapter 5 for Restricted
Areas.)
3.4. Other Airfield Driving Violations. The AFM/DAFM will handle other airfield driving
violations on a case-by-case basis.
62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                         27


                                           Chapter 4

                                      CERTIFICATION

   4.1.3. Individual is successfully trained and tested in airfield driving procedures
   (Attachment 4).
4.2. Prerequisites for Permanently Assigned Personnel/Contractors. Screening unit
personnel for airfield certification will be accomplished by the unit commander through the unit
ADPM. The following requirements apply when determining if an individual needs to be
airfield certified:
   4.2.1. Only personnel requiring frequent and continuing airfield access should apply for
   airfield certification.
   4.2.2. The individual’s on- and off-duty behavior must reflect an acceptable level of maturity
   and responsibility.
   4.2.3. The individual must possess a valid state driver's license and have no driving
   violations that currently prevent the person from driving on base. Additionally, the
   individual must have a military or government driving license for the vehicles that he or she
   will drive on the airfield.
   4.2.4. All applicants must pass a color vision test administered by the 62 MDS. The DAFM
   may approve ―limited access‖ to individuals who fail the color vision testing. Access to the
   CMA is not granted in these cases and the AF IMT 483 will be stamped ―NOT
   AUTHORIZED CMA.‖ NOTE: Civilian employees working on the CMA must have
   normal color vision and it should be listed as a requirement for employment. EXCEPTION:
   Personnel that have a mandatory requirement for normal color vision (entry and retention) in
   their Air Force Specialty Code are exempt from color vision testing. The unit ADPM must
   provide the DAFM a current copy of AFSC specialty job description. NOTE: McChord
   Field assigned aircrew may submit a copy of their AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation
   for Flying or Special Operational Duties, instead of a color vision test stamped by the 62
   MDS.
4.3. Training. If all prerequisites are met, the unit ADPMs will, as a minimum, ensure that:

   training.
   4.3.5. A day (and night as required) airfield check ride is completed on the airfield. (See
   Attachment 16 for check ride criteria.) NOTE: Individuals not receiving night
   orientation/training check rides will have their AF IMT 483 restricted (e.g., AUTHORIZED
   DAYLIGHT HOURS ONLY). If the individual later requires a nighttime authorization, the
   unit ADPM will ensure training is provided (night orientation and check ride) and
   documented. The AFM/DAFM or designated AMOPS representative will update the AF
   IMT 483 as required.
   4.3.6. The individual passes the AMOPS's written airfield driving and phraseology test.
   (Minimum passing score is 80%, corrected to 100%.) NOTE: The AMOPS test will include
   the OPR and currency date.
4.4. Airfield Restrictions. Unit ADPMs have the option to restrict individuals to certain areas
on the airfield (e.g., airfield roadway), depending on the individual’s duty responsibilities.

       training was completed.
       4.5.1.2. The Airfield Check Ride checklist (Attachment 16).
       4.5.1.3. Airfield Driving CBT test score and an AF IMT 483.
   4.5.2. AMOPS will provide the individual with an incursion prevention briefing and an
   airfield layout map as a final test. This test will ensure all personnel operating on the airfield
   are thoroughly familiar with the airfield layout. Minimum passing score is 100%.
   4.5.3. AMOPS (AFM/DAFM or NAMO) will endorse the McChord IMT 603 and stamp the
   AF IMT 483 with the applicable airfield driving authorization (MCCHORD AIRFIELD,
   MCCHORD RAMP ONLY, or NOT AUTHORIZED CMA).
   4.5.4. AMOPS will retain the individual's McChord IMT 603 and return it to the unit
   ADPM, where it will be maintained until the individual leaves the unit.
4.6. Temporary Duty (TDY) Personnel.
   4.6.1. Personnel temporarily assigned to McChord AFB who have a requirement to drive on
   the airfield may be granted permission to drive on the airfield. The following criteria must

62AWI13-201 5 MAY 2011                                                                          29


   4.6.2. Using the TDY/Temporary Contractor Personnel Checklist (Attachment 17), the host
   unit's ADPMs will provide TDY personnel with an airfield orientation and airfield
   layout/procedures briefing, emphasizing FOD control, speed limits, and runway intrusions.
   The briefing will include those items identified in AFI 13-213: airfield signs, markings and
   lighting; speed limits for aircraft parking aprons, taxiways and special purpose vehicles;
   operating vehicles in the immediate vicinity of aircraft; parking and chocking requirements;
   lateral distance requirements for mobile obstacles on taxiways and aprons; FOD
   control/prevention; runway incursion prevention; airfield violations and consequences;
   proper radio terminology and phraseology; and, airfield layout.
   4.6.3. The individual will report to AMOPS in Bldg 1172 with a TDY/Contractor Checklist
   signed by the ADPM and a current AF IMT 483. AMOPS will either issue a temporary AF
   IMT 483 or stamp the airfield authorization (MCCHORD AFB AIRFIELD, MCCHORD
   RAMP ONLY, or NOT AUTHORIZED CMA) as appropriate on the reverse.
   4.6.4. Personnel who are not airfield driving certified at their home station must complete

                                           Chapter 5

                     RELATED AIRFIELD DRIVING OPERATIONS

5.1. Vehicle Magnetic Cone Procedures. All vehicles operating on the airfield that cannot be
easily identified from a distance as a GOV must have a magnetic cone displayed on the top of the
vehicle. EXCEPTIONS: Emergency response vehicles with hazard/warning lights installed,
fire protection vehicles, box trucks, crew/passenger buses, Wing/Group Commander staff cars
and Empire Aircraft Services.
   5.1.1. When a vehicle displaying a magnetic cone leaves the airfield, the cone will
   immediately be removed and secured.
   5.1.2. Magnetic cones may be obtained from the unit ADPM (for government tagged
   vehicles only).
5.2. Privately Owned Vehicles (POV). POVs are prohibited from operating on the airfield.
NOTE: Rental vehicles are considered POVs. Government leased/rented vehicles may be used
on the airfield during special events such as Air Expo/RODEO with OG/CC approval (per
paragraph 1.2). AMOPs will determine pass procedures and issuance.
   5.2.1. Temporary Passes. AMOPS will issue a magnetic cone to personnel who have an
   infrequent requirement to drive commercial vehicles on the airfield (i.e., leased or
   contractor/vendor nongovernment-owned vehicles). The magnetic cone will be placed on top
   of the vehicle when on the airfield.
   5.2.2. The contracting officer or coordinator is responsible for:
       5.2.2.1. Briefing commercial contractor personnel on their responsibilities while
       operating motor vehicles on the airfield.
       5.2.2.2. Providing contractor personnel with a letter to AMOPS (62 OSS/OSAA) that
       sufficiently justifies the requirement for a temporary permit.
5.3. Foreign Object Damage/Debris (FOD) Prevention. Vehicles on the airfield are a major
source of foreign objects that damage aircraft tires and are ingested into jet engines with
potentially disastrous results. All airfield personnel have a responsibility for FOD control. In
order to help prevent FOD, the following precautions shall be taken by all personnel on the
airfield:
   5.3.1. Close truck tailgates and tool compartments prior to entering and while driving on the
   airfield.
   5.3.2. Operate vehicles on paved surfaces to the maximum extent possible. If operation off
   paved surfaces is required to perform duties, the driver will check the tires immediately after
   returning to the paved surface and remove any potential foreign object material.
   5.3.3. When exiting a construction area onto the airfield, drivers must stop, inspect vehicle’s
   tires, and remove any potential foreign object material.
   5.3.4. Remove FOD from the airfield when it is observed. Contact AMOPS if a sweeper is
   required.
   5.3.5. Ensure that all equipment carried in/on a vehicle is properly stored and secured.
