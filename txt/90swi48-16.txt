System, M41.

2. Purpose: The NBC protective mask is a critical force protection asset as long as it properly fits the
wearer. An improperly fitted NBC mask could result in death upon minute exposure to chemical or bio-
logical agents. The QNFT enhances NBC defense survivability by quantitatively testing for mask leakage
and training personnel on how to properly don, adjust and select the best mask-fit possible and instill
mask confidence. Bioenvironmental (BEF) and Civil Engineering Readiness (CEX) Flights jointly
administer the QNFT Program.

3. New Policy Intent (Dated 25 June 2004): The purpose of the policy is to relieve the burden from
bases required to fit test the same individuals multiple times due to mask shortages. The previous policy,
“fit-to-mask”, required an individual to be fit tested each time a different gas mask was issued. Currently,
2                                                                     90SWI48-16 17 FEBRUARY 2006


the “fit-to-size” permits deploying individuals to use a same size and type mask determined during QNFT
but not necessarily the same one they were initially fit-tested on.

4. Responsibilities:
    4.1. Commanders, directors, and functional managers.
       4.1.1. Responsible for enforcing the provisions of this instruction.
       4.1.2. Ensure members filling primary mobility position numbers (MPN) receive NBC QNFT and
       meet required testing schedules according to 90th Space Wing 2006-2007 AEF cycles. See
       Attachment 1.
       4.1.3. Ensure sufficient supplies of NBC masks are available for all personnel on mobility and/or
       deployable to high or medium threat areas.

5. Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF):
    5.1. Provide QNFT Program oversight of gas mask fit-testing.
    5.2. Ensure BEF system operators are fully trained on the M41 Protection Assessment Test System
    (PATS) and commercial variant (Porta Count) plus accessories, adapters, and testing procedures.
    5.3. Setup and check the M41 as described in AFMAN 32-4006.
    5.4. Perform all tests IAW AF Technical Order 14P4-15-11.
    5.5. Establish certain days of the week to administer the test. Note: Monday – Thursday 0800-1100
    hrs and 1300 – 1600 hrs. Call extension 3088 for appointment. Note: No Show Letters will be dis-
    tributed if individual fails to report at established date/time.
    5.6. On a case-by-case basis, arrange to visit units with large populations for QNFT testing.
    5.7. Furnish two copies of the Command Core System QNFT letter or similar product to the individ-
    ual. Note: The individual will maintain a copy within his/her gas mask and in his/her mobility folder
    for verification purposes.
    5.8. Notify the unit commander of individuals unable to achieve a 2000 Fit-Factor (FF).
NOTE: A 2000 FF is required to pass the QNFT. The QNFT test is based on the amount of particles
assessed inside the mask versus outside. This is used to indicate if the gas mask has a proper seal.
    5.9. Identify personnel requiring QNFT every 20 – 40 months or within 30/60/90 days of assignment
    for high/medium/low NBC threat areas using spreadsheet/database.

           FACT SHEET FOR AIR FORCE NBC MASK QUANTITATIVE FIT TEST (QNFT)
                               AND TRAINING PROGRAM


Q: What is the Quantitative Fit Test (QNFT) and Training Program?
A: AFMAN 32-4006, Nuclear, Biological And Chemical (NBC) Mask Fit And Liquid
Hazard Stimulant Training, outlines the Air Force (AF) program to perform “quantitative”
fit testing and training on NBC protective masks for AF members. The quantitative
method determines how well the mask fits the wearer and if the individual has a properly
sized mask. In the past, the AF used subjective qualitative methods to determine if the
gas masks fit, relying on an individual’s sense of smell and taste to a test agent. QNFT
involves measuring the particulate concentration in the atmosphere (outside of the mask)
and inside the mask cavity, and calculating a fit factor (FF). The higher the FF, the better
the fit.


Q: Why conduct QNFT?
A: The purpose of the QNFT and Training Program is to enhance NBC defense training,
help AF personnel maximize their NBC mask protection, and instill NBC mask
confidence. The NBC mask QNFT program applies to negative pressure masks designed
specifically for use in an NBC environment. This program is intended to be training
aide rather than a certification tool to ensure personnel meet or exceed the minimum
target FF. QNFT increases personal protection through training personnel to attain an
adequate FF by:


(1) Confirming individuals’ mask sizes are correct, and
(2) Training individuals on how to properly don their masks to attain an adequate fit
(e.g., sequence of head harness adjustment) and to know what their mask feels
like when an adequate fit is attained (e.g., head harness tension).
90SWI48-16 17 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                   7


Q: What is the “minimum target” fit factor (FF)?
A: The AF selected a FF of 2000 as a division between “adequate” and “poor” fitting gas
masks. The FF indicates how well the mask fits; it is not a protection factor (PF). A PF
indicates the degree to which an adequately fitted mask will reduce the concentration of a
contaminant. For example, for a given contaminant, an adequately fitted mask with a
protection factor of 10,000 will reduce the wearer’s exposure to 1/10,000th of the
contaminant level outside the mask. The QNFT does not measure or determine the
protection factor.


Q: Why do some individuals “fail” QNFT?
A: Some reasons people do not attain the minimum target FF include use of corrective
lens inserts (straps may interfere with the seal) or the shape and size of the individual’s
head. It is also important to realize that the NBC masks were not designed to fit 100% of
the AF population; there will be persons who, due to the size and shape of their heads,
will fall outside the design percentiles for the mask.


Q: What could preclude a valid QNFT?
A: It could be a medical condition or mask problem. (1) If an individual reporting for
QNFT has an obvious medical condition that might interfere with a valid evaluation (for
example, swelling due to dental surgery; a skin condition; or a shaving waiver). QNFT
will be delayed pending a medical evaluation, which may result in rescheduling QNFT to
a later date or some other medical follow-up. (2) There could be a physical problem with
the mask (e.g., dirt in exhalation valve).


Q: What can be done to improve fit?
A: The person conducting the fit test will determine if something can be changed to
improve the fit of the mask. This may include modifying donning procedures, using a
skull cap, ordering Advantage 1000 spectacle inserts, or selecting a smaller or larger
mask. All of this is done at the time of the fit test. Most people who do not reach the
minimum fit factor will be able to achieve it through these simple actions.

Q: What if a person in your unit cannot achieve the minimum target FF?
A: A small percentage of service members cannot be properly fitted with the authorized
protective mask (e.g., MCU-2 Series mask). These individuals are classified as “Hard-to-
Fit”. If all options have been exhausted, then Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) may
recommend a M45 Land Warrior, Chemical-Biological Mask (available in Extra Small
and Large) for the unit to order for the hard-to-fit individual. Once a fit is obtained, the
mask will be issued as Individual Equipment. The hard-to-fit individual will retain
possession of their mask as they transfer between duty stations and deploy with that
mask. If the M45 option is not applicable for the individual, BE will request a meeting
with the individual’s commander to discuss deployment issues.


Q: How does the unit of the hard-to-fit individual order a M45 mask?
A: All purchases of M45 masks for hard-to-fit individuals will be made on the
recommendation of the BE Flight. The M45 can only be purchased in two sizes: Extra
Small and Large. In addition, different size nose cups are available. The unit is
responsible for funding the mask and any supporting or replacement parts. Submit
requisitions for the M45 mask through the standard supply channels to the Depot. The
mask kit and the mask accessories (spare parts, hoods, second skins, filters) must be
purchased using O&M dollars. The NSNs are as follows: XS = 4240-01-447-6989 and
LG = 4240-01-447-6988.


Q: Does the hard-to-fit individual keep the M45 mask while in the Air Force?
A: Yes. Certified hard-to-fit individuals retain possession of their mask, since the M45
is custom fitted to the individual, as they transfer between duty stations until him/her
terminates from active or reserve service. The M45 masks are returned to the supply
system once the individual separates from the service. Each individual is responsible for
the proper safeguarding and care of the mask.
