    2.2. Shipments will arrive at either of two gates (Walmore or Tuscarora) when transported by truck.
    Shipments of munitions will be received only between 0730 and 1530 hours on regular duty days.
    Other arrival times will require coordination and prior approval with the appropriate conventional
    munitions section.

3. Munitions Arriving by Surface Vehicle (Truck or Other Conveyance):
    3.1. Class/Division 1.3. or 1.4. Note: Explosives H/C/D 1.1 and 1.2 will not be allowed on Niagara
    Falls ARS.
       3.1.1. Between 0730 and 1530 on a weekday (normal duty hours), the security guard will validate
       driver identification and HAZMAT driver’s licenses and conduct close inspection of the vehicle.
       The security guard will also direct the driver to proceed to the nearest inspection area and inform
       the security control who is responsible for that shipment. Security Forces shall cordon off area
       securing the site to prevent unauthorized access.
       3.1.2. During other than normal duty hours, the guard will instruct the driver that the U.S. Army’s
       Military Traffic Management Command Operation Center will be notified of the discrepancy at
       1-800-524-0331.
    3.2. Class/Division 1.3 or 1.4 Munitions Onboard Carriers Vehicle.
       3.2.1. Between 0730 and 1530 on a duty day (or if prior arrangements were approved for other
       times), the security guard will direct the driver to the nearest inspection area and inform the secu-
       rity control who is responsible for that shipment. Truck inspection areas are:
           3.2.1.1. Area 1 (Walmore Gate): Kinross Street, south of Utzig Drive.
           3.2.1.2. Area 2 (Tuscarora Gate): Southeast corner of parking lot east of building
           904(NYANG).
       3.2.2. Security Control (914 AW or 107 ARW) will send a security representative to the inspec-
       tion area and advise their respective transportation section and supply section, the 914 AW com-
       mand post, base fire department, and safety office that an explosive-laden vehicle is in the
       inspection area.
914AWI91-203 8 NOVEMBER 2004                                                                             3


      3.2.3. The supply representative will determine the ultimate receiver of the shipment and contact
      security control (by way of on-scene security police). CAUTION: Radios should not be used
      within a 50’ radius of explosives downloaded and those still onboard the delivery vehicle.
      3.2.4. The respective vehicle maintenance section will dispatch a vehicle inspector (auto
      mechanic) to the inspection area. The vehicle inspector will inspect the explosive-laden vehicle
      in-accordance-with DTR 4500.9R and DOD 6055.9 Standard, chapter 5, using DD Form 626,
      Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous Material).
      3.2.5. If found to be in satisfactory condition, the vehicle will be escorted by the security police
      and fire department along the designated route to the munitions offload point. NOTE: Explo-
      sive-laden vehicles entering the installation will be inspected for Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
      before entering the aircraft-parking ramp. This can be accomplished at the vehicle inspection area,
      or just prior to entering the aircraft parking areas.
      3.2.6. If the shipment is considered unsafe, contact security police. Security police will notify the
      appropriate off base Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) agency. NOTE: Under AFMAN
      91-201, paragraph 2.74.13.5, the "suspect vehicle" area will be Aircraft Explosive Cargo parking
      area, located at the center end of Taxiway A-1, unless it is more hazardous to move the vehicle.
      The decision to move a suspect vehicle to this area will be determined by the on-scene Com-
      mander and two out of three representatives from security police, transportation, and safety.
      3.2.7. If “Safe Haven” is requested by the carrier representative (driver) due to an actual threat to
      the munitions being transported, the security police desk will be contacted for coordination pur-
      poses and to obtain a decision on granting “Safe Haven” status. Discretion must be exercised to
      minimize public endangerment achieved by allowing carrier representatives and equipment to
      remain on base overnight (or until the threat has passed).
      3.2.8. The fire department will dispatch a fire truck to the holding area and provide escort protec-
      tion to the offload point.
      3.2.9. When a truck is parked on the Aircraft Explosive Cargo parking area, NFTA and Niagara
      Falls Tower must be apprised of the need to preclude any aircraft from taxiing near the explo-
      sives-ladened vehicle.
