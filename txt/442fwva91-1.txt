             COMMANDER’S SAFETY VISION
                                 “Mission First, S afety Always!”
Safety preserves our resources, both human and material.
Every day the 442 FW trains for, or executes, some of the
most demanding missions in the Air Force. Any loss due
to a mishap is just as costly as a loss in combat. I rely on
you; maintainers, operators, support personnel and
commanders to be my safety staff. I expect each of you to
integrate the principles of risk management in every
activity we do, at work as well as at home. Risk
management is as simple as ABCD: Assess the risk,
Balance controls, Communicate with others, and Decide
on control actions. Risk management will enable us to
eliminate unnecessary risks and successfully accomplish
our mission. I am obligated and dedicated to providing
our Airmen a safe and healthy working environment. I
challenge each of you to join me in achieving that goal.
