*Note 1: If MSCL 503 (C-5) is loaded, mispolls shall not exceed 10% per station, per munitions
type. Mispolls exceeding more than one (1) MJU-62 type flare per torque box station,
necessitates flare replacement. Mispolls exceeding more than three (3) MJU-53 type flares per
visor station and more than two (2) per torque box station necessitates flare replacement.

      8.5.6. If any error message is displayed on the CMDS CDU during the flare load process,
      terminate the load procedure and contact 60/349 AMXS (C-5) or 860/945 AMXS (C-17),
      Electronic Warfare, to verify proper system operation. After proper system operation is
      assured, complete the load operation.
      8.5.7. Flares will not be downloaded from one aircraft and uploaded on another aircraft.
      Only flares that have been certified by 60/349 MXS/MXMW will be utilized for new
      ADS tasking order requirements.
   8.6. Upon completion of the upload, normal maintenance may continue on the aircraft
   providing that the CMDS is safe (power removed from CMDS, and master safety pin is
   installed). Refer to T.O.11A-1-33, Handling and Maintenance of Explosives-Loaded
   Aircraft.
9. Flare Download Procedures.
   9.1. The applicable 60/349 AMXS or 860/945 AMXS Flare Load Team will perform the
   flare load operation. Flare load teams will notify MOC or their respective flight line
8                                                            TRAVISAFBI91-106 2 MAY 2013


    expediter when download is started. MOC will notify the Fire Protection Flight of the
    location of the flare downloading.
    9.2. In the event of a hung flare or explosive incident/accident involving flares, MOC must
    immediately notify the Fire Protection Flight, EOD (through command post), 60/349 AMW
    Safety, Airfield Management, 60/349 MXG Safety, the 60/349 MXS Production Supervisor
    and the applicable 60/349 AMXS Production Supervisor or 860/945 AMXS Production
    Supervisor.
    9.3. If the flare inventory does not match requirements as described in paragraph 8.6.4.2
    (C-17 and 8.6.4.3 (C-5), due to any combination of factors, and there is not an imminent
    mission scheduled, the aircraft must be downloaded and the flares turned over to 60/349
    MXS/MXMW for replacement.
    9.4. All aircraft containing flares sets with expenditures and all aircraft earmarked for
    aircraft maintenance hangars and spots 301, 302, 522, 710-719 will have flares downloaded
    and turned over to 60/349 MXS/MXMW.
    9.5. To comply with TAFBI 21-106, Foreign Object Damage/Dropped Object Prevention
    Program, account for flare panels and to provide a means for maintenance accountability
    during flare downloading procedures, the following forms documentation will be entered in
    aircraft AFTO 781As:
       9.5.1. For C-5/C-17 Download: A Red X, using WUC 01000, will be entered in forms,
       separate from the info notes, and will read – AIRCRAFT REQUIRES FLARE
       DOWNLOAD.
       9.5.2. Line through “INFO NOTE”, as required, for previous entered documentation for
       flare panel removal once panels have been installed on aircraft.
       9.5.3. Line through/update “INFO NOTE” previously entered for documenting flare
       upload.
    9.6. It is acceptable to temporarily download flares to perform short maintenance actions
    (not to exceed 4 hours) at the same location, and then immediately re-upload flares following
    maintenance (note: All applicable flare loading steps outlined in task specific flare load
    checklist will be accomplished prior to re-uploading flares). Flares will be placed in the flare
    storage container during the short maintenance actions. If, for any reason, the maintenance
    cannot be completed within the 4 hours, then flares will be turned over to 60/349
    MXS/MXMW.
    9.7. Flare load teams or their respective flight line expediter will notify MOC when
    download is complete.
    9.8. MOC will notify the Fire Protection Flight and Airfield Management that flares have
    been removed from the affected aircraft.
TRAVISAFBI91-106 2 MAY 2013                                                          9


  9.9. 60/349 MXS/MXMW personnel will notify 60/349 MXS Production Supervisor to
  notify MOC and advise them that flares have been pick-up and the removal of explosive
  hazard, MOC in turn will notify the Fire Protection Flight.
