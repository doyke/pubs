SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access to
classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the DD
Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information systems
(AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the requirement
to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in this
publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security and
policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The term
"sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified contract that
has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | )
indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment.

                                          Chapter 2

                                SECURITY CLEARANCES

2.1. Facility Security Clearances (FCLs).
   2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security
   Clearance (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the FCL.
   DSS establishes and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M, DOD
   5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-501,
   Personnel Security Program Management.
       2.1.1.1. To request an FCL sponsorship, write to the CSO with oversight responsibility
       for the sponsored facility.
       2.1.1.2. Give the full name for the sponsored facility, its physical and mailing address,
       telephone number, and a specific point of contact at the facility, when known. Give the
       full name, job title, and direct-dial telephone number of the Air Force sponsor.
       2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When
       circumstances do not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through
       DSS.
   2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential
   and Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of
   interim Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD
   5220.22-R. To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships
   through command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each
   request must include these items:
   2.1.2. (AFMC) Route interim Top Secret facility security clearances through local CIP and
   HQ AFMC/IP.
       2.1.2.1. An explanation of why an interim Top Secret FCL would prevent a crucial delay
       in the award or performance of a classified contract.
       2.1.2.2. A listing giving the legal name of the facility being sponsored, its complete
       street address, and the names and positions of people who are applying for interim Top
       Secret access authorization.
       2.1.2.3. The address of the authorizing DSS.
   2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
   participating in the NISP.
       2.1.3.1. The ISPM with oversight responsibility for a cleared facility conducts required
       security reviews of the operation and assists the CSO, as necessary.
       2.1.3.2. The ISPM also conducts surveys and/or administrative inquiries pertaining to an
       on-base cleared facility as requested by the CS O and ensures contractor compliance
       with DOD 5220.22-M, NISPOM.
 18                                       AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_AEDCSUP_I 5 MAY 2011


      2.1.3.3. Complete the survey by using the DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance
      Survey Data Sheet, [DOD 5220.22-R], or an equivalent/acceptable automated format
      when conducting survey for an on-base cleared facility and forward a copy to the CSO.
      2.1.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Contracting officers (COs) verify facility security clearances
      through the Defense Security Service (DSS) Industrial Security Field Database (ISFD) or
      DSS Secure Web Site. When COs require assistance to verify a facility security
      clearance, they contact the servicing CIP.
      2.1.3.4. (AEDC) AEDC/TSD-IP will verify the facility security clearance (FCL) and
      authorized safeguarding of classified information through the local DSS or DSS Central
      Verification Authority for all DD Forms 254 received for review. Contracting Officers
      may contact AEDC/TSD-IP for assistance in verification of the FCL.
2.2. Contractors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).
   2.2.1. The CSO tells COs if a contractor performing on a classified contract has foreign
   ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) or whether it can be negated. Such influence might
   jeopardize the security of classified information held by the contractor.
   2.2.1. (AEDC) AEDC/PK will immediately notify the SSA anytime Foreign Ownership,
   Control or Influence (FOCI), or other pertinent security issues are identified relating to
   AAFB or AEDC GSU contractors. Conversely, the SSA will notify AEDC/PK anytime
   issues arise with contractors on AAFB, AEDC/OL-000A and AEDC/OL-000-B contractors
   that could affect their FCL status.
   2.2.2. To resolve a FOCI problem, the CSO may establish a facility clearance that limits the
   level and type of classified information to which a FOCI contractor has access. Such
   restrictions might affect ongoing, pending and future classified contracts with the contractor.
   The CO should discuss this impact with the ISPM and servicing Foreign Disclosure office.
   2.2.3. The CO considers sponsoring a National Interest Determination (NID) after receiving
   written justification from the requesting program office or activity. This justification must
   address and explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the sole
   available source to the AF. If applicable, the program or activity must also provide a written
   explanation when contract cancellation would cause unacceptable delays for mission-
   essential weapons systems in the field or for support organizations.
      2.2.3.1. The requesting program office or activity is responsible for obtaining written
      release approval authority from the functional owner of the “proscribed information,”
      prior to submitting the NID to the contracting office. The program office or activity
      contacts the OCA for Top Secret (TS), NSA for Communications Security (COMSEC),
      DCI for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and DOE for Restricted Data (RD)
      or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) to obtain release approval. (NOTE: All release
      determination request (NID) involving/for SCI must be submitted to HQ USAF/XOIIS
      for review, coordination and processing).
          2.2.3.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Forward requests for SCI NIDs through the supporting
          SSO/SIO, to HQ AFMC/A2S (MAJCOM SSO), for HQ USAF/A2RS approval.
      2.2.3.2. The CO reviews, validates, and processes the NID and associated written
      approvals as follows:
AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_AEDCSUP_I 5 MAY 2011                                                     19


          2.2.3.2.1. Forward request for NID related to special access program (SAP)
          performance through the appropriate SAP and command channels to the Deputy for
          Security and Investigative Programs, Office of the Administrative Assistant
          (SAF/AAZ), 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20330-1720 for approval.
          2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to
          HQ USAF/ XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to
          SAF/AAZ for review and endorsement.
          2.2.3.2.2. (AFMC) Forward requests for non-Special Access Program (SAP)
          National Interest Determination (NID) through the local CIP to HQ AFMC/IP for
          submission to SAF/AAP. Local CIP and HQ AFMC/IP review and coordinate as
          appropriate.
      2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of
      Defense for Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon,
      Washington, D.C. 20301-3040, for final approval.
2.3. Contractor Personnel Security Clearances (PCLs).
   2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also
   terminates contractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor
   employee is terminated. Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications
   regarding the employee or the contractor.
   2.3.2. The Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review, DOD Office of General
   Counsel, may suspend or revoke contractor PCLs following due process.
   2.3.3. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential or Secret PCLs for interim
   clearances, where possible.
   2.3.4. When a contractor employee who is not cleared for access to Top Secret information
   needs such access to perform on an Air Force classified contract, the employing contractor
   may sponsor the individual for an interim Top Secret PCL.
      2.3.4.1. The contractor should send requests to the CO who seeks concurrence of the
      system program office (SPO), system manager (SM), or program manager (PM).
      2.3.4.2. The contractor's request should document clearly why the individual needs an
      interim PCL, why contract requirements may not be satisfied with another individual
      more suitably cleared, and what the potential adverse impact would be on contract
      performance if an interim PCL were not granted. The contracting officer will deny
      contractor requests that do not meet these criteria.
      2.3.4.3. The CO routes the appropriate contractor’s request for interim Top Secret PCLs
      to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval.
      2.3.4.3. (AFMC) Route interim Top Secret personnel security clearance (PCL)
      paperwork through the local CIP and HQ AFMC/IP for submission to AFMC/CC.
      2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes
      the endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS
      for action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.

   2.3.5. (Added-AFMC) OC-ALC/PK acts as the nominating commander on requests for
   personnel security investigation requests for contractors supporting presidential activities.
   See DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program; AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security; and AFI
   31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, for additional guidance.
2.4. Processing Trustworthiness Determinations.
   2.4.1. When contractors require unescorted entry to restricted areas, access to sensitive
   unclassified information, access to government automated information systems (AIS) and/ or
   sensitive equipment, not involving access to classified information, the contractor’s personnel
   security questionnaire is processed by the sponsoring Air Force activity per DOD 5200.2-R
   and AFI 31-501.
   2.4.1. (AFMC) Sponsoring Air Force organizational security managers submit requests for
   contractor unclassified IT personnel security investigations to the servicing CIP for
   processing IAW AFI 31-501.
2.5. Reciprocity. The CO, ISPM, and other installation security disciplines offices of primary
responsibility (OPRs) work together to resolve issues pertaining to reciprocity, as applicable to
inspections, surveys, audits, security clearances, security reviews, etc. Elevate reciprocity issues
to the next higher level of command when they can not be resolved locally.

3.1. Security Training Requirements.
3.1. (AEDC)Security training requirements for contractors performing classified efforts on
AAFB and AEDC GSUs are contained in the VGSA. Security training requirements for the
same contractors performing unclassified efforts are outlined in a standard security clause
provided to the contractor by AEDC/PK.
   3.1.1. Air Force classified solicitations and/or contracts [Statement of Objectives (SOO),
   Statement of Work (SOW), Request for Bid (RFB), Request for Quote (RFQ), VGSA, etc.]
   may stipulate contractor compliance with and participation in pertinent Air Force, command
   and installation security training programs when performance or services will occur on an

   3.1.2. When specified in an executed VGSA, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management, security training requirements satisfy the NISPOM training provision for on-
   base integrated visitor groups. Other Air Force functionals and/or security discipline OPRs
   may use this training provision for operational efficiency, however the specific requirements
   must be identified in the VGSA.
   3.1.3. When an on-base contractor operation is designated as a cleared facility, the ISPM
   will provide the initial facility security officer (FSO) briefing in accordance with the
   NISPOM and CSO guidance.
   3.1.4. Air Force unit security managers or security officers will provide information security
   program training (initial, refresher and annual) and other security awareness support to
   integrated visitor groups. The AF activity, working in concert with the ISPM, will
   incorporate language into the VGSA, which requires visitor group personnel to attend and/or
   receive information security training per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Chapter 8. Unit
   security managers will ensure integrated visitor group personnel are included in their security
   education program.
   3.1.4. (AFMC) The contractors' facility security officer or visitor group security point of
   contact (POC) will provide initial and recurring security training to NISPOM visitor group
   contractors. NISPOM visitor group employees may be included in AF unit security training
   programs.
3.2. Security Briefing/Debriefing Requirements.
   3.2.1. Management officials of the on-base cleared facility visitor groups are responsible for
   ensuring their employees receive all required security briefings and debriefings as mandated
   by the NISPOM.
   3.2.2. For integrated visitor groups, DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 security training
   requirements are equivalent to and satisfy the training requirements of NISPOM, where

                    SECURITY SPECIFICATIONS AND GUIDANCE

4.1. Issuing Security Classification Guidance.
   4.1.1. The AF program, project, activity and contracting office (CO) implements NISPOM,
   DOD 5200.1-R, and installation security requirements through contract documents. Only
   COs can sign, modify or negotiate changes to contracts.
   4.1.2. When a contractor requires access to classified information, the AF program, project
   or activity prepares the required DD Forms 254, DOD Contract Security Classification
   Specifications. The contractor should use the security requirements in this form to accurately
   estimate the cost of security measures. More detailed security requirements are specified in
   the statement of work (SOW), statement of objectives (SOO), performance work statement
   (PWS), Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA), etc.
   4.1.2. (AFMC) AF program, project officers, or activity POCs must involve the CIP early
   in the acquisition process when contracts require contractor access to classified or
   unclassified sensitive information or enhanced physical security for products while under the
   contractor’s control.
   4.1.2. (AEDC) Air Force program officers, project officers, or other government activities
   point of contact must involve AEDC/TSD-IP early in the acquisition process when contracts
   require contractor access to classified or unclassified, sensitive information, or enhanced
   physical security for products under the contractor’s control.
   4.1.3. The responsible AF program, project, or activity will identify (by title, functional
   OPR, and approval date), the specific security classification guidance or guides (SCGs)
   applicable to the contract in Block #13 of the DD Form 254. The AF activity/program will
   provide copies of the SCG to the contractor prior to the contract commencing.
       4.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Use the DD Form 254 to convey contractual security
       classification guidance to foreign contractors. For complex classification issues, attach
       Country Specific Guides or extracts of security classification guides (SCG) applicable to
       the foreign contract performance that are releasable to the government of that country
       under National Disclosure Policy. DoD SCGs are not releasable to foreign nationals or
       governments unless approved by the responsible foreign disclosure officer (FDO).
       Coordinate all proposed releases with the local Foreign Disclosure Office.
4.2. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specifications.
   4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
   contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
   the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
   terms of the solicitation/ contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
   forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
   classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements
   listed in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.

   4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
   disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security
   guidance is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the
   requesting AF entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards
   an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
   4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security
   disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form
   254. This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office
   symbol, date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and
   maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When
   SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible
   for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs
   unclassified, whenever possible.
4.3. Reviewing and Certifying the DD Form 254.
   4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
   classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only

   the DD Form 254. Contract completion dates will not be annotated on the DD Form 254.
4.4. Distribution of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.1. When DSS is relieved of security oversight responsibility for cleared facilities
   performing on SCI or SAP programs, furnish Headquarters DSS, 1340 Braddock Place,
   Alexandria VA 22314-1651, a copy of the DD Form 254.
   4.4.2. When a contractor’s performance will be on Air Force installation, the AF program,
   project or activity must identify/specify all contract performance locations, if known, on the
   DD Form 254. When the contract is performed elsewhere, the CO will provide a copy of the
   signed DD Form 254 to that location’s ISPM.
   4.4.2. (AFMC) When performance will be on an Air Force installation, identify the
   servicing CIP by office symbol and address in Block 13 of the DD Form 254. For contract
   performance outside the CONUS, place an “X” in Block 17f with a note, “See Block 13.” In
   Block 13, enter the office symbol and mailing address of the overseas cognizant security
   office.” In addition to the distribution indicated in Block 17, make distribution to the security
   offices listed in Block 13.
   4.4.3. Procuring Contracting Officers (PCOs), their designated representatives, including

4.5. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).
   4.5.1. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations that
   will require access to classified information. At the IC’s discretion, the VGSA execution
   requirement may be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to
   sensitive unclassified information, sensitive resources or frequent "entry" to the installation.
   4.5.1. (AFMC) Execute VGSAs with contractor groups visiting 90 days or more
   consecutively. Consider executing VGSAs with contractors visiting periodically for periods
   of less than 90 days if they require supplemental security using alarms, security guards, or
   other means.
   4.5.2. The installation ISPM, security disciplines and functional OPRs work in concert with
   the AF program, project and/or activity to develop the Visitor Group Security Agreement
   (VGSA) requirements. The requirement to execute a VGSA is in addition to preparing the
   DD Form 254.
   4.5.3. The VGSA must address those security requirements and/or procedures that are
   unique to the installation for which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs
26                                       AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_AEDCSUP_I 5 MAY 2011


  need only address those areas of security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been
  covered elsewhere within the contract, DD Form 254, SOW, SOO, PWS, etc.
  4.5.4. The ISPM is the technical OPR for development and preparation of the VGSA. For
  coordination purposes, the ISPM routes the VGSA to all installation security discipline
  OPRs and/or other agencies lending expertise to the contractual security requirements.
  4.5.5. The ISPM signs the VGSA on behalf of the installation commander. The ISPM
  forwards a copy of the executed/signed VGSA to the contracting officer who awarded the
  contract or to the contracting officer’s designated representative, when appropriate.
  4.5.5. (AFMC) CIPs may not delegate authority to sign VGSAs. Host activity commanders
  and program managers or their designees sign VGSAs in addition to CIPs.
  4.5.5. (AEDC) The VGSA for Integrated Air Force Visitor Groups is signed by the
  applicable Air Force Program Manager, Visitor Group Representative, ISPM, as the
  Commander’s designated representative, and the Contracting Officer responsible for the
  contract. A copy of the signed VGSA is forwarded to all the above. VGSAs are reviewed
  every two years for currency by the responsible CUIP PM and/or Security Manager and the
  on-site visitor group security representative. The CUIP PM and/or Security Manager
  annotates the results of this bi-annual review on the VGSA Review Log. Significant changes
  in security requirements required of the Visitor Group will require revision of the entire
  document and be staffed for review, signatures, and dates on the last page of the VGSA. The
  On-Base Cleared Facility Security Officer (FSO) will ensure bi-annual reviews are
  accomplished for NISPOM Visitor Group VGSAs. Pen and ink changes made to the VGSA
  are acceptable between bi-annual reviews and do not constitute a re-write or re-signing by
  signatories on the last page of the document provided there’s been no significant impact or
  change in scope of security requirements originally required of the visitor group in the initial
  VGSA.
  4.5.6. An authorized company official shall sign the VGSA. The CO will file a copy of the
  authorization with the contract.
  4.5.6. (AFMC) An authorized representative of the sponsoring cleared facility's
  management staff (e.g., the facility security officer) signs VGSAs.

5.1. Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. The IC works in concert with the Air Force
activity, CO and ISPM to determine the designation of an on-base visitor group (cleared facility,
integrated visitor group or intermittent visitor).
5.1. (AEDC)The Commander has delegated authority to the ISPM to determine contractor
group designations of contractor operations that require access to classified information as
cleared facilities, integrated visitor groups, NISPOM visitor groups, or intermittent
visitors.
   5.1.1. (Added-AEDC) AEDC’s operating contractor performs a classified effort at
   AEDC/OL-000A and has been designated as an Integrated Air Force Visitor Group under the
   management and direction of the On-Site Director. Industrial Security Review of the Visitor
   Group at AEDC/OL-000A is conducted jointly with the AEDC/OL-000A security manager
   during the annual Information Security Program Review performed by AEDC/TSD-IP.
   5.1.2. (Added-AEDC) Through an interdepartmental agreement with AEDC’s operating
   contractor, subcontractors, as designated in official contractual agreements, support testing at
   AEDC/OL-000-B and is designated as an Air Force Integrated Visitor Group under the
   management, direction, and oversight of the AEDC/NFAC Site Director. National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration Protective Services is the host police and industrial
   security office on Moffett Field and will, in coordination with AEDC/TSD-IP, provide
   technical security assistance to the On-Site Director in support of tests performed in the 40’x
   80’ and 80’x 120’ wind tunnels. Joint security reviews of the Information and Industrial
   Security Programs at AEDC/OL-000-B by AEDC/TSD-IP and ATA/FSO will include the
   ATA Visitor Group on-site.
5.2. Integrated Visitor Group.
   5.2.1. Integrated visitor groups operate in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental
   guidance thereto. They handle, generate, process, and store classified information per AF
   guidance. The exception being, their “access” is limited to “need-to-know” contract-specific
   classified performance information.
   5.2.2. The AF must stipulate the specific DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guidance, which
   is applicable under the terms of the executed VGSA.
   5.2.3. The guidance conveyed to on-base contractor operation via the VGSA is limited to the
   AF installation and the AF solicitation/contract which it was executed to support. All other
   NISPOM mandated security requirements not addressed or specifically exempted by the
   executed VGSA or other contracting document must be implemented by the contractor.
   5.2.4. The VGSA must clearly reflect that the Air Force is accountable for and controls all
   classified information. Integrated contractor visitor groups are prohibited from establishing
   separate classified information controls. (NOTE: Integrated visitor group personnel can not
   be appointed as primary or alternate security managers for AF activities. However, they can
   be required (via the VGSA) to provide other security program support, under AF direction,
   such as, conducting end-of-day security checks, security training/briefings, etc.).

            OVERSIGHT REVIEWS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Conducting Industrial Security Reviews (SRs).
   6.1.1. Industrial Security Reviews. The ISPM conduct security reviews (SRs) of on-base
   cleared facilities that performs classified work on Air Force installations. Such SRs evaluate
   the contractor’s compliance with contract specific-security requirements and pertinent DOD
   and Air Force security instructions.
   6.1.1. (AFMC) ICs have security cognizance and CIPs provide security oversight and
   support to two Federally Funded Research and Development Centers that operate as cleared
   facilities. The Electronic Supply Center (ESC) IC has cognizance over Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, and The MITRE
   Corporation, Bedford, MA.
   6.1.2. Scheduling Industrial Security Reviews. Conduct (SRs) of on-base cleared facilities
   per DOD 5220.22-M and DOD 5220.22-R. Unless conducting an unannounced security
   review on a cleared facility, provide contractor activity’s management 30 days advanced
   written notification.
   6.1.2. (AFMC) CIPs conduct security reviews of cleared facilities, for which they maintain
   security oversight, at least annually.
   6.1.3. Performing Industrial Security Reviews. ISPMs coordinate with other Air Force
   security discipline OPRs such as; Operations Security (OPSEC), Computer Security
   (COMPUSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC), to provide specialized expertise
   when necessary to complete a security review. The SR is complete when all security
   requirements imposed under the terms of the contract have been evaluated.
      6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed SR
      report, with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to
      document the results of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the
      automated DSS format.
      6.1.3.2. Facility security clearance (FCL) files must contain all key documentation
      prescribed by DOD 5220.22-R and the CSO, to include DD Form 254 and related
      contract security requirement documents.
   6.1.4. Post-Industrial Security Review Requirements.
      6.1.4.1. Send a letter/report to senior management officials of the cleared facility within
      10 days of completing the security review. The letter should:
      6.1.4.2. Confirm the contractor's security status as discussed during the exit interview.
      6.1.4.3. List any deficiencies requiring corrective action.
      6.1.4.4. Within 30 days, request written confirmation on the status of any open major
      discrepancy (condition which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the
      loss or compromise of classified information).
 30                                       AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_AEDCSUP_I 5 MAY 2011


      6.1.4.5. The ISPM may extend the time for corrective action if required changes are
      significant and the contractor is making a conscientious effort to resolve problems
      expeditiously.
   6.1.5. Unsatisfactory Industrial Security Reviews.
      6.1.5.1. The ISPM assigns an on-base cleared facility an unsatisfactory SR rating:
          6.1.5.1.1. To a cleared facility visitor groups if it fails to satisfactorily perform its
          contractual security responsibilities.
          6.1.5.1.2. When major failures in the contractor's security program have resulted in
          or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified
          information.
          6.1.5.1.3. When the contractor is clearly responsible for the security problems cited
          during a security review.
          6.1.5.1.4. The ISPM coordinates with the CSO and contracting officer when
          assigning an unsatisfactory SR rating for an on-base cleared facility.
          6.1.5.1.5. The home office facility (HOF) for the cleared facility is ultimately
          responsible for meeting contract security requirements. When assigning an
          unsatisfactory SR rating, the ISPM notifies the HOF immediately through the
          contracting office and requests prompt and complete corrective action. If the HOF
          fails to take corrective action, its security clearance may be affected. The servicing
          security activity should notify the HOF’s CSO if problems continue.
   6.1.6. Invalidating the Facility Security Clearance (FCL).
      6.1.6.1. The CSO notifies the contracting officers in writing when the FCL of a
      contractor under their jurisdiction is invalidated.
      6.1.6.2. A contractor who fails to correct security deficiencies that subsequently results
      in invalidation may lose its FCL.
      6.1.6.3. Although most contractors resolve invalidations promptly, contractors with
      foreign owned, controlled, or influence (FOCI) invalidations may have to wait for many
      months. Where FOCI is evident, the facility clearance may remain invalidated for more
      than a year while methods to resolve the FOCI are considered, approved, and
      implemented. The FCL is invalidated while DSS negotiates voting trusts, proxy
      agreements, or special agreements with foreign interests.
      6.1.6.4. Document SR for an on-base cleared facility as required by the DOD 5220.22-
      M, DOD 5220.22-R, and CSO guidance. Keep copies of completed SR reports with pre-
      security review letter and completed post-review correspondence for 2 years from the
      date of the most recent SR.
      6.1.6.5. Maintain copies of self-inspection reports or reviews for 2 years from date of the
      most recent self-inspection.
6.2. Conducting Information Security Program Reviews.
   6.2.1. Information Security Program Reviews. On-base integrated visitor groups will be
   evaluated and conduct self-inspections collectively with the AF activity per DOD 5200.1-R

                                  VISITS AND MEETINGS

7.1. Installation Visitors. The installation commander is the sole authority responsible for
granting contractors access to the installation, regardless of which DOD agency, military service
component, or activity awarded the contract.
7.2. Visitor Groups. The IC designates contractors who require access to the installation in the
performance of a government contract as intermittent visitors, integrated visitor groups, or
cleared facilities.
7.2. (AFMC)Visitor Groups. The IC delegates authority to the CIP to determine contractor
group designations (intermittent visitor, integrated visitor group, NISPOM visitor group, or
cleared facility). Contractor activities may be designated NISPOM visitor groups IAW AFPD
31-6, paragraph 7, only when it is required by the mission, operational requirements,
autonomous nature of a visitor group's operation or other factors.
7.2. (AEDC)Sub-contractors performing classified efforts on AAFB under the oversight
and direction of the On-Base Cleared Facility Security Officer are designated as NISPOM
Visitor Groups per AFPD 31-6, Para 7, due to their unique mission and operational
requirements. The FSO endorses Block 16, Certification and Signature, on DD 254 Form
certifying security requirements stated therein are complete and adequate for safeguarding
classified information released or generated under the classified effort.
7.3. Contractor Visits to Air Force Installations.
   7.3.1. DOD contractors located on or visiting Air Force installations in support of a
   classified contract must comply with DOD 5220.22-M, Chapter 6, Section 1, visit
   requirements.

       will ensure contractor personnel in-process for purposes of clearance verification,
       validation and records processing prior to performing the terms of their contract. Failure
       to process through the Sponsoring Activity, Trusted Agent and Security Manager could
       result in delays and potential denial of access to classified, Restricted, Controlled Areas
       or issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC).
       7.3.1.2. (Added-AEDC) Additionally, the CUIP PM and/or Security Manager will out-
       process contractors through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) when a
       contractor resigns or employment is terminated. Servicing activity trusted agents will
       ensure appropriate entries are made in the Contract Verification System database and that
       any issued CAC are returned to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) Customer Service and
       Identification Card Section. The sponsoring activity will ensure the contractor is out-
       processed and all appropriate records are updated.

                                   SUBCONTRACTING

8.1. Prime Contractor’s Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. Prime contractors are responsible for ensuring their on-base subcontractors are
   knowledgeable of and comply with the applicable security requirements (NISPOM,
   installation, etc.) as identified in contracts and/or other contracting documents.
   8.1.2. Prime contractors supporting classified efforts must include a provision in each on-
   base subcontract that requires subcontractors to contact the installation commander or
   designee and execute a VGSA prior to beginning on-base operations.
8.2. Subcontractor Responsibilities. On-base subcontractors must execute a separate and/or
independent VGSA with the installation. (NOTE: As an alternative, when multiple
subcontractor perform services in support of the same on-base classified contract and prime
contractor, the execution of this VGSA, can be satisfied by the subcontractor acknowledging
review and understanding of the security requirements identified in the prime contractor’s
executed VGSA. This being the case, executing and adding a signatory page only (attachment)
to the prime’s VGSA is acceptable).
8.2. (AEDC)NISPOM Visitor Groups, in support of a classified effort on AAFB for 90
consecutive days or more, are serviced by the On-Base Cleared Facility Security Officer
and adhere to security provisions set forth in the NISPOM, Security Policies and
Procedures (SPP) and VGSA.

with Air Force AIS policies and procedures. The OPR for these policies and procedures is
AEDC/TSDI. The appropriate Designated Approval Authority must accredit all AIS (classified
or unclassified) used by contractors on AAFB and AEDC/OL-000-A and AEDC/OL-000-B
GSUs, prior to use. AEDC/TSDI retains overall oversight responsibility for contractor use of
AIS on AAFB, AEDC/OL-000-A and AEDC/OL-000-B GSUs, as well as oversight
responsibility for COMSEC and EMSEC requirements and approvals. Contractor security
representatives will report all potential security incidents involving classified AIS to the ISPM
and AEDC/TSDI within one duty day.
   9.1.1. When industrial security program oversight is retained by the Air Force for on-base
   cleared facilities, the CO coordinates information technology (IT)/ automated information

VGSA—Visitor Group Security Agreement

Terms
Classified Contract—Any contract that requires or will require access to classified information
by the contractor or the employees in the performance of the contract. A contract may be
classified even though the contract document itself is not classified.
Cleared Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial,
or other facility for which DOD has made an administrative determination (from a security
viewpoint) that the entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a certain
category (Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret).
Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DOD) agency responsible
for industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has
designated the Defense Security Service (DSS) to perform this function. The Director of DSS
has further delegated this responsibility downward within the agency. DSS Regional Directors
provide industrial security administration for DOD contractor facilities located within their
respective geographical area. One exception, for which ISPM has responsible, is DOD
contractors on Air Force installation who have been designated as “visitor groups.” When used,
the language “Cognizant Security Office” (CSO), always refers to DSS or an entity thereof.
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)—This AF entity implements and administers
the installation’s information, personnel and industrial security programs. The ISPM is
responsible for supervising and overseeing on-base contractor’s security programs and/or
operations.
Installation—An installation is an area in which the Air Force holds a real property interest or
real property over which the Air Force has jurdisdiction by agreement with a foreign government
or by right of occupation. The term installation also includes all auxiliary off-base or detached
installations under the jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation.
Integrated Visitor Groups—An on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that
requires access to classified information and operates under the direct control/supervision of the
Air Force. The integrated visitor group is authorized to function in accordance with DOD
5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 per the VGSA. The Air Force maintains control of all classified and
provides day-to-day supervision over this type of contractor operation. It basically differs from
the on-base cleared facility because of its close interaction and/or relationship with the AF
organization it supports.
Interim Facility Security Clearances (Interim FCL)—Interim FCL are temporary, limited
company security clearances established by the DSS. It does not permit access to Restricted
Data, COMSEC, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), SCI, SAP, or Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency classified Information. However, if an interim Top Secret FCL is issued,
the contractor may access such information at the level of Secret and Confidential. Interim FCLs
may not be appropriate for all contractual needs and are not available for all sponsored
companies.
Intermittent Visitor—A contractor or company, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that require
“entry” to an Air Force installation for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on call basis to
 44                                         AFI31-601_AFMCSUP_AEDCSUP_I 5 MAY 2011


perform contractual duties. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does not
exceed 90 consecutive days.
Invalidation—A condition at a cleared facility caused by changed conditions or performance
under which the facility may no longer be eligible for an FCL unless the facility promptly
initiates appropriate corrective actions.
Major Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be, expected to result
in the loss or compromise of classified information.
NISPOM Visitor Group—An on-base contractor operation that does not meet the requirements
of a cleared facility or integrated visitor group. A NISPOM visitor group operates in accordance
with the NISPOM and installation security program requirements. They handle, generate,
process, and store classified information separately IAW their contracts and guidance provided
in the VGSA. The visitor group has access to a security container or containers under the visitor
group's control. Their access is limited to need-to-know contract-specific classified information.
The CIP conducts industrial security reviews in accordance with the NISPOM
On—Base Cleared Facility—An on-base contractor operation cleared under the provisions of
the NISP and established at the discretion of the IC per DOD 5220.22-R. These entities operate
under NISPOM guidance and the ISPM has been designated by the IC to provide security
oversight.
Reciprocity—A reciprocal condition, relationship, mutual or cooperative agreement, between
two or more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept the efforts
(requirements, procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same compensation.
Visitor Group—Any on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires
access to classified information. The installation commander determines their “official” on-base
designation. (NOTE: All on-base contractor operations are considered “visitor groups,” per this
AFI. The IC assesses and evaluates the working relationship and interactions between the visitor
group and AF activity to determining their “official” designation, i.e., cleared facility, integrated
visitor group or intermittent visitor).
Visitor Group Security Agreement—A documented and legally binding contractual agreement
between an Air Force activity and a DOD contractor whereby the contractor commits to
complying with, rendering or performing specific security tasks or functions for compensation.
The VGSA attest to and certifies the existence of such an agreement, including applicable
changes and amendments, attachments, supplements and exhibits.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access
to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the
DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information
systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the
requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in
this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security
and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The
term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified
contract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R,
Information Security Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC
is at the last attachment.

Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD 5220.22-R.
To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships through
command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each request
must include these items:
2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
participating in the NISP.
2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to HQ
USAF/XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to SAF/AAZ for
review and endorsement.
2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Counterintelligence and Security (OSD-USD/I), 5000 Defense Pentagon,
Washington, D.C. 20301-3040, for final approval.
2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also
terminates contractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor
employee is terminated. Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse implications
regarding the employee or the contractor.
2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then includes the
endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for transmission to DSS for
action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.
4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
terms of the solicitation/contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements listed
in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security guidance
is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the requesting AF
entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards an original DD
Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security

disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD Form 254.
This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13 (office symbol,
date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and maintain a copy
of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When SAPs are involved,
coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible for SAP security
oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs unclassified, whenever
possible.
4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only
annotates Block 13 of the draft DD Form 254. Other security requirements are incorporated
into the SOW, SOO, PWS, VGSA, etc.
4.3.2. The AF program, project or activity reviews the DD Form 254 and applicable security
classification/declassification guidance at least once every five years or as required, to ensure
accuracy and currency. When changes are necessary, the contract will be modified, if
appropriate and revised guidance issued.
5.3. Cleared Facility. An on-base cleared facility operates under the security mandates and
requirements of the NISPOM. See AFPD 31-6 for further guidance regarding their
establishment.
6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed SR report,
with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to document the
results of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the automated DSS format.

7.3.2. ( DELETED)
7.3.3. (DELETED)
7.4. Air Force Visits to Contractor Facilities. Air Force personnel who require access to
classified information while visiting non-DOD contractor facilities must comply with the visit
request submission requirements of DOD 5200.1-R, DOD 5220.22-M, AFI 31-401 and/or the
contractor location to be visited.

9.1. Information Technology and Automated Information System Accreditation.
9.1.1. When industrial security program oversight is retained by the Air Force for on-base
cleared facilities, the CO coordinates information technology (IT)/ automated information
system (AIS) accreditation, Communications Security (COMSEC), and Emission Security
(EMSEC) requirements with the responsible installation security discipline OPR, the ISPM and
DSS, if appropriate.
9.1.2. Integrated visitor groups use approved Air Force IT/AIS and/or networks to process
classified and sensitive unclassified information.
9.1.3. Contractor employees who require access to government IT/AIS under the terms of a
government contract must be determined to be trustworthy by a designated government official

prior to IT/AIS access being granted. Process all contractors IT/AIS access security
background investigations in accordance with DOD 5200.2-R and AFI 31-501. This
requirement must be specified in the basic solicitation and/or contract documents.
9.1.4. Contracts or solicitations (classified and unclassified) involving the use, operation,
maintenance, etc., of IT/AIS will be routed through the installation Communications and
Information (SC) activity for review and coordination.
12.1. Integrated visitor groups use existing Air Force security program related plans (Operations
Security, Program Protection, Information Technology, etc.), procedures, operating
instructions (OIs), and educational/training materials that meet the intent of and satisfy
NISPOM requirements. Coordinate with other security discipline OPRs, when applicable, and
incorporate authority for their usage in the VGSA or other appropriate contracting documents.
