This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 16-1, International Affairs, and
supports the authorities derived from Titles 10 and 22 United States Code (U.S.C.); Department
of Defense (DoD) Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition System; DoD Instruction
(DoDI) 2010.06, Materiel Interoperability and Standardization with Allies and Coalition
Partners; DoDI 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System; and DoDD 5530.3,
International Agreements. This instruction supports the Air Force as it seeks to achieve the goals
and objectives of the National Security Strategy (NSS), the National Defense Strategy (NDS),
the DoD Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF), and the Air Force Global Partnership
Strategy. It applies to all United States Air Force (USAF) personnel, including Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) Units and the Air National Guard (ANG), who prepare, manage,
review, or participate in International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) activities. It covers the
guidance, policies, and responsibilities that govern the management of IAC programs throughout
the USAF. As used herein, IAC refers to the broad range of international activities in which
DoD and a foreign government(s) jointly manage efforts to satisfy common military
requirements through cooperation in research, development, test, evaluation, acquisition,
production and support of air, space, and cyberspace technology and systems. This instruction
does not cover joint military arrangements or operations with allied nations that are under the
purview of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), nor does it
address Security Assistance programs, including Foreign Military Sales. Refer to Air Force
Manual (AFMAN) 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management, for a

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication revises AFI 16-110, 4 November 2003, by shortening the AFI to a summary
overview policy document and adding the publication of an AFMAN to detail the guidance and
procedures for IAC programs. This publication describes IAC and its implementing programs,
and specific roles and responsibilities for IAC in Chapter 2. The previous AFI 16-110 delineated
responsibilities under each chapter, making it difficult for responsible offices to have a full
picture of IAC impact on their workload. This revision also adds information on technologies
that require additional reviews by DoD offices before the USAF enters into any international
agreement. Since this AFI is completely reformatted, it must be reviewed in total, as well as its
newly published companion document, AFMAN 16-114, Procedures for U.S. Air Force
Participation in International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) Programs.

                                            Chapter 1

         INTERNATIONAL ARMAMENTS COOPERATION (IAC) PROGRAMS

1.1. Program Description. IAC refers to the broad range of international activities in which the
DoD and a foreign government(s) jointly manage efforts to satisfy common military
requirements through cooperation in research, development, test, evaluation, acquisition,
production and support of air, space, and cyberspace technology and systems. These activities
include:
     1.1.1. Research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) of defense technologies,
     systems, subsystems, and equipment.
     1.1.2. Cooperative production (including follow-on support) of defense articles and
     equipment.
     1.1.3. Data, information, and personnel exchanges conducted under approved programs.
     1.1.4. U.S. Government procurement of foreign defense articles (including software),
     technology (including manufacturing rights), or services (including logistic support).
     1.1.5. Test and evaluation (T&E) of conventional defense equipment, munitions, and
     technology.
1.2. Purpose and Objectives. The Air Force will participate in air, space, and cyberspace IAC
programs as it seeks to achieve the goals and objectives of the National Security Strategy (NSS),
the National Defense Strategy (NDS), the DoD Guidance for Employment of the Force (GEF),
and the Air Force Global Partnership Strategy. All USAF components should promote
participation in IAC programs with partner countries in support of the following objectives:
     1.2.1. Building partnerships and partnership capacity of a mutually beneficial nature.
        1.2.1.1. Establishing new, and sustaining and expanding existing, relationships to
        promote interoperability, integration, and interdependence, as appropriate.
        1.2.1.2. Providing international partners the capability and capacity necessary to provide
        for their own national security.
     1.2.2. Deploying and supporting common, or at least interoperable, equipment.
     1.2.3. Achieving savings through cost sharing and economies of scale afforded by
     cooperative RDT&E programs.
     1.2.4. Securing the best technologies, military or civilian, available for equipping the U.S.
     and its partners.
     1.2.5. Supplying the best available defense material to the U.S. and its partners in the
     timeliest and most cost effective manner.
1.3. Armaments Cooperation Policy, Legal Requirements, Financial Requirements, and
Disclosure Requirements.
     1.3.1. International Armaments Acquisition Policy. The Department of Defense
     acquisition policy is contained in DoDD 5000.01 and DoDI 5000.02 and implemented within
AFI16-110 13 MAY 2013                                                                         5


  the Air Force through AFPD 63-1, Integrated Life-Cycle Management, and AFI 63-101,
  Integrated Life-Cycle Management. They provide the management framework for
  translating mission needs and technology opportunities into acquisition programs supporting
  Air Force requirements. Within the acquisition process, the Air Force considers international
  sources in the following order when selecting materiel solutions to validated requirements:
     1.3.1.1. Procurement or modification of commercially available products, services, and
     technologies, from domestic or international sources;
     1.3.1.2. Additional production or modification of previously developed U.S. and/or
     allied military systems or equipment; and
     1.3.1.3. Cooperative development program with one or more allied nation.
  1.3.2. Interoperability Policy. Interoperability with allies and coalition partners is a
  valuable way to ensure our allies participate with the United States in future military
  operations. The DoD policy is contained in DoDI 2010.06, Materiel Interoperability and
  Standardization with Allies and Coalition Partners. Within the Air Force, materiel
  interoperability and standardization with allies and coalition partners are considered as part
  of the basic conceptual approach in the development, production, and product improvement
  of all systems and equipment intended for use in coalition operations. All applicable U.S.
  ratified materiel international standardization agreements are complied with to the greatest
  extent feasible.
  1.3.3. Processing Policy. DoDD 5530.3 and AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
  Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, provide procedures and authorities for
  processing international agreements (IAs). They establish approval procedures for
  negotiating and concluding agreements with foreign governments and international
  organizations. For all Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology
  & Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) related IAs, proponents may use the streamlined procedures
  cited in DoDI 5000.02 and described in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, Chapter 11.2,
  and the IC in AT&L Handbook published by the Director, OUSD(AT&L)/International
  Cooperation (IC) for review and approval rather than the procedures described in DoDD
  5530.3. USAF proponents for IAC should consult with SAF/IAPQ as early as possible to
  develop action plans for any international cooperative effort.
  1.3.4. Legal Requirements. The acquisition and procurement of DoD air, space, and
  cyberspace systems shall be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. Congress
  has enacted a number of laws authorizing the DoD to enter into agreements with foreign
  nations for the purpose of enhancing mutual defense. The primary legal authorities that
  allow IAC activity are Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350a, Title 10 U.S.C. § 2358, Title 22 U.S.C. §
  2767 (Section 27 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA)), and Title 22 U.S.C. § 2796d
  (Section 65 of the AECA). There are other authorities that may apply depending on
  circumstances. SAF/IAPQ should be consulted prior to developing a cooperative program.
  1.3.5. Financial Requirements. DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation
  (DoD FMR), Volume 12, Chapter 9, International Agreements, contains detailed financial
  procedures that DoD Components must follow in initiating, developing, and requesting
  formal review of IAs and any annexes, appendices, amendments, or modifications. IAC
  programs must comply with the DoD FMR in areas such as the proper sources of funding,
 6                                                                    AFI16-110 13 MAY 2013


     equitability determinations, and valuation of contributions, particularly non-financial
     contributions.
     1.3.6. Disclosure Requirements. The disclosure and release of classified military
     information or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in support of IAC programs will
     be consistent with The National Policy and Procedures for the Disclosure of Classified
     Military Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations (NDP-1).
     The DoD implementing directive is DoDD 5230.11, Disclosure of Classified Military
     Information to Foreign Governments and International Organizations. AFI 16-201, Air
     Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program, implement national disclosure
     policy (NDP) in the Air Force. USAF proponents for IAC programs must obtain foreign
     disclosure approval documentation for the release of classified information and CUI from the
     appropriate USAF Foreign Disclosure Office (FDO).
1.4. Guidelines. The USAF will engage in IAC activities when evaluation indicates that it will
benefit the USAF without causing undue risk to U.S. security. Major factors in this evaluation
include:
     1.4.1. A strong opportunity the IAC activity will build international relationships and
     capacity, and enhance coalition interoperability;
     1.4.2. A commitment by the operational, technical, and financial communities of the USAF
     and the prospective foreign partner(s) to the project and to international cooperation; and
     1.4.3. Harmonized requirements, in both performance specification and the project schedule,
     among all potential participants.
1.5. IAC Scope. IAC programs available for USAF use include, but are not limited to, those
listed in paragraphs 1.5.1. through 1.5.7. below. AFMAN 16-114 contains detailed information
about these programs and provides templates for complying with programmatic requirements.
     1.5.1. International Cooperation (IC) in Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics
     (AT&L) Program. IC in AT&L pertains to any international agreement concluded with one
     or more foreign governments or with an international organization. These activities range
     from small science and technology (S&T) efforts to multi-million dollar, multinational
     projects or programs. Regardless of size, these activities are characterized by the fact that
     they are based on mutual and equitable sharing of effort, cost, and risk, either in RDT&E,
     cooperative production, and/or logistics of a defense article; and share the resulting
     information, equipment, or other benefits equitably. The parties commit to these
     arrangements in a formal IA such as a memorandum of understanding (MOU), a
     memorandum of agreement (MOA), a technical or project arrangement (PA), a loan, or other
     similar type of mechanism. IAs can be concluded (signed) with one or more foreign
     governments or with an international governmental organization. All official IAs require a
     written final report upon completion to enable the USAF to capitalize on lessons learned
     from IAC projects.
     1.5.2. Information Exchange Program. Under this program annexes to master agreements
     are developed for the exchange of RDT&E information on a reciprocal, balanced basis such
     that the RDT&E information exchanged between parties will be of approximately equivalent
     value, qualitatively and quantitatively. These annexes deal with specific technologies in a
AFI16-110 13 MAY 2013                                                                       7


  generic, non-system specific manner and involve the exchange of reports, technical
  documents, and related information.
  1.5.3. International Testing Programs.
     1.5.3.1. Test and Evaluation (T&E) Program. This is a DoD-managed program,
     authorized under Title 10 U.S.C. § 2350l and carried out under a series of bilateral IAs
     that enables the USAF and a partner nation or international governmental organization
     access to the test facilities of one another. It also allows for cooperative T&E-related
     projects under master agreements.
     1.5.3.2. Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program. The FCT Program tests and
     evaluates foreign Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that demonstrate potential to satisfy
     U.S. military requirements. The Comparative Technology Office (CTO) reports to the
     Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Rapid Fielding (ASD(RFD)) through the
     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)) under the
     Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics
     (OUSD(AT&L)). CTO plans, programs, and budgets for FCT Program funding and
     selects candidate projects endorsed by HQ USAF.
  1.5.4. Personnel Exchange Programs.
     1.5.4.1. The Engineer and Scientist Exchange Program (ESEP) enables the exchange of
     military or civilian engineers and scientists in RDT&E positions.
     1.5.4.2. The Administrative and Professional Exchange Program (APEP) enables the
     exchange of military or civilian specialist personnel in administrative, finance, health,
     legal, logistics, planning, and other support functions.
  1.5.5. International Cooperative Research and Development (ICR&D) Program. The
  ICR&D Program seeks to enhance conventional defense capabilities of the U.S. and its allies
  through cooperative projects. The program provides “seed money” to capitalize on
  international cooperative opportunities until USAF program funding is available through the
  normal budget process. SAF/IAPQ plans, programs, and budgets the USAF ICR&D
  Program.
  1.5.6. Coalition Warfare Program (CWP). The CWP promotes interoperability in support
  of coalition warfare by early identification of operational issues that can be overcome with
  innovative solutions in areas such as architectures, requirements, and systems acquisitions.
  OUSD(AT&L)/IC plans, programs, and budgets for CWP funding and selects candidate
  projects endorsed by HQ USAF.
  1.5.7. Other Potential IAC Tools Available to the USAF.
     1.5.7.1. International Other Transactions (OTs). DoD has authority to enter into
     transactions other than contracts, grants or cooperative agreements to award “other
     transactions” (OTs) in certain circumstances for prototype and research projects with
     foreign non-government entities.
     1.5.7.2. Non-domestic Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs).
     Non-domestic CRADAs enable the USAF to enter into cooperative agreements with
     foreign non-government entities.
8                                                              AFI16-110 13 MAY 2013


    1.5.7.3. IAC Forums. The USAF participates in many international forums and activities
    that promote IAC.         A number of organizations lead them, to include the
    OUSD(AT&L)/IC, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Headquarters U.S.
    Air Force (HQ USAF), and Major Commands (MAJCOMs). These forums and activities
    normally review existing programs, provide executive-level oversight, and highlight
    opportunities that may result in future collaboration.
