                               Chapter 1
                          GENERAL INFORMATION
                                    Overview


Introduction      This handbook serves as a guide for applying the Instructional
                  System Development (ISD) process in defense systems
                  acquisition. It follows the principles of AFPD 36-22, AFMAN
                  36-2234, and other policy documents. It is intended as an easy
                  reading guide for the novice to ISD, as well as the veteran.
                  While it is designed as a "stand-alone" document, you must also
                  be familiar with the referenced policy documents.


Background        In the past, application of ISD to defense system acquisition has
                  not necessarily been an orderly or well-thought-out process.
                  Sometimes training was considered at concept exploration while
                  in extreme cases it may not have occurred until after the system
                  was fielded. As a result of these variances, the quality and depth
                  of training coverage varied widely from program to program.


Purpose           The purpose of this handbook is to incorporate the applicable
                  regulations and manuals into a handbook that covers the major
                  phases of the ISD process and addresses them to the various
                  phases of defense system acquisition. The ISD process has
                  application in all acquisition phases, but the major effort occurs
                  between the demonstration and validation phase, and the
                  production and deployment phase (Figure 1). The acquisition
                  cycle can last ten years or more, requiring frequent coordination
                  and evaluation, revisiting prior effort and redirecting as required.

                                                                 Continued on next page

What is ISD?      Instructional System Development is a deliberate and orderly,
                  but flexible process used for planning, developing, implementing,
                  and managing instructional systems. It ensures that personnel
                  are taught in a cost-efficient way the knowledge, skills, and
                  attitudes essential for successful job performance. ISD helps to
                  validate that:

                     There is a training need.
                     There is an effective and efficient solution to the need.
                     The solution can be implemented.
                     The solution can be assessed to determine whether it meets
                     the need.
                     During the development and operation of an instructional
                     system, there is a total continuing requirement for technical
                     and management improvement.


Basis for ISD     ISD is based on:

                     Basic research on how people learn
                     Basic research on how people communicate
                     The systems engineering process
                     The development of media and computer technologies

Why use ISD?        Instruction must be planned if it is to be effective. ISD
                    requires that:

                       Job tasks and mission requirements are analyzed.
                       The target population to perform the job is analyzed.
                       The difference between what the target population can do
                       now vs. what they must be able to do to perform the job is
                       identified as training requirements.
                       Training requirements are addressed by a hierarchy of
                       training objectives.
                       Training objectives are achieved through media and methods.
                       Media and methods are selected to optimize efficiency and
                       effectiveness of training.
                       Training courses are developed and validated to ensure that
                       training objectives are met.
                       There is a continuous feedback loop throughout for quality
                       improvement.


Goals of ISD        The goals of ISD are to produce students who can perform their
                    jobs after receiving instruction, and to reduce overall costs of
                    training by accurately identifying training requirements and
                    equipment.


How to use ISD      ISD is:

                       Flexible and systematic
                       A tool to develop the right training to solve the problem

                    ISD is NOT a step-by-step linear process.

                                  Don’t have a "checklist mentality"
                                       when you’re using ISD.

                    You need to think of ISD as being circular. You can start
                    anywhere at any time, as the need requires. During each phase
                    of the ISD process, you continually assess the quality of the
                    process and any product input. Evaluation is ongoing throughout
                    the life cycle of the training system. The updated Air Force ISD

What is a total    A total training system is a systematically developed curriculum
training system?   including, but not necessarily limited to, courseware, classroom
                   aids, training simulators and devices, operational equipment,
                   embedded training capability and personnel to operate, maintain
                   or employ a system. The training system includes all necessary
                   elements of logistic support. This is covered in more detail in
                   Chapter 2.


Quality            Quality improvement, with an emphasis on evaluation throughout
improvement        the life cycle of the program, is the glue that holds the total
                   system together. Figure 2 shows the updated ISD model with
                   quality improvement and system functions.


What are system    Successful training systems must have basic top-level functions,
functions?         and these functions must be in place before a training system
                   can operate. The basic training system functions are discussed
                   in the following paragraphs and are depicted in Figure 3.

                                                                Continued on next page

What are system         Management. This is the function of directing or controlling
functions?              all aspects of the training system. These activities are an
(Continued)             integral part of conducting training.

                        Support. This provides for and maintains the system on a
                        day-to-day and long-term basis. This includes long-range
                        planning as well as day-to-day activities. Examples are
                        resources you need to keep equipment functioning, such as
                        an equipment maintenance contract.

                        Administration. This is the part of management that
                        performs the day-to-day tasks of operating an instructional
                        system. This includes functions such as documentation,
                        student assignments, and student records.

                        Delivery. This is the means of giving students the training.
                        Instructors, computers, and textbooks are examples of ways
                        to deliver instruction.

                        Evaluation. This function is the continuous process of
                        gathering feedback data through formative, summative and
                        operational evaluations to assess the system and, most
                        important, student performance.

When do you        The system functions must be working before you start the
implement them?    training. Aspects of the training system functions are active
                   throughout all phases of ISD.


Relation to ISD    Using these essential functions to design the overall training
                   system architecture and then allocating them to the respective
                   system components, or people responsible, ensures that these
                   functions are operational when the total training system is
                   fielded. ISD products are integrated into the total training
                   system, and aspects of the system functions are active
                   throughout all phases of the ISD process.


System functions   Figure 4 shows the phases most often used in the systems
and ISD phases     approach, which are analysis, design, development, and
                   implementation, with the evaluation activities integrated into each
                   phase of the process. The phases are embedded within the
                   system functions. Evaluation is shown as the central feedback
                   "network" for the total system.

System functions      The instructional development process, which the model
and ISD phases        summarizes, calls for instructional developers to:
(Continued)
                         Analyze and determine what instruction is needed.
                         Design instruction to meet the need.
                         Develop instructional materials to support system
                         requirements.
                         Implement the instructional system.

                      Evaluation is a central function that takes place at every phase.
                      Symbolically, Figure 4 shows that all phases of the model
                      depend on each of the other phases. The ISD process allows
                      the instructional developer or design team to enter or reenter the
                      various phases of the process as determined by the nature and
                      scope of the development or revision activity. The phases of the
                      updated model are described in more detail in separate chapters
                      of this handbook.


Evaluation            Evaluation is a continuous process beginning during the analysis
                      phase and continuing throughout the life cycle of the instructional
                      system. Evaluation consists of:

                         Formative Evaluation, consisting of process and product
                         evaluations conducted during the analysis and design
                         phases, and validation, which is conducted during the
                         development phase. Included are individual and small-group
                         tryouts.
                         Summative Evaluation, consisting of operational tryouts
                         conducted once the entire training system is fielded.
                         Operational Evaluation, consisting of periodic internal and
                         external evaluation of the operational system during the
                         implementation phase.

                      Each form of evaluation should be used during development,
                      update, and revision of instruction, if possible, and if the form of
                      evaluation is applicable.

                 The updated model graphically illustrates that:

                    Evaluation is the foundation of the ISD process.
                    ISD is a continuous process with the flexibility to enter and
                    reenter the various phases, as necessary, to develop, update,
                    or revise instruction.
                    All ISD activities take place within and are dependent on the
                    system functions.
                    Teamwork is required between personnel performing system
                    functions and those designing, developing, and implementing
                    instructional systems.
                    All ISD activities and system functions focus on continuous
                    quality improvements in the system.


Quality          Although Quality Improvement (QI) is covered in detail on page
improvement      36, you should remember that QI is the continuous, organized
                 creation of beneficial change to the system. The objective of QI
                 is to foster continuous improvements in the process and products
                 of ISD.

                                     Overview


Introduction       Fielding a new defense system with a total training system is a
                   project that requires considerable management, coordination and
                   integration. Lessons learned in fielding total training systems
                   have shown that organizations responsible for integration of the
                   training system have been left scrambling. Why? Because
                   important and sometimes even critical functions were overlooked
                   early in the overall design. The shortfalls range from "common
                   sense" such as failing to analyze student production
                   requirements, to "technical" such as improper integration of out-
                   the-cockpit visual system design with the design of the simulator.

                   Analysis of successful programs concluded that there are basic
                   top-level functions required for operation of a total training
                   system.


Purpose            The purpose of this chapter is to explain the total training system
                   concept in the context of instructional system design. These
                   concepts apply whether you are buying a total system or parts of
                   a system, a new defense system or a modification.

What is a total       As mentioned earlier, a total training system is a systematically
training system?      developed curriculum. The training system includes all
                      necessary elements of logistic support. In order to acquire a
                      total training system, follow the instructional system development
                      process interacting with the systems engineering process.

                      developed.

                                Section A
                      Acquisition Concept Definition

Introduction       Acquisition is the obtaining of supplies or services, by and for the
                   use of the federal government, using appropriated funds. Before
                   acquiring these supplies and services, you must evaluate the
                   constraints and opportunities to make a sound decision. Once
                   the decision to acquire something (rather than obtaining it
                   through internal development) is made, an overall approach to
                   the acquisition should be developed.


Purpose            The acquisition concept serves as a starting point from which
                   other activities originate. The activities generated by a decision
                   to lease supplies or services can be very different from those
                   generated by a decision to purchase them. Other factors that
                   can change acquisition activities are sole sourcing, competitive
                   contracting, research and development, dual sourcing, and other
                   contracting methods.


Where to read      Prior to making a decision whether or not to obtain defense
about it           system training through acquisition, the process leading to the
                   decision has begun. Important aspects of this process are
                   described under the topics listed below.

                    Training System Requirements Studies Initiation


Introduction           To ensure proper planning and development, Training System
                       Requirements (TSR) must be considered early in the cycle of
                       defense system acquisition. For this reason, preliminary training
                       consideration should begin in the pre-concept phase of system
                       acquisition. At this time, the defense system using command will
                       form and chair the Training Planning Team (TPT). Once the
                       defense system is defined in the demonstration and validation
                       phase of acquisition, TSR studies are initiated. A Training
                       System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) is a systematic approach
                       to front-end analysis of a training system based upon an
                       integrated instructional systems development/systems
                       engineering process that develops data items to document the
                       training and preliminary system requirements.


Purpose                The purposes of the TSR studies are to:

                          Determine training need.
                          Outline the "big picture."
                          Define training requirements.
                          Define thoroughness of data and analysis.
                          Involve defense system contractor in training issues early on.


What are training      Training requirements are determined by comparing the skills
requirements?          and knowledge requirements needed to do a job, to the current
                       abilities of the persons expected to do the job. The difference
                       between those current attitudes, abilities, knowledge, and the
                       skills necessary to perform specific tasks in order to operate,
                       maintain, and support a defense system are the training
                       requirements.

Further          There are several areas to consider when deciding on the TSR
explanation      study approach. For example, is a TSR study really needed? If
                 so, to what depth? Should the TSR study be done by an
                 independent contractor or the training system development
                 contractor (phased approach)? Have alternative acquisition
                 strategies been identified to allow for consideration of innovative
                 solutions to the training need? The TSR study lays the
                 foundation for the ISD process. (Further information is available
                 as each document is explained in this handbook.)

                         Training Planning Team

Introduction   Coordination and communication are the keys to success in any
               program, and are most critical in the training business. The
               formation of a Training Planning Team (TPT) helps keep the
               many players working together to reach the training system
               objectives.


What it is     A Training Planning Team (TPT) is defined as an action group
               composed of representatives from all pertinent functional areas,
               disciplines, and interests involved in the life cycle of a specific
               defense training system. The TPT is formed at pre-concept and
               continues throughout the acquisition and day-to-day operation of
               the training system. The personnel on the TPT represent the
               using command, the system program office, and other concerned
               agencies. The TPT develops and uses the System Training Plan
               (STP) to ensure that training considerations, constraints and
               opportunities are adequately addressed in the defense system
               acquisition modification process.


Objectives     The primary objective of the training planning team is to get the
               right agencies communicating and coordinating from the very
               beginning as a team. Once a System Program Office (SPO) is
               formed, the TPT bridges between the SPO and the operating
               command. The goal is to develop the STP and keep it current
               throughout the life of the defense system.


Who is         The primary operating command will establish and chair TPTs
responsible?   throughout the life cycle of the defense system. The program
               office (normally AFMC) will support and assist the chair as
               required. The using command will also be responsible for
               developing a Manpower Estimate Report (MER) following
               acquisition guidelines.

               Note: The training wheels were put into motion prior to the
               formation of the SPO. Training was specified in the Program
               Management Directive (PMD), which is the primary document
               that directs the program office to begin a system acquisition.
               Using the PMD, the program office develops a Program

                      primary operating command are considered the prime players,
                      Air Education and Training Command (AETC) has a key role.
                      This is true even if the training system will be contractor
                      procured, developed and operated.

Other                 Acquiring training is a complex process involving many agencies
responsibilities      and personnel. As stated earlier, while the operating command
                      and the program office are the two major players, many other key
                      offices are involved. For example, AETC plays a key role that
                      varies depending on the nature of the training involved. AETC
                      normally will:

                         Be a member of and support the TPT.
                         Designate an AETC Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
                         for the specific program.
                         Assist in determining whether all or parts of training will be
                         AETC- or contractor-developed. (If AETC or USAF
                         developed maintenance training, read "Air Force-Developed
                         Maintenance Training" [page 145].)

                         Designate AETC supporting agencies and define roles.

                      Note: As mentioned earlier, the TPT continues throughout the
                      life of the defense system. While the TPT may not meet every
                      day, every week, or even every quarter, they will meet frequently
                      enough to evaluate changes in the defense system for their effect
                      on the training system. The TPT will update the STP annually or
                      when changes occur that affect training in:

                             Training System Concept


Introduction        The development of an overall training system concept is the
                    beginning of a system-training plan. This concept serves as the
                    starting point for all other planning. It provides the framework to
                    develop system requirements, resource requirements, etc.


Objective           The objective of the training system concept is to define the
                    training philosophy and policy within which the training system
                    will be designed and operated. The training system concept
                    includes the characteristics to be exhibited by the overall training
                    system.


Who is              The operating command, as part of the TPT, is responsible for
responsible?        developing the Training System Concept (TSC). They will be
                    assisted by:

                       Subject Matter Experts (SME)
                       Contractors
                       Instructional designers
                       System Program Office (SPO) representative
                       Air Education and Training Command (AETC) representative
                       Other managers and specialists as required


What is in a TSC?   The TSC is purposely broad, but it sets the boundaries within
                    which training system decisions can be made. It can contain
                    items such as:

                       Training system life cycle master plan
                       Training philosophy
                       Type and amount of training that may be needed
                       Estimated funding requirements
                       Estimated training and support equipment needs
                       Type and size of facilities needed
                       Estimated time to develop and deliver the system
                       Projected impacts on personnel
                       Training constraints

Where to begin   The best way to begin developing a TSC is to review
                 predecessor systems. Look for similarities and differences.
                 What were the lessons learned from those predecessors? Now
                 is the time to identify the expense and time drivers. Many other
                 considerations must be taken to develop the TSC, which leads to
                 process analysis decisions and helps in developing the system-
                 training plan.

                             System Training Plan


Introduction      The Training System Concept (TSC) starts the System Training
                  Plan (STP). The training planning team is tasked in AFP 50-11
                  with initiating the STP. The primary operating command is
                  tasked with overall responsibility for the effort.


Objective         The objective of the STP is to support acquisition and
                  modification processes, requirements, documents, and milestone
                  decisions. The STP also ensures that proper training is
                  identified as the mission changes, the defense system changes,
                  or the world situation changes. The STP is a living document.


Description       The STP is a life cycle, iterative planning document that defines
                  the following functions of a training system:

                     Design
                     Development
                     Funding
                     Resources
                     Support
                     Modification
                     Operation
                     Management

                  A STP format is available in AFP 50-11.


Subset plans      The STP is composed of subset plans for each functional area
                  required, such as:

                     Operations
                     Logistics
                     Support


IMPACTS           The STP is included in the IMPACTS Program Plan (IPP) as the
                  training input and submitted to AF/XO for Air Staff coordination.

IPP                 The STP is submitted as part of the IPP to SAF/AQ prior to each
                    milestone decision point, or as required, starting with Milestone 1
                    (see Figure 1).


What does the STP   The STP will normally:
do?
                       Establish training system definition through acquisition and
                       modification documentation, which will support the review and
                       decision process.
                       Identify training needs, concepts, strategies, constraints,
                       risks, data, alternatives, resources, responsibilities, and other
                       areas, through an iterative process.
                       Document the results of early, front-end, and follow-on
                       training task analyses.
                       Provide information and identify resources for management
                       decisions within the planning, programming, and budgeting
                       process which support defense/training system acquisition
                       and modification processes.
                       Provide the basic concepts and strategy to attain and
                       maintain training system concurrency to support desired
                       training capability at the appropriate time.
                       Identify alternate training strategies, to include methodology
                       and media, if funding, concurrency, or other unknowns
                       negatively impact required training system capabilities.
                       Establish milestones and schedules to ensure timely
                       development, testing, and fielding of training capability and
                       training support.


STP development     Various development levels are required to support milestone

                       Training Acquisition Strategy Analysis


Introduction         At this point, when the TPT is formed and the STP is being
                     written, a preliminary decision will be made on whether to
                     contract for all or parts of the training. Assuming the decision is
                     to have contractors develop at least a part of the training, the
                     command with program management responsibility will develop
                     an acquisition strategy. The acquisition strategy is finalized
                     before each contracted activity.


Things to consider   In developing an acquisition strategy, the following should be
                     considered by the SPO in coordination with the user:

                     Equipment:
                        Current federal acquisition regulations
                        Funding availability and constraints
                        Defense system schedules
                        Complexity of training system
                        Types of training being acquired (operator / maintenance /
                        other)
                        Sole vs. multiple sourcing
                        Lease vs. purchase

                     Personnel:
                        Trained personnel requirements
                           How many? and, When needed?
                        On-site training or schoolhouse?
                        One-time course vs. life cycle use
                        Total contractor training vs. turnkey (using command
                        operation)


Other                Getting the "big picture" is important in developing the
considerations       acquisition strategy. The total training system perspective is
                     needed to understand its full scope and how the integration will
                     take place in order to have a fully operational system. Though a
                     contracted activity may be treated as independent, the tie into
                     the "big picture" ensures a good fit. Always consider how the
                     training system fits into the overall defense system acquisition.
                     Choosing the wrong acquisition strategy not only affects the
                     training system, but can also cause delays in the defense system
                     testing, support, and initial operational capability.

                                  Analysis

What you do      During analysis, you should:

                    Collect information on job performance requirements of Air
                    Force missions/duties/jobs/tasks.
                    Determine the necessary qualifications of the job performers.


Why do it?       Analysis must be conducted to make sure you get the right kind
                 of training for the stated need.

When you do it   Do your ISD analysis when you need to get information that will
                 affect your design or when you need to assess trade-offs
                 between alternatives. Do ISD analysis:

                    Before beginning design development
                    When defense system changes require instructional system
                    changes
                    When a more efficient alternative applies
                    When a more effective approach is suggested
                    When new instructional technology is to be incorporated

What you get       If you have conducted the analysis correctly, you will get valid
                   task details that describe training requirements and identify
                   potential alternatives for training equipment.


What you need to   Systems process is an input-process-output activity.
do it              A variety of subject matter reference data documents determine
                   what type of analysis is needed by providing input.
                   These documents identify the sources from which data is
                   necessary:

                      Defense system data
                      Similar system data
                      Input from Subject Matter Experts (SME)
                      Specialty training standards (STS)
                      Technical Orders (TO)

                                  Design

What it is       Instructional design is similar to architectural design. You
                 determine what you want the training to look like and how you
                 want it to work. The analysis that you previously conducted will
                 help determine the basic structure; not only for the training
                 system, but also for the defense system it supports. A continuing
                 effort in the design phase is the assurance of quality in the
                 design process and products with an emphasis on
                 improvements, where possible.


Why do it?       Design is conducted to save money, increase the quality of the
                 product and get the training done on time. You don’t just go
                 out and start developing instruction, just as you don’t run right
                 out and start building a house without planning and designing it
                 first.

What it is?         Evaluation is the way to measure the effectiveness of the
                    training. Evaluation answers the questions:

                       Have the students mastered the objectives?
                       How well are the course graduates performing in the field?
                       How can the training be improved?
                       How well is the process working?


Why do it?          You conduct evaluation after implementation to gain feedback
                    internally and from the field throughout the life cycle of the
                    training to make sure graduates can still perform the job to
                    standards. Evaluation is conducted throughout the acquisition to
                    provide feedback about the quality of the ISD process and the
                    resulting products.

                               Quality Improvement

Introduction          ISD is a continuous, systematic process with continuous
                      evaluation. The ISD process is the Air Force tool to ensure that
                      quality systems are built to the customer’s satisfaction. It helps
                      managers and training developers build programs that teach
                      what Air Force people need to know, when they need to know it,
                      in the most effective and most efficient manner possible. The
                      ISD process implements all of the principles of the Quality Air
                      Force (QAF) program.

                      Quality is the vehicle to ensure that training systems are built
                      and delivered customer-centered.


What it is            Quality improvement (QI) is the continuous, organized creation
                      of beneficial change. It occurs throughout the ISD process.
                      Quality improvement results in raising student performance (due
                      to training) to an unprecedented level.


Objectives of QI      The objective of QI is to foster continuous improvement in the
                      ISD processes and products and to ensure on-time development
                      of high-quality courseware that enables students to reach the
                      desired performance levels in an effective and cost-efficient
                      manner. QI occurs throughout the ISD process.


Results of QI         High quality in training product development brings:

                         Increased student satisfaction
                         Products that are easy to maintain
                         Increased ability of students to perform a job immediately
                         after training

                      High quality in training design brings:

                         Fewer errors
                         Less rework (and waste)
                         More successful training
                         Less time spent in developing new products
                         Potentially lower life cycle costs

Test and               Test and evaluation is the check to ensure that system
evaluation             requirements are met according to the specification. It is used as
                       part of the quality process.


Quality relationship   Customers:
                         Know your customers. The information gained in the
                         mission/job analysis process gives the instructional design
                         team information that defines the customer’s expectations.
                         Focus on customers. As mentioned earlier, the needs of
                         the work center drives the instructional needs. By continuing
                         to trace the relationship between the job requirements and all
                         aspects of the instructional program, you maintain a continual
                         focus on the actual field requirements. In addition, ISD also
                         requires that the capabilities, aptitudes and attitudes of the
                         student target population be considered during the design
                         process.

                       Team Players:
                          Foster teamwork. A training program cannot be designed
                          and developed in a vacuum. In order to develop effective
                          training, the design team must include representatives from
                          the work center and evaluation offices. This helps ensure
                          that the training matches the performance requirements of the
                          job.
                          Empower your people. ISD is a problem solving, decision-
                          making model. The flexibility of the process, combined with
                          the fact that there are any number of ways to solve a given
                          training problem, requires that design teams be allowed
                          freedom and authority to design, develop, and implement
                          training that meets job performance requirements.

                       Final Product:
                          Know your mission. ISD depends on mission and job
                          analysis for basic data. All instruction must be based directly
                          on mission or job requirements. The checks in the process
                          help eliminate instruction not related to the job.

                          Job analysis uses data from many sources, including mission
                          statements found in regulations or locally developed
                          statements. Analysts also make use of management

(Continued)            observation to determine the actual job requirements.

                       As part of the job analysis process, a training needs
                       assessment is conducted to arrive at the actual performance
                       problem. In some cases, a problem is not related to lack of
                       training, but to a problem with the job structure or
                       environment. The ISD process helps ensure that you don’t
                       build a training program for a non-training problem.
                       Set goals and standards. Goals and standards for an
                       instructional development effort come in many variations.
                       First, the job requirements and the impact of the performance
                       deficiency determine the timing required for the development
                       process and the conduct of the instructional program.
                       Second, the content of the training is determined by the job
                       performance requirements. The design team should directly
                       translate the cues, conditions, and performance standards of
                       the job directly into the instructional program.
                       Manage by fact. Each phase of the ISD process requires
                       constant evaluation against the job requirements identified
                       earlier in the process. In addition, a variety of tools have
                       been developed to help ensure that design and development
                       decisions are made with supporting data. For example, a
                       number of media selection tools are being used that provide
                       managers with information that matches training media with
                       the training requirements. These matches are based on
                       learning theories and development cost factors (money and
                       time). ISD is designed to guide managers and developers to
                       awareness of factors affecting their decisions.
                       Integrate quality in all phases. Evaluation is continuous
                       quality checking. This is true during each phase of the ISD
                       process, from analysis to implementation. Built-in checks in
                       each phase ensure the quality of the ISD process and
                       products. The emphasis is on satisfying the job performance
                       requirements and producing graduates who can do their jobs.
                       Evaluate quality constantly. The ISD process is a cyclical,
                       ongoing process of continuous improvements. As curriculum
                       developers progress through the different phases of ISD, the
                       process and products of each phase are constantly evaluated
                       against the job requirements and principles of learning. The
                       results of the evaluations determine which phase of ISD to
                       enter next. Constant evaluation identifies changes in job
                       requirements due to updates in equipment and personnel,
                       which results in new ISD efforts to provide the best possible
                       training to Air Force personnel.

Basis of process   The basis of process improvement is Quality Air Force. QAF is a
improvement        management philosophy and a methodology that work together
                   to produce continuous process improvements. It is based on the
                   following principles.

                      All work is a process.
                      Processes receive work from suppliers, add value, and
                      deliver output to customers.
                      Anyone from whom a process receives work is a supplier.
                      Anyone to whom a process delivers output is a customer.
                      Customers have needs and expectations.
                      Customers will define and measure quality in terms of those
                      needs and expectations.
                      Quality is meeting customer needs and expectations.
                      Improving process quality increases productivity.
                      Processes can be identified, understood, measured, and
                      improved.
                      The people who operate the processes know best how to
                      improve them.


Procedure for      In order to ensure process improvements, you will need to use a
process            systematic method to identify and correct the causes of the
improvement        problems. The six steps of process improvement are outlined in
                   the following table.

What it is      "Chart it, check it, change it" is a simple phrase that summarizes
                one of the ways to implement the procedure. It is a systematic
                approach to continuous improvement. This approach has three
                principal steps, as shown below and in Figure 6.

                     effort you implemented. Analyze the data you collected.
                     Act on the results. If the effort was truly an improvement,
                     standardize and document it. If it was not successful, determine
                     what could be done to improve it.

                        System Engineering Interaction
Introduction          Nothing in the ISD process occurs in a vacuum or at least it
                      shouldn’t. It’s extremely important that ISD interface with other
                      defense system acquisition/life cycle support functions
                      continuously. One important way that the ISD process meshes
                      with the defense system is through interacting with system
                      engineering. An "interaction" is a two-way street: ISD and
                      system engineering communicate and support each other. But
                      why is it important and how does it happen?


What it is            A system is a composite of skilled people and equipment
                      (hardware and software) that provide an operational capability to
                      perform a stated mission.

                      ISD is the systematic process employed to design and develop
                      training for a defense system. It is used to identify training
                      requirements, to determine appropriate media for training, and to
                      design, develop, implement and evaluate training and training
                      materials for defense systems.

                      The system engineering process is a logical sequence of
                      activities and decisions transforming an operational need into a
                      description of system performance parameters and a preferred
                      system configuration.


Relationship of ISD   ISD and system engineering are two complementary processes
and system            that are used to design and develop training systems for defense
engineering           systems. The processes have many similarities and each
                      process accomplishes functions not accomplished by the other.


Importance of ISD     System engineering must consider personnel, the skills they
to system             require, and the training program to teach these skills as integral
engineering           parts of the defense system. Failure to integrate ISD into system
                      engineering can result in an inadequately supported system.

                      System engineering addresses those training system design
                      issues having to do with translation of training system functional

                                                                    Continued on next page

Importance of ISD   requirements (stated by ISD) into hardware and software. It
to system           considers the defense system hardware, software, support
engineering         equipment, operations, and maintenance concept. System
(Continued)         engineering examines new technology, similar systems, and
                    existing systems to arrive at a functional description of the
                    system in terms of hardware and software requirements. The
                    system engineering process is used to produce the management
                    and design decisions and data upon which the training system is
                    based. ISD alone cannot fulfill all the needs of a total training
                    system.


Interaction         ISD and system engineering are mutually supporting facets of a
                    defense system acquisition and life cycle. All individuals
                    involved with acquisition must ensure that ISD is considered in
                    system engineering and vice versa. Many avenues exist for this
                    interaction. Among them are:

                   It was stressed that ISD is a flexible process, always employing
                   the principles of continuous or quality improvement. You have
                   seen how training system requirements must be considered early
                   in the cycle of defense system acquisition. Teamwork,
                   communication, and coordination have been stressed frequently.
                   But at this point, a contract has not yet been awarded and could
                   still be a long time away. In fact, you learned in the previous
                   chapter that a TPT has been formed and that the TPT
                   determines the approach to take for acquiring training to support
                   the defense system. Sometimes it may be in the best interests of
                   the Air Force, for the Air Force to develop the training
                   themselves. If the decision is to have contractors develop all or
                   part of the training, another series of events, processes and
                   activities begins, leading to contract award. It is very important
                   that you know what occurs before contract award because
                   several key program office actions will occur during this time,
                   ultimately affecting the team and the ISD process.


Purpose            The purpose of this chapter is to explain the major tasks that
                   occur during pre-award of a training system contract and to focus
                   on the contractor and government responsibilities, along with the
                   ISD implications.

Special          As mentioned above, there will be occasions when it is best for
considerations   the Air Force to develop its own training. One area that needs
                 special consideration is Air Force developed maintenance
                 training. Another key consideration is interactive courseware
                 (ICW). There will be occasions where you will need to acquire
                 ICW. Because of their importance, these two areas are covered
                 in separate chapters as listed:

ISD phase        At this stage, you are conducting planning, preceding the
                 analysis phase of ISD. The updated Air Force ISD model is
                 shown in Figure 8.

Tasking          Throughout the rest of this handbook, various tasks and
                 responsibilities will be described. They will normally be listed as
                 either "Contractor Tasks" or "Air Force Tasks." Never assume
                 that task listings are complete. As you learned earlier, each
                 defense program varies depending on such things as funds,
                 scope and time. Also, note that while all USAF tasks are listed
                 as "Air Force Tasks," they could be performed by different
                 agencies of the USAF, again depending on the program. For
                 example, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) may
                 have various tasks and other responsibilities at different stages
                 in the ISD and acquisition phases. These requirements should
                 be specified and agreed to in a Memorandum of Agreement
                 (MOA) signed by the using command, program office and AETC.

                            Acquisition Planning

Introduction       A training system concept has been published that describes the
                   desired overall training philosophy, principles and capabilities.
                   At this point, the Air Force has decided that it will pursue a
                   training contract and now must take steps to prepare and award
                   a contract. Acquisition planning is where considerable
                   communication, assessments, strategy sessions and preliminary
                   planning will take place.


Purpose            The purpose of acquisition planning is to develop preliminary
                   concepts, plans and strategies for the acquisition. By completing
                   this task, the Air Force will be assured that the acquisition
                   strategy is best suited to the purpose, meets user needs, meets
                   regulations and other constraints, and ideally "covers all the
                   bases."


Acquisition life   Before going any further, look again at the diagram of the
cycle              acquisition life cycle milestones and phases (Figure 9).
                   Acquisition planning is accomplished at each phase. The more
                   defined the defense system becomes, the closer ISD activities
                   can come to actual training system design. The ISD analysis
                   phase is typically part of acquisition planning for Phase I and is
                   repeated again for Phase II. Although training systems are
                   considerations in Phase 0, little ISD analysis is done before
                   Phase I.

                                                                  Continued on next page

Contractor tasks      During acquisition planning, the potential contractors are doing
                      everything possible to learn about the potential contract. This
                      includes, but is not limited to:

                      -   Marketing capabilities to using command(s) and program
                          office
                      -   Gathering intelligence data such as:
                           - Funding profile
                           - Users’ perceived requirements
                           - Program office’s perceived requirements
                           - Political advantages and constraints
                           - Potential follow-on work
                      -   Identifying strengths and weaknesses
                      -   Evaluating teaming trade-offs
                      -   Evaluating profit potential
                      -   Evaluating cost/schedule/performance risks
                      -   Listing pros/cons of bid/no bid decision
                      -   Responding to Requests for Information (RFI) and Searches
                          for Information (SFI)

Air Force tasks   At this point, the using command will ensure that the SME
                  support principles are agreed to by all levels. While the potential
                  contractors are gathering data and going through their various
                  actions, the program office is becoming very busy in getting this
                  potential program moving. Some actions that they are taking
                  include:

                  -   Engage the using command.
                      - Trigger update of training system concept.
                      - Get user to define system functional requirements
                      (management, administration, support, delivery of instruction,
                      ISD, QI).

                  -   Engage industry by issuing SFI.
                  -   Perform preliminary program risk assessment.
                  -   Write training system life cycle master plan (top-level system
                      management strategy).
                  -   Engage Program Element Monitor (PEM).
                      - Negotiate program-funding profile.
                      - Define test agency responsibilities.
                      - Identify major program constraints.
                      - Negotiate Program Management Document (PMD).

                  -   Assess development risk.
                  -   Define acquisition strategy.
                      - Identify alternative acquisition strategies.
                      - Examine feasibility of a phased approach.
                      - Define Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA)
                      requirements.
                      - If any, which TSRA tasks?
                      - Should there be a separate TSRA contract?
                      - Lock in strategy at this point.
                      - Write acquisition plan.

                  -   Write baseline concept description supporting integrated
                      weapon system management.
                      - Establish SME support principles.

(Continued)          agreed to in Memorandum of Agreement):
                     - Develop and coordinate AETC participation plan.
                        - Specify methodology:
                            - Training development or quality assessment
                            - Training assessment during Operational Test and
                            Evaluation (OT&E) (AETC will assess whether the
                            maintenance program meets user needs)
                        - Specify personnel and other resources.
                        - List data requirements.

                     -   Review listing of data items to be considered when a new Air

Military standards   You read that AETC is reviewing military standards (MIL-STD).
                     MIL-STDs are documents issued within the Department of
                     Defense (DoD) in accordance with the basic policy of the
                     Defense Standardization Program (MIL-STD-962). MIL-STDs
                     establish engineering and technical requirements for items,
                     equipment, processes, procedures, practices and methods that
                     have been adopted as standards. MIL-HDBK-29612 is for
                     military training programs.


MIL-HDBK-29612       Since MIL-HDBK-29612 is limited in scope, you need to refer to
                     Attachment C to understand the cross-walk for total training
                     systems acquisition (AFMC/ASC process) and MIL-HDBK-29612.
                     The ultimate goal of MIL-HDBK-29612 is to enable the
                     Government to identify more accurately the data or information
                     that the Government must have to fulfill a training requirement.
                     Because the standard has been prepared for joint service use,
                     understanding how to tailor the task descriptions and data
                     requirements cited in MIL-HDBK-29612 is critical. Failure to
                     tailor accurately and intelligently will result in performance of
                     tasks and purchase of data that either extend significantly
                     beyond the minimum scope of the original training requirement or
                     do not meet the needs of the end user, while unnecessarily
                     escalating

Data             The SPO should have completed the acquisition plan detailing
                 the parameters of the acquisition. Data plans may indicate a

                      developed.


What it is            The RFP is an acquisition package soliciting design and
                      development proposals for new or updated systems from
                      contractors. The document generally consists of:

                         Executive summary
                         Instructions to offerers
                         Requirements documents
                         Statement of work
                         Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)
                         Model contract
                         Other special items

                      The release of the RFP is the official start of the contracting
                      process.


Contractor tasks      During this stage, the potential contractors are continuing their
                      intelligence gathering operations and trying to "scope out" the
                      potential contract as much as possible. They have now begun to
                      talk with SPO personnel concerning:

                         Specific requirements
                         "Show stoppers"
                         Government prejudices or peculiarities

                      Note: Sometimes the Air Force will issue a draft RFP to potential
                      contractors to get them more in line with the acquisition strategy
                      and to give the contractors an opportunity to give feedback to the
                      Air Force. The draft RFP is not binding in any manner. A second
                      draft release before final RFP clarifies any misunderstandings
                      before going into source selection rules.

                                                                     Continued on next page

Contractor tasks   If a draft RFP has been received, the potential contractors will:

                      Review and comment on the RFP.
                      Attempt to influence Government (not to give them the
                      contract, but to make various changes to the specifications
                      such as to improve performance, cost, and quality).
                      Negotiate potential teaming agreements.
                      Generate preliminary system design.


Air Force tasks    The program office is now busy writing various documents
                   specifying system functional requirements, reflecting the user’s
                   requirements and constraints. These include:

                      System Requirements Document (SRD)
                      Statement of work inputs
                      Instructions to offerers
                      Requirements correlation matrix

                   In addition, Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) decisions affecting
                   the Training System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) are
                   documented. These include:

                      Reasons for doing TSRA
                      How results precede and feed subsequent program phases
                      Rationale for separate TSRA contract or pursuit of phased
                      program

                   If tasked, AETC will also develop a "strawman" concept of
                   system life cycle training using their experience and familiarity
                   with similar systems. For example, the "strawman" concept of life
                   cycle training will include AETC’s estimate of:

                      Training requirements for the life cycle of the defense system
                      Recommended training methods and media
                      Anticipated levels of the training needed by the workforce
                      Specific Air Force specialties needing training
                      Career point at which the training will likely be required

                                                                  Continued on next page

Air Force tasks      This "strawman" training concept will be used as a baseline for
(Continued)          comparison of the contractor proposals. In many respects the
                     "strawman" concepts cover many of the same areas that would
                     be covered in the early development stages of a system-training
                     plan.

                     AETC could also review the draft RFP for concerns such as the
                     following:

                     Requirements:

                             Are overall data requirements adequate?
                             Is the contractor required to warrant data for accuracy and
                             completeness?
                             Have Government Furnished Property (GFP) and
                             Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) been clearly
                             identified?
                             Are requirements for government quality assurance
                             included?
                             If Computer-Based Instruction (CBI) is required, has it
                             been considered as an acquisition?

                     Other Considerations:

                             Are milestones related to the defense system events
                             rather than calendar dates?
                             Have availability and supportability of GFP/GFE been
                             planned?
                             Have technical data requirements been included?
                             Is digitized data or Computer-Aided Acquisition Logistics
                             Support (CALS) considered?
                             Have facilities and classrooms been considered?
                             (Facilities must be considered up front as part of the
                             acquisition.)

                               Proposal Writing

Introduction       A lot of work has gone into acquisition planning and RFP
                   development to produce a draft RFP. Now the RFP will be
                   refined, rewritten in final form and distributed, and potential
                   contractors will write and submit proposals. The contractor will
                   go through many steps to ensure that the proposal is the best
                   document possible, reflects the contractor’s capabilities, and is at
                   a fair, competitive price. To write the proposal, the contractor
                   must ensure that several actions are done.

                   Note: Before the final RFP is delivered to the potential
                   contractors, the SPO and using commands will sponsor bidders’
                   conferences to review the draft RFP and conduct question and
                   answer sessions. Once this is completed and draft RFP
                   shortfalls are remedied, the formal RFP is delivered. A second
                   draft RFP ensures that remedies are satisfactory before final
                   RFP release.


Purpose            The purpose of proposal writing is for industry to prepare a
                   document for the Air Force. The document should convince the
                   AF contracting officer that the contractor’s company can produce
                   the best quality product that meets or exceeds the minimum
                   requirements, within specifications, at a fair price, and will be
                   delivered on time.


Contractor tasks   In the proposal, the contractor must show an understanding of
                   the requirements and the intent to comply. The contractor must
                   also include a top-level training system specification showing
                   allocated functional requirements. Source data requirements
                   and tasks must be identified to include:

                      Identification of associate contractor agreements
                      Identification of simulator data integrity standards

                                                                  Continued on next page

Contractor tasks      The first major product that the potential contractor prepares is
(Continued)           the top-level System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP).
                      This includes plans for development of:

                         Hardware
                         Software
                         Courseware
                         Firmware

                      In addition, the contractor will prepare the System Engineering
                      Master Schedule (SEMS), write training system specifications,
                      and identify source data requirements.


Air Force tasks       The SPO will conduct bidders’ conferences, discussing draft
                      proposals with the contractor. The SPO will write evaluation
                      standards and identify the source selection team. The using
                      commands and AETC will support the SPO at the bidders’
                      conferences as required.

                                Source Selection

Synopsis          At this stage, the Air Force will review all proposals using
                  guidance developed by the SPO. The using commands and
                  AETC should participate in this process. During this process, the
                  Air Force will try to determine the contractor’s understanding of
                  the total system functional integration. The using commands will
                  ensure that the training concepts are understood and represent
                  users’ interests.


Air Force tasks   Source selection will follow a predetermined and documented
                  schedule of activities. The SPO, working with the using command
                  and AETC, will review many areas. Some questions they may
                  ask include the following.

                  Feasibility

                     Can the contractor really do what is proposed in a quality
                     fashion within schedule and budget?

                  Conformance

                     Does the proposal meet requirements of the RFP?

                  Coverage of User Requirements

                     Will this training satisfy the customer?
                     Is it what the customer "ordered?"

                  Consistency

                     Is planned training consistent with defense system operation
                     and maintenance concepts?

                  The SPO will also conduct a training system capability and
                  capacity review, if appropriate.


Contract award    After all the above actions are completed and preview steps
                  satisfied, a contract is awarded. Once the contract is awarded,
                  considerable work will begin using the ISD process.

                                    Overview


Introduction       While reading about the total training system earlier (page 15),
                   you learned that a key ingredient to success is planning.
                   Planning in defense system acquisition consists of many tasks
                   that occur early in the acquisition cycle and continue throughout
                   all phases.


Purpose            The purpose of this chapter is to explain the major tasks in
                   performing planning. While you will not become a planning
                   expert by reading this chapter, you will know the concepts and
                   processes necessary for success.

Which ISD phase?   You have not yet entered an ISD phase but are doing preliminary
                   work. You are still in a planning stage, focusing on training while
                   in the management function. This function is highlighted in
                   Figure 10.

Contractor tasks   Since the defense system contractor has been contracted to
                   produce and deliver a system, that contractor plays a large role
                   in planning for training. The contractor is responsible for
                   conducting all the steps in planning while coordinating with the
                   program office and primary operating commands. The
                   acquisition contract may be for courseware or devices, on-site
                   training, type 1 training, or a total training system. (For
                   information about type 1 training, see AFI 36-2201.)

Air Force tasks      Throughout the planning stage, the program office will review all
                     contractor products and design decisions, working with the
                     contractor informally to make required changes, while elevating
                     areas of concern.

                     The primary operating command supports the contractor with
                     SME advisors from staff, line and supporting positions; they
                     advise regarding training doctrine and provide the practical field
                     experience.

                     Air Education and Training Command provides support, as
                     requested, by reviewing contractor products and elevating
                     concerns. Specific areas of interest to AETC are discussed later
                     in this chapter.

                           Assess Instructional Needs

Introduction          Instructional need has been defined many ways but is generally
                      considered to be the discrepancy or gap between desired
                      performance and current performance. In the acquisition
                      business, it is defined as the process of identifying the problem,
                      documenting any shortfall and developing a solution.
                                  An instructional need exists when an
                                employee lacks the necessary knowledge,
                                 skills or attitudes to perform a required


Purpose               The purpose of assessing instructional needs is to validate a
                      need for training in a defense system acquisition.


Stages of             The three basic stages of assessing instructional needs are:
assessing
instructional needs      Define the problem.
                         Document the deficiency.
                         Develop the solution.

Basic steps of      The three overall stages can be broken down into six or more
analysis            basic steps. You can modify these as necessary.

                       Step      Analysis Activity
                        1        Define the Objectives. Why are you doing the
                                 analysis? What is your goal?
                        2        Identify Data Requirements. What kind of data
                                 will you need to review to conduct the analysis?
                        3        Select Methods of Gathering Data. How will you
                                 obtain the data you need? Examples are:
                                 • Use questionnaires.
                                 • Make observations.
                                 • Conduct interviews.

                            Develop Overall Outline

Introduction        At this point in the planning phase, you have assessed
                    instructional needs and determined that there will be a training
                    requirement for the product that you are acquiring. But you have
                    also found out that this "product" will create a lot of unknowns in
                    the training and support areas if you don’t get a handle on it now.
                    For these reasons, you need to develop an overall outline.


What it is          An overall outline is defined as a macro, rough profile of what’s
                    going on and what needs to be done. This outline gives the "big
                    picture" of the entire training system.


Structure           There is no required structure to the outline. It will vary
                    depending on the size and complexity of the system being
                    acquired and the training required.


How to develop an   The best way to start in developing the outline is to review the
outline             contract and the SOW. Developing the outline is similar to
                    developing a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). A WBS is a
                    hierarchical ordering of work activities and products which is
                    used in detailed planning of work activity units and in costing for
                    proposals and contracts. Your outline need not be as detailed as
                    a WBS, but the areas to consider are similar. Begin with the
                    training system at the top. Next, list broad categories of things
                    that comprise the system. Then consider each of these things
                    and list the activities that go into them. Continue this "pyramid
                    building" until the desired level of detail is reached.


What to consider    Items to consider could include, but are not limited to:

                    Objective:

                       Training equipment
                       Courseware
                       Trained personnel requirements

                                                                   Continued on next page

                      Subjective:

                         Instructors
                         Defense system schedules
                         Test plans
                         Desired instructional approach


Other conditions      When developing the outline, consider how the components of
                      the training system interrelate with each other and the defense
                      system. Progress, delays or changes in the defense system will
                      have an effect on the training system and vice versa.

                              Section C
                    Define Planning Requirements

Introduction     Now that you have an outline of the "big picture," you need to
                 define planning requirements. The training development process
                 may require more than one plan. But don’t let this scare you
                 away. If done correctly, the selected plans will follow an orderly
                 process and will fit into the overall picture like pieces of a puzzle.
                 A "plan" can be a one-page document or a 200-page binder. It
                 depends on the system, the program and the subject.


Where to start   In defining planning requirements, the first question to ask is:
                 "What plans will be required?"


Questions to     If you can answer the question above, you are on the right track.
answer           If you cannot, then further study may be necessary. Find the
                 answers to questions such as:

                    What activities need advance preparation?
                    What do you need to know and have in place in order to do
                    these activities?
                    Is this information needed for the training system
                    implementation plan?
                    Is this information needed for the System Engineering
                    Management Plan (SEMP)?
                    Will there be a courseware/ISD development plan to guide
                    your process?
                    How will you know the training system quality?
                    Will you need a test and evaluation plan?


Who develops     After answering the above questions, you can concentrate on the
plans?           required plans. You need to remember that no single person
                 develops all plans. In a major acquisition, there will be several
                 personnel or several teams of Air Force and contractor personnel
                 developing plans at any given time.

                 Remember to coordinate and communicate.
AFH 36-2235       VOLUME 3     1 NOVEMBER 2002                                           69




Example plans        You touched on some plans that may be important. Some plans
                     you may see are:

                        System training plan
                        Training system implementation plan
                        SEMP
                        Courseware/ISD development plan
                        Training system test and evaluation plan
                        ISD management plan


Air Force tasks      During and following the planning phase, the following actions
                     will occur. The SPO will:

                        Review all contractor products and design decisions.
                        Work with the contractor to effect required changes.
                        Elevate areas of concern.

                     The using command will:

                        Provide SME support as required. (SMEs could be utilized
                        from all applicable positions, such as staff, line and support
                        positions.)

                     AETC will review the ISD management plan to ensure that:

                        ISD methodology provides for sound, objective, systematic,
                        and traceable training decisions.
                        Contractor-planned training meets user-defined requirements.

                     AETC will also identify areas for comparative analysis.


Data                 The contractor may deliver the various plans in accordance with
                     the contract, but plans will normally be delivered following the
                     planning stage. This will include the ISD management plan and
                     the training system implementation plan.

Metrics           Metrics are standards of measurement or quality indicators that
                  are critical in the acquisition and ISD processes. The purpose of
                  metrics is to give qualitative and quantitative evaluations of
                  processes and products throughout the development of
                  courseware. Acquisition metrics track key factors such as cost,
                  schedule, and performance. Types of metrics include:

                     Qualitative
                       Quality assurance
                       Evaluation criteria

                      -   Review all TSRA deliverables incrementally as drafts are
                          written.
                      -   Compare percentage of completion of draft products vs.
                          completion timeline/milestones.
                      -   Evaluate percentage/amount and types of personnel
                          proposed for each development phase vs. AF experience
                          base. Has the contractor budgeted personnel for the

                              Mission Analysis

Introduction       Mission analysis and task analysis normally go hand-in-hand.
                   Mission analysis generally precedes task analysis. A mission
                   analysis will provide basic data on system functions, types of
                   equipment, maintenance requirements, educational goals and
                   other information.


What it is         Mission Analysis is defined as a process of reviewing mission
                   requirements, developing collective task statements, and
                   arranging the collective tasks in a hierarchical relationship.


Contractor tasks   Many tasks are conducted during a mission analysis. Some
                   tasks will occur concurrently, others subsequently. These tasks
                   can include the following:

                      Collect mission data.
                      Perform literature search.
                      Conduct interviews.
                      Conduct on-site visits/reviews.
                      Compare new system to existing system.
                      Compare new system to similar system.
                      Document mission descriptions.
                      Create traceability database.


Air Force tasks    During this stage, the SPO will continue dialogue with the
                   contractor, reviewing products and giving guidance as necessary.
                   As delegated, the user and AETC will review contractor
                   deliverables for validity, process conformance, technical
                   accuracy and completeness.

                                    Task Analysis

Introduction          Every job in the Air Force consists of tasks that comprise the job.
                      The goal of task analysis is to zero in on the target population or
                      the group needing to be trained and determine what they need in
                      order to do the job.


What it is            The best way to define task analysis is to break it down into two
                      parts.

                         Job Task Analysis - A process of examining a specific job to
                         identify all the duties and tasks that are performed by the job
                         incumbent at a given skill level.
                         Training Task Analysis - The process of examining each
                         unique unit of work from the job task analysis to derive
                         descriptive information used in the design, development, and
                         testing of training products.


Contractor tasks      Task analysis is a more in-depth analysis compared to mission
                      analysis. It is a further breakout, narrowing the analysis to the
                      required tasks. It includes the following activities:

                         Identify tasks for each mission.
                         Describe critical functions.
                         Generate task lists based on defense system crew
                         composition.
                         Document crewmember qualification levels.
                         Create preliminary task hierarchical list.
                         Document expected performance required for each task.
                         Trace tasks back to mission descriptions (using database).


Air Force tasks       The SPO will continue dialogue with the contractor, reviewing
                      products and giving guidance as necessary. The SPO will
                      review and approve the reports as appropriate. They will review
                      the reports for accuracy, ensure that task lists are complete, and
                      verify that correct "assumptions" were made. The SMEs will
                      evaluate draft deliverables from the perspective of the using
                      command requirements.

                                                                     Continued on next page

Air Force tasks   Training analysts review for compliance with DIDs and required
(Continued)       processes. They will also review to ensure that traceability has
                  been maintained throughout the Training System Requirements
                  Analysis process (as discussed in Chapter 2).


Data              Following completion of mission and task analysis, a report is
                  required. The report should contain items such as:

                  Mission Items:

                          Training Requirements Analysis

Introduction            When a new or modified defense system is being designed and
                        developed, training impacts must be considered throughout the
                        process. As you know, no system is fully functional without the
                        trained personnel to operate, maintain, and support it. Ideally,
                        the mission and task analyses have been performed or are in a
                        stage of completion. Now the training requirements analysis
                        begins.


Purpose                 The purpose of the training requirements analysis is to develop
                        the training task list. These are the tasks for which the student
                        lacks the skills, knowledge, or attitudes in order to perform them.


How is a task list      To develop a task list:
developed?
                           First conduct a target population analysis
                               Data determines types of students entering the training
                               system and their current skills/knowledge/attitudes

                           Perform a breakdown of skills, knowledge and attitudes to
                           determine which skills, knowledge and attitudes is performed.
                              Determining which skills can be trained in what setting.

                        This breakdown will be a key factor in conducting objectives
                        analysis (Section D).


Who develops it?        The contractor normally develops the analysis with input from
                        SMEs.


Contractor tasks        Conducting early training requirements analysis, including any
                        preliminary analysis during concept development, will help
                        ensure that the following tasks are done.

                        Assess and analyze:
                           Assess potential sources of students.
                           Assess students’ knowledge and education.

                                                                       Continued on next page

                      Create final training task hierarchy list.
                      Document findings by writing Training Requirements Analysis
                      Report (TRAR).
                      Document in a database, tracing requirements back to
                      mission descriptions.

                   Determine:

                      Identify target population (potential students).
                      Determine student experience level.
                      Identify students’ current proficiency and qualifications.
                      Define increase needed in skills, knowledge, and attitudes
                      (SKA).
                      Define performance factors and qualification levels for
                      terminal objectives.


Air Force tasks    The SPO will review the report, comment and approve, as
                   appropriate. The user will:

                      Conduct comparative analysis for comparison to contractor-
                      performed analysis results.
                      Review contractor-training decisions for traceability,
                      completeness, accuracy and reasonableness.
                      Check that target population definition is correct.
                      Verify that performance factors reflect valid performance
                      requirements.


Data               Following the above actions, the contractor will deliver the TRAR
                   and other documentation in accordance with the contract.

                                 Section D
                             Objectives Analysis

Introduction       Training objectives are the framework in which training systems
                   are designed and developed. The objectives are directed at
                   meeting all training requirements. The achievement of the
                   training objectives makes up the difference in knowledge, skills,
                   and attitudes needed by the target population to do the job.


Purpose            The purpose of conducting objectives analysis is to clearly state
                   training requirements in terms of conditions, standards, and
                   behaviors, and arrange them in a logical and effective sequence.
                   This becomes very important when structuring the course
                   syllabus and developing the courseware.


How is it          There is no "concrete" way to organize training objectives.
developed?         Objectives are organized in the most effective and efficient way
                   to conduct training. There are several recommended tasks in an
                   objectives analysis.


Who develops it?   The training system requirements analysis contractor performs
                   the objectives analysis with input from SMEs.


Contractor tasks   The contractor will complete many tasks at this stage, including:

                      Develop objectives, including:
                        Top Level
                            Terminal

                         Create flow chart for subordinate/superordinate relationships.
                         Describe qualification levels.
                         Document analysis.


Air Force tasks       The SPO will:

                         Review rationale, justification, and traceability of the training

                         Continue working with the contractor, giving guidance as
                         required.
                         Review and approve any objectives and media reports.
                         Through SMEs, review and coordinate the training objectives
                         hierarchy, as well as the task analysis process.


Data                  The contractor will deliver documentation in accordance with the
                      contract. This will probably not occur until completion of media
                      analysis, which is described in the next section.

                                Media Analysis

Introduction       Instructional media refers to the different means used to give
                   information to the student. Different types of media have various
                   levels of effectiveness, depending on the complexity of the
                   subject being taught. Media analyses must be conducted to
                   ensure that the most effective media are used to efficiently meet
                   the training requirements.


What it is         Definitions of media vary, but for purposes of this section, media
                   refers to a channel of communication utilized to aid learning.
                   Types of media vary from instructor-based to full mission
                   simulation.

                   Media analysis is defined as the process of examining media
                   requirements and assembling a data bank of information to use
                   for selecting appropriate media for use in instruction.


How is it          Media analysis is not a straightforward process. It is an iterative
developed?         process with various media tradeoffs made prior to determining
                   the media pool. The media pool is the agreed-upon set from
                   which media will be selected. The "preferred" media are
                   selected and scrutinized against possible tradeoffs such as cost,
                   logistics, maintenance support and facilities. Consistency of
                   media is also an important consideration. The goal is an optimal
                   media solution that is feasible to implement within the training
                   system design.


Who develops it?   The contractor conducts media analysis, with some input from
                   SMEs. The contractor normally uses training analysts and
                   systems engineers in the effort.
AFH 36-2235        VOLUME 3     1 NOVEMBER 2002                                         83




Contractor tasks      Media analysis can be a very detailed process and will vary
                      depending on the program. The contractor will complete tasks
                      such as the following:

                         Conduct surveys of:
                           Instructional systems
                           Educational technologies
                           Authoring systems

                         Define student evaluation techniques.
                         Select media allocation model (if applicable).
                         Conduct media trade study.
                         Analyze media training effectiveness.
                         Allocate candidate media in matrix.
                         Using database, trace media allocations back to mission
                         descriptions.
                         Analyze instructional strategy alternatives.
                         Develop global instructional strategy.
                         Identify levels of courseware required for computer-based
                         training (CBT).
                         Document analysis.


Air Force tasks       The SPO has continued dialogue and guidance with the
                      contractor. The SPO will ensure that documentation meets
                      requirements. They will again ensure that objectives are
                      traceable to and support valid training requirements. They will
                      also check for:

                         Logical objective grouping.
                         Correct objective flow.
                         Verification that all training requirements are covered by
                         objectives.
                         Appropriate media selections for skills taught (with special
                         attention to use of operational aircraft and hardware).
                         Validity of functional and physical fidelity requirements.
                         Validity of media selections and training requirements.
                         Assurance that operational equipment is considered in media

                         Assurance that AF technical training centers equipment and
                         media needs are addressed.
                         Assurance that if CBT is selected as media, it is procured as
                         part of the acquisition.

Steps to media   The above list can be summarized in the following steps to select
selection        media.

                    Develop a list of possible media.
                    Review constraints relative to cost, time, availability,
                    resources, etc.
                    Evaluate media needs relative to content, objectives,
                    instructional strategies, teaching methods, and organizational
                    patterns.
                    Verify that media are compatible with other AF systems and

                                Cost Analysis

Introduction      To make intelligent decisions about the selection of a system to
                  fulfill a specific need, you must look beyond the immediate cost
                  of developing and producing that system. You must look at
                  various alternatives in training approaches. You learned earlier
                  about media analysis and various factors you must consider.
                  Closely interrelated with that is cost analysis. In cost analysis,
                  you analyze not only instructional media but also life cycle costs
                  such as operations, maintenance and support. A system that is
                  initially more expensive may be less expensive in the long term.
                  But the reverse tends to be true. Also, the cheapest up-front
                  system generates more support costs and sometimes even more
                  remedial and follow-on training costs.


Purpose           The reason you must conduct cost analysis is to make sure you
                  are acquiring the best long-term value by performing a
                  comparative evaluation of potential instruction methods and
                  media to determine the most efficient alternative.


What it is        You learned earlier that the types of media are defined as the
                  delivery vehicles for presenting instructional material to students
                  to induce learning.

                  Additionally, training effectiveness analysis is defined as the
                  process of measuring and integrating the training effectiveness
                  and the cost effectiveness of existing and/or proposed alternative
                  training system configurations and components in order to
                  determine the optimal mix of new training system components, or
                  to evaluate and improve existing training systems. In other
                  words, to determine the most effective training for the money
                  available.

                  Training strategy is defined as the logical arrangement of
                  course content within a pattern or organization, which will likely
                  cause the most learning to occur. It includes the purpose, target
                  audience, content outline, interaction, feedback, testing,
                  audiovisual options, and other data.

Background       Your goal should be to determine the most effective and efficient
                 training possible. There are alternatives for nearly all training
                 strategies. You may not want to use alternatives, but funding or
                 scheduling may force you to. The best-planned training
                 strategies sometimes are changed due to design, schedule or
                 other modifications. That is why you must analyze life cycle
                 costs compared to training strategy alternatives. It is always
                 better to be prepared up front.


How to prepare   Depending on the training system program being worked, cost
cost analysis    analysis could be performed in a manual mode or by utilizing
                 automated cost analysis models. Cost analysis can be a time-
                 consuming process that, if done properly, will pay long-term
                 dividends. Figure 13 is a simplification of what is involved in cost
                 analysis.

What is included?     The first step in the process is to identify the problem. The word
                      "problem" may be a misnomer in that what you really have at this
                      point is a "challenge." Your challenge is: "Do we use classroom
                      instruction or CBT, videotape, or ICW? Or do we use a simulator
                      or actual operational hardware? What is the student load?"
                      Once you identify the problems, you must identify what data will
                      be needed, how to collect the data, and so on. These steps can
                      be modified and expanded as necessary to support the task at
                      hand.


Final report          When you have finished the process, you will have developed a
                      cost analysis report that identifies the best strategy to take to
                      utilize the most efficient and effective training available.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will analyze life cycle costs versus:

                         Training effectiveness
                         Media alternatives
                         Training strategy alternatives

                      They will also document cost analysis in the training system
                      basis analysis report.


Air Force tasks       Following completion of the cost analysis, the SPO continues
                      dialogue and guidance with the contractor. They will review cost
                      analysis documents to ensure that:

                         Comparisons are appropriate.
                         Trade-offs are properly considered and analyzed.
                         Analyses are unbiased.
                         Factors used are complete, appropriate and realistic.

                                Section G
                     Training System Basis Analysis

Introduction       In the planing phase of ISD, you developed a "big picture" outline
                   of instructional needs and potentially required plans. You
                   identified what plans would probably be required and identified
                   elements of the training system implementation plan. Among
                   other things, you decided if there would be a courseware/ISD
                   development plan. The training system basis analysis (TSBA) is
                   one of the activities in this phase.


Purpose            The purpose of the TSBA is to develop the training system
                   concept and define the training system configuration. The TSBA
                   report documents existing training programs and establishes the
                   functional baseline for the design, development, and operation of
                   an integrated training system. The report is used to define
                   training capabilities and establish system requirements for the
                   training system.


Contractor tasks   The contractor will review and update previous work in planning
                   and analysis to complete the following requirements.

                   New Items:

                      Write development plans for the instructional system and for
                      courseware.
                      Define training system conduct.
                      Assess training technologies (incorporate media analysis
                      from objectives and media analysis).
                      Perform problem analysis.
                      Develop success criteria for:
                         Course Readiness Review (CRR).
                         Site Readiness Review (SRR).
                         Training System Readiness Review (TSRR).
                         Using database, trace system requirements back to
                         mission descriptions.
                         Validate requirements analysis database traceability.

                                                                Continued on next page

Contractor tasks      Continuing items:
(Continued)
                         Update training system implementation plan.
                         Document existing training system.
                         Document similar training system.
                         Document inputs for System Requirements Document (SRD).
                         Document analysis.


Air Force tasks       The SPO will continue to work with the contractor throughout this
                      process, and must review contractor intermediate products,
                      elevating any areas of concern. Once the report is delivered, the
                      SPO will review and approve as appropriate. The SPO will also:

                         Identify any new requirements and changes reflected in top-
                         level program documents such as:
                            Using command(s) system training plan(s)
                            Operational readiness document
                            Previous TSRA products
                            Program management directive
                            New constraints such as:
                                Cost changes
                                Schedule changes
                                Site changes
                                System changes

                         Verify that all valid training requirements are covered.
                         Verify that all system requirements are traceable to valid
                         training requirements.
                         Check to make sure that if success criteria are met, they will
                         ensure success.

                      The using command(s) will support the SPO as necessary and
                      will support a MOA for SME use.

                      Note: If this contract is not a single, total system development,
                      the SPO must:
                         Write a new RFP.
                         Write SRD providing a functional description of all
                         requirements for the total training system (single-contract
                         programs only). This includes student input/output.
                         Estimate SME requirements.
                         Negotiate MOA with using command(s).

                                Preliminary Syllabus

Introduction          Now a preliminary syllabus will be developed. A preliminary
                      syllabus puts into an outline the "big picture" of the training
                      system in a "real world" context.


Purpose               The purpose of the preliminary syllabus is to develop and
                      document a detailed outline of the overall structure of the
                      instruction. The preliminary syllabus will provide a master plan
                      that describes how the training system configuration and overall
                      training concept will be used.


Contractor tasks      Using the previously developed guidance, such as the various
                      plans, analyses, objectives and media analyses, an unrestrained
                      syllabus is developed. This unrestrained document looks at the
                      big picture, covering the entire training system. The goal is to let
                      nothing be overlooked. To develop an unrestrained syllabus, the
                      contractor must:

                         Cluster/sequence objectives.
                         Define course structure.
                         Define course times.
                         Develop course maps.

                      Once this is done, constraints must be applied and the target
                      must be narrowed to best fit the objectives. The contractor must:

                         Update media allocation matrix.
                         Show course times.
                         Indicate facility needs.

                      Once constraints are applied, document the preliminary syllabus
                      while tracing syllabus elements back to mission descriptions. It’s
                      important that a database be used for this to ease reference and
                      tracking in the future.

                      The final step in this area is to write a comprehensive syllabus
                      report and identify lessons for prototyping.

Air Force tasks   The primary job of the using command at this point is to update
                  the STP. The SMEs will review the preliminary syllabus to
                  ensure that their objectives are part of the syllabus.

                  As the contractor develops preliminary syllabus documents, the
                  program office reviews the products, giving guidance as
                  necessary. The final step for the SPO is to review and approve
                  the preliminary syllabus.

                  AETC will review the preliminary syllabus for:

                     Logical flow
                     Coverage of all valid training requirements


Data              A syllabus development report is delivered as required by the

                                     Overview


Introduction       You are now proceeding into the design phase of ISD. This is a
                   good time to remember that you should never consider that the
                   planning and analysis phases are over

                                  The various phases of ISD are
                                        never complete.

                   While you may go progressively from one phase to the next, you
                   will periodically revisit a phase to update a plan, add something
                   you overlooked, or make mid-course corrections. As mentioned
                   in Chapter 1:
                                 ISD is flexible and is not a step-
                                      by-step linear process.

                   But, now that you have developed plans and conducted various
                   analyses, it is time to start designing instruction.


Purpose            The purpose of this chapter is to describe the ISD design phase
                   and the various applications that are specific to acquisition of a
                   defense system.

                                     Section A
                               Start of Development

Introduction          This section is included to cover the situations where a Training
                      System Requirements Analysis (TSRA) is not done, or was done
                      by a separate contractor. If the prior TSRA was conducted as
                      part of a single contract, you can skip this section if that contract
                      allows the contractor to proceed into development.

                      Note: Although you are in the design phase, some development
                      actions take place.


Contractor tasks      As mentioned, if prior tasks were performed as part of a single
                      contract for total system development, nothing happens at this
                      stage. But if prior tasks were performed as part of a stand-alone
                      TSRA or of a multi-phased development, the contractor uses the
                      TSRA results and prepares a proposal.

                      The contractor will write a new system specification as part of the
                      proposal.


Air Force tasks       If prior tasks were performed as part of a single contract for total
                      system development, nothing happens here.

                      If prior tasks were performed as part of a stand-alone TSRA or of
                      a multi-phased development, this is the point of a new solicitation
                      (see note on page 88). The program office will then generate:
                          New RFP
                          New SRD (if required)
                          New source selection
                          New contract award

                      If a new RFP is required, the using command will support the
                      source selection actions.

                      If AETC performs ISD (such as in maintenance training), training
                      equipment functional specifications will be provided to the SPO.
                      The SPO will then develop an RFP from the functional
                      specifications. When the RFP is issued, contractor involvement
                      begins. This RFP kicks off actions previously described
                      beginning on page 54, Request for Proposal Development.

                                Section B
                          Guidance Conferences

Introduction      At this point, a contract has been awarded for development of the
                  training system. The Air Force will now schedule guidance
                  conferences (normally two) to assist the contractor.


Purpose           The purpose of the guidance conferences is to ensure that all
                  parties understand and agree on requirements, roles and
                  responsibilities. The goal is to eliminate or minimize
                  misinterpretations and misunderstandings.


Who conducts?     The Air Force will conduct the conferences at the contractor’s
                  facility shortly after contract award.


Air Force tasks   The program office will:

                     Conduct Program Requirements Guidance Conference
                     (PRGC), including the following tasks:

                        Review contract.
                        Review management issues.
                        Review data issues.
                        Discuss use of System Engineering Master Schedule
                        (SEMS).

                     Conduct System Engineering Guidance Conference (SEGC).
                     Discuss contractor’s approach to:

                        Writing process descriptions
                        Organization
                        Structured model philosophy

                                 Section C
                       System-Level Development Plans

Introduction          Previous chapters covered the development of preliminary plans
                      on various subjects such as a Systems Engineering Management
                      Plan (SEMP), while also defining planning requirements in areas
                      such as quality and life cycle operations. Based on these
                      preliminary reviews and using the various plans and analysis
                      stages, detailed system level development plans will now be
                      written.


Purpose               The purpose of these plans is to have "road maps" or guides,
                      listing various goals and procedures to follow. While ISD in itself
                      is not linear, some of the components of ISD must be followed in
                      a linear process for successful goal accomplishment. Plans that
                      are contractual will "direct." Those not contractual will "guide."


Contractor tasks      The main goal of this stage is to get the contractor to write, or in
                      some cases, update, system level development plans. One of
                      the largest plans to be written is the SEMP. The SEMP includes,
                      but is not limited to:

                      Engineering:

                         System engineering organization (how hardware, software
                         and course organizations interact)
                         System engineering detail schedule (how used)
                         How the work breakdown structure is used by engineering

                      Security issues:

                         Planned trade-off studies and analyses
                         Risk management plan
                         System security plan
                         Integration of reliability, safety, environment, etc.

                                                                      Continued on next page

Air Force tasks      The SPO will also review for disconnects between contractor
                     plans/schedules and training need dates for:

                        Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E)
                        Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)
                        Initial cadre
                        Follow-on training
                        Initial Operational Capability (IOC)
                        Required Assets Available (RAA)

                     The program office will also review for disconnects between:

                        Facilities plans
                        Funding plans/levels
                        Personnel plans/levels
                        Training dates (do they match required delivery date [RDD]?)

                     The using command needs to review the revised SME support
                     MOA and support or negotiate it as required.

                     As the contractor is writing and/or delivering applicable plans,
                     the program office should be conducting a "big picture" review.
                     At this point, the SPO must ensure that the total training system
                     functional requirements and integration are defined for all
                     Configuration Items (CI). Now that plans and workload are
                     becoming more visible, this would be a good time for the SPO to
                     update the MOA defining SME support.

                     Unless delegated in the MOA, the program office will review
                     contractor plans and compare with:

                        STP
                        User training requirements
                        Defense system acquisition and test plans

Quality plan   While all plans serve a purpose and are important, the quality
               plan is always critical. It is most important that plans are written
               to be used and followed. "Filling squares" in the plans
               business will eventually catch up with you, especially in the
               quality area. The training system quality plan should include
               items such as:

                  Training management plan

                      Training system support center
                      Training management system

                            Section D
      Courseware Planning Leading to System Readiness Review

Introduction         Although this is the design phase of ISD, you continue to conduct
                     planning updates, evaluations and quality improvement. There
                     are relatively few cases where you finish one task or phase
                     completely, go to the next, and never have to revisit previous
                     work.
                                        ISD is a continuous process.


Purpose              The purpose of planning is to ensure that the required plans have
                     been considered and are now going to be written. These plans
                     will define and organize various tasks and procedures necessary
                     to design, develop, implement, evaluate and support instruction.


Contractor tasks     Some of the major plans that will be written are the courseware
                     development plans. Because of contractual or system
                     requirements, these plans may be written at an earlier stage. If
                     so, now is the time for updates. Courseware development plans
                     should:

                        Define development process.
                        Define organization.
                        Define handoffs.
                        Define controls.
                        Address procedure and criteria for:
                           Individual tryouts
                           Small-group tryouts (SGTO):
                              Design reviews
                              PDR/CDR process

                     These plans should also include:

                        Production resources plan and tracking procedures
                        Courseware configuration management plan
                        Courseware production plan (draft)
                        Courseware development schedules (draft)
                           Tie to integrated master schedule

                                                                   Continued on next page

                   In addition, a test and evaluation plan may be written, which will
                   include:

                      Formative, summative and operational evaluation plans
                      Data collection procedures
                      Using command roles and responsibilities:

Air Force tasks    As the contractor develops the plans and delivers according to
                   the contract, the SPO must:

                      Review plans, schedules and criteria.
                      Work with contractor to effect required changes.
                      Alleviate areas of concern.

                   As the SPO reviews various contractor products, the using
                   command representatives will conduct similar reviews. Following
                   their review, written comments will be provided to the SPO.

                                                                  Continued on next page

Air Force tasks      AETC will continue to review contractor plans and products.
(Continued)          AETC will also:

                        Check for continuity with system level plans and STP.
                        Verify that development plans and schedules allow meeti1ng
                        training need dates.
                        Validate development process.
                        Verify that quality plans will help ensure quality.

Acquisition          Following the planning update, an SRR is conducted. This
milestone            review, attended by the SPO and using commands and
                     contractor, is conducted to ensure that all players understand the
                     requirements and are ready to proceed.

                       Development Activities

Introduction   Development activities are now beginning as you progress
               through the ISD design phase. These development activities are
               segregated into three main groupings to facilitate various actions
               that must occur. The three groupings are listed below.

                  Topic                                                 Page

         Development Activities Leading to System Design Review (SDR)


Contractor tasks      In the first stage of development activities leading to SDR, the
                      contractor defines the development processes. If a preliminary
                      syllabus was developed earlier, the update or comprehensive
                      syllabus is written now. Along with the comprehensive syllabus,
                      the contractor should:

                         Define interactive courseware (ICW) production standards:
                            Authoring system capability
                            Delivery platform capability

Air Force tasks    The SPO must review all contractor products and design
                   decisions, working with the contractor to effect any required
                   changes. Areas of concern should be elevated. The SPO
                   should:

                      Review and comment on ICW production standards.
                      Review and comment on design formats.
                      Review and comment on Prime Item Development
                      Specifications (PIDS).

                   As in the planning update, and for all development activities, the
                   using command will have SMEs review contractor products,
                   providing comments to the SPO.

                   AETC will review the contractor’s documents for proper
                   incorporation of SRR recommendations and compatibility with
                   user requirements and timeliness. They will then prepare for
                   participation in the SDR.

                   At this point, the system design review is conducted.
milestone


Metrics            During the SDR, the AF will review the contractor’s responses to
                   action items from the SRR and ask questions such as:

                      What is the seriousness of the priority action items?
                      What is contractor timeliness of response to action items?
                      Are the contractor’s updated personnel/skill allocations
                      consistent with the program as defined at SRR?
                      Are updated versions of critical planning documents (such as
                      ISD management plan, quality plan, etc.) consistent with SRR
                      decisions?

                                                                 Continued on next page

Metrics (Continued)      Are course contents planned for each course element and the
                         personnel planned to accomplish it consistently?

                      Note: Ensure consistency with production tracking device,
                      because the levels you establish here will be used as a baseline
                      for tracking future production resource consumption.

                      During the SDR, the AF will also:

                         Verify that the contractor is prepared for the PDR.
                         Verify that the PDR checklist shows that the contractor meets
                         all requirements for PDR. Pay special attention to the system
                         engineering master schedule. For example, how are they
                         doing compared to schedules?


Higher system level By the time of the SDR, the contractor should have accomplished
activities          the following:

                         Close out all prior action items.

                      Note: At this point, the contractor is nearly ready for the
                      courseware CDR. To ensure that everything is in order, the
                      contractor should remember that at the CDR the following should
                      be done:

                         Demonstrate prototype lessons.
                         Baseline prime item development specification (written at
                         course level).
                         Review hardware/software/courseware integration.
                         Nominate members for Curriculum Review Board (CRB).


Air Force tasks       The SPO has a critical task at this point since the CDR
                      represents the final hurdle before entering the ISD development
                      phase. The SPO must now review and approve all contractor
                      products, working with the contractor to effect any required
                      changes. The SPO will:

                        Lesson Outlines/Flow Diagrams

Introduction          Now that you have entered the development phase of ISD, you
                      begin to focus on the development of lessons. In this phase, the
                      contractor will review plans and designs, and will have frequent
                      formal and informal meetings with SMEs, the SPO and using
                      command representatives.


Purpose               The objectives of lesson outlines/flow diagrams are to define
                      scope, content, duration, and schedule of contractor-developed
                      courses.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will:

                         Develop lesson outlines and flow diagrams for each lesson
                         based on course- level PIDS requirements and the course
                         and lesson objectives shown in the syllabus.


Air Force tasks       The SPO will:

                         Review (spot-check) lesson outlines and flow diagrams
                         against PIDS requirements and the course and lesson
                         objectives shown in the syllabus.
                         Arbitrate SME comments.
                         Elevate areas of concern as required to resolve.

                      In addition, SMEs will review all lesson outlines and flow
                      diagrams, elevating areas of concerns as necessary.


Metrics               The Air Force should:

                         Ensure the integrity of the production resource-tracking
                         device used as a tool to evaluate contractor performance
                         throughout the production process.
                         Verify schedule integrity.

                                                                    Continued on next page

Metrics                 Look at number of discrepancies (DR) or revision
(Continued)             recommendation forms for each lesson and the severity of the
                        write-up. Look for trends across production base. Look at
                        volume of SME comments as check of contractor
                        understanding.
                        Review all products for conformance with style and format
                        guide. (Cutting corners? Unauthorized changes?)
                        Ensure that requirements traceability is preserved. Do lesson
                        outlines reflect a comprehensive course design?

                         Lesson Strategy/Lesson Plans

Introduction          Outlines and flow diagrams have been developed. Now the
                      contractor will actually build the lesson strategy and write lesson
                      plans for standup instruction.


Purpose               The purpose of lesson strategy and lesson plan development is
                      to provide the subject matter content, instructional strategies and
                      other supportive information for each lesson. A lesson strategy
                      may be a data item but would normally be incrementally reviewed
                      on-line prior to the critical design review.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will:

                         Develop lesson strategy for ICW lessons (also called "lesson
                         spec").
                         Develop lesson plans (standup instruction).
                         Define CBT level and authoring system features to be
                         exploited for each lesson.
                         Review integration of lessons to courses.

                      Note: CBT development lead-time is critical. Plan for it.


Air Force tasks       The Air Force will review (spot-check) lesson strategies and
                      lesson plans against PIDS requirements and the course and
                      lesson objectives shown in the syllabus.

                      The SMEs will review all instructional strategies and lesson
                      plans, elevating areas of concern to the SPO.

Metrics   The Air Force should track:

                Lesson production status against the production plan
                baseline:
                By lesson
                By course

                Courseware production personnel staffing numbers and
                experience against production plan baseline

                                     Section C
                                    Storyboards

Introduction         As lesson plans are being written, storyboarding is also occurring
                     where required. Storyboards become the visualization of the
                     training sequence. They are the sketches and narration notes of
                     this visual process. The ultimate goal is to facilitate learning with
                     student participation and individualized instruction.


Purpose              Storyboards provide a blueprint for the production of interactive
                     courseware. This includes scripting information and visual
                     representatives of the materials to be presented. Storyboards
                     also provide information and directions for the programmer and
                     the instructional designer necessary for coding.


Contractor design    The contractor will develop storyboards and integrate courses to
tasks                each other and to the total training system.


Air Force tasks      The Air Force will spot-check storyboards and lesson integration
                     against PIDS requirements and the course and lesson objectives
                     shown in the syllabus. SMEs will review all storyboards,
                     elevating areas of concern.

                        Coding, Programming, Writing

Introduction        The ISD development phase is the stage where instructional
                    materials are actually created. Some work in this area may have
                    been started earlier but efforts will now be intensified. At this
                    point, you may be coding, programming, or writing, depending on
                    the scope of the training being developed.


Purpose             The purpose of this stage is to create all audiovisual and other
                    necessary instructional materials. Additionally, mission
                    scenarios and student/instructor lesson guides are produced.


Contractor tasks    Depending on the contract, the contractor will:

                        Write lesson guides for instructors and students.
                        Create all other instructional materials.
                        Create mission scenarios.
                        Code and debug.
                        Prepare for lesson-level tests (individual tryouts).


Air Force tasks     The Air Force will review instructional materials and mission
                    scenarios. SMEs will review all lesson guides and instructional
                    materials.


Higher system level The Air Force will correlate traditional courseware development
activities          with courseware to be embedded within other training devices;
                    for example, mission scenarios incorporated within weapon
                    system trainers.

                    Note: Incremental development of PDRs, CDRs, SGTOs, and
                    CRRs will occur throughout this stage at the direction of the SPO.

                                 Section E
                       Lesson Tests (Individual Tryouts)

Introduction          As lessons are completed, tests must be conducted to validate
                      the lessons. These tests will be conducted on an individual
                      basis as well as in small groups. This section will cover
                      individual tryouts (ITO).


Purpose               The purpose of testing is to validate the lessons and courses and
                      to allow adjustments and improvements to be made before full-
                      scale implementation. By using ITOs, the contractor can collect
                      and analyze performance data from representative students to
                      identify major errors in all of the courseware.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will:

                         Test all lessons (in accordance with courseware test plan).
                         Select/provide surrogate students.
                         Evaluate lessons from the SMEs’ perspective, ensuring
                         proper lesson content.
                         Collect/analyze data.
                         Analyze and fix discrepancies.


Air Force tasks       Before the ITOs began, the SPO approved the questionnaire and
                      comment forms. During the test, the SPO has been an active
                      observer, especially through the SMEs. As the tests are
                      ongoing, the SPO will conduct spot checks of actual instruction
                      and data generated by the tests. Upon completion of the tests,
                      the SPO will review the data and select any issues that are
                      appropriate for resolution. Issues need to be addressed by the
                      entire team at a resolution meeting.

                      The using commands are very active in this stage. They will:

                         Provide students for the tests.
                         Monitor contractor conduct of tests (through SMEs).
                         Conduct check of all data generated by tests.
                         Review data to identify issues for resolution.

                                                                   Continued on next page

Air Force tasks   AETC may participate in the ITOs as both observers and
(Continued)       students. They will compare the planned lessons and course
                  with the actual performance and will prepare an appropriate
                  report listing comments, issues, and concerns for resolution.


Metrics           The Air Force should ask questions and make comparisons such
                  as the following:

                     Does the contractor intend to test all of the lesson production
                     (ITOs)?
                        If less:
                             Why?
                             Is sample viable?
                        Are courses selected representative?

                     What is the number and severity of test discrepancies
                     identified?
                     Compare actual course length (from tryouts) against planned
                     course length (may imply a major rewrite). Remember that
                     training objectives should determine course length.
                     Track training discrepancy (TD) correction rate.
                         How fast does contractor correct errors?
                         Will corrections be incorporated in time for small-group
                         tryout?
                         Is contractor using resources effectively?
                         Are personnel required for correction consistent with
                         personnel plan?

                     Are incremental tests running in accordance with formative
                     evaluation plan?

                         Course-Level Integration Tests

Introduction          Course-level integration tests are conducted between ITOs and
                      Small-Group Tryouts (SGTOs). Actual media and equipment are
                      used so that any discrepancies noted can be fixed before
                      continuing into the next stage.


Purpose               The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the courseware is
                      ready for the SGTO, and that it has been integrated so that all
                      components fit together logically and effectively.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will:
                         Provide government with surrogate student requirements.
                         Use questionnaires and comment forms.
                         Perform test against PIDS.
                         Perform test from a student perspective.
                         Focus on integration across lessons.
                         Use actual (final) delivery media if available; make-do work-
                         arounds may be used if necessary.
                         Collect/analyze data and discrepancies.
                         Document test results.
                         Analyze and fix discrepancies.


Air Force tasks       The Air Force will:
                         Review comment forms and questionnaires developed to
                         support integration tests.
                         Review test resources, schedules, and test support plans;
                         ensure integrity of test activity. Ensure availability of
                         surrogate students.
                         Review (spot-check) data generated by test.

                      The using command will provide students for course level
                      integration tests. The SMEs will:
                          Monitor contractor conduct of tests and comment as
                          necessary.
                          Check data generated by tests.
                          Review data to identify issues for resolution.

                   tests performed, corrections should have been made to the
                   lessons and other applicable courseware. SGTOs will now be
                   conducted to test the courseware on a larger scale.


Purpose            SGTOs are conducted to collect data from a more realistic
                   sample of the actual student population. These students will be
                   from the target audience and will use actual equipment, identical
                   environment and other parameters that will be found in the full-
                   scale course. This data will be used to make additional
                   modifications as necessary before the large-group tryout.


Contractor tasks   The contractor will:

                          Use questionnaires and comment forms.
                          Integrate production HW/SW media.
                          Conduct test using actual, final lesson materials, and all
                          other supporting media (or work-arounds) required to
                          make the course "whole."
                          Perform SGTO.
                          Verify system function from the student’s viewpoint.

                          Collect/analyze data and discrepancies.
                          Document test results.
                          Analyze course run time and student performance.
                          Analyze and fix discrepancies.


Air Force tasks    The Air Force will:

                      Review and approve comment forms and questionnaires
                      developed to support SGTOs.
                      Review test resources, schedules, and test support plans.
                      Ensure integrity of test activity.

                        Iterative Remedy and Retest

Introduction       Now that incremental tests have been conducted and test results
                   data have been analyzed, corrections must be made to the
                   lessons and courses as required. As with all previous actions,
                   this is a team process involving the contractor, SPO and using
                   commands. This is a critical stage as this is the final step before
                   the final course readiness review (CRR).


Purpose            The purpose is to identify and remedy all discrepancies and
                   retest before getting approval to proceed to implementation.


Contractor tasks   Using data from the ITOs and SGTOs and guidance from the
                   SPO, the contractor will:

                      Conduct a resolution meeting consisting of contractors and
                      Air Force SGTO observers to fix discrepancies.
                      Submit any discrepancies not received at resolution meeting
                      to the Curriculum Review Board (CRB) for approval.
                      Fix discrepancies.
                      Repeat SGTO as necessary.
                      Provide data to support Functional Configuration Audit (FCA).
                      Support conduct of FCA.
                      Finalize all draft data item submissions.
                      Provide final site implementation.


Air Force tasks    The SPO is now at the final approval stages of ISD development.
                   But before implementation can begin, the following must be
                   done.

                      SMEs verify that all courseware materials are ready for
                      training.
                          At conclusion of SGTO retest, program office and user
                          review contractor remedies for all discrepancies. The
                          SPO arbitrates SME comments.

                      Elevate issues of concern as required to ensure resolution.

                                                                 Continued on next page

Air Force tasks         Conduct FCA and CRR.
(Continued)               Verify that courses meet PIDS.
                          Verify that PIDS:
                             Are performed on-site.
                             Use real students.
                             Use full classes.
                             Have all relevant media work-arounds in place.

                             Verify that FCA is held open until all discrepancies have
                             been corrected and approved by the SPO.

                        The SPO, SMEs, and users review and approve the
                        functional configuration audit.

                     While the SMEs are taking various actions, as members of the
                     government team, as specified above, their primary role is to
                     verify that all courseware materials are ready for training.

                     AETC will verify that lessons and courses are ready for
                     implementation and that:

                        Technical data are available, current and incorporated into
                        the material.
                        Course content reflects actual defense system.
                        User needs are met.


Metrics              Before the CRR, the Air Force will verify the following:

                        Are requirements to complete CRR reflected in CRR
                        checklist?
                        Do CRR checklists meet SEMS criteria?
                        Are any test discrepancies still outstanding? (All should be
                        cleared prior to the CRR.)


Acquisition          The CRR is conducted following completion of the above tasks.

                                  Overview


Introduction    This is the reason you began the ISD process in the first place to
                conduct instruction. You have developed and validated an
                instructional system, have developed and validated lessons and
                courses, and now it is time to become operational. This chapter
                covers the system functions and planning required to implement
                instruction.

                Note: Seasoned carpenters say "Measure twice, cut once."
                Learn from that and do a double check to make sure system
                functions are in place, working and ready (see System Functions,
                page 10). Ensure that all previous planning has been completed.
                It will be time well spent.


Purpose         The purpose of this chapter is to explain the major events that
                must occur to help ensure successful implementation.

                                 Section A
                     Site Training Readiness Review

Introduction       After all CRRs for a training site have been completed, a site
                   training readiness review (STRR) [also called Site Readiness
                   Review (SRR) or on-site review] will be conducted.


Purpose            This review is conducted at each site to confirm that the site is
                   ready to conduct training.


Contractor tasks   The contractor will support the STRR by showing that the desired
                   objectives and standards have been achieved. The contractor
                   will:

                      Collect data supporting summative evaluation.
                      Document results in test report.
                      Provide data to support STRR.


Air Force tasks    The SPO will approve the STRR based on success criteria and
                   checklists, and participate in contractor’s status briefings. In
                   addition, the SPO will conduct the STRR if in a non-guaranteed
                   student program.

                   The using command will provide support as required.

                   AETC will participate in on-site reviews and ensure that the site
                   is ready for training, reviewing items such as:

                      Facilities (training and support)
                      Training equipment
                      Courseware
                      Instructors

                   AETC will ensure that all are in place and ready, or that suitable,
                   temporary work-arounds are developed.

                   Implementation of System Functions

Introduction       Earlier, you learned that the system functions must be in place
                   before a training system can operate. You also learned that
                   there were four basic system functions:

                      Management
                      Support
                      Administration
                      Delivery

                   These functions are critical to the instructional system
                   implementation process. This process will operate effectively
                   and efficiently only if these functions are in place and in use.


Purpose            The purpose of the system functions is to support the
                   instructional infrastructure.

                             Management Function


What it is      Management is considered to be the practice of directing or
                controlling all aspects of the instructional system. These
                activities are an integral part of conducting instruction. A system
                cannot be properly implemented without the system management
                function in place.


Who is          Each level within the instructional activity has various
responsible?    management responsibilities depending on the activity or
                program.

                Example: A program or project manager may have overall
                management responsibility, while an instructor may have
                management responsibility more focused on the teaching or
                learning activity.


Categories of   Management activities required to support implementation of an
management      instructional system can be categorized into five areas, as shown
activities      below.

                               Support Function


What it is        Support may be defined as the maintainer of the system. This
                  includes long-range planning, as well as day-to-day activities.

                  Like the other systems functions, support is a vital component of
                  the ISD system team.


Example           Support can include:

                     Providing student services
                     Maintaining equipment
                     Providing spare parts
                     Maintaining courseware


Who is            Management has overall responsibility for support, but various
responsible?      activities have different responsibilities. Examples are:

                     Acquisition – acquires equipment
                     Logistics – maintains and supports

                         Administration Function


What it is     Administration is the function that is concerned with the day-to-
               day tasks of operating an instructional system. Administration is
               a form of management or supervision that absorbs tasks not
               clearly appropriate elsewhere. Administration contributes
               significantly to the overall effectiveness of the instructional
               system. In fact, every phase of ISD is affected by administration.


Example        Systems administration can include:

                  Maintaining documentation
                  Processing reports
                  Filing data


Who is         All activities get involved in administration. Key offices include:

                  Registrar section
                  Instructor staff
                  Clerical staff

                                    Delivery Function


What it is            Delivery is the means used to provide instruction to students.


Examples of           Examples of system delivery methods include:

                         Workbooks
                         Simulators


Who is                All activities directly involved in the instructional system have
responsible?          responsibilities such as the following.

                         The training manager in system acquisition ensures that
                         adequate planning has been done before selecting the
                         delivery method.
                         Instructional designers select the most appropriate delivery
                         method and report to management.

                              Full-Class Tryouts

Introduction       Full-Class Tryouts (also called Large-Group Tryouts) are
                   conducted to complete one final test before the training system is
                   considered fully implemented. This tryout is conducted on-site in
                   the real environment, using real students, full classes and all
                   required media.


Purpose            The purpose is to fully test the training system, identifying
                   discrepancies and remedying as necessary. It also validates the
                   training system’s capability to accommodate incremental and
                   systematic integration of all components of a training system
                   without degradation to system performance and training
                   effectiveness.


Contractor tasks   The contractor will conduct the tryout in a guaranteed student
                   program. The contractor will support the Air Force in a non-
                   guaranteed student program. The contractor will also collect
                   data supporting summative evaluation and document results in a
                   test report.


Air Force tasks    The Air Force will:

                      Approve tryouts based on success criteria and checklists.
                      Conduct tryouts in non-guaranteed student program.
                      Support tryouts if contractor conducts.

                      Mature System Performance Review

Introduction          After the system has been operational and functional for a period
                      for time, it will be continually evaluated. At a certain point in its
                      operation, however, a mature system performance review will be
                      conducted. It will be conducted on-site in a real environment,
                      using full classes of real students.


Purpose               The purpose of this review is to see if the system is performing
                      as designed and expected and to identify any modifications
                      needed.


Contractor tasks      The contractor will conduct or support the review, depending on
                      the contract. The contractor will also collect data supporting
                      summative evaluation, documenting any changes required and
                      test results.


Air Force tasks       The using command will conduct or support operational
                      evaluation throughout the life cycle of the system.

                              EVALUATION
Overview
Introduction    Evaluation occurs throughout the ISD process. Once instruction
                has been conducted, the Air Force will be specifically concerned
                with determining how well the training is achieving its objectives.
                Evaluation is the feedback that helps ensure that training
                objectives are achieved and the quality of graduates’
                performance is acceptable. The process continuously evaluates
                the course to determine if it is operating as designed. For
                example, six months after students graduate, are they still able to
                meet job performance requirements? If not, why not? Is it
                because of shortfalls in the course? Should changes in the
                course be undertaken? These are the kinds of questions you
                must ask and reviews you must make to ensure that the training
                that was developed is effective and efficient. You have already
                begun evaluation as you started with formative evaluation at the
                beginning of planning with development of the evaluation plan.
                Now you must do more.


Purpose         The purpose of this chapter is to describe the evaluation process
                that is used to continually evaluate the effectiveness and
                efficiency of training.

ISD phase        As you can see in Figure 18, evaluation has the most emphasis.
                 It is conducted throughout the ISD process, with each ISD phase
                 being involved with evaluation.

                                 Section A
                             Formative Evaluation

Introduction        Evaluation occurs throughout the ISD process, but formative
                    evaluation occurs during development, production, and test
                    activities. It is the period from the beginning of planning to
                    course readiness review or validation of materials. Formative
                    evaluation should be part of the T&E plan, which was developed
                    earlier.


Purpose             The purpose of formative evaluation is to evaluate lesson/course
                    development during the "formative" stages and allow for
                    corrections (remedies) to be made before training is fully
                    implemented.


What is included?   As part of the T&E plan, formative evaluation is conducted during
                    development, ITO, and SGTO. It is not a process in itself, but a
                    series of events that are all part of formative evaluation. The
                    data collected is used to make lesson/course corrections and is
                    provided to the SPO for their review and action as necessary.


Air Force tasks     The SPO reviews data and provides guidance as requested.


Additional          Formative evaluation includes acceptance testing of equipment
information         and software, performance verification of system components,
                    formative evaluation of courseware, and training system
                    development.

                    The courseware formative evaluation plan is outlined in the
                    system test plan. The results of formative evaluation are
                    reviewed in the CRR.
AFH 36-2235     VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2002                                        141


                                Section B
                            Summative Evaluation

Introduction        Summative evaluation begins at the Courseware Readiness
                    Review (CRR), overlaps the formative evaluation phase, and
                    terminates at the Training System Readiness Review (TSRR).

                    Summative evaluation assesses the training system in the
                    operational environment to validate the baseline established
                    earlier. It will check for full system integration.


Purpose             The primary purpose of summative evaluation is to determine
                    whether the training developed for the students is effective and
                    efficient. It is the process of collecting data from students,
                    instructors, and other key evaluation interfaces as they use
                    instructional media in the actual training environment. Its
                    purpose is also to identify instructional materials, training media
                    or instructional management system components that result in
                    poor learning, inefficiency, or poor student acceptance. This
                    data will then drive improvements.

                    Summative evaluation answers questions such as:

                       How well has the training been accomplished as reflected by
                       operational requirements?
                       Do graduates of a course meet established training system
                       and operational performance standards?
                       Are the training system performance standards correct?
                       How can the training be better accomplished?


What is included?   Summative evaluation is a form of quality improvement that
                    evaluates the "summed" effect of the total training program. It
                    should begin at CRR/validation and go through TSRR. In the
                    acquisition business, this is both internal and external.

Internal evaluation   Internal evaluation determines the adequacy of each component
                      of the training program such as instruction, materials, equipment,
                      and facilities. It is conducted within the instructional system or
                      "schoolhouse." It determines how well each component
                      contributes to the production of quality graduates. Internal
                      evaluation for a contractor-operated training system is usually
                      conducted by the contractor and reviewed/approved by the SPO
                      and/or using command.


External evaluation   External evaluation determines how well graduates are meeting
                      job performance requirements – the reason for training them in
                      the first place. In external evaluation, the contractor will assess
                      the degree to which skills obtained during the course are
                      generalized effectively to the operational unit environment.
                      External evaluation utilizes information from the field, such as
                      feedback from supervisors of graduates. The SPO and/or using
                      command will review/approve results of external evaluations.


How to conduct        Internal evaluations can be conducted by reviewing:

                           Operational Evaluation

Introduction       Operational evaluation is the continuation of evaluation
                   throughout the life of the fully operational training system.
                   Operational evaluation occurs on a system regardless of whether
                   it is contractor- or Air Force-operated. The operational
                   evaluation is similar to summative evaluation except it is
                   continuous and reflects long-term operational data.


Purpose            The purpose of operational evaluation is to provide real-time
                   data for use in reviews, updates and quality improvement of
                   training systems. It is continuous improvement.


Who conducts?      The training source and the contract determine who conducts the
                   operational evaluation. The best way to do this is to use the
                   following table.

                                    Then

What is included?   Operational evaluation is a continuation of the procedures and
                    data collection begun in summative evaluation. It usually starts
                    at the TSRR and lasts throughout the life cycle of the program.
                    The emphasis shifts from establishing the instructional value of
                    the courses to detecting flaws or deterioration. The prime goal is
                    to maintain and improve course quality throughout the life cycle.
                    The following issues should be addressed in operational
                    evaluation:

                       Measurement and assessment of student learning in
                       comparison to established training requirements and
                       objectives
                       Measurement of terminal objectives (qualification/certification)
                       Identification and resolution of discrepancies and deficiencies
                       in courseware
                       Assessment of training in light of modification/upgrades in the
                       defense system


How is it           Operational evaluation is conducted by both internal and external
conducted?          means.

                    Internal evaluation can be conducted by reviewing:

                       Course documents
                       Resources
                       Instructional facilities
                       Instructor performance
                       Measurement programs
                       Other sources as necessary

                    External evaluations can be conducted by using:

                       Questionnaires

                          For graduates
                          For supervisors

              AIR FORCE-DEVELOPED MAINTENANCE TRAINING
                                     Overview


Introduction        This chapter is for the individual who has been charged with
                    managing or being on a team responsible for applying ISD to Air
                    Force-developed maintenance training concurrently with defense
                    system acquisition. This application would normally take place
                    during the early acquisition cycles of a new defense system, but
                    could occur late in the cycle or even after the system has been
                    fielded. Regardless of when your involvement begins, this
                    chapter will help ensure that you do the right thing at the right
                    time.


Description         Maintenance training is performance- or knowledge-based
                    training for people who will maintain defense systems. The term
                    defense system is all-encompassing. A defense system is not
                    limited to aircraft, bombs, guns or missiles, but can include
                    anything needed to support the mission. For example, radars,
                    computers, trucks and engines can be considered part of these
                    systems.


Where to read       This chapter contains two sections. The first section explains the
about it            major functions in applying ISD to Air Force-developed
                    maintenance training. Section B provides an explanation of a
                    15-step ISD process used in maintenance training.

                    Note: This chapter is primarily applicable to maintenance
                    training. However, it contains several management tools that can
                    assist you in various ISD tasks, no matter what your involvement
                    or function. Use and adapt as you desire.

                      Major Functions in Applying ISD to
                  Air Force-Developed Maintenance Training

Introduction          The major functions of applying ISD concurrently with acquisition
                      are general in nature and cover the normal management-type
                      areas. This section has been written as if you are to be a team
                      chief or project manager of a portion of the ISD team. Modify the
                      guidance provided to best suit your needs.


Critical              There are many functions that determine the level of success.
Factors               These include the following topics:

                         Planning
                            Scheduling
                            Collecting/reviewing data

                         Building work teams
                         Training
                         Managing workloads
                         Conducting meetings
                         Timeliness
                         Quality


Planning              Planning for training development is one of the most important
                      activities required for successful program management. Proper
                      planning requires you to make time on your calendar for this
                      critical item. Planning includes anything needed for successful
                      completion of the project.
                                     Make time on your calendar.



Planning activities   Some key planning activities are:

                         Scheduling
                         Collecting and reviewing data
AFH 36-2235        VOLUME 3            1 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                       147




Scheduling            Scheduling is the process of defining what needs to be done and
                      when it must be done to facilitate the smooth progression of work
                      leading to project completion. Several tools are available to
                      assist you. The ones you select will depend on your needs.


Scheduling tools      Some scheduling tools include Gantt charts and PERT charts.
                      Examples are shown in Figures 19 and 20, respectively.


Gantt charts          Gantt charts are an organizing tool to visually indicate resources
                      and activities with a designated time frame. They are used to
                      compare planned completion dates with actual performance.
                      These charts consist of a list of tasks to be accomplished and the
                      time allowed for each. Some tasks are sequential and some are
                      overlapping. A Gantt chart contains:

                         Horizontal time scale that depicts the length of the project
                         Vertical axis with list of all activities involved in the project
                         Horizontal bar indicating duration of each activity

PERT charts      PERT charts also show key data but include dependencies of
                 activities. They can help determine critical events and dates,
                 and help decide where resources can be better utilized and
                 where management attention is most needed. A PERT chart
                 contains:

                    Box for each sequentially arranged activity required to
                    complete the project
                    Depiction of input-output contingencies among activities

Collecting and   Collecting and analyzing data occurs during the life of the
analyzing data   acquisition, beginning at concept exploration. Data can be
                 anything from blueprints to performance characteristics to
                 various training reports. The SPO Program Manager (PM),
                 through the Data Maintenance Office (DMO), is responsible for
                 acquiring the contractor data necessary to manage all aspects of
                 the program. The data collection and analysis process is
                 depicted in Figure 21.

                               Data Process


Data examples   Some examples of data include:

                   Program schedules
                   Training and Training Equipment Plan (TTEP)
                   Training support data
                   Course critiques
                   ISD management plan

                Note: Do not request or accept data unless you have a valid
                need. Data is expensive, more so when it is unnecessary. See
                Discussion on MIL-HDBK-29612 on Page 52.


Building work   Once you have developed a schedule and begun to collect and
teams           analyze data, you will have a better understanding of the type of
                staff members you will need to pull onto your team. Do this very
                carefully. Success depends on teamwork and dedication to the
                project. There are limitless numbers of books on team building
                and leadership secrets to success; but there are no short cuts.
                Check the books, review your leadership and management
                course materials, and talk to your network of trusted bosses and
                former bosses, as well as successful peers. Learn from them.
                Team members may come from unit resources or from TDY
                locations.


Training        Never assume that your team knows all there is to know. If they
                have worked on ISD projects before, and have been successful,
                then you can assume that they know what needs to be done.
                What you must do is set the work and training standards up front.
                Explain the project to the team and establish your rules of order.
                Survey the team and develop appropriate training. It may be
                something as simple as telephone etiquette to something as
                complex as preparing a wiring diagram of electrical components
                in a widget. The goal of ISD is to produce training and increase
                skills and knowledge, but you should do it for your team first and
                not neglect your own training.

Managing         If you’ve been a manager for any length of time, you have heard
workloads        that the best way to manage workloads is to "delegate." But
                 delegation alone does not foster success. You must know what
                 and to whom to delegate. You must follow up, and know when to
                 follow up. No one ever admits to having extra personnel that
                 they want to give you to help out. So you must use your staff to
                 manage as necessary. Use the computer or manual systems for
                 tracking.


Conducting       "Everyone hates meetings." Not true! Everyone hates non-
meetings         productive, worthless meetings. Make sure yours are productive.
                 Don’t have a meeting for the sake of a meeting. Have an
                 agenda, stick to it, take notes, publish minutes and follow up.
                 Expect the same of your staff. Meetings are for communication,
                 but they also keep the team informed and on the right track.


Timeliness       "The early bird gets the worm." Maybe, but earlier you built a
                 schedule. If you built it right, stick to it and deliver as promised.
                 If there is a legitimate reason for slippage in the schedule, inform
                 your superiors. They would rather have an honest person who
                 wants to build and deliver a quality product with a schedule delay
                 than an inferior product on time.


Quality          "If you don’t have time to do it right the first time, when will you
                 have time to fix it?" Quality and timeliness go hand-in-hand and
                 cannot be overemphasized. Your team should focus on quality
                 and continuous improvement.

                         ISD Process Applied to
               Maintenance Training Acquisition Environment

Introduction        If you read AFMAN 36-2234, you learned that the original ISD
                    model was considered to be a five-step process, even though the
                    "steps" were not intended to be followed in a typical "step-by-
                    step" process but in phases. The revised model has phases that
                    should be done in a continuous process, not step-by-step. You
                    learned earlier that ISD is a never-ending process. You will learn
                    through practical experience that in your particular operation or
                    program, modification of the phases may facilitate application of
                    ISD. If this helps ensure a quality product that meets the user’s
                    training objectives, then do it.

                    The following example is a synopsis of a 15-step ISD process
                    provided for your information and use as appropriate. This 15-
                    step process was designed to fit the peculiarities and limitations
                    of the AF-developed maintenance training acquisition
                    environment. It is taken from the procedures used by the 374
                    Training Development Squadron (TDS) of Air Education and
                    Training Command (AETC) as they apply ISD to new or
                    significantly modified defense systems. The ISD phases with the
                    15-step process are listed below. Note: This is only an
                    example of one organization’s application of ISD.

Applications      The maintenance training system (or portions) for most major Air
                  Force defense systems has been developed using these
                  procedures. Examples include:

                     B-1B
                     B-2
                     C-17

Other uses           By modifying the 15-step process (deleting or changing steps),
                     these procedures have been successfully applied to operator

Background           As you learned earlier, the acquisition ISD process actually
                     begins when HQ USAF issues a PMD to the major commands.
                     This document directs the SPO to begin system acquisition. The
                     SPO then develops a PMP, which outlines responsibilities and
                     general management objectives. HQ AETC provides inputs to
                     Section II, Training, of the PMP. Part of AETC’s responsibility, in
                     support of a new defense system, is test participation. The
                     Director of Technical Training Operations makes the assignment
                     of a Responsible Agency (RA), HQ AETC/TTO (example, the 374
                     TDS was the RA for the B-1 program).


374 TDS              The 374 TDS, Plans and Evaluation branch, submits a proposed
participation plan   Participation Plan (PP) to HQ AETC/TTO. The PP shows how the
                     374 TDS proposes to manage ISD and test activities.

                                                                    Continued on next page

                                     or the Responsible Test Organization (RTO). HQ
                                     AETC then approves required personnel
                                     authorizations (identified in the PP) for the 374
                                     TDS. Personnel for these authorizations may be
                                     drawn from the prime center, using command, or
                                     others as directed by the Field Training Group
                                     (FLDTG).


ISD team                The 374 TDS begins the ISD effort by organizing an ISD team.
organization            Whenever possible, a senior NCO experienced in squadron and
                        test management procedures is assigned as Acquisition Training
                        Development Manager (ATDM). The ATDM leads the ISD team.
                        This person is responsible for meeting the objectives outlined in
                        the PP. The ATDM also ensures that the ISD team is trained in
                        the 15-step ISD process for acquisition and is familiar with
                        AFMAN 36-2234, AFH 36-2235, and AFI 36-2201. When
                        trained, the ISD team begins compiling data on system
                        maintenance requirements. Once the data are collected, the ISD
                        team begins the analysis.

TRRRM          The results of the ISD analysis [training and Technical Training
               Material (TTM) requirements] are then reviewed by participating
               agencies in a Training Requirements Recommendation Review
               Meeting (TRRRM). The TRRRM is designed to review, consoli-
               date, and coordinate AETC TTM recommendations. It is also
               used to review proposed Course Control Documents (CCDs)
               prior to further action.


TRRRM          Participants in the TRRRM, other than 374 TDS, may include the
participants   HQ AETC Training Staff Officer (TSO), HQ AETC Training
               Equipment Resources Manager, Field Training Group, Training
               Support Squadron, prime center Plans and Resources
               personnel, and associate center Plans and Resources
               personnel.


TRRRM          The result of the TRRRM is a consolidated package of
results        recommended TTM/CCDs. The package is reviewed by the
               Program Office (PO) (for funding and procurement action), who
               develops system specifications for each hardware training
               device. Specifications are then reviewed by HQ AETC and
               placed on contract by the PO.


Purpose        The purpose of allowing AETC personnel to review these
               specifications (before contracting) is to ensure that the TTM
               satisfies objectives identified during analysis. Subject matter
               specialists (SMS) may also participate in design reviews to
               ensure that required characteristics, as well as changes, are
               incorporated. Changes for training hardware after the TRRRM
               may require modification to the contract. Transition of SMSs to
               the first training site is scheduled to support operational
               requirements. SMSs become the nucleus of the initial instructor
               cadre. Procured TTM is delivered, installed, and operationally
               checked at the training site by contractors. When all resources
               are in place, the final ISD step can begin. By actively seeking
               system information during the early phases of System Acquisi-
               tion/Test and Evaluation and applying ISD, AETC can provide
               the PO with appropriate TTM requirements.

Purpose           The purpose of this chapter is to give general guidance for
                  contractor-developed ICW.


AFH 36-2235,      This USAF Handbook provides information and guidance for
Volume 5A         applying current instructional technology and the ISD process as
                  described in AFMAN 36-2234. It is useful in helping to decide
                  when to use ICW and provides many guidelines and decision
                  aids.


MIL-HDBK-         This handbook (MIL-HDBK-284-1) describes all phases of ICW
284-1             analysis, design, development, implementation, and logistic and
                  life cycle support. This handbook is intended to be used in
                  conjunction with MIL-HDBK-29612, Military Training Programs.


MIL-HDBK-         Also to be used with MIL-HDBK-29612, this handbook (MIL-
284-2             HDBK-284-2) can help ICW device manufacturers, developers,
                  and users implement the mandatory software interface and
                  command requirements for ICW and authoring systems.
                  Information and guidance is provided for:

                    handbooks. Key terms used in MIL-HDBK-29612 are repeated in
                    this handbook to provide a single comprehensive glossary of
                    terms and definitions related to military training and interactive
                    courseware.


Tailoring           Detailed information on the process for acquiring ICW should be
                    tailored to agree with your acquisition strategy. This tailoring
                    should include deliverable data requirements.

                  reasonably map to one or more of the Volume 3 sub-tasks.

                  Over 80% of all MIL-HDBK-29612 sub-tasks correlate with sub-
                  tasks of the Volume 3 activity blocks. However, 40% of the
                  Volume 3 sub-tasks have no MIL-HDBK-29612 coverage at all.

                  The chart also illustrates that the Volume 3 process groups
                  common sub-tasks differently than the MIL-HDBK-29612
                  process. While some Volume 3 activities map fairly cleanly to
                  MIL-HDBK-29612 tasks on a one-to-one basis (Activity Block 23
                  to Task 301, for example), other Activity Blocks map to as many
                  as seven major tasks in MIL-HDBK-29612.

                           Lessons Learned

Introduction   As you progress through the ISD process in acquiring training
               with the acquisition of defense systems, you will ask yourself:
               "How can I prevent a mistake?" or "Just what do I look for?" or
               "Do I really have to coordinate this change?" The following
               lessons learned examples were extracted from actual successes
               and not-so-successful experiences in past Air Force programs.
               They are provided not only for your information, but also to serve
               as an introduction to the Air Force Materiel Command Lessons
               Learned Program. This "Program" is a database of information
               located at the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC)
               Headquarters at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. This floppy disk
               and hard copy data bank can pay immeasurable dividends if
               used properly. Call AFMC at DSN 785-3454, Commercial
               513/255-3454, or write:

Examples       The following are examples of lessons learned:
                  The F-100 jet engine (used on the F-15 and F-16) was not
                  available for training until eight years after deployment. As a
                  result, efficient and effective maintenance was not available.
                  (Source: AFSC/HSD.)

                  Operational E-3As were used as trainers because no trainers
                  were initially purchased with the weapon system. In addition,
                  built-in test (BIT) was eliminated without evaluating its impact
                  on training. These two decisions resulted in costly corrective
                  actions. In the interim, the Air Force paid $3 million a year for
                  contract training. Had they bought the trainer on time they
                  could have saved $9 million. (Source: Tech Report ADB099-
                  970. April 1981, Logistics Mgmt. Inst.; also MANPRINT
                  Bulletin Sep/Oct 88.)

                  The F100-AW-220-equipped F-15 aircraft at Eglin AFB in
                  August 1988 were a success story. They had 100%
                  serviceable spares, no holes, and plenty of combat-ready

                    1986, the 33rd TFW received their 59th aircraft in May 1988.

                    Throughout the 36,000-plus hours flown since that time,
                    reliability and maintainability parameters remained at
                    unprecedented high levels. The engine operated so well that
                    maintaining skill proficiency levels became a problem similar
                    to the "Maytag repairman" story. Since the engine seldom
                    broke, there was little chance to work on it. Much of this
                    success story was attributed to the overall strategy of strong
                    user involvement during ASD field visits to finalize the
                    technical data requirements and maintenance concept to
                    starting production engine deliveries. (Source: AFSC/ASD-
                    AL, AL Staff Digest, Aug 88.)

                    The GLCM program had a number of MPT-related problems:
                       A training system designed for 340 students per year that
                       had to train 1400 troops per year
                       Inadequate field survival training
                       Other training-related problems
                       (Source: AFSC/ASD Paper, Nov 88.)

                    Changing scenarios for the A-10 deployment location from
                    one base to two bases required an additional 165 personnel
                    slots. This requirement, however, was not coordinated early
                    enough to have trained people available for the first two
                    overseas deployment exercises. (Source: MANPRINT

        374 Training Development Squadron 15-Step ISD Process

Introduction     Before you start, it’s important to understand the structure of the
                 Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Each AFSC is considered to
                 be a job. Each job is completed by performing related duties;
                 each duty is completed by performing a given number of tasks;
                 each task is completed by performing a sequence of activities;
                 and each activity is completed by applying skill and knowledge
                 behaviors. By approaching acquisition training development in
                 this manner and using the right analysis parameters, accurate
                 and cost-effective training/TTM can be determined. Also note
                 that results of analysis performed using this handbook may be
                 documented by either completing forms you develop or using
                 forms developed by the 374 TDS and provided at the end of this
                 attachment. While these forms are not mandatory, they are
                 provided because they have been successfully used for these
                 procedures. You may also document data by using the ISD
                 Automation software (IBM-compatible) titled "ISDA" available
                 from the 374 TDS (for address, see page 259).

                        document the data become classified. Always check
                         with the Program Security Officer for instructions
                             concerning storage and disposition of media.

                              STEP 1
                  IDENTIFY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


Substep 1         Identify Duties


Purpose           The purpose of this substep is to identify and compile a list of
                  duty statements associated with an AFSC as related to the
                  weapon system. A list of duty statements can be assembled by
                  referring to the “Specialty Summary” and “Duties and
                  Responsibilities” sections of AFR 39-1, Occupational Survey
                  Reports (OSRs), applicable specialty training standards, and
                  contractor data. Duty statements are created from two parts of
                  speech, a verb and an object. The verb and the object describe
                  the duty in a broad sense.


Example           For example, one of the duties of an avionics technician might be
                  to “Maintain the J-4 Compass System.” In this example, the verb
                  and the object don’t tell how (remove, replace) or what (flux
                  valve, main amplifier) to maintain. Together they simply tell
                  technicians that they are required to keep an aircraft system in
                  working order. Don’t hesitate to assume that some duties are re-
                  quired even if they’re not stated in available data sources. Use
                  your experience as well as the experience of other SMSs.
                  However, be sure to document all assumptions as such. You
                  may document your data in any format you desire; just document
                  it.


Verification      Once the list of duty statements is complete, have it verified by
                  applicable agencies such as the using command and test force
                  technicians. After verification, a periodic review/reevaluation
                  should be accomplished to ensure accuracy. As the system
                  matures, new information becomes available.


Substep 2         Gather Data
                                         AFH 36-2235 VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2002




Purpose              The purpose of this substep is to gather all data pertaining to a
                     given AFSC which, in turn, is related to a given weapon system.
                     This data will eventually be used to help structure a complete
                     task list. The complete task list is used to identify and define
                     potential training requirements.


Limit your           The database should be limited to data relating to entries
database             identified in the duties list (developed in the first substep). For
                     example, while performing ISD for an avionics system of an
                     aircraft, data related to the engine isn’t considered unless these
                     systems interact with one another.


Additional sources   Many “new” or “advanced” systems are actually the next
                     generation of existing equipment. Similarities may exist in opera-
                     tor/maintenance functions and performance requirements. Data
                     obtained from similar systems can be used to project new job
                     performance requirements.


Examples             Data can be collected from:

                        User-defined operational concepts
                        User-defined maintenance concepts
                        PDRs
                        CDRs
                        LSA
                        Maintenance Level Analysis (MLA)
                        Contractor engineering drawings
                        SMS/contractor engineer interviews
                        SMS/contractor technician interviews
                        Developmental Program Manuals (DPMs)
                        Preliminary Technical Orders (PTOs)


Forms of data        Data can take many forms. Use any and all available data to
                     compile as comprehensive a database as possible.


Substep 3            Identify Tasks

Purpose           The purpose of this substep is to identify and record a compre-
                  hensive list of task statements necessary to perform all related
                  duties. A good task description will include a definition of what is
                  to be done, why, when, where, by whom, and how well. The
                  entire training scenario is built upon written task descriptions,
                  which detail job performance requirements. Use the following
                  criteria to identify tasks.

                     A task is a group of related activities directed toward a goal.
                     A task usually has a definite beginning and end.
                     A task involves a person’s interaction with equipment, other
                     personnel, and/or media.
                     A task, when performed, results in a meaningful product.
                     A task includes a mixture of decisions, perceptions, and/or
                     motor activities.
                     A task may be any size or degree of complexity, but must be
                     directed toward a specific purpose or discrete portion of the
                     total duty.


Example           Identify the tasks for every duty statement from Substep 1.
                  Referring to the example in Substep 1, the first task statement
                  might be “REMOVE J-4 COMPASS SYSTEM FLUX VALVE.” The
                  verb and object describe, more specifically, how and what to
                  maintain.


Substep 4         Verify Task List


Purpose           The purpose of this substep is to verify that the task list is as
                  complete and accurate as possible. Verification requires close
                  coordination between applicable agencies. These agencies
                  might include other SMSs, test force counterparts, contractor
                  personnel, or user maintenance personnel.


Verification      Also, when asking for task list verification, give instructions to:
instructions
                     Identify additional tasks that need to be included.
                     Identify tasks not performed on this weapon system, but put
                     on the list in error.
                     Evaluate each statement’s action verb for accuracy.

Modifications      Once the task list is verified, make the necessary modifications.
                   As with the duty list, reevaluate the task list.


Substep 5          Group Tasks


Purpose            The purpose of this substep is to group discrete/related tasks.
                   Keep in mind that the way tasks are grouped may influence the
                   design of the training equipment. Tasks that are grouped
                   together tend to be taught together.


Logical grouping   A logical procedure for grouping tasks is to separate them by
                   major subsystem. Tasks related to individual subsystems may be
                   further divided according to functions performed. Finally, tasks
                   may be subgrouped at the line/shop level within each function.

                           STEP 2
     IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET POPULATION

Introduction         Before training requirements can be determined, two pieces of
                     information are needed: (1) tasks identified in Step 1, and (2)
                     characteristics of the target population. These characteristics are
                     skills and knowledge that the target population already possess
                     and are combined to create a definition of the target population.


Definition           The target population is defined based on two factors: (1) skill
                     levels, and (2) previous training. Skill levels are simply the 3, 5,
                     or 7 level rating of the personnel who will perform the
                     maintenance. Previous training refers to technical training and
                     other formal education. These factors are important because
                     they influence the number of potential training requirements that
                     are analyzed and trained. Use sources such as
                     Course/Specialty Training Standards, Occupational Surveys,
                     personal experience, etc., to build on this information.


Document             Sometimes it’s necessary to make assumptions about the target
assumption           population. If this has to be done, base assumptions on the most
                     current information from applicable sources.


Target population    A summation of this analysis is called a Target Population
definition summary   Definition. This definition becomes the baseline for the remaining
                     analysis.

                               STEP 3
             DETERMINE TASK-BASED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

Introduction          In this step, an analyst decides what is and what isn’t included in
                      the training. This decision is made by comparing training
                      requirements (Step 1) with the characteristics of the target
                      population (Step 2).


Substep 1             Identify Activities


Purpose               The purpose of this substep is to document the sequence of
                      activities used to complete each task; each activity is then
                      analyzed to see if it can be classified as a potential training
                      requirement.


Definition            An activity can be considered a discrete step toward the
                      completion of a given task. Use any and all available data such
                      as Technical Orders (TOs), personal experience, interviews with
                      test personnel, etc., to build a list of activity statements. Each
                      activity must, as a minimum, describe (1) the action taken, (2) the
                      object of the action, (3) the equipment/tools used to perform the
                      action, (4) precautions and likely errors, (5) any alternative
                      activities, and (6) any existing contingencies.


Activities analysis   Each activity of every task is analyzed by answering five
                      questions. Only those activities identified as potential training
                      requirements need to be analyzed for related skill and knowledge
                      behaviors. To analyze activities, answer the following:
                         Is the activity new? That is, has this exact step in this system,
                         subsystem, or piece of equipment not been performed by the
                         target population before?
                         Are there any abnormal conditions associated with performing
                         the activity? Are there environmental limitations under which
                         the activity must be performed, such as extreme noise or

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235       VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2001                                          223


Activities analysis      limited access? Is the equipment or material being handled
(Continued)              hazardous, heavy, or bulky? Is more than one person
                         required to manipulate switches?
                         Are there new or unusual criteria related to the activity? Does
                         the activity require new or stricter standards of performance
                         for speed, timing, accuracy, or sequence?
                         Is there a chance for negative transfer to occur? If the target
                         population performs this activity in a manner previously
                         learned, will it cause incorrect or dangerous results?
                         Are any new or modified support tools or equipment required?


If no                 If the answer to all of these questions is "NO," the activity is
                      simply integrated into the training scenario for the benefit of
                      cohesion. That is, it doesn’t drive a training requirement but it’s
                      still needed to complete the task.


If yes                If the answer to any of these questions is "YES," the activity is
                      considered to be a potential training requirement.


Substep 2             Identify Skill and Knowledge Behaviors


Introduction          Skill and knowledge behaviors form the foundation of the
                      training. They influence the characteristics and type of training
                      equipment as well as the structure of the instructional content.


Definition            A skill behavior is any discrete physical action that requires
                      practice to master. Some examples are lifting or moving
                      equipment, positioning components, and tightening or loosening
                      hardware. A knowledge behavior is a fact, rule, or principle; it’s a
                      piece of information retained and results in observable behavior
                      during the performance of a task.


Identification        Each of these types of behavior needs to be identified before
                      applying any analysis parameters. Use the following taxonomy to
                      help identify activities. These points clarify skill and knowledge
                      behaviors related to an activity.

                                                                     Continued on next page

Analysis cautions    Be very careful when analyzing behaviors. For example, being
                     able to locate an object isn’t the same as being able to name an
                     object. That is, it isn’t necessary to associate a name to an object
                     in order to find it. The difference, although small, influences the
                     type of learning (taxonomy) and therefore the type of training
                     that’s developed.


Examples             The example of "APPLY AIRCRAFT POWER" contains several
                     behaviors. A technician would first need to find the power cable
                     before connecting it to the aircraft. Therefore, the first behavior
                     is knowledge-based and might be written as "IDENTIFY POWER
                     CABLE." Phrase knowledge behaviors carefully; list any
                     information that might help, form an objective such as
                     performance conditions or criteria.


How to identify      Now that skill and knowledge behaviors are identified, begin the
potential            analysis that determines which are potential training
requirements         requirements. Each skill/knowledge behavior of every activity
                     (identified as a potential training requirement) is analyzed by
                     answering several questions. Only those skill and knowledge
                     behaviors identified as potential training requirements need to be
                     analyzed for equipment requirements.

                        Is the skill/knowledge new to the target population?
                        Is there an unusual condition attached to the skill/knowledge?
                        For example, is there an awkward body movement necessary
                        in performance, limited or "blind" access/visibility, etc.?
                        Are there new or unusual criteria related to the activity? Does
                        the activity require new or stricter standards of performance
                        for speed, timing, accuracy, or sequence?
                        Is there a chance for negative transfer to occur? If the target
                        population performs this activity in a manner previously
                        learned, will it cause incorrect or dangerous results?
                        Are any new or modified support tools or equipment required?


If No                If the answer to all of these questions is "NO," the skill or
                     knowledge behavior is integrated into the training scenario for
                     the benefit of cohesion. It doesn’t drive a training requirement but
                     it’s still needed to complete the activity.

If Yes   If the answer to any of these questions is "YES," the skill or
         knowledge behavior is considered to be a potential training
         requirement.
AFH 36-2235      VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2001                                        229


                          STEP 4
       DETERMINE CONCEPT-BASED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS


Introduction         In this step, skill and knowledge behaviors identified as potential
                     training requirements are analyzed further for potential concept
                     training requirements. That is, some of those pieces of
                     knowledge that indirectly support potential training requirements
                     (behaviors) may not be known to the target population.


Example              A jet engine mechanic has to perform engine changes from time
                     to time. Part of being able to do this is knowing (cognitive
                     domain) where the mount bolts are located and how to remove
                     them. Note: These are the types of behaviors identified and
                     analyzed in Step 3. But, there’s another knowledge component
                     here; mount bolts are required to be “close tolerance.” They fit
                     tighter and, therefore, create a more reliable structure. Does a
                     jet engine mechanic have to know this to change an engine? It
                     depends on the definition of the target population. This is “nice to
                     know” information for someone who does nothing more than
                     engine changes, but consider the same information within a
                     different scenario. A jet engine mechanic is assigned to
                     troubleshoot an engine vibration problem. The problem isn’t
                     severe enough to warrant an engine change, but it’s noticeable.
                     The vibration of the engine is induced into the airframe; why?
                     “Close tolerance” mount bolts form a single structure of the
                     engine and the airframe. Vibrations propagate through a solid
                     mass more readily than through a looser structure. The word
                     “troubleshoot” adds a new dimension to the task.


Cognitive training   The analysis performed in this step also supports potential
                     training requirements that fall exclusively into the cognitive
                     realm; for example, training scenarios that present a degree of
                     understanding for system theory or management practices.
                     These types of scenarios are on the same level with performance
                     (psychomotor)-based tasks and are assembled or disassembled
                     in the same way; they are referred to here as cognitive-based
                     training requirements.

What is a concept?   In both contexts, a concept is an idea or group of ideas with
                     common elements. From this perspective, a concept can be
                     thought of as a set of common elements, each element having its
                     own characteristics.


Substep 1            Identify Concepts


Purpose              The purpose of this substep is to identify concepts that are
                     relevant not only to those behaviors identified as potential
                     training requirements, but also to those tasks that fall exclusively
                     into the cognitive realm (potential cognitive-based training
                     requirements).


How to identify      First, identify concepts that are relevant to potential behavioral
concepts             training requirements. Next, identify those tasks (potential
                     cognitive-based training requirements) that are exclusively within
                     the cognitive realm. Apply the following six questions to each
                     potential cognitive-based training requirement. If the answer to
                     any of these questions is “YES,” then it’s considered a potential
                     concept-training requirement and is analyzed in the remaining
                     subsets.

                        Does the target population need to know about functional
                        operations of components?
                        Does the target population need to know about associated
                        system inputs (input signals or data from another system)?
                        Does the target population need to know uses, capabilities,
                        and limitations of test equipment?
                        Does the target population need to understand and be able to
                        apply knowledge of signal flow to find discrete components?
                        Does the target population need to use other data with test
                        equipment to find faulty components?
                        Does the target population need to know and apply specific
                        rules such as Ohm’s Law?


Substep 2            Identify Concept Elements
AFH 36-2235    VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2001                                          231




Definition         Concepts are made of elements, much the same way that tasks
                   are made of activities. Disassembling each concept into discrete
                   knowledge parts (elements) identifies these elements.


Example            The concept of troubleshooting contains many elements. Three
                   of these elements are: (1) identify the problem, (2) localize the
                   problem to a subassembly or function, and (3) isolate the
                   problem to the discrete component. The requirement to perform
                   troubleshooting may have been identified in Step 3, but the
                   concept or theory (collective concept elements) is identified here.


How to identify    Analyze each element and apply the following questions.
concept elements
                      Is the element relevant to the target population? An element
                      is relevant when it has a direct bearing on the subject matter,
                      so closely related to the concept as to provide reinforcement,
                      or is required for understanding and reinforcement.
                      Is the element incidental to the target population? These
                      elements are similar to those activities and behaviors that
                      weren’t identified as potential training requirements but were
                      included for the sake of cohesion.


If no              If the answer to both of these questions is “NO,” the element is
                   discarded.


If yes             If the answer to the first question is “YES,” the element is
                   identified as a potential concept element-training requirement.
                   These are the only elements considered for further analysis. If
                   the answer to the second question is “YES,” it isn’t considered
                   for further analysis, but is included in the training scenario for the
                   benefit of cohesion.


Substep 3          Identify Characteristics of Elements
                                      AFH 36-2235 VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2002




Introduction      Characteristics make an element unique. Referring to the
                  previous example, the concept of troubleshooting, each element
                  implies progress toward a goal. It’s because of the unique
                  characteristics of each element that a technician can reach that
                  goal.


Example           To identify a problem in an avionics system, technicians must
                  use several of the physical senses (that’s one characteristic) and
                  be able to understand the sequential signal flow from one
                  component to another (that’s another characteristic). Technicians
                  must also understand the functional operation of each
                  component (characteristic) as well as each component’s
                  interrelationship with others (yet another characteristic).


How to identify   Remember, characteristics are identified only for potential
characteristics   concept element training requirements that are “RELEVANT.”

                  Ask these questions:

                     Is the characteristic new? Has this target population been
                     exposed to this level of understanding on this system?
                     Is the characteristic complex? That is, is it detailed, does it
                     require a higher level of scientific theory, or understanding of
                     mathematical formulas?
                     Is the characteristic critical? Can the element be understood
                     without it?


If no             If the answer to all of these questions is “NO,” the characteristic
                  can be discarded.


If yes            If the answer to any of these questions is “YES,” it’s identified as
                  a potential element characteristic training requirement and
                  documented.

                                STEP 5
                   DETERMINE MEDIA AND METHODOLOGY


Introduction          If there’s a training requirement, something must be used to
                      teach it some form of media. The first image that comes to mind
                      is an instructor standing in front of a class lecturing from
                      transparencies. This is the most common way to get a point
                      across, but not always the most effective. Instructional scenarios
                      should stimulate the senses.

                      In this step, the analyst is prompted by a series of questions.
                      Answers given in response to these questions determine the best
                      delivery method, domain of learning, whether hardware or
                      alternate media is used, the appropriate media class, and the
                      best method of instruction for each media class.


Substep 1             Determine Method of Delivery


Purpose               The purpose of this substep is to determine how the instructional
                      message is delivered.


How to deliver        There are two ways to deliver the instructional message, (1) by
instruction           an instructor or instructor-based delivery, and (2) by specific
                      media or media-based delivery.


Instructor-based      Instructor-based delivery may use a variety of media such as
delivery              transparencies, exhibits, etc., but without the instructor the media
                      is lifeless. That is, the media can’t deliver the instructional
                      message by itself; media only supports delivery of the
                      instructional message.


Media-based           In media-based delivery, an instructor isn’t necessary for
delivery              learning to take place. The media is a self-contained instructional
                      unit; it provides (in most cases) stimulus and feedback, and an
                      instructor supports delivery of the instructional message.

How to determine     To determine the method of delivery for behaviors and concepts,
method of delivery   ask the following questions:

                           Is the instructional content dynamic? If the content is likely
                           to change, requiring updates more than once a year, it’s
                           considered to be dynamic. The cost of updating media-
                           based materials is very high compared to updating
                           alternate media.
                           Does the behavior deal with interpersonal skills, behavior
                           modification, or change in attitude? This focuses on the
                           affective domain of learning. Human interaction is
                           generally more effective in a classroom or laboratory
                           environment.
                           Is team effort or interaction with an instructor important?
                           Where team efforts are concerned, it’s usually desirable to
                           let an instructor control the learning environment.
                           Does the behavior require feedback on performance of
                           motor skills or procedures? When students work to master
                           a psychomotor skill they require feedback to correct
                           undesirable behavior.
                           Is the instructional message intended for wide
                           distribution? Consider the target population and where
                           they’ll be located. If the target population is scattered
                           throughout a geographical location, then the instructional
                           message needs to be exported. The cost of sending
                           instructors may be prohibitive; therefore, hardware
                           (media-based instruction) may be appropriate.
                           Is it critical that the content be delivered the same way
                           every time? While it’s certainly desirable, it’s seldom
                           critical. This is intended to identify those behaviors where
                           inconsistent or faulty instruction could lead to unsafe acts
                           on the part of the target population.
                           Should the instructional content be adaptable to individual
                           differences and/or allow individuals to control the pace or
                           amount of practice? In situations where extremes exist in
                           individual capabilities, learning styles, or previous training/
                           experience, media-based material may be appropriate.
                           Is face-to-face instruction impractical? Consider the
                           availability of qualified instructors, instructor-to-student
                           ratios, and temporary duty (TDY) costs. If any of these
                           factors apply, media-based material is appropriate.

                                                                    Continued on next page

How to determine     Note: Each skill/knowledge behavior and concept training
method of delivery         requirement is analyzed using these same eight questions.
(Continued)                Notice, also, that the first four questions are considerations
                           for instructor-based delivery and the last four questions
                           are considerations for media-based delivery. Use Yes/No
                           answers to these questions to determine your media
                           recommendations


Substep 2            Determine Domain of Learning


Introduction         The domain of learning is another key factor that helps determine
                     whether to use hardware or alternate media. In this substep, the
                     domain of learning is determined for both delivery methods,
                     instructor-based and media-based.


How to determine     To determine the domain of learning for instructor- or media-
domain of learning   based delivery, each behavior and concept is analyzed using
                     these questions. If the answer to any one question is “YES,” an
                     analyst is directed to the appropriate domain of learning.
                     Document the results.

                        Is the behavior a motor skill? If so, it is a psychomotor domain
                        of learning. A motor skill is a matter of dexterity, that is, a
                        given body movement or motion that’s practiced so much that
                        it becomes automatic. For example, tightening a bolt with an
                        adjustable wrench is a motor skill that some 3-skill-level
                        technicians must practice. Practice is required for them to
                        learn how to use the wrench with one hand and adjust it
                        without dropping it.
                        Does the behavior call for knowledge or mental skills? If so, it
                        is a cognitive domain of learning. Task knowledge are facts
                        and principles that support performance. Mental skills allow a
                        person to make decisions, discriminate between similar
                        inputs, or to recognize the difference between

                                                                    Continued on next page

How to determine        Does the behavior require a change in attitude? If so, it is an
domain of learning      affective domain of learning. Attitudes refer to an internal
(Continued)             state that influences the choices a person makes. This
                        consists of emotional and intellectual aspects. The point of
                        focus here is those attitudes that can be changed with
                        exposure to role models, opportunities for successful
                        accomplishment, and positive reinforcement.


Conclusions          To this point, the delivery method and domain of learning are
                     known for each behavior and concept. The 374 TDS
                     recommends analyzing training requirements identified for
                     instructor-based delivery first.


Substep 3            Determine Instructor-Based Delivery Requirements


Are motor skills     If motor skills (psychomotor domain) are required in learning,
required?            analyze the behavior or concept by answering the following
                     questions:
                         Is the behavior difficult to execute? If the behavior is difficult
                         to execute, it’s probably difficult to master without some
                         hands-on practice. For example, adjusting the color bias on a
                         television or adjusting a carburetor on a running engine.
                         Are there unusual conditions? Consider the working
                         environment and stressful situations such as working in
                         cramped quarters or where pacing of events can’t be
                         controlled.
                         Are there special performance criteria? Criteria are standards
                         of performance. Are there specifications that can’t be met
                         without practice?
                         Are there hardware cues that affect performance? The actual
                         equipment may provide feedback that’s too difficult or
                         complex to explain. Simulation of equipment feedback may be
                         shown with audiovisual media or hardware. Which is most
                         cost-effective?
                         Are new support tools/equipment required? Note: “Tools” are
                         not only wrenches and hammers but also mathematical
                         equations, computer programs, formulas, etc. However, the
                         concern here is hardware-type tools. Other tools should be
                         analyzed as alternate media.

                                                                     Continued on next page
AFH 36-2235        VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2001                                         237




Are motor skills         Are the consequences of error high? This focuses on
required?                chances of personal injury or damage to equipment if the
(Continued)              behavior isn’t performed correctly. An aircraft egress system,
                         for example, isn’t taught on actual equipment for 3-skill-level
                         training; one mistake is enough to kill a person and damage
                         equipment.
                         Is the frequency of performance very high or very low? Some
                         behaviors are performed so often that practice on a hardware
                         training device leads to greater efficiency. On the other hand,
                         behaviors (such as emergency procedures) may be
                         performed so rarely that they’re forgotten unless practiced
                         often.


If yes                If the answer to any of these questions is “YES,” the analyst is
                      directed to use a hardware (HW) training device.


If no                 For “NO” responses, hardware isn’t used, so alternate media is
                      the appropriate choice. Consider the relevant factors used as
                      stimuli. These factors influence student performance.


Alternate media       Media includes, but is not limited to:

                         Print
                         Audio
                         Projected still visual
                         Audio projected still visual
                         Motion visual
                         Audio motion visual
                         Color motion visual
                         Color audio motion visual


How to determine      To determine the appropriate alternate media for a behavior or
alternate media       concept (psychomotor domain), answer the following questions:

                         Is display of motion necessary? In some cases, students may
                         have to respond to feedback from system components; the
                         reverse may also be true.

                                                                    Continued on next page

How to determine      Is color necessary? Unless color flags an important aspect of
alternate media       system operation (warning lights, for example) or is present in
(Continued)           a real scenario, it isn’t necessary.
                      Is sound necessary? Again, consider whether or not this
                      factor flags an important aspect of system operation or is
                      present in the real scenario.

                   Note: All other behaviors and concepts are understood to
                   require hardware. These are analyzed at a later time.


Are knowledge      If knowledge skills are required, you must analyze the behavior
skills required?   or concept. Ask the following questions:

                      Does the behavior involve unfamiliar concepts or objects?
                      Consider whether or not the target population was ever
                      exposed to this specific behavior. This includes equipment
                      as well as environment.
                      Does the behavior involve interpersonal skills? Consider any
                      interaction/communication between people.
                      Is display of motion necessary? Again, students may have to
                      respond to feedback from system components.
                      Is sound necessary? If it flags important aspects of system
                      operation or is present in a real scenario, the answer is
                      “YES.”
                      Is it practical to demonstrate the real thing in class? For
                      example, it isn’t practical to bring a complete jet engine into
                      class to teach the knowledge portion of removing mount bolts.
                      Remember that this is the cognitive domain.

                   By answering these five questions, the analyst is led to the
                   appropriate alternate media.


Substep 4          Determine Media-Based Delivery Requirements


Synopsis           An analyst may have determined earlier that a given behavior is
                   suited to media-based delivery. That is, the training scenario is
                   controlled by some type of media that provides stimuli, monitors
                   student response, and provides feedback. Now you need to
                   determine delivery requirements for all three domains of learning
                   supported by media-based delivery.

Substep 5         Determine Method of Instruction


Introduction      The purpose of this substep is to determine the best method of
                  instruction for each media class (within alternate media)
                  identified earlier.

                                  STEP 6
                     DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES


Introduction           This step is designed to refocus efforts at the task level. The
                       end product is a preliminary overview of the training scenario.


Substep 1              Develop Criterion Objectives


Definition             When phrased properly, criterion objectives specify under what
                       circumstances a behavior is performed (condition), exactly what
                       must be done (behavior), and how well the behavior is performed
                       (standard).


Description            The condition describes the important aspects of the
                       performance environment. Examples of these aspects are the
                       tools the students are given to work with, access to technical
                       data, and special instructions.

                       The behavior of a criterion objective is observable and
                       measurable. That is, students must demonstrate a knowledge or
                       performance so that an instructor can determine/see a specified
                       degree of skill or change. The behavior also matches, as closely
                       as possible, actual task performance.

                       The standard of a criterion objective specifies the precise degree
                       of completeness and accuracy of a behavior. The degree of
                       completeness and accuracy may be stated as compliance with
                       Tos, minimum levels of acceptable performance, time
                       requirements, rate of production, etc.


Potential training     Criterion objectives are developed only from those tasks and
                       concepts identified as potential training requirements. Consider
                       each one carefully; some may not be observable or measurable.


Instructional goals    Training requirements that are neither observable nor
                       measurable are integrated into the training scenario, but are
                       written as instructional goals. Instructional goals have a similar
                       written format to behavioral statements.
AFH 36-2235        VOLUME 3     1 NOVEMBER 2001                                          241




Substep 2             Develop Tests


Introduction          As stated earlier, criterion objectives must be observable and
                      measurable. Therefore, all criterion objectives must be
                      measured with either a written or performance test. Of primary
                      concern for written tests is clear communication of questions or
                      problems to students.


Guidelines for test   Following are some guidelines for developing tests.
development
                         Write tests to the reading grade level of the target population.
                         Don’t write tests with the intent of tricking students.
                         Use correct grammar.
                         Use plausible distracters.
                         Use some type of illustration to clarify complex scenarios.
                         Don’t give away the correct answer to a question in its stem
                         or in a previous question.
                         Give clear instructions to the examiner and students.
                         Compare the test material to the criterion objective to ensure
                         that it measures the intended behavior and standard.


Performance test      Performance tests need to be structured correctly if students are
guidelines            to retain the instructional message. Pushing students into the
                      actual performance test before they’re ready causes frustration,
                      confusion, and lack of motivation to concentrate on the
                      remainder of the instruction. The following are some guidelines
                      to follow for developing performance tests.

                         Performance tests need to be demonstrated. This not only
                         clarifies aspects of the procedure, but serves as a summary
                         for the whole task.
                         Give students enough practice before actual testing. If time
                         permits, let them practice until they feel confident with the
                         scenario. Allow them to practice at least twice for complex
                         scenarios.
                         Identify appropriate safety precautions and procedures.
                         Include any special instructions to the examiner in the
                         Instructional Guidance. Special instructions might point out
                         considerations for preparation, timing of certain events, or
                         alternate plans.

Substep 3            Develop Media Descriptions


Purpose              The purpose of this substep is to determine specific types of
                     media for each alternate media class from Step 5, then write a
                     brief narrative describing specific types.


How to develop       To develop media descriptions, answer the following questions.
media descriptions
                        Are materials readily available? For example, if print media is
                        needed, are there existing manuals and illustrations to
                        support the need?
                        What are the production costs for different media within a
                        given class?
                        How much time is available for development?
                        How many times will the training be offered? If it’s offered
                        one time, don’t spend the money for elaborate media.
                        Is the media subject to frequent change? This can also be
                        costly for certain types of media.


Identify resource    At this point, identify any resource requirements. Doing this now
requirements         allows plenty of time for changes, revisions, etc. Resource
                     requirements include any type of hardware support for specific
                     media such as projectors, cameras, dry marker boards, etc.


Substep 4            Develop Written Overview


Purpose              The purpose of this substep is to define how specific alternate
                     media and resources are used in the training scenario or how
                     they’re used to help deliver the instructional message.


Documentation        As you write your overview, estimate and document the number
                     of hours needed for each training requirement. Base this
                     estimate on task performance data and personal experience.


Substep 5            Sequence Training Requirements
AFH 36-2235    VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2001                                       243




Purpose            The purpose of this substep is to structure the training scenario.
                   Structuring allows students to comprehend relationships that
                   exist between concepts, skill and knowledge behaviors,
                   activities, and tasks.


Definition         There are two levels of structuring: (1) macro structuring, and (2)
                   micro structuring.

                      Macro structuring consists of the largest divisions by major
                      subject matter or topic. Using this structuring allows the
                      training scenario to be divided according to major work areas,
                      systems, or levels of progression. Once this is complete,
                      micro structuring can begin.
                      Micro structuring simply allows potential training requirements
                      to be structured into major divisions. This involves
                      sequencing activities into tasks and tasks into objectives.
                      There are three ways to sequence these activities and tasks
                      during micro structuring: (1) by job performance order, (2) by
                      psychological order, and (3) by logical order. These are
                      explained as follows.
                          Sequencing by job performance order produces an
                          instructional environment that replicates the real
                          environment. It’s very effective in scenarios where
                          students must produce immediately. This tends to have a
                          high level of psychological impact that translates into
                          quality job performance.
                          Sequencing by psychological order focuses on the
                          concepts of known to unknown, simple to complex, and
                          whole to part-whole. However, this type of sequencing is
                          subjective; the analyst determines what’s known and
                          unknown, simple and complex, etc.
                          Sequencing by logical order is a combination of the first
                          two types and leans heavily toward whole to part-whole.


Determine common Determine whether or not any objectives (for concept-based
elements         training requirements) have common elements. These objectives
                   are placed at the beginning of the training because they
                   represent concepts that are fundamental to several tasks. For
                   example, the concept of physical force is fundamental to learning
                   how simple machines work. Therefore, instruction on this
                   concept precedes instruction on specific machinery.

Prerequisites   Next, determine if there are any skill and knowledge behaviors
                that are prerequisites for others. It may be beneficial to place
                these into objectives and sequence them before others. Also,
                while making this determination, look for chains of events that
                must be performed in specified order.

                               STEP 7
               IDENTIFY HARDWARE FIDELITY REQUIREMENTS


Introduction        By this time, an analyst has formed a general idea of what the
                    hardware requirements are for media classes identified in Step 5.
                    However, the degree of hardware fidelity needs to be
                    determined. That is, how realistic must the hardware be to
                    support the training scenario? Also, this analysis helps
                    determine the degree of fidelity needed to teach individual skill
                    behaviors; this is possible because tasks are analyzed to the skill
                    and knowledge behavior level (Steps 1 through 4). This prevents
                    development of hardware training devices that perform more
                    functions than are absolutely necessary to deliver the
                    instructional message.


Substep 1           Identify Hardware Fidelity Requirements


Introduction        There are two aspects to fidelity requirements for any hardware
                    training device: (1) functional, and (2) physical. Each of these
                    aspects is analyzed for the quality or degree of stimulus,
                    response, or feedback.


Purpose             The purpose of this substep is to identify and analyze hardware
                    for functional and physical fidelity requirements.
                                          AFH 36-2235 VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2002




How to identify       Examine the media classes for both instructor-based and media-
hardware              based delivery. Specific hardware for these media classes is
functional fidelity   identified by considering which major assemblies,
requirements          subassemblies, or lower assembly units students come in contact
                      with (for a given training requirement). Answer the following
                      questions.

                         Does the hardware have a functional impact? The functional
                         impact of hardware consists of both stimuli and feedback.
                         Therefore, it’s considered from both perspectives. If students
                         must receive information from hardware to perform a task or
                         make a decision, the answer to this question is “YES.”
                         Is the stimulus/feedback difficult to understand? For example,
                         a digital pressure gauge is easier to comprehend than an
                         analog pressure gauge; analog scales are continuous with an
                         infinite number of values from point A to point B and,
                         therefore, it’s more difficult to determine an exact value.
                         Is the stimulus/feedback difficult to understand because of
                         motion, body position, or feel? This considers whether or not
                         the hardware is in motion during task performance, awkward
                         body positions interfere with performance, and/or
                         discrimination between some physical characteristics of the
                         hardware makes it difficult to make a decision.
                         Is there something unusual, abnormal, or dangerous about
                         the hardware? Use personal experience and good judgment
                         to answer this question. Careful consideration should be
                         given to scenarios with moving parts, explosives, and new or
                         modified tools.

                      Note: Depending on a given response, an analyst may be
                      directed to label the hardware as having various levels of fidelity.


Example               A behavior requires the target population to use a new piece of
                      test equipment. The test equipment is new only because a
                      modification included an external manual adjustment. Since the
                      test equipment has a functional impact, it requires “High” (H)
                      functional fidelity; specifically, the external manual adjustment.

Functional fidelity   Use the flowchart in Figure E-2 to determine the degree to which
                      each piece of hardware must act like the real thing.

How to determine      No matter what the response is during functional fidelity analysis,
physical fidelity     an analyst must determine the degree to which the hardware
requirements          must look like the real thing. Ask the following questions.

                         Is the hardware acted upon directly? If students must come in
                         physical contact with the hardware, the answer to this
                         question is “YES.”

                                                                                 Continued on next page

How to determine       Is the hardware next to or connected to high (H) fidelity
physical fidelity      hardware and does it enhance students’ understanding? In
requirements           some cases, hardware may not provide stimuli, response, or
(Continued)            feedback; it’s merely next to or connected to hardware that
                       does.
                       Is unaided judgment used to respond to hardware outputs
                       (difficult response)?
                       Are there many possible hardware configurations? It’s simply
                       easier for students to comprehend the overall scenario using
                       a single high (H) fidelity piece of hardware as opposed to
                       numerous low (L) fidelity components.
                       Is there something unusual, abnormal, or dangerous about
                       the hardware?

                    Again, depending on the response, an analyst may be directed to
                    label hardware as “High” (H) fidelity, “Possible High” (PH) fidelity,
                    “Low” (L) fidelity, or “Possible Low” (PL) fidelity.

Substep 2              Perform Whole-Hardware Analysis


Purpose                This analysis is intended to make the hardware training device
                       appear as realistic as possible at minimal expense. Most
                       hardware training devices include components such as dials,
                       switches, lights, etc., from the actual equipment. But, depending
                       on the training scenario, many of the components may be
                       nonfunctional.


Example                Consider, for example, what should be done with the fifth
                       indicator in a group of five, if students receive
                       stimuli/response/feedback only from the first four. It’s suggested
                       that the fifth indicator be included as a “Low” (L) fidelity
                       component.

Why include      There are two reasons to include these types of components.
various          First, it makes the hardware training device look realistic;
components?      second, including a modest number shouldn’t add significant
                 material costs. Two-dimensional drawings or photographs can
                 represent many of these low fidelity components.


Consider         In some cases it may be more expensive to fabricate the
operational      hardware training device with low fidelity components than to use
hardware         the actual hardware. Will including low fidelity components
                 contribute to learning? Or would it be best and most effective to
                 use actual hardware?


Substep 3        Compile Fidelity Recommendations Within Tasks


Introduction     Keep in mind that the hardware requirements analyzed in the
                 previous steps/substeps are developed from potential behavioral
                 training requirements. In turn, these behavioral training
                 requirements are developed from a given activity within a given
                 task.


Purpose          The purpose of this substep is to compile fidelity decisions within
                 that given task. The hardware requirements for a given activity
                 are probably used in other activities of the same task.
                 Therefore, these same hardware requirements are probably
                 labeled with varying fidelity levels. These fidelity labels, for
                 common hardware requirements, must be compiled first.


How to compile   To compile fidelity recommendations within tasks, look at the
                 hardware requirement for the first potential behavioral training
                 requirement of the first activity within the first task. Now, search
                 the rest of the activities in the first task for the same hardware
                 requirement. For this same hardware requirement, total the
                 number of “High” (H) fidelity labels; do the same for the “Possible
                 High” (PH) fidelity labels, “Low” (L) fidelity labels, and “Possible
                 Low” (L) fidelity labels.


Substep 4        Compile Fidelity Recommendations Within Blocks

Purpose              Just as some hardware is common to more than one activity
                     within a task, some hardware may be common to more than one
                     task within a block. The purpose of this substep is to compile
                     fidelity decisions within blocks.


How to compile       Search the hardware requirements analyzed in Substep 3, within
                     each task, to identify common hardware requirements within
                     blocks of instruction. The end result should be a hardware
                     training device that can be used in more than one unit and/or
                     objective.


Substep 5            Compile Final Fidelity Recommendations


Synopsis             The procedures for this substep are identical to procedures in
                     Substeps 3 and 4, only performed a step higher in the structure
                     of the training scenario. The purpose of this substep is to
                     compile fidelity decisions within the entire course of instruction.
                     That is, there may be hardware requirements that are common to
                     more than one block of instruction. This subset is simply a
                     compilation of the previous substeps in Step 7.

                                  STEP 8
                 IDENTIFY INTERACTIVE COURSEWARE (ICW)
                         FIDELITY REQUIREMENTS

Introduction         Research shows that ICW is a very powerful media in terms of
                     presenting information; it allows development of conceptual
                     skills, analytical skills, and psychomotor skills. It can take many
                     forms, including text-based and interactive video (IVD).


Purpose              The purpose of this step is to determine the type of ICW best
                     suited to training requirements.


Substep 1            Identify ICW Fidelity Requirements
                                           AFH 36-2235 VOLUME 3       1 NOVEMBER 2002




Background            Potential training requirements that need to be presented with a
                      media class of ICW are already identified. This is done in Step 5.
                      All potential skill-, knowledge-, and concept-based training
                      requirements within this media class are analyzed here for
                      fidelity requirements.


Why is ICW            The analysis for ICW fidelity differs from that of hardware fidelity
analysis different?   in the level of focus. In hardware fidelity analysis, the focus is on
                      the actual hardware required to support a behavior or concept.
                      Here, the focus is on course content.


Example               For example, a given task may require students to apply
                      electrical power to an aircraft’s avionics systems. An activity in
                      this task requires them to turn on the battery switch. The skill
                      behavior, here, is to physically move the toggle switch from
                      “OFF” to “ON.” A knowledge behavior is the understanding why
                      the switch must be turned on; one concept used to help
                      understand this behavior is that of electron flow. If it’s already
                      determined (from Step 5) that the media class for these
                      behaviors is ICW, then the battery switch, associated system
                      knowledge, and concept of electron flow are analyzed for fidelity
                      requirements.


How to conduct        Conduct the analysis by answering the following questions.
ICW analysis
                         Is the skill, knowledge, or concept difficult to understand?
                         Consider whether or not it’s difficult to understand without
                         seeing an animated representation.
                         Do students come in contact with system components during
                         actual maintenance? If students are manipulating controls or
                         making judgments based on system performance/status, the
                         answer to this question is “YES.”
                         Is it difficult to make a response? Consider close coordination
                         between team members and quick cognitive or psychomotor
                         reaction.
                         Is the response based on specific system stimuli? Stimuli
                         may be in the form of feedback.
                         Is there a high consequence for incorrect student
                         performance? Consider what’s going to happen if students
                         perform the activity incorrectly or out of sequence.

Substep 2      Compile Final ICW Fidelity Recommendations


Purpose        The purpose of this substep is to compile all ICW fidelity analysis
               data into a cohesive package. These final recommendations are
               used to develop ICW.
AFH 36-2235   VOLUME 3     1 NOVEMBER 2001                                      255




Background       Notice that there’s no middle ground for the fidelity labels in
                 Substep 1. Each skill, knowledge, or concept either needs to be
                 presented in detail or isn’t critical to understanding.


Conclusions      Considering that both functional and physical fidelity
                 requirements can have either of these two labels, there are only
                 four possible scenarios that can exist for each type of training
                 requirement. These scenarios are explained next.

                    A low functional and low physical scenario indicates that the
                    training requirement can be met with a text-based tutorial;
                    there are no visual cues or system functions that students
                    must react to. Text-based tutorials may take the form of
                    discussions on specific concepts, which are used later. They
                    may also take the form of study aids that reinforce classroom
                    instruction.
                    A high functional and low physical scenario indicates that the
                    training requirement can be met with animated graphics with
                    text support. Animated graphics illustrate abstract concepts
                    while simulating some aspect of operation.
                    A low functional and high physical scenario indicates that the
                    training requirement can be met with static graphics. Static
                    graphics are generally used to clarify points.
                    A high functional and high physical scenario indicates that the
                    training requirement can be met with two-dimensional
                    part-task simulations. Creating a performance environment
                    requires animation, and this type of ICW is designed to give
                    the visual and auditory cues that go along with manipulation
                    of controls. A two-dimensional part-task simulation can be
                    developed using computer animation, interactive video, and
                    variations/combinations of the two.

                             STEP 9
               IDENTIFY INSTRUCTIONAL FEATURES


Introduction   There are four aspects to any training scenario: (1) stimuli, (2)
               response monitoring, (3) feedback, and (4) next task or activity.

                  Stimuli prompt students into action and come from one of two
                  sources: (1) an instructor, or (2) hardware/alternate media.
                  Cues from these sources give students information that leads
                  them to proceed with a given performance.

                  What students do after seeing, hearing, or feeling stimuli is
                  called the response. In response to stimuli, students perform
                  a task or an activity. Student response must be monitored in
                  one of two ways: (1) by an instructor, or (2) by
                  hardware/alternate media. The data gathered during
                  response monitoring is used to provide a degree of feedback
                  to the students.

                  Feedback either reinforces student behavior or helps correct
                  it, depending on the data received during response
                  monitoring. Feedback may also prompt students to begin the
                  next task or activity; once this happens, feedback is then
                  considered stimuli.

                  The feedback/stimuli that directs students to perform the next
                  task or activity comes from (1) an instructor, or (2)
                  hardware/alternate media.


Commonality    Notice that there’s one thing in common for all four aspects.
               Either an instructor or hardware/alternate media controls the
               training scenario. Skill, knowledge, and concept training
               requirements, to this point, are already determined as delivered
               by the instructor or media.
AFH 36-2235       VOLUME 3      1 NOVEMBER 2001                                        257




Purpose              Even though media-based delivery is directed for some
                     behaviors and concepts, it may be necessary for an instructor to
                     control one of the aspects of stimuli, response monitoring,
                     feedback, or next activity. The purpose of this step is to identify
                     instructional features for those skill/knowledge behaviors and
                     concepts with a media class of HW, ICW, or EXH; specifically,
                     which (instructor or media) controls one of the given aspects and
                     what features are assigned to them. Each hardware training
                     device (or supporting hardware), under these media classes, is
                     analyzed in this step.


Substep 1            Identify Stimuli Controls and Features


How to identify      Look at the first behavior or concept with a hardware requirement
                     and define the stimuli. Once this is known, answer the following
                     questions to identify which (instructor or media) controls stimuli
                     and whether features are preprogrammed or variable:
                        Does the hardware control the stimuli? If dealing with a
                        simple task, such as remove and replace, instructors can
                        effectively control the stimuli and keep the training scenario
                        realistic.

                        Does the hardware control the intensity of stimuli? Intensity
                        is defined as pitch, tone, volume, or duration for audio stimuli
                        and brightness or duration for visual stimuli.

                        Is the intensity preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?
                        Preprogrammed means that each student sees the exact,
                        same presentation no matter when instruction is given.
                        Variable means that the presentation is adapted to individual
                        student needs. One or the other is included as a feature; it’s
                        simply a choice an analyst must make. This position is
                        maintained in the remaining analysis of Step 8.

                        Does the hardware control the rate of stimuli? Consider
                        whether or not the hardware training device must emulate
                        system operation.

                        Is the rate preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)? Refer to
                        the clarification in the third question.

                                                                    Continued on next page

How to identify      Does the hardware control the signal-to-noise ratio? A signal
(Continued)          is defined as the instructional message, whatever it may be.
                     Noise is defined as anything that interferes with or blocks the
                     signal; it distracts students’ attention from the training
                     scenario. If the training scenario is very active/interactive, the
                     hardware is designed to control this feature.

                     Is the signal-to-noise ratio preprogrammed (PP) or variable
                     (VAR)? Refer to the clarification in the third question.


Substep 2         Identify Response Monitoring Controls and Features


How to identify   Consider the following:
                    Is hardware freeze capability required? Freeze capability
                    stops the training scenario temporarily, after a specified
                    number of student errors, a fatal error, or when time limits are
                    exceeded. Consider whether or not the nature of the training
                    scenario prompts frequent mistakes.
                    Are the freeze criteria preprogrammed (PP) or variable
                    (VAR)?
                    Do students remove the hardware freeze? If instructors are
                    available to do this, let them. This ensures they’re aware of
                    individual needs and puts the human factor back into the
                    training scenario. If students remove the freeze, remediation
                    must be included; this remediation is designed to keep
                    students from making the same mistake twice.
                    Is remediation preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?


Substep 3         Identify Feedback Controls and Features


How to identify   Specific feedback must be identified before continuing. Use the
                  following questions to identify controls and features for feedback:
                      Is feedback provided by the hardware? Consider how much
                      control is given to the hardware already and whether or not
                      the hardware is used in a self-paced training scenario.
                      Does the hardware provide the consequences of a false
                      response? If the hardware is to simulate the actual equipment
                      or provide remediation, the answer is "YES."
                      Is the feedback preprogrammed (PP) or variable (VAR)?

Substep 4            Identify Next Task/Activity Controls and Features


How to identify      The next task/activity must be identified before continuing. Use
                     the following questions to identify controls and features.

                        Does the hardware control whether or not students proceed
                        to the next activity? Consider the complexity of the training
                        scenario.

                        Is the next activity variable?

                        Is the variability derived from student response or student
                        score? Variability derived from student response
                        acknowledges the many possible hardware configurations;
                        this feature causes hardware to simulate actual equipment
                        and students are free to treat it as such (freeplay). Variability
                        derived from student score limits the possible action a student
                        may take. This feature is best suited for tasks or activities
                        that are critical in nature or to reinforce the instructional
                        message to lower skill levels.

                     Note: The last six steps of the 15-step process are brief and
                     summarized below.

      PREPARE TRAINING EQUIPMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY AND
                  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION


Synopsis       This document is used to record training equipment design
               requirements. It’s used by the Program Office (PO) to prepare
               the Request For Proposal (RFP). The format will vary depending
               on SPO requirements.

                           STEP 11
              PREPARE COURSE CONTROL DOCUMENTS


Synopsis         A proposed Course Chart (CC) and Course Training
                 Standard/Specialty Training Standard (CTS/STS) are now
                 derived from the analysis. This is an AETC-specific requirement.


Purpose          The analysis from this ISD process provides the majority of the
                 information needed for development of the CC and CTS/STS.
                 Estimates of course lengths, instructional design, hardware
                 training devices, and AETC-furnished equipment can be derived.

                            STEP 12
           PREPARE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND TESTS


Synopsis         Preparing instructional materials and tests requires preparation
                 of criterion objectives (Steps 6 and 11). These criterion
                 objectives are listed in the appropriate CCDs and form the basis
                 for this step. Use the analysis data from Steps 3 and 4 when
                 developing test items for criterion objectives. AETC-specific
                 requirements and guidance are in ATCR 52-3 for testing
                 policy/procedures for resident training, and ATCR 50-21 for FTD
                 courses. Guidance and format requirements for training literature
                 (used in resident training) can be found in ATCR 52-2 and ATCR
                 50-21 (for FTD courses).

                         VALIDATE INSTRUCTION


Synopsis         Validation begins as soon as proposed CCDs are printed in their
                 final form. The initial step of the validation phase makes copies
                 of CCDs available to MAJCOMs, FTDs, and/or the Prime Center
                 responsible for weapon systems support (for their review and
                 recommendations). Review and recommendations by these
                 agencies includes providing instruction to a small group of
                 specialists. Time constraints placed on this test bed determine
                 the extent of the validation phase.

                         STEPS 14 AND 15
                  CONDUCT AND EVALUATE TRAINING


Synopsis          These steps represent the final proof of the ISD process. They’re
                  accomplished in a formal training environment at the operational
                  site. At this point, conduct, management, and evaluation of the
                  course are the responsibility of the using agency. If training
                  analysis and development are performed properly, the result is a
                  training program that instructors are familiar with, and hardware
                  training devices that are justified.
