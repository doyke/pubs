                                            Chapter 2

                                      AA&E SHIPMENTS

2.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel whose duties involve receiving, processing,
packaging, handling and shipping of AA&E.
2.2. Location of Operations.
     2.2.1. Aircraft: Load/download will be at the designated explosive “hot cargo” area. For
     EAFB the “hot cargo” pad is located next to the Control Tower, Bldg 7107.
     2.2.2. Trucks: Load/download in accordance with base explosive site plans. EAFB’s
     explosive load/download area for trucks is located in the Munitions Storage Area (MSA).
2.3. Movement Routes.
     2.3.1. The primary entry to the base for delivery trucks is the Bismark Gate. In the event
     that the Bismark Gate is closed during normal duty hours, 28th Security Forces Squadron (28
     SFS) personnel must be contacted by 28th Logistics Readiness Squadron Logistics Cargo
     Movement (28 LRS/LGRDDC) personnel to allow entry of any and all delivery trucks
     through the Bismark Gate. All categories of munitions/explosives will be escorted by
     owner/user personnel; however Class 1.1/1.2/1.3 AA&E will be escorted by 28 SFS during
     non duty hours to the MSA after 28th Logistics Readiness Squadron (28 LRS/LGRDC)
     personnel have accomplished the DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting
     Hazardous Materials). For all Class 1.3/1.4 AA&E, 28 LRS/LGRDC personnel will escort
     to the MSA upon completion of the DD Form 626 and verification by 28th Security Forces
     Squadron Commander. After normal duty hours 28 SFS will provide escort for Category 1.4
     only after 28 LRS/LGRDC personnel have inspected the vehicle using the DD Form 626. 28
     SFS will escort the shipment to the railhead adjacent to Combat Arms Training Maintenance.
     2.3.2. Vehicle Inspection: The Bismark Gate is designated as the base’s vehicle inspection
     station.
     2.3.3. Suspicious Vehicle Holding Area: Suspicious vehicles will not be allowed on the
     installation. If a vehicle is considered suspicious, 28 SFS will be contacted at 385-4001.
     2.3.4. SVHA: The SVHA is located on a graveled section of Scott Dr. The area is
     approximately a 30’x80’ area and is identified by markers on the right shoulder. The
     following compensatory measures will be used to mitigate risk to unrelated personnel and
     meet explosive quantity/distance requirements outlined in para 2.3.4.1.
        2.3.4.1. Access to Scott Dr. will be restricted north of the railroad tracks to meet Public
        Traffic Route (PTR). Units escorting commercial carriers will be responsible for
        restricting access at this point. Road cones will be utilized until a permanent gate is
        installed.
        2.3.4.2. Explosive limits for the SVHA are as follows:

                                            Chapter 3

                                 CLASSIFIED SHIPMENTS

3.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel involved with the processing, packaging, and
shipment of classified, controlled, sensitive and nuclear related material.
3.2. Procedures.
   3.2.1. All units/personnel that offer for shipment classified material will ensure the asset is
   properly identified on the shipping documents (DD Form 1348-1 and/or DD Form 1149).
   Additionally, the 1348-1As/1149s will include the applicable CIIC/SRC code and must be
   marked, in RED, identifying the degree of classification, i.e., SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL,
   or CCI.
Note: “TOP SECRET” shipments are not authorized to be processed through 28 LRS/LGRDDC
section.

   3.2.2. 28 LRS/LGRDCO will (for classified shipments up to 150 lbs):
       3.2.2.1. Establish delivery receipt times with the shipper. Normally, classified shipments
       will be received and processed between 0800-1300 Monday-Thursday.
       3.2.2.2. Designate qualified personnel to receipt for classified material.
       3.2.2.3. Initiate and use the established checklist (AFI 24-203, Atch 6) for processing
       classified material.
       3.2.2.4. Ensure all classified shipments are safeguarded during the receiving, packing,
       and handling process. Shipments will be handled, packed, processed and then logged
       into the classified storage areas O1T or O1B, as necessary. Classified shipments will not
       be left unattended/unprotected. Currently Cargo Movement DOES NOT have a
       classified cage, all classified have eyes-on until shipment leaves this location.
       3.2.2.5. Ensure the DD Form 1348-1A and/or DD Form 1149, has the applicable
       CIIC/SRC and is marked, in RED, to reflect the degree of classification, i.e. “SECRET,”
       “CONFIDENTIAL,” or “CCI.”
       3.2.2.6. Use Standard Asset Tracking System (SATS) electronic signature as required. If
       a discrepancy is detected which cannot be resolved on the spot, escalate to the section
       supervisor.
       3.2.2.7. Ensure each item is enclosed in two opaque sealed containers or similar
       wrappings. If the classified material is an internal component of an item of equipment,
       the outside shell or body of the item may be considered to be a sufficient enclosure if it
       does not reveal classified information. Specialized shipping containers including closed
       cargo transporters may also be considered the outer wrapping or cover.
       3.2.2.8. Ensure all previous markings on exterior shipping container are obliterated. No
       new markings on the exterior container will contain any information indicating the piece
       is of a classified nature, e.g. security classification marking or Transportation Protective
ELLSWORTHAFBI24-203 8 JANUARY 2009                                                         11


     Service required. Note: Maintenance Technical Orders (TOs) may require a
     nomenclature marking on exterior.
     3.2.2.9. Ensure all copies of the shipping documents are enclosed inside the exterior
     container.
     3.2.2.10. Ensure all seams and openings are taped.
     3.2.2.11. Enter required information into the Cargo Movement Operations System and
     affix DD Form 1387, Military Shipping Label, to cargo. Paper labels other than pressure-
     sensitive shall be securely affixed with a water resistant label adhesive or PPP-T-60
     waterproof, pressure sensitive tape. PPP-T-60 tape will be placed over the entire surface
     of the label.
     3.2.2.12. Ensure DD Form 1348-1A and DD Form 1149, shipment planning worksheet is
     complete and accurate, i.e. pieces, weight, cube, etc.
     3.2.2.13. Process confidential/SECRET shipments tendered to a DOD Domestic Express
     Small Package Service (DESPS) contract carrier(s) in accordance with, AFI 24-203, Para
     5-12. For SECRET shipments, packing and crating will ensure proper packaging has
     been accomplished, and turned over to Outbound Freight for movement IAW para
     2.5.2.3. of this wing instruction. THIS MODE/METHOD WILL NOT BE USED FOR
     MOVEMENT OF CLASSIFIED, SENSITIVE CCI TO AN AMC APOE FOR
     ONWARD MOVEMENT AIRLIFT OR WHEN THE ITEM ALSO CONTAINS
     HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.
         3.2.2.13.1. The DESPS carrier(s) will be used only when next-day delivery can be
         provided. This mode WILL NOT be used on Friday unless “Saturday Delivery” has
         been coordinated with consignee.
         3.2.2.13.2. Verify the shipment against the manifest/pickup record before physically
         removing the item from the security cage and ensure the sign-in/sign-out log has been
         properly signed.
         3.2.2.13.3. Prepare and forward a REPSHIP to consignee prior to or immediately
         after shipment’s departure per DOD 4500.9-R, Chapter 205, Para. L. If a fax or e-
         mail cannot be transmitted, a telephone REPSHIP will be accomplished with the
         consignee. This will be documented with name of person talked to, DSN number
         called, date and time called.
         3.2.2.13.4. Hand all associated documentation to designated personnel in Outbound
         Freight.

     3.2.3.4. Prepare the bill of lading using proper tenders, routing instruction notes and
     Transportation Facility Guide instructions.
     3.2.3.5. Release property to the carrier. Ensure shipping documents, CBL and DD Form
     1907 are appropriately signed after checking the driver's license(s) and carrier/DOD
     authorization to carry classified material.
     3.2.3.6. Prepare and forward a REPSHIP to consignee prior to or immediately after
     shipment’s departure per DOD 4500.9-R, Chapter 205, Para. L. If a fax or e-mail cannot
     be transmitted, a telephone REPSHIP will be accomplished with the consignee. This will
     be documented with name of person talked to, DSN number called, date and time called.
     If consignee does not acknowledge receipt of REPSHIP, Outbound Freight will contact
     the consignee following 2 duty days, in an attempt to gain confirmation.
     3.2.3.7. Within 24 hours of RDD, Outbound Freight will contact the consignee for
     verification of receipt of cargo. If consignee is unable to confirm receipt of cargo on
     RDD, Outbound Freight will contact consignee again following 2 duty days. If
     consignee does not confirm receipt of cargo by RDD + 2 duty days, Outbound Freight
     will initiate a Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR). If consignee does not respond,
     then verification may be made through the carrier’s electronic signature service via the
     Defense Transportation Tracking System (DTTS), or the carrier’s automated tracking
     system.
     3.2.3.8. File signed checklist with CBL.
  3.2.4. Inbound Receiving will:
     3.2.4.1. EAFB Transportation Facility Guide directs consignment of logistical material
     into the base supply central receiving section, 1600 Tinker Drive, Bldg 7510. In-
     checkers must handle all small package carrier deliveries as classified material. An
     indication that a small package is/may be classified is receipt of a REPSHIP and the
     absence of a packing envelope on the outside of the container. For a classified shipment
     other than a small package, the driver will provide a DD Form 1907.
     3.2.4.2. Only personnel that are cleared and listed on the Classified Receipt Listing are
     authorized to receipt and/or process small package carrier deliveries (Note: Only the
     JPAS will be used to verify Security Clearance Eligibility, Investigation Status, and
     Access Levels; therefore units must provide the 28 LRS an update immediately if an
     individual's Clearance Eligibility and/or Access Level is downgraded or changed).
     Packages will be secured by constant monitoring or stored in the classified storage area
     located at Bldg 7510, Receiving Section until turned over to the customer. Inbound
     personnel will open each package as part of the receiving process. Upon identification of
     a classified item, inbound receiving personnel will initiate and use the receiving checklist
     for classified material (AFI 24-203, Atch 7).
     3.2.4.3. The classified cargo may be turned over to the consignee after the individual is
     confirmed on the classified receipt listing with documentation of the transaction on DD
     Form 1907.
