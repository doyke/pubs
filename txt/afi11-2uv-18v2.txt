                                          GENERAL

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. Units will conduct all evaluations in accordance with the
provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction.
1.2. Procedures:
   1.2.1. Flight examiners (FE) use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
   conducting flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, each FE must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
   evaluation criteria.
   1.2.2. Unless specified, the examinee or FE may fly in the seat that best enables the FE to
   conduct a thorough evaluation. The FE normally occupies the left seat during periodic
   instructor mission evaluations.
   1.2.3. Prior to the flight, the FE briefs the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
   how it is conducted. The examinee accomplishes required flight planning during the
   evaluation and furnishes the FE a copy of necessary mission data and maps if required.
   1.2.4. The FE thoroughly debriefs all aspects of the flight. These debriefs will include the
   examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and any required additional training. A squadron supervisor must attend the debrief if the
   overall grade is Q-3.
   1.2.5. To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully complete a dedicated
   initial instructor evaluation. Subsequently, crewmembers designated as instructors will be
   evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. The FE will act as a
   student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
1.3. Grading Instructions:
   1.3.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and
   stable aircraft conditions. Momentary deviations from tolerances are not considered in
   grading provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
   jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the area grade.
   1.3.2. FEs will use the evaluation criteria in paragraphs 1.3.5 and 3.1 to determine individual
   area grades. When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards,
   FEs will make appropriate comments stating performance and/or instruction was
   commendable in the Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8,
   Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas
   is subjective and specific situations are not covered.
   1.3.3. The FEs will derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the
   area grades, based on a composite of the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2, this instruction, and FE judgment.
   1.3.4. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to
   successfully achieve the mission objectives. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in
 4                                                             AFI11-2UV-18V2 15 AUGUST 2011


     any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3). Critical areas
     are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the area title in Chapter 3. Grade critical areas as ―Q‖ or ―U.‖
     1.3.5. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as
     noted within the evaluation criteria in Chapter 3).

1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE):
     1.4.1. The FE will administer an oral EPE either on the ground or in flight. During the
     evaluation, the FE will include a sampling of emergency procedures resolved to a logical
     conclusion.
     1.4.2. The FE will include           an      evaluation   of   the       following   items   on   an
     instrument/qualification EPE:
        1.4.2.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
        1.4.2.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate all boldface procedures and at least one
        noncritical aircraft emergency procedure.
        1.4.2.3. Alternate or divert airfields.
        1.4.2.4. Cockpit/crew resource management (CRM).
     1.4.3. The FE will include an evaluation of jump emergencies on a mission EPE.
     1.4.4. Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because
     of an unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a
     successful reevaluation. For each EPE graded ―qualified with additional training required,‖
     the FE will indicate whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next
     flight.
1.5. Completion of AF Form 8. Record and certify aircrew member qualification using the AF
Form 8 in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Additionally, with the exception of
restrictions and exceptionally qualified designation (if used), place all comments on the reverse
side of the AF Form 8.
1.6. Changes and Waivers:
     1.6.1. HQ USAF/A3/5 is approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction.
     1.6.2. Each MAJCOM director of operations is waiver authority for this instruction, IAW
     AFI 11-202, Volume 2.

                                EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
      2.1.1. There are five types of evaluations in the UV-18: qualification (QUAL), mission
      (MSN), instrument (INSTM), instructor (INSTR), and SPOT. Evaluations include requisites
      and required areas. Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is required (R) for an evaluation.
      Table 2.2 prescribes required areas that must be included in the flight evaluation profile.
      Evaluation areas are aligned under the type of evaluation.
      2.1.2. If it is impossible to accomplish a required area in flight, the FE may elect to evaluate
      the areas by an alternate method (aircrew training device, orally, etc.) in order to complete
      the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately evaluated by an
      alternate method, the examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the
      evaluation. The FE will document the alternate evaluation method in the Examiner’s
      Remarks in the Comments block of AF Form 8.
2.2. Requisites. Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When
evaluations are combined, the examinee will accomplish all requisites for each evaluation. The
FE will document requisites in the ground phase of the AF Form 8. Units will combine similar
exams into a single test and enter as one requisite on the AF Form 8.

2.3. Copilot Evaluations:
      2.3.1. All copilot evaluations are combined INSTM and QUAL evaluations. For mission
      copilots, include the MSN evaluation.
      2.3.2. The FE will brief the sortie profile and flies from the left seat. Include all required
      areas from Table 2.2 (for the evaluations given) in the flight evaluation profile. The examinee
      will accomplish a normal instrument flight rules (IFR) departure. Evaluate a sampling of
      instrument maneuvers including unusual attitudes, holding, fix-to-fix, circling, or arcing. On
      MSN evaluations, evaluate Area 33, Wind Drift Indicator (WDI)/Jump Pattern Procedures
      (simulated or actual).

 Notes:
 1. Sample either power-on or traffic pattern stalls.
 2. Sample either slow flight or steep turns.
 3. For INSTM evaluations, at least one of the following is required: unusual attitudes,
 holding, fix-to-fix, arcing, or circling approach.
 LEGEND:
 R – Required

2.4. Pilot Evaluations:
     2.4.1. All pilot evaluations are combined INSTM and QUAL evaluations. For combined
     MSN evaluations, evaluate Area 33, WDI/Jump Pattern Procedures (simulated or actual).
     2.4.2. The FE will brief the sortie profile and fly the majority of the profile from the right
     seat. Include all required areas from Table 2.2 (for the evaluations given) in the flight
     evaluation profile. The examinee will accomplish a normal IFR departure. Evaluate a
     sampling of instrument maneuvers, including unusual attitudes, holding, fix-to-fix, circling,
     or arcing.
     2.4.3. The examinee will perform normal and single engine approaches and fly a visual
     pattern, nonprecision and precision approaches (at least one of each), and 0-, 10-, and 20-
     degree flap landings, including at least one right-seat takeoff and landing.
2.5. Aircraft Commander Evaluations:
     2.5.1. All aircraft commander evaluations are combined MSN and QUAL evaluations.
     2.5.2. The examinee will brief the sortie profile and flies from the left seat. Normally this
     evaluation is flown as an out and back with a visual flight rules (VFR) drop-in at an
     uncontrolled field, required area work, simulated off-station jump demo, and instrument
     procedures. Other profiles may be flown with FE concurrence. Include all required areas
     from Table 2.2 (for the evaluations given) in the flight evaluation profile.
     2.5.3. The examinee will accomplish a normal IFR departure, perform normal and single
     engine approaches and fly a visual pattern and 0-, 10-, and 20-degree flap landings. If an
     INSTM evaluation is combined with this evaluation, accomplish nonprecision and precision
     approaches (at least one of each) and sample instrument maneuvers, including unusual
     attitudes, holding, fix-to-fix, circling, or arcing.

2.6. Instructor Pilot Evaluations:
   2.6.1. All instructor evaluations are combined MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluations to test
   both proficiency and instructor ability.
   2.6.2. The examinee briefs the sortie profile and flies from the right seat. Include all required
   areas from Table 2.2 in the flight evaluation profile. Accomplish a normal IFR departure.
   Evaluate a sampling of instrument maneuvers, including unusual attitudes, holding, fix-to-
   fix, circling, or arcing.
   2.6.3. The examinee will accomplish Area 33, WDI/Jump Pattern Procedures, and perform
   normal and single engine approaches, a visual pattern, nonprecision and precision approaches
   (at least one of each), and 0-, 10-, and 20-degree and full-flap landings.
