                                  GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Responsibilities. This instruction prescribes procedures for operating F-16 aircraft under
most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically
addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                        9


                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

Section 2A—-General

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations. Accomplish
sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map
preparation, and takeoff/landing data. (T-1).
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. Bird Watch Conditions are
defined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFPAM 91-212,
Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques. The OG/CC will
determine local BASH procedures. (T-1).
   2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
   phase II period increase likelihood of birdstrike. Significant bird hazards are published in
   FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance.
   2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
   appropriate decisions based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
   airfield personnel. (T-1).
   2.2.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
   United States Avian Hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com) provides BASH
   information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, PFPS software overlay, and
   latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information. (T-1).
2.3. Standards. The OG/CC may publish and approve group or wing standards. Operations
Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11-series compliance prior to
publication. (T-1).
2.4. CBRNE. Procedures for operation in a CBRNE-threat environment are contained in
Attachment 2.
2.5. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.5.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum TOLD requirements on the MDC are:
   2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal
   speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; normal landing speed and
   distance (dry/wet); heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and distance
   (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, evaluate aircraft performance by
   comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000 foot
   acceleration check speed. (T-1).
   2.5.2. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas. (T-1).
 10                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


   2.5.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational
   flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
   2.5.4. Low Altitude Maps.
       2.5.4.1. On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart
       Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. It will be of such
       scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits
       navigation and safe mission accomplishment. Circle/highlight manmade obstacles at
       above planned flight altitude within 5nm of the planned route. Annotate time or distance
       tick marks and headings. (T-1).
       2.5.4.2. Annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the IFR Off Airways guidance in AFI
       11-202V3 chapter 8. (T-1).
       2.5.4.3. For flights inside the Continental United states (CONUS) under Visual Flight
       Rules (VFR) or inside Military Training Routes (MTR), comply with the following:
          2.5.4.3.1. Use FLIP AP/1B and either sectional aeronautical charts or mission
          planning software (e.g. PFPS/Falcon View/JMPS). Select the following overlay
          options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,
          MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries. (T-1).
          2.5.4.3.2. Annotate Low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books ,
          with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil
          airfields, and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas
          and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or
          MTR lateral boundary. Annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity
          of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other
          areas of conflict. (T-1).
       2.5.4.4. Outside the CONUS, follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
       on mission planning. If no such guidance exists, use the best charts or flight planning
       software overlay options available to accomplish the intent of maximizing traffic
       awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries. (T-1).
   2.5.5. Digital Terrain System (DTS) and Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System
   (AGCAS). F-16 mission planners will ensure RDTED coverage is adequate for the mission
   area and is loaded to each flight member’s ADTC to ensure maximum AGCAS protection.
   Without appropriate RDTED coverage, or when corrupted data is present, AGCAS will still
   provide recovery protection to 50 feet MSL, however this may not prevent potential ground
   collision when MSL elevation is higher. (T-1).
   2.5.6. All qualified crewmembers will carry current checklists on every flight. (T-1).
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities. (T-
1).
2.7. Overwater. Planned flights over water, outside of the local training area (e.g.,
deployments, cross countries, Programmed Delivery for Maintenance (PDM) inputs, etc) will be
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     11


accomplished two-ship as a minimum. (T-1). Single ship over water flights, outside of the local
training area, require OG/CC approval. (T-3). For deployments under ACC/AOS movement
control, AFI 11-207 waiver authorities will apply.
2.8. Briefing and Debriefing.
   2.8.1. All flight members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with
   unit/squadron supervisors. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing to
   promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the
   capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron
   standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard." (T-1).
   2.8.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on
   complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and must start flight briefings at least 1.5
   hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings will start in sufficient time to be completed
   prior to pilot changeover. Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all minimum
   requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-202V3 are addressed. Additional time and CRM
   emphasis is required in D-model sorties especially on FAM and Incentive flights. Passenger
   must demonstrate oxygen regulator use, ability to establish multiple airways and mask
   removal after being strapped in. (T-1). Reference Attachment 3 for example briefing
   guides. All flight briefings will include:
       2.8.2.1. Weather and NOTAMs (T-1).
       2.8.2.2. Emergency procedures (T-1).
       2.8.2.3. Mission priorities and task management. (T-1).
       2.8.2.4. Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE). (T-1).
       2.8.2.5. Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will
       brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight. (T-1).
   2.8.3. Low-level Briefings will emphasize (T-1):
       2.8.3.1. Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and
       weather avoidance with route abort procedures. (T-1).
       2.8.3.2. Employment of all Collision Avoidance Advisories and Digital Terrain System
       warnings to include AGCAS. (T-1).
       2.8.3.3. Human factors to include task prioritization, g-excess illusion, and perceptual
       issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain. (T-1).
       2.8.3.4. Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as
       well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict. (T-1).
   2.8.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip
   clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of
   flight. (T-1).
   2.8.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days. (T-1).
       2.8.5.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight that is less complex than the primary
       mission. Unbriefed missions/events will not be flown. Mission elements may be
 12                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


      modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads
      will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. Continuation training (CT)
      missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence. (T-1).
      2.8.5.2. During deployed operations, exercises, or multiple-go days when aircraft turn
      times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight
      brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent flights. (T-1).
      2.8.5.3. On multiple-go days, subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity.
      Schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. If that sortie is non-effective
      for weather, maintenance or airspace, IPs may elect to accomplish the planned upgrade
      events in the second sortie. (T-1).
   2.8.6. Debriefing.
      2.8.6.1. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
      responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and sensor
      management. (T-1).
      2.8.6.2. Flight leads will review the video/audio record of all tactical portions of the
      sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness. (T-1). It is imperative to evaluate
      not only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when
      the AGSM breaks down and G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots
      with poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations
      officer. (T-1). The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge
      training in accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
2.9. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of
flight manual checklists must contain all items, verbatim and in order, unless specifically
addressed in the flight manual. (T-1). Pilot aids will contain:
   2.9.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachment 3 for examples). (T-1).
   2.9.2. Local radio channelization. (T-1).
   2.9.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information. (T-1).
   2.9.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
   NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc). (T-1).
   2.9.5. Divert base cable and barrier information. (T-1).
   2.9.6. Bailout and jettison areas. (T-1).
   2.9.7. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation,
   Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing. (T-1).
   2.9.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local
   training areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures.

Section 2B—-Night (see also night of Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6

2.10. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Compute the MSA for each leg of the intended route of
flight in accordance with AFI 11-214. (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                            13


2.11. Night chart requirements. Minimum requirement is a Form 70 or chart/map containing
headings, RAAs, MSAs, and maximum/minimum route structure altitudes. (T-1).

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—-Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. [B/D model aircraft] when the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully qualified
   F-16 pilot, place the stick control switch in the FWD position. (T-1).
   3.1.2. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit; in the avionics bay
   behind the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back). (T-1).
   3.1.3. Do not place objects in or on top of the engine intake. (T-1).
   3.1.4. Secure publications, maps and personal items to avoid flight control/ throttle
   interference. (T-1).
   3.1.5. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) except when using Aircrew Eye and Respiratory
   Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE). (T-1).
   3.1.6. If flying with the COMBAT EDGE vest, remove the port plug on the CRU-94/120 (if
   installed), stow the plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon
   completion of the sortie. (T-1).
   3.1.7. Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position. (T-1).
   3.1.8. Do not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III
   configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2. (T-1).
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
intercom system during all start-engine, pre-taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Use the
intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are
performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas. (T-1).
Do not actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment.
Units with an active air defense commitment may waive use of ground intercom during alert
scrambles. (T-1). When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with
AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. (T-1). The
crew chief will repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system. (T-1).
   3.2.1. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
       3.2.1.1. EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate hand. (T-1).
       3.2.1.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
       motion. (T-1).
       3.2.1.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push
       forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet). (T-1).
       3.2.1.4. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook. (T-1).
       3.2.1.5. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no). (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     15


       3.2.1.6. EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion
       indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors
       may be present. (T-1).
3.3. Taxi and Arming.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission
   requirements dictate, limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots
   in turns. (T-1).
   3.3.2. Ice/Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all portions
   of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. (T-1). When ice and/or
   snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
   (T-1). Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. (T-3).
   3.3.3. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O.
   1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
       3.3.3.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation. (T-1).
       3.3.3.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start. (T-1).
       3.3.3.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and EOR). (T-1). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.
       3.3.3.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-
       off. (T-1).
       3.3.3.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       (T-1). Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified personnel must
       accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. (T-1).
   3.3.4. EPU Check. Do not allow maintenance technicians to approach the aircraft until the
   EPU check is complete. (T-1). Use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe.
   (T-1).
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Place hands in view of ground personnel
while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de-arming are in progress. (T-1). If the intercom
system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
the chief and use visual signals. (T-1). EOR inspections will be accomplished immediately
prior to takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing
the chock area (not required for alert scrambles). (T-1). At non-USAF bases, make every
attempt to coordinate an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit. (T-1).
   3.4.1. Forward Firing Ordnance. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with
   forward firing ordnance. (T-1).
   3.4.2. Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any
   abnormalities. (T-1).

3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width.
Minimum spacing between separated elements/flights is 500 feet. (T-1). Wingmen must
maintain wingtip clearance with their element lead. (T-1). If runway width permits, lineup with
wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight. (T-1).

Section 3B—-Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10. (T-1).
   3.6.2. Pilots will review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as
   short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations and abort sequence in formation
   flights. (T-1).
   3.6.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff. (T-1).
   3.6.4. Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings
   (including remotely operated cables). (T-3).
   3.6.5. OG/CC may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate. (T-3).
   3.6.6. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50
   percent of the available runway. (T-1).
   3.6.7. Centerline Stores. Start the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless
   runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate
   otherwise. (T-1). Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank may takeoff across approach
   end BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system.
   3.6.8. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements is 10 seconds (15 seconds for
   afterburner). (T-1). Increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for join-up on top or when
   carrying live air-to-surface ordnance (excluding BDU-33s and 20mm ammunition). (T-1).
   3.6.9. After releasing brakes, aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway.
   (T-1).
   3.6.10. Formation Takeoff.
       3.6.10.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to two aircraft. (T-1).
       3.6.10.2. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
          3.6.10.2.1. Runway width is less than 125 feet. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.2. Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, BDU-33s,
          20mm ammunition, 2.75 rockets, AGM-88, AGM-65, and night illumination flares).
          (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.5. Ferrying aircraft from contractor/AFMC facilities. (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      17


          3.6.10.2.6. Asymmetric loading or a difference of more than 2,500 pounds gross
          weight. (T-1).
3.7. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.7.1. Day weather minimums for VFR join-ups below a ceiling are 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
   miles (5 km) visibility. (T-1).
   3.7.2. Flight leads will maintain 350 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed. (T-1). Pilots may delay AB cancellation to
   establish closure on lead or lead element. OG/CCs may approve different climb and cruise
   airspeeds within dash one limits. (T-3).
   3.7.3. Battle damage/bomb check will be accomplished on RTB, when practical (i.e.,
   weather prohibits accomplishing BD check). This check is mandatory after expending any
   ordnance (including 20mm ammunition). (T-1).
   3.7.4. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet MSL when practical. (T-1).
   3.7.5. For further join-up procedures, see Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
   Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4).

Section 3C—-Enroute

3.8. Air Refueling.
   3.8.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator. (T-1). Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade or requal pilot is in
   the formation and will request a qualified (non-student) boomer. (T-1).
   3.8.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g., KC-
   10, KC-135) for the first time. (T-1).
   3.8.3. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW ATP-56B and
   AFTTP 3-3.F-16. (T-1).
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) and Automated Recovery Training Series
(ARTS)/Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.9.1. The following are the minimum altitudes for the prescribed maneuvers.
       3.9.1.1. Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling - 10,000 feet AGL, except dive
       recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude). (T-1).
       3.9.1.2. Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) numbers 1, 2 and 3 -
       10,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.3. HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 - 15,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.4. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering.
       (T-1).
       3.9.1.5. HARTS 3 with PARS – 10,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.6. ARTS 2 – 8,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.7. ARTS series number 1, 3, 4, and 5 – 5,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
 18                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


   3.9.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. (T-1). If unavoidable, the aircraft
   should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.9.3. Do not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft
   performance. (T-1). EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during
   intercepts performed by airspace control alert tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below
   5000 feet AGL) VID training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KIAS.
   3.9.4. Do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. (T-1).
   Examples are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to
   gain additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed.
   3.9.5. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition. (T-1).
   3.9.6. The following is guidance for Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series
   (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16):
       3.9.6.1. HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only. (T-1).
       3.9.6.2. In F-16 C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, do not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 unless
       in one of the following configurations: Clean (no tanks), or 300 gallon centerline tank.
       MAU-12s may be carried on stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM-9/AMDs/ACMI/CATM-120s
       may be carried on stations 1, 2, 8 and/or 9. CATM-120s will be symmetrically loaded if
       carried. AIM-9/AMD/ACMI can be symmetric or one missile asymmetric. Inlet
       mounted TGP and/or HTS pods may be carried. (T-1).
       3.9.6.3. For all F-16 Blocks, external tanks should be dry to avoid a faster than expected
       airspeed bleed-off due to excessive weight during the pull up, for all HARTS maneuvers.
   3.9.7. The following is guidance for Automated Recovery Training Series (ARTS) for
   AGCAS/ Pilot Activated Recovery System (PARS) recovery profiles (reference AFTTP3-
   3.F-16): (T-1).
       3.9.7.1. With exception of the HARTS 3 with PARS maneuver, AGCAS/PARS demo
       maneuvers may be flown in any aircraft configuration unless concern for over-g exists.
       However, a CAT I loading is preferred to demonstrate the full maneuvering potential of
       the automated recovery system. Potential for over-g exists if any Nose-low PARS
       maneuver is performed when the aircraft configuration has a symmetric g-limit of less
       than 6.2 g CAT I or 5.2 g CAT III.
       3.9.7.2. AGCAS recoveries shall not be demonstrated by executing dive maneuvers
       toward the ground. AGCAS is designed to provide a minimal buffer above the ground
       during recovery and must not be intentionally activated.
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. (T-1).
Flight members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts
or other assigned tasks. (T-1). Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond
their abilities without sacrificing basic responsibilities. (T-1). Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and
AFTTP 3-1.F-16.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       19


   3.10.1. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. (T-1). Wingmen will be
   prepared to take the lead when directed. (T-1).
   3.10.2. In IMC, the maximum flight size in visual formation is four aircraft except when
   flying in close formation with a tanker. (T-1).
   3.10.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited. (T-1).
   3.10.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, or detailed in local procedures. (T-1). Initiate configuration
   changes for four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. When formation position changes
   are directed by radio, all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. (T-1). A
   radio call is mandatory when directing position changes at night or under instrument
   conditions. (T-1).
   3.10.5. Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot
   has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN). (T-1).
   3.10.6. Lead changes.
      3.10.6.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
      over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
      3E)]. (T-1).
      3.10.6.2. During limited visibility conditions (e.g., night, IMC) initiate lead changes
      from a stabilized, wings level attitude [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
      3E) and Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4). (T-1).
      3.10.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal
      fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T-1).
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3. F-16 and AFI 11-214).
   3.11.1. A G-Ex is required if planned maneuvering will exceed 5G. Accomplish the G-Ex
   day or night, only in VMC, with a discernible horizon, and only when unaided or NVG-aided
   visual cues are adequate to safely perform the maneuver. (T-1). If these requirements are not
   met, omit the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5G. (T-1).
   3.11.2. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g., chase of a G-Ex), flight members
   will follow AFTTP 3-3.F-16 G-Awareness Exercise Procedures. (T-1). Use on-board
   systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior to maneuver
   execution. (T-1).
   3.11.3. Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is
   clear from potential traffic conflicts. (T-1). If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace:
      3.11.3.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g., Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
      Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
      exercise/special mission areas).
      3.11.3.2. In VFR only above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.11.3.3. In VFR only inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
 20                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


      3.11.3.4. In VFR only below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
   3.11.4. Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,
   theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be performed. (T-1). If no
   such guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical extent.
3.12. Tactical Formations.
   3.12.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight
   lead/lead element and they must maintain sight. (T-1). Trailing aircraft/elements are
   responsible for deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when
   required. (T-1). At low altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. (T-1).
   Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during
   formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements,
   not on deconfliction between elements. (T-1). Normally, the wingman is responsible for
   flight path deconfliction, but the flight/element lead becomes primarily responsible when: (T-
   1).
      3.12.1.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
      forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingman becomes
      engaged fighter).
      3.12.1.2. The wingman calls "padlocked".
      3.12.1.3. The wingman calls “blind”. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back
      to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
   3.12.2. Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures.
      3.12.2.1. Flight members will call blind with an altitude to the hundreds of feet, i.e.,
      “Blind 16.9”. (T-1). The visual flight member will respond with “visual” and talk eyes
      on. (T-1).
      3.12.2.2. If the other flight member is also “Blind,” they will call blind with an altitude.
      (T-1). Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the
      wingman’s flow direction. (T-1). Use a minimum of 500 feet (1,000 feet above 5,000
      feet AGL) altitude separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude.
      All flight members must visually clear their flight path. (T-1).
      3.12.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the
      flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
      position of the other flight member/element and climb/descend if necessary. (T-1). If
      visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to
      ensure flight path deconfliction. (T-1). Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes
      and/or adversary blocks must be considered.
   3.12.3. Sensor formations. If SA is lost or “Blind” in a sensor formation, call “Blind” with
   altitude and follow the above procedures. (T-1). Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude
   stack at all times in sensor formation. (T-1).
3.13. Chase Formation.
   3.13.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       21


   (FEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Qualified pilots, including Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery,
   etc) and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Aircrew Training, may be chased
   by Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by
   group/squadron commanders.
   3.13.2. Procedures.
       3.13.2.1. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In-
       flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-tail
       separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In
       the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
       (T-1).
       3.13.2.2. A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail
       clearance out to a range of 1 NM, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide
       assistance. (T-1).
       3.13.2.3. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for ensuring frag
       deconfliction is maintained for his aircraft. (T-1).
3.14. Show Formation. Such formations will be specifically briefed and flown IAW applicable
directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy & Procedures, and applicable MAJCOM or
ANG directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays
and aerial events. (T-1).
   3.14.1. AGCAS SHOW mode may be selected only if operating IAW MAJCOM or ANG
   approved aerial events.
3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1. F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16).
   3.15.1. Airspeed and Altitude. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KIAS
   and the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (or IAW approved step-down training). For
   night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is the MSA (see AFI 11-214) unless operating
   under NVG LOWAT Procedures. (T-1).
   3.15.2. At low altitude, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted attention, knock-
   it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL). (T-
   1).
       3.15.2.1. When a “PULL-UP-PULL-UP” warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate
       action to ensure terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments. (T-1).
       3.15.2.2. F-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings
       will set an altitude that does not result in “PULL-UP” warnings at normal operational
       altitudes. (T-1). Minimum MTC is 50 feet for strafe and visual bombing, and 25% of
       LOWAT Category minimum altitude for all other operations. Wings with significant tall
       trees in the operating area or VR routes will account for average tree height when setting
       MTC altitudes. (T-1).
 22                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


       3.15.2.3. F-16’s equipped with an operational AGCAS will ensure NORM mode is
       selected prior to LOWAT operations down to 500’AGL to include HAS and LAS events.
       (T-1). If operations are required below 500’AGL, AGCAS MIN mode may be selected
       to prevent nuisance fly-ups. (T-3).
   3.15.3. Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. For low altitude
   training outside the CONUS, comply with theater/host nation guidance. (T-1).
       3.15.3.1. Deteriorating weather on a VR Route.
           3.15.3.1.1. Able to maintain VMC. If it becomes apparent that weather ahead will
           not permit continued flight on the VR, maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit
           the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude. (T-0).
           3.15.3.1.2. Unable to maintain VMC. Climb to briefed deconfliction altitudes
           (reference Chapter 2). Squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a
           controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if required. Maintain preplanned
           ground track. (T-1).
   3.15.4. Obstacle/Terrain Avoidance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
   separation from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight
   leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that
   ensures vertical separation. (T-1).
   3.15.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead. (T-1).
   3.15.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright bunting
   maneuvers. (T-1).

Section 3D—-Recovery and Landing

3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, call gear down no later than 3 NM final. For an
instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), call gear down at the final approach fix or published
glide slope intercept point. For an overhead, call gear down departing the perch. For a SFO or
FO, call gear down at base key. (T-1).
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach will normally be flown at 11 degrees AOA.
Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA. (T-1).
3.18. Landing restrictions. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the
available runway, land at an alternate if possible. When the RCR at the base of intended landing
is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g.,
MA-1A, 61QS11). (T-1).
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.
   3.19.1. The desired touchdown point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a
   VFR approach is the threshold. The aim point for a precision approach is the glide path
   interception point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, touch down either past a
   raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. With centerline stores, touchdown
   will normally be past an approach-end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                        23


   the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or an
   aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. Single-ship or
   formation landings with centerline stores may be made across BAK-12 arrestment cables
   which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system. (T-1).
   3.19.2. Touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 degree approach will be a
   minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and
   speedbrake/tail scrapes. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft
   is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar fighter
   aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-15) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base,
   whichever is higher. (T-1).
       3.19.2.1. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing with a
       light tail wind, spacing will be increased to 6,000 feet minimum. (T-1). Under these
       conditions, moderate to severe wake turbulence has been reported out to 7,000 foot
       touchdown spacing.
   3.19.3. All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when
   speed/conditions permit. (T-1).
3.20. Low Approaches.
   3.20.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes: (T-1).
       3.20.1.1. IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.2. Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.3. Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.20.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.21. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Do not fly
them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank. (T-1).
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unless the OG/CC determines that local conditions (e.g.,
threat condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, do not fly overhead patterns with
unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33). (T-3).
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted if the following conditions are met:
   3.23.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
   3.23.2. Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate
   air traffic control agencies.
   3.23.3. The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000
   feet in trail will be considered a separate flight).
   3.23.4. No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid
   requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind).
 24                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. An element low
approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on
downwind at 200-250 KIAS.
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.25.1. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front
   cockpit. (T-1).
   3.25.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take
   control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary. (T-1).
3.26. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.26.1. Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. (T-1). Consider symmetrical as those stores
   loadings which do not require an abnormal trim or control application to counter a heavy
   wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed.
   3.26.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element. (T-1).
   3.26.3. Use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. Fly a published precision
   instrument approach if one is available. If not, fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight
   in and reference available lighting systems (e.g., VASI, PAPI) for descent angle. (T-1).
   3.26.4. If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side.
   (T-1).
   3.26.5. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing. If the
   wingman overruns lead after landing, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side of
   the runway and wingtip clearance. Do not attempt to reposition behind lead. (T-1).
   3.26.6. Do not make formation landings when: (T-1).
       3.26.6.1. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.26.6.2. The runway is wet or reported wet.
       3.26.6.3. There is ice, slush, or snow on the runway.
       3.26.6.4. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.26.6.5. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach
       end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations).
       3.26.6.6. Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs.
       3.26.6.7. The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 miles visibility (or a flight
       member's weather category, whichever is higher). This applies to chased approaches and
       formation low approaches.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       25


Section 3E—-Night (see also night of Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)

3.27. General Night Procedures.
   3.27.1. Night Ground Operations. The anti-collision (strobe) light may be OFF and the
   position lights STEADY if they prove to be a distraction. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of
   300 feet and on the taxiway centerline. (T-1). The taxi light will normally be used during all
   night taxiing. Exception: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an
   aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
   visually cleared without the taxi light.
   3.27.2. Night Takeoff. Aircraft will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights
   FLASH for takeoffs, unless IMC will be encountered shortly after takeoff. (T-3). Exception:
   For formation takeoffs, flight/element leads will turn the anti-collision light OFF and position
   lights STEADY after reaching the run-up position on the runway. During a night formation
   takeoff, brake release, gear retraction and AB termination will be called on the radio. (T-1).
   Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL
   before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   (T-3).
   3.27.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is 3,000 foot
   ceiling and 5 miles visibility. (T-1). After join-up, the anti-collision light will be OFF and
   position lights will be STEADY for all except the last aircraft, which will keep the anti-
   collision light ON and position lights FLASH unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   (T-3).
   3.27.4. Position/Lead Changes. Unless operating with NVGs, do not change lead or wing
   positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. Call such changes over the radio
   and initiate them from a stabilized, wings-level attitude whenever possible. (T-1).
   3.27.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a night formation break-up, the flight lead will confirm
   position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
   acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids. (T-1).
   3.27.6. Night Landing. Land from the most precise approach available. Night formation
   landings will only be performed when required for safe recovery of the aircraft. (T-1).
3.28. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
   3.28.1. NVG Preflight. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted/focused for the
   individual pilot using (in order of preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye
   lane, or equivalent. (T-1). Reference AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
   Program.
   3.28.2. Cockpit Lighting. Fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting MAJCOM
   designates as NVG compatible. (T-2). MAJCOMs will only make such a designation if all
   control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated by the NVG-compatible
   lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event they need to
   transition to instruments. (T-1).
   3.28.3. Weather/Visibility/Illumination Levels/Minimum Altitudes/Discernable Horizon.
   Reference AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-3.F-16, and AFI 11-202V3. All pilots conducting NVG
26                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


  operations that include air-to-air/surface-to-air threat reactions or air-to-ground
  dynamic/diving deliveries will conduct a “30-Up and 30-Down” horizon orientation
  maneuver before conducting tactical maneuvering.         (T-1). This maneuver will be
  accomplished in VMC, above the MSA and should be completed after the G-awareness
  exercise. The purpose is to evaluate horizon conditions and practice an NVG horizon
  orientation and crosscheck. If airspace precludes the maneuver, pilots operating on NVGs
  will limit maneuvers to AFI11-214 “Restricted Maneuvering” guidelines. (T-1). Pilots will
  adhere to the following guidelines when conducting the 30-Up and 30-Down maneuver: (T-
  1).
     3.28.3.1. In VMC conditions (with a discernible horizon), and with sufficient altitude
     (~3,000-5,000 feet) in approved operating airspace, accelerate to 350 KIAS minimum.
     Maintain a minimum spacing of 6000 feet between aircraft throughout the maneuver.
     The flight lead will announce, “Standby 30-UP, 30-Down” and will communicate a
     reference heading prior to execution for flight deconfliction. Flight members will verify
     correct spacing, heading, and entry parameters and will communicate “stand by” if not
     ready.
     3.28.3.2. Flight leads will command “30 Up,” and all pilots will execute a military
     power, 3-4 G wings-level pull up to place the bore cross on the 30 degree pitch ladder.
     Pilots will evaluate and orient themselves with the horizon in the forward quadrants, both
     above and below the horizon while maintaining intra-flight deconfliction contracts. Take
     note of the physical cranial movement required to move the NVG field of regard back to
     the horizon, as well as the condition of the horizon due to ambient factors. If at any time
     the airspeed drops below 250 KIAS, weather is encountered, or symptoms of spatial
     disorientation are recognized, the pilot will immediately transition to primary flight
     instruments, call a “knock it off (with reason),” and conduct an IMC nose-high recovery.
     3.28.3.3. After approximately 5 seconds, or sooner if airspace or altitude restrictions
     require, the flight lead will command “roll left (or right), 30 down”. All aircraft will roll
     inverted and accomplish the military power, 3-4 G wings-level pull to place the bore
     cross at the 30 degree nose-low, then roll upright on the reference heading. Once intra-
     flight deconfliction is assured, repeat the horizon crosscheck and visibility assessment
     while maintaining the 30 degree-nose low attitude.
     3.28.3.4. If during any portion of the maneuver a flight member determines that the
     visibility or horizon reference is unsuitable for tactical maneuvering per AFI-11-214
     guidance, the flight lead will modify the training profile and either transition to non-NVG
     formations or NVG formation tactics limited to AFI11-214 “Restricted Maneuvering”
     guidelines. Continually modify profiles or airspace utilization throughout the sortie if
     conditions change and no longer permit the planned maneuvering. Flight training
     modification includes: restricted maneuvering limitations (with or without NVGs) per
     AFI-11-214, a non-NVG formation IMC game plan, or accomplishing a briefed alternate
     mission without NVGs.
     3.28.3.5. Pilots will continually cross-check visually perceived attitude aided by NVGs
     with frequent cross-checks of primary flight instruments throughout the mission.
  3.28.4. NVG Qualifications. Do not wear NVGs in flight unless the pilot is NVG qualified
  or there is a qualified NVG IP in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non-NVG qualified
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      27


   pilot). (T-1). F-16B/D Familiarization flights are authorized if appropriate academics are
   accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat. (T-1).
   3.28.5. Radio Calls. All flight members will make a radio call when donning, raising, or
   stowing NVGs. (T-1).
   3.28.6. Obstacle/Intra-Flight Deconfliction. When flying in route, only one flight member
   per element will don/raise/stow NVGs at a time. Flight leads will call turns if forced to
   maneuver while flight members are donning/raising/stowing NVGs. (T-1).
   3.28.7. Takeoffs/Landings. NVGs will be stowed or raised during takeoff until at or above
   2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. Stow or raise NVGs no later
   than 5 minutes prior to landing unless NVGs are required to handle an emergency or mission
   requirements dictate. (T-1).
   3.28.8. NVG Use during Air to Air Refueling (AAR). Stow or raise NVGs no later than the
   stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect. (T-1).

Section 3F—-Other

3.29. Targeting Pod Operations. Do not use the TGP for anything other than navigational SA
below 1,000 feet AGL (e.g., Only VID aircraft, designate for weapons delivery, etc. above 1,000
feet AGL). (T-1). (USAFWC, Test, and AATC: Minimum altitudes for TGP operations are
established in WIC or test syllabus requirements, continuation training plans or operational test
and evaluation requirements).
3.30. Radio Procedures. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign (except
for wingman acknowledgment). Transmit only that information essential for mission
accomplishment or safety of flight. (T-1).
   3.30.1. Radio Checks. Acknowledge radio checks, which do not require the transmission of
   specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:               "2, 3, 4").
   Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of
   being completed or is understood by the flight member. (T-1).
   3.30.2. Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding
   the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. If flight members are not monitoring in-flight
   ATC frequency, the flight lead will pass all ATC instructions to the flight. Flight members
   will acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead. (T-1).
   3.30.3. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-
   1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations. (T-1).
   3.30.4. Ops Checks.
       3.30.4.1. Monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an out of
       balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency should be increased during tactical
       maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are required: (T-1).
           3.30.4.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
           3.30.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty.
           3.30.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
 28                                     AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


           3.30.4.1.4. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if
           multiple passes are made and after departing the range.
       3.30.4.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
       quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system and cabin altitude. If the G-suit
       malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all ACBT maneuvering until normal
       operation is reestablished. (T-1).
       3.30.4.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or
       visual signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal. (T-1).
           3.30.4.3.1. During Ops checks, ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is returned to
           the NORM position. (T-1). Totalizer-only Ops checks may be used periodically
           during high demand phases of flight.
           3.30.4.3.2. For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are carried, each flight
           member will check the external tank(s) and add “Tank(s) feeding/dry” to the Ops
           Check. (T-1). Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be
           omitted from subsequent ops checks.
           3.30.4.3.3. Do not substitute data-linked fuel status for operations checks. (T-1).
3.31. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential
for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference.
3.32. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of an F-16B/D must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement "You have the
aircraft." The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft." Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. (T-1).
Exception: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft)
will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless
briefed otherwise. (T-3).
3.33. Fuel Requirements. (T-1).
   3.33.1. Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel quantity needed to terminate an event and proceed with
   the remainder of the mission.
   3.33.2. Bingo Fuel. A briefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.33.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel quantity on initial or at the FAF at the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is
   established locally or:
       3.33.3.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 1,000 pounds.
       3.33.3.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,200 pounds.
   3.33.4. Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an
   aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing
   or alternate, if required, with:
       3.33.4.1. Minimum Fuel:
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     29


          3.33.4.1.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 800 pounds or less.
          3.33.4.1.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,000 pounds or less.
       3.33.4.2. Emergency Fuel:
          3.33.4.2.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 600 pounds or less.
          3.33.4.2.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 800 pounds or less.
   3.33.5. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established bingo
   fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
3.34. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.
   3.34.1. If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.),
   turn them on for all flights. Set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. PGCAS
   will be enabled with a minimum altitude setting of 200 feet for day operations and 700 feet
   for night operations. AGCAS mode (NORM/MIN/SHOW) will be set per mission
   requirements and confirmed mode selected. AGCAS should only be turned off if a known
   system malfunction affecting safety of flight requires system deactivation. Pilots will ensure
   that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff. For low altitude operations GCAS
   settings, reference 3.15.2.2 this publication. (T-1).
3.35. ALOW Setting. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter at the briefed minimum
altitude, the command-directed minimum altitude, or as briefed, whichever is highest. (T-1).
3.36. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Do not conduct training missions when surface winds
along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state. Do not conduct over water
training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the sea state exceeds
10 feet (or 4 meters-USAFE). (T-1). This is not intended to restrict operations when only a
small portion of the route is affected. (T-3). The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
3.37. Airborne Interrogator Friend Foe (AIFF) Operation. (T-1).
   3.37.1. To reduce the potential for adverse effects on Combat Identification, Air Traffic
   Control, and Traffic Collision Avoidance systems, pilots will limit interrogations to the
   minimum required for the mission.
   3.37.2. For AIFF operations within the United States and its Possessions (US&P), pilots
   will comply with the equipment and operational restrictions as specified in the applicable
   Radio Frequency Authorizations (RFA's) which can be obtained from the unit spectrum
   management office.

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Head-Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block, do not use the HUD to recover
   from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when no other
   reference is available. The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/42/50/52
   aircraft has been certified as a primary flight instrument and may be used as a primary flight
   reference in night/IMC conditions. The HUD in all other F-16 Blocks may be used as an
   additional instrument reference only. No F-16 Block may use the HUD as the sole reference
   in night/IMC conditions. (T-1).
   4.1.2. INS/GPS or EGI Use. The F-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV). Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
   observer in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. The observer may occupy either seat of the F-
   16B/D provided the intercom is operable. Use the radar to aid in clearing the area. Pilots in
   F-16A/C aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase. They may fly
   multiple approaches in VMC without a chase, but will place their primary emphasis on
   seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Chase aircraft may move into close formation on final for
   a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated. (T-1).
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join-up.
   4.2.1. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 miles (5 km), each aircraft and element
   will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when
   departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T-1).
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and will
   not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
   airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
   attempts to maintain radar contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument
   procedure, then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will notify ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.1. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.2. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
       4.3.1.3. Normal spacing is 2-3 NM.
       4.3.1.4. Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar/Sensor Contact procedures
       until the aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar/sensor contact and called
       "tied." (T-1).
   4.3.2. No Radar/Sensor Contact. (T-1).
       4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
       turns to maintain the desired spacing.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                        31


     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 NM spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to
     meet the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact. (T-1).
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, except
     to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e., radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures. (T-1).
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS (or as required by local procedures). Upon reaching this speed, the flight leader
     will set a pre-briefed power setting. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise Mach/TAS,
     unless otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Make all turns using 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. En Route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  (T-1).
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery. (T-1).
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at locations where procedures have been
     established. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and local operating procedures
     must address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum, procedures must address each
     recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and maximum spacing
     requirements, lost contact and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
 32                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
       spacing.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure
       that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar.
       4.3.6.7. Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.
       4.3.6.8. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
       4.3.6.9. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
       4.3.6.10. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
       4.3.6.11. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
       4.3.6.12. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
       configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
       all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.13. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.14. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "Callsign
       (C/S) lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
       heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC.
       If contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
       may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If
       separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by
       ATC.
       4.3.6.15. Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail
       recovery will terminate in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveillance
       Radar (ASR) approach.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will
confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or
appropriate GPS/INS waypoint). (T-1).
4.5. Formation Penetration. (T-1).
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                    33


   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation
approach with an F-16 experiencing an Emergency. (T-1).
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures. (T-1).
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen, ICAO)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1.
   4.7.2. The F-16 is Approach Category E. If no Category E minimums are published,
   Category D minimums can be used, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less.
      4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed
      (KTAS) or less. At high density altitudes 260 KTAS may require a KIAS below the
      speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and Category D approaches shall not be flown.

                       AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (T-1).
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment. (T-1).
   5.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW
   T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master
   Arm switch position.
   5.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations. (T-1).
   5.3.1. Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited.
   5.3.2. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering is 350
   KIAS.
   5.3.3. All configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering as defined by AFI 11-
   214. Before conducting unlimited maneuvering in a CAT III configured aircraft, consider
   gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                        35

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

Section 6A—-General

6.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (T-1).
6.2. Simulated Gun Employment. (T-1).
   6.2.1. Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master Arm switch
   position.
   6.2.2. Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm
   switch in SIM) with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). This
   restriction does not apply on a controlled range against targets approved for gun employment
   with ammunition loaded.
   6.2.3. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
6.3. Training Missions with a Hot Gun. (T-1).
   6.3.1. Pilots will not select strafe submode until immediately prior to roll in and will deselect
   strafe submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver.
   6.3.2. When firing the laser, ensure you are not in a mode that will allow the gun to fire.
   6.3.3. AGCAS will not be disabled for strafe operations. (T-3). During LAS an automated
   recovery may occur near 2000’ slant range; therefore cease fire prior to 2000’ slant range or
   rounds may be employed well long of the target during automated pull-up.
6.4. Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets. Do not conduct such attacks
with hung ordnance. Do not conduct them with live ordnance, except for 20 mm ammunition in
a gun safed IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1. When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g.
bombs, external fuel tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load simulated weapons (zero quantity) in
the SMS/MFD only on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations (Exception: Captive Maverick
and HARM missiles may be selected). Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or
SIMULATE prior to the first attack. Flight lead will query and flight members will reply to a
“check zero quantity, uncarted station” radio call. (T-1).
6.5. Weather. In training, do not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling below
2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL. (T-1).
6.6. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS
above 10,000 feet AGL). (T-1).
6.7. Target Identification. Pilots shall positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with ROE. For training sorties, achieve positive
 36                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


identification by either visually acquiring the target or by confirming target location through
valid on-board/off-board cues. Cues may include, but are not limited to, radar, GPS, marking
rounds, TGP or IR Maverick lock on, IR pointers or NVG-compatible marking devices.
Exercise caution when relying on a single cue to confirm target location. (T-1).
6.8. Safety of Ground Personnel. When ground controllers are present on Class B/C ranges,
range personnel will brief pilots on locations of these personnel and each pilot will acknowledge.
Pilots must know applicable range weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and
weapons footprints. Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground
personnel or intended target locations. (T-1).

Section 6B—-Night

6.9. Altitude. Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the guidance in AFI 11-
214. The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS) is the Target MSA (as defined in
Attachment 1) unless executed by an “NVG-LOWAT” or “NVG High Angle Strafe Low
Altitude” qualified pilot (as defined in AFI 11-2F-16 V1) under high-illumination conditions (as
defined in AFI 11-214). For HAS, pilots will review and confirm parameters prior to roll-in. (T-
1).
6.10. Bank Angle. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
structure (<5K AGL). (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       37


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual. (T-1).
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective
   actions have been accomplished.
   7.1.2. Do not fly an aircraft with a tripped engine monitoring system (EMS) Go-No-Go
   indicator (Bit Ball) until maintenance has accomplished the appropriate procedures and
   cleared the fault.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel steering system, the brake
   system, or a generator [Note: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator failure
   (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally].
   7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground or in-flight
   trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete.
   7.1.5. In the F-16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been
   accomplished and will provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.
   7.1.6. For actual/perceived flight control malfunctions, pilots will terminate maneuvering
   and take appropriate action. If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder
   interference, the pilot will take positive action to ensure no further control interference
   occurs.
   7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds dash one limits, terminate tactical maneuvering and
   investigate. If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank and
   can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW TO 1F-16A/C-1. If not, terminate the
   mission. Instruments, deployment missions, level weapons deliveries and straight-through-
   non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until a safe landing is
   possible.
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). CAPs are in Attachment 4.
7.3. Ground Aborts. (T-1).
   7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead will normally renumber the
   flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate
   agencies of such changes.
   7.3.2. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight in accordance with the
   brief or flight lead instructions. If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range,
   all events will be terminated until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
 38                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


7.4. Takeoff Aborts. (T-1).
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, say call sign and intentions when practical.
   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort takeoff if adequate
   clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" will be used to indicate a
   departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" will be used to
   indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will address net barrier raising
   procedures.
   7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KIAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, declare a
   ground emergency. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake
   procedures.
   7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 KIAS, lower the hook. If aborting below 100 KIAS, lower
   the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway.
7.5. Air Aborts. (T-1).
   7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for
   the aborting aircraft is required.
   7.5.3. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
       7.5.3.1. Bird strike
       7.5.3.2. Actual or suspected foreign object damage.
       7.5.3.3. Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance.
       7.5.3.4. Moderate to severe icing.
       7.5.3.5. Over-G (Note: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach).
       7.5.3.6. Flight control system anomalies, including uncommanded departures from
       controlled flight (Exception: intentional departures from controlled flight conducted
       IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that
       reset IAW flight manual procedures.
       7.5.3.7. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown.
       7.5.3.8. Lightning strike.
7.6. Radio Failure (NORDO). Reference AFI 11-205 and the Flight Information Handbook.
   7.6.1. NORDO in Formation. (T-1).
       7.6.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
       maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member
       and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as soon as
       practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A
       formation approach to a drop-off on final should be performed unless safety
       considerations dictate otherwise.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      39


     7.6.1.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
     aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
     flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
     other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
     clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
     signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
     If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
     the base of intended landing or a divert base.                Aircraft experiencing any
     difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
  7.6.2. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range.
     7.6.2.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up
     radio.
     7.6.2.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower on the
     attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight lead
     will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or
     rejoin the flight and RTB.
     7.6.2.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to
     join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.6.3. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range.
     7.6.3.1. Make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while
     rocking wings. The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO
     aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. If the NORDO
     aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass on the target maintaining
     normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic and proceed to a
     recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the
     emergency aircraft.
     7.6.3.2. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude
     landing with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished
     provided the following conditions are met:
     7.6.3.3. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with
     the RCO and the remainder of the flight.
     7.6.3.4. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
     aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.6.4. NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing.
     7.6.4.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
     7.6.4.2. If radio failure occurs, safe the armament switches, join on another member of
     the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.1
     7.6.4.3. Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and
     continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will
 40                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


       join on the tow's wing. Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
       will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight lead will signal when
       the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the banner is
       away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he will take the lead,
       RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the NORDO and establish the
       appropriate landing pattern. If cable remains, follow local procedures.
   7.6.5. NORDO during Recovery.
       7.6.5.1. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.5.2. To signal the need for an approach-end arrestment, lower the tailhook (visual
       formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted).
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. (T-1).
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots. Although
SD is most common at night or in IMC, it can and has happened in day VMC. Reference
AFMAN 11-217V1 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its
consequences.
   7.8.1. Enabling PARS is an acceptable recovery method from SD induced unusual attitudes,
   reference AFTTP 3-3.F16 for recommended throttle techniques during PARS recoveries.
   7.8.2. Pilots should ensure deconfliction from other aircraft (primarily above or below their
   position) prior to PARS activation.
7.9. Lost Wingman. (T-1).
   7.9.1. Priorities. The first priority is to establish safe separation from other aircraft (e.g.,
   tanker or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance
   and clearance from other traffic.
   7.9.2. Prohibitions.   Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC
   conditions.
   7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to instruments and inform lead while
   executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3-3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will
   acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. Once lost
   wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the
   flight lead.
   7.9.4. Two- or Three-Ship Flights. (Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost
   wingman procedures.)
       7.9.4.1. Wings-Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously
       inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume
       heading and obtain a separate clearance.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      41


      7.9.4.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15
      seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
      resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
      separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when
      separation is ensured.
      7.9.4.4. Precision/Non-precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
      ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
      while obtaining a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.5. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
      clearance, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
      procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
      clearance.
   7.9.5. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative
   that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will
   follow the appropriate procedure listed below:
      7.9.5.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30
      degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
      seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate
      clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions. (T-1).
   7.10.1. General. Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a
   known malfunction. If abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight occurs, have the
   launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage
   has occurred.
   7.10.2. Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and
   impact point, if known, and provide the information to debrief personnel. Check switches
   safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining stores as hung and
   obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard,
   jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.3. Hung Freefall Ordnance or Missile Hangfire/Misfire. First confirm switches/SMS
   settings were correct. If they were, record all relevant switch/SMS settings and proceed as
   follows.
 42                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


       7.10.3.1. Hung Live Freefall Ordnance. Attempt delivery using an alternate delivery
       mode, if applicable. If unsuccessful, use selective jettison procedures for the store. If
       unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be
       determined, consider selective jettison of the rack.
       7.10.3.2. Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance. Make an additional attempt to expend.
       If unsuccessful, select an alternate delivery mode and try again. If unsuccessful,
       ordnance from other stations/dispensers may be released provided this does not violate
       load symmetry limits. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable
       area on a single pass, if practical.
       7.10.3.3. Maverick Missile Hangfire. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is
       a hangfire. If able, have a chase pilot inspect such a missile.
       7.10.3.4. Maverick Missile Misfire. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate
       switches were selected is a misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch. If able,
       have a chase pilot inspect the missile for smoke or fire. If either exists, jettison the
       missile on the range. If not, pilots may attempt another pass. If the second attempt fails
       and conditions permit, remain dry in the pattern for 15 minutes, then proceed to the
       recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures.
       7.10.3.5. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures. Visually inspect
       the aircraft for damage, if practical. Declare an emergency (not required for hung
       practice/inert ordnance or hung rockets). Obtain a chase aircraft, if available. Avoid
       populated areas and trail formations. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3. A simulated
emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the actual
emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance
of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.11.1. Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. Instead, use the flight
   simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference. Do
   not practice in-flight engine shutdown. Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is
   available and either an active tower or a ROM (or equivalent, e.g. SOF) is in operation. Do
   not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC. (T-1).
   7.11.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. OG/CCs will establish
   specific procedures for SFO training and establish letters of agreement with appropriate
   agencies. They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume. General
   SFO procedures follow: (T-1).
       7.11.2.1. The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
       the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
       complete the approach.
       7.11.2.2. Do not initiate or continue an SFO if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists
       that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with
       traffic. Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a
       result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. Discontinue an SFO if unable to
       obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. Discontinue an SFO if airspeed drops
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                        43


       below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the
       flare. Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and
       do not attempt to resume the SFO.
       7.11.2.3. Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g., AFMC high
       angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO.
       7.11.2.4. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call.
           7.11.2.4.1. "High Key"
           7.11.2.4.2. "Low Key"
           7.11.2.4.3. "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)"
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. General directive procedures are listed below.
OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the unit supplement to this volume. (T-1).
   7.12.1. Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation.
   7.12.2. Talk. Establish an On Scene Commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency
   situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency
   if necessary.
   7.12.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means
   available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or
   TGP. Pass this information to follow-on SAR forces.
   7.12.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of all
   possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow
   approximately 1 minute per thousand feet (16 feet per second) for parachute descent. The
   OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR.
   7.12.5. Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to
   maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Do not overfly bingo. Relinquish OSC
   duties to more qualified rescue forces (e.g., SANDY 1, US Coast Guard) upon their arrival.
   7.12.6. For overwater SAR/CSAR, OSC will utilize every means available (visual, TGP,
   Radar Ground Map, or Ground Moving Target Modes) to locate vessels that may aid in
   recovery.
7.13. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures. Do not shut down the engine unless
fire/other conditions dictate or directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. Raise the tailhook on
the signal from the arresting crew. Do not taxi until directed to do so by the arresting gear crew.
(T-1).

                                            Chapter 8

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW
AFI 33-360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves
to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot.
Units may supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance: (T-1).
8.1. (AVIANOAB)General. This chapter supplements operational directives and establishes
local procedures for all pilots assigned and attached to the 31st Fighter Wing (FW). Information
contained in other directives will not be repeated in this regulation. Close study of this
regulation, the 31 FW Pilot Aid, 31 FW Standards, current FCIFs, OGRFs and applicable Italian
Publications (PIV, NOTAMs, Manuale BOAT Vol 2, Stato Maggiore Aeronautica [SMA] 7,
SMA 73, Standard Operating Procedure [SOP] ADD 8, SOP ADD – 01, SMA 311) is necessary
to effectively and safely employ from Italy.

       8.1.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Single-Ship Missions.            Single-ship missions are
       permitted in accordance with AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                  45


        8.1.2.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The following are authorized pre-planned single-
        ship missions:
           8.1.2.2.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Incentive orientation flights. See paragraph
           8.1.2.14.

           sorties.
           8.1.2.2.1.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Tasked NATO Exercise Sorties.
           8.1.2.2.1.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Cross-country          sorties,            including
           deployment/redeployment sorties, with 31 OG/CC approval.
           8.1.2.2.1.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Single-ship sorties between Aviano and the
           Depot Level Maintenance Facility at SABCA, Belgium, or any USAFE airbase in
           continental Europe (or flights from those facilities to Aviano) are pre-approved,
           but require 31 OG/CC notification.
           8.1.2.2.1.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Squadron Supervisors may authorize single-
           ship missions as a result of fallout. Single-Ship air-to-surface sorties will be
           conducted IAW AFI 11-214.
        8.1.2.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Single ship missions to Slunj Range or Pocek
        Range are not authorized.
     8.1.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Non-Demanding Sortie Guidance. Demanding and
     Non-Demanding sorties will be flown IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, Attachment 2.
        8.1.2.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Red Air sorties may be considered Non-
        Demanding if executed under limited-maneuvering training rules.
     8.1.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Filing Flight Plans.
        8.1.2.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Flight Plan Submission/Approval. 31st Fighter
        Wing Scheduling (31 OSS/OSOS) submits a daily flying schedule PVG (Programma
        Voli Giornalieri) the workday prior to the date of flight for all wing/deployed units’
        training flights to Italian Base Operations Center (BOC).
        8.1.2.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Squadrons’ requests for local flying must be
        submitted by 0900L, the working day prior, to 31 OSS/OSOS. Italian holidays,
        Saturdays, and Sundays are not considered workdays.
        8.1.2.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Wing scheduling will deconflict airspace requests
        and submit the PVG by 1300L through ITAF BOC. 31 OSS/OSOS will confirm all
46                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


        sorties forwarded by PVG message are approved by AUTMIX (Assigned Mission)
        message. Missions not on the AUTMIX message are not authorized.
        8.1.2.4.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aviano Stereo Routes. Stereo routes are listed in
        Attachment 18 and the 31 FW Pilot Aid and will be used to the maximum extent
        possible for all local sorties. Any changes to the stereo route of flight, or local flights
        not utilizing a stereo route require submission of a Piano Di Volo-Flight Plan two
        working days prior to the flight. Upon approval by Airfield Management Operations
        (AMOPS), a copy must be provided to 31 OSS/OSOS for inclusion on the PVG. The
        PVG and the Piano Di Volo-Flight Plan must match exactly. Non-local flight plans
        must be submitted no later than (3) hours prior to takeoff.
            8.1.2.4.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fax or email the Italian Flight Plan, Piano Di
            Volo (equivalent to DD Form 1801), IAW FLIP General Planning Chap 4 to
            Airfield management. Before faxing/emailing, ensure the flight plan has been
            signed/electronically signed by the pilot in command. A follow-up call will be
            made to ensure the fax was received (fax 8674, Ph 7222). Squadrons will
            maintain the flight plan on file for 90 days.
        8.1.2.4.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) The fighter squadrons, AMOPS, and the 31
        OG/SOF will receive a copy of the PVG by email or fax. AMOPS will use the PVG
        to file the Piano Di Volo-Flight Plans. If an altitude higher than the published
        maximum is required, a separate message must be submitted the day prior.
        8.1.2.4.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Flight plans filed on the same day of flight (i.e.
        after the PVG is published) are considered “immediate” flight plans. Notify wing
        scheduling (DSN 632-8490) with the requirement for an immediate mission NLT 1
        hour before the new takeoff time. This is not a routine request and must be
        accomplished whenever a flight cannot meet the original takeoff time by -15 to +45
        minutes, a change is required (route, operation area, etc.), or an addition to the flying
        schedule is required. Immediate requests made within 1 hour of takeoff have a high
        probability of being denied or delayed due to the complicated approval process.
        8.1.2.4.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) SARMs will print and post the NOTAMs daily
        and have the NOTAMs available for pilot review NLT 15 minutes prior to the first
        scheduled flight brief time.
        8.1.2.4.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Low-level flights must reference the BBQ (Italian
        low-level series) NOTAMs. See Attachment 17, 31 FW Low-Level Procedures, for
        further instructions.
     8.1.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Suspected Flying Violations. Pilots who are involved in
     a suspected flying violation will inform their supervisor, give the mission video file to the
     squadron commander, and submit a written report to the 31 OG/CC, who will forward to
     the ITAF, if required.
     8.1.2.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Quiet Hours
        8.1.2.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The 31 FW hosts various wing, ITAF, 3AF, and
        NATO official functions requiring restrictions to be levied on airfield operations
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     47


        creating excessive levels of noise. The following restrictive airfield operation
        categories will be implemented when required:
           8.1.2.6.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) CATEGORY 1: Operations cease. No
           aircraft or helicopter takeoffs, landings, taxi operations, engine starts, engine test
           operations, AGE operation, or towing of aircraft or support equipment to include
           munitions and fuel truck operations.
           8.1.2.6.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) CATEGORY 2:              Aircraft, AGE (Aircraft
           Ground Equipment), and engine test operations (not to exceed idle power unless
           operated in the Hush House) may be permitted in the specified loops. All aircraft
           takeoff, landings, and taxi operations are prohibited.
           8.1.2.6.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) CATEGORY 3: NATO contingency aircraft
           and helicopter launch and recovery operations are permitted to include operation
           of necessary AGE equipment. All other operations not in direct support of
           launching NATO tasked contingency sorties are prohibited (except those listed in
           Cat 2). All recoveries will be from a straight-in approach to full stop landing.
           Aircraft may be required to return to parking spots via alternate taxi routings.
           8.1.2.6.1.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) CATEGORY 4: Normal aircraft and support
           ground operations are permitted. No aircraft takeoffs allowed (except those listed
           in Cat 3). Aircraft returning to Aviano will be required to recover from a straight-
           in approach to full stop landing only. Overhead and practice approaches are
           prohibited. Aircraft may be required to return to parking spots via alternate taxi
           routings.
        8.1.2.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Coordination. Coordination will be accomplished
        through 31 OG Scheduling (632-7838/8490). A minimum of 10 days advanced
        notice is required in order to reduce the impact to flying operations. Variations to this
        policy are at the discretion of the 31 OG/CC. 31 OG/CC through ITAF/CC is the
        approval/waiver authority for Aviano Airfield Restrictive Operations during the hours
        between 0700L-2300L. 31 MXG/CC through ITAF/CC is the approval/waiver
        authority during the hours of 2300L-0700L. This policy applies to all operations and
        maintenance personnel assigned to the 31 FW.
        8.1.2.6.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Waiver to Quiet Hours: IAW HQ USAFE A3
        waiver letter dated 6 Jan 05, DV flights for SACEUR, DCDRUSEUCOM,
        Component Commanders, NAF Commanders, USAFE/CV, and Deputy Commander
        Air Headquarters Ramstein are exempt from quiet hour restrictions imposed by NAF,
        Wing, or lower echelon organizations at all USAFE installations. This HQ USAFE
        A3 waiver does not apply to ITAF imposed quiet hours at Aviano AB. The waiver
        authority for ITAF imposed quiet hours is ITAF/CC. Additionally, aircraft
        emergencies are exempt from all quiet hour restrictions.
     8.1.2.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Survival Vests. F-16 aircrew will wear a survival vest
     during all sorties.
     8.1.2.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Local Weather Procedures

     8.1.2.8.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aviano has both USAF and Italian Air Force
     (ITAF) weather observers. On the Advanced Meteorological Information System
     (AMIS) the identifier LIPA is Aviano’s ITAF Weather. Aviano’s USAF weather
     observers prepare and brief a Mission Execution Forecast (MEF), a customized
     weather depiction for USAF pilots. The MEF includes, but is not limited to, takeoff
     and landing weather at Aviano, alternate airfield weather, and working airspace
     weather.
     8.1.2.8.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) ITAF and USAF observers use different
     techniques for measuring visibility and this sometimes leads to different results.
     ITAF Weather determines the airport status (Open or Closed / IFR or VFR), ATIS,
     and all the weather information reported by ATC. If Aviano airport status is IFR, the
     VFR pattern is closed, regardless of USAF weather observations.
     8.1.2.8.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) The USAF Weather can be used for determining
     required diverts/alternates, for decisions to launch aircraft, and for decisions to begin
     instrument approaches. Authority to use USAF Weather for such decisions rests with
     31 OG/CC and will be transmitted through the SOF.
     8.1.2.8.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aviano’s airfield elevation is approximately 100’
     above airfields within a 200 nm radius. During periods of fog it is not unusual to
     have unrestricted visibility at Aviano, while the neighboring airfields have visibilities
     of less than 400 meters. A slight change in temperature or wind can cause drastic
     changes in Aviano’s weather with little or no warning.
     8.1.2.8.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Thunderstorm & Severe Weather Avoidance.
     Aviano's close proximity to the Dolomite Mountains makes the area conducive to
     rapidly changing weather and unstable air leading to cumulus buildup and
     thunderstorms, particularly in the summer and fall. In addition to the guidance in AFI
     11-202v3, the following steps will be taken when thunderstorms are a factor in the
     local flying area:
        8.1.2.8.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Top 3s will brief known and forecasted areas
        of thunderstorm activity during Step Briefs.
        8.1.2.8.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will work
        with the weather shop and flights airborne to identify thunderstorm activity and
        their impact to local flying operations.
        8.1.2.8.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Prior to takeoff, pilots will contact the SOF
        to determine if thunderstorms are a factor to their departure routing, airspace
        and/or recovery. SOFs will provide recommended routing, altitudes and airspace
        to avoid them.
        8.1.2.8.5.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Once airborne, flight leads, or their
        designated representatives, will provide a PIREP to the SOF along with any
        additional recommendations to avoid possible flight hazards.
        8.1.2.8.5.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) When possible, flight leads will use Ground
        Map Radar to further aid in the detection and avoidance of thunderstorms.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                   49


        8.1.2.8.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircrew will wear Anti-Exposure suits IAW AFI
        11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support Program. Aircrew will wear anti-exposure suits on
        any preplanned over water flight when the water temperature is 60F (15.5C) or less.
        The OG/CC may waive anti-exposure suit wear when local air temperature is 70F
        (20C) or greater and the water temperature is 51F or greater. Aircrew will wear anti-
        exposure suites over water transit to/from Sara, Foligno, Speedy, or over water
        training in those airspaces, when cold water conditions exist as described above
        (gliding distance to land is not a consideration).
     8.1.2.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fuel Requirements and Bingo Fuel
        8.1.2.9.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) 31 FW SOFs will designate a divert field at all
        times due to single runway operations at Aviano. When required, this field will also
        constitute as an alternate per AFI 11-202 Vol 3. Pilots will use this field for fuel
        planning purposes. SOFs will ensure that the following three items are available on
        the ATIS: Aviano recovery fuel status (IFR or VFR), designated divert field, and the
        divert field status (IFR or VFR). Aviano airfield pattern status (IFR vs. VFR) is
        determined by the Tower Watch Supervisor through ITAF weather observations (see
        8.1.2.8.2.). The divert field and divert field weather status is determined by the SOF.
        Format will be: “31 FW Fuel Status: VFR/IFR Bingos, divert is (base), VFR/IFR.”
           8.1.2.9.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) "VFR" means that pilots may plan fuels to
           recover via the normal VFR pattern entry procedures, VFR pattern, and landing.
           8.1.2.9.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) "IFR" means that pilots will plan fuels to
           recover via an IFR pattern (radar vectors or instrument penetration) and landing.
        8.1.2.9.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fuel requirement at the divert field is based on the
        ability or inability to fly an overhead pattern. Daytime weather at or better than
        2,500’/5 km is considered “VFR” (i.e. no instrument approach required), and weather
        worse than 2,500’/5 km or night is considered “IFR” (i.e. instrument approach
        required).
        8.1.2.9.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) When using VFR Bingos at Aviano, pilots will
        arrive on initial with the VFR divert fuel specified in the 31 FW Pilot Aid. When
        using IFR Bingos, pilots will land with the IFR divert fuel specified in the 31 FW
        Pilot Aid.
        8.1.2.9.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Divert fuels are calculated to execute a low
        approach, military power climb, no jettison, maximum range cruise, and enroute
        descent to arrive overhead the divert field with 1,000 pounds of fuel remaining if the
        divert fuel requirement is “VFR.” If the divert field fuel requirement is “IFR,” 400
        pounds is added for a penetration and approach. Use the fuel planning calculations in
        the 31 FW Pilot Aid.
        8.1.2.9.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) During recovery delays, advise Aviano Approach
        and the SOF of fuel remaining, in minutes, until reaching divert fuel. Only declare
        Minimum or Emergency Fuel IAW AFI 11-2F-16V3.
        8.1.2.9.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) All primary divert airfields listed in the 31 FW
        Pilot Aid have compatible, non-radar required, published approaches. Emergency
50                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


        divert airfields in the 31 FW Pilot Aid are generally not suitable as IFR alternates due
        to approaches that are either incompatible or that require radar.
        8.1.2.9.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Dual Alternates. Refer to AFI 11-202V3, USAFE
        Supplement for dual alternate criteria and restrictions.
        8.1.2.9.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Canopy Sheeting Guidance.              The following
        guidance applies to both local operating procedures at Aviano as well as off-station
        flying operations.
           8.1.2.9.8.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The SOF will ensure the declared alternate is
           free of forecast or observed moderate or heavy rain.
           8.1.2.9.8.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) If forecast (via MEF/TAF) or observed
           heavy or moderate rain conditions exist at Aviano, the SOF may require canopy
           sheeting fuels. This is an additional 400# (A/A) / 700# (A/G) to allow for an
           additional approach at Aviano prior to reaching published divert fuel.
           8.1.2.9.8.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots encountering canopy sheeting will
           write up the aircraft Code 2. Details of the incident will be reflected in the Top 3
           and SOF EOD reports.
     8.1.2.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ice Foreign Object Damage (FOD).
        8.1.2.10.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) When Weather declares an “Ice Induction
        Advisory” (weather conditions exist that are favorable for engine ice induction), the
        SOF will notify FS Top 3s and the first aircraft of each go will accomplish an Ice
        FOD check. Additionally, during an Ice Induction Advisory, if the SOF determines
        that there is surface-based visible liquid moisture present on the airfield (rain, fog,
        sleet, snow, or wet runway/taxiways, etc.), then the SOF will declare “Ice FOD
        procedures in effect.” The SOF will notify FS Top3s that Ice FOD procedures are in
        effect. Top3s will notify the MX Pro Super that Ice FOD Procedures are in effect.
        The SOF will declare "Ice FOD Procedures in effect" if any aircraft reports an Inlet
        Icing light regardless of visible moisture. See Figure 8.1.2.10.1.
        8.1.2.10.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ice FOD Check. An Ice FOD Check is a risk
        mitigation procedure to prevent an entire go from starting and experiencing engine
        induction icing, which could possibly damage aircraft engines. An Ice FOD Check is
        required any time Weather declares an Ice Induction Advisory.
           8.1.2.10.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The Ice FOD Check aircraft will start, taxi
           onto the shelter apron, stop, and run the engine at idle with the Anti-Ice Switch
           ON for 5 minutes. If no icing in/around the intake is noted by the crew chief,
           inform the SOF of "negative ICE FOD." If any actual inlet icing is observed by
           ground observers, shutdown immediately and advise the SOF/Top 3. Top 3 will
           not allow other aircraft to start engines. Enter a CODE 3 write up in the 781.
        8.1.2.10.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ice FOD Procedures. The SOF will declare Ice
        FOD Procedures are in effect. Procedures will be IAW the 31 FW Pilot Aid and this
        Instruction. The first aircraft of the go will perform an ICE FOD check IAW
        paragraph 8.1.2.10.2 (see Figure 8.1). At least one monitor for every two aircraft is
        required whenever aircraft are stopped for an extended period (i.e. parking ramp,
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       51


         EOR, etc.) The crew chief or inlet monitor remains alert for ice buildup in/around the
         inlet. If the inlet monitor observes any inlet icing, the pilot will shut down
         immediately, advise the SOF/Top 3, and enter a CODE 3 write up in the 781. If inlet
         icing is observed at any time, flying operations will terminate (except airborne
         flights). The SOF will direct all F-16s on the ground to shut down. When ready to
         taxi, remain at ramp/shelter until traffic delays are eliminated. Do not taxi to alternate
         EOR or other holding areas unless there are adequate inlet monitors available.
         Airborne aircraft will continue their mission, recover normally and adhere to the
         above procedures during de-arm and taxi back.

Figure 8.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ice FOD Procedures.




         8.1.2.10.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Inlet Icing Light. Pilots who observe an Inlet
         Icing Light at EOR should notify ground crews (call a Red-Ball if required). An Inlet
         Icing Light in the chocks with the engine operating does not require an abort unless
         ice buildup is visible on the inlet (as little as ¼ inch can damage the engine) or if the
         Inlet Icing Light is suspected to be the result of an anti-ice system malfunction (i.e.
52                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


        icing light stays on >70 consecutive seconds).       Aircraft will not takeoff with a
        continuously illuminated Inlet Icing Light.
     8.1.2.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) Cross Country Procedures
        8.1.2.11.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Cross-country Planning. The pilot in command
        or his/her designated representative must complete a Piano Di Volo-Flight Plan
        (ITAF DD Form 1801 equivalent) when departing Aviano or another ITAF base, or a
        DD Form 1801, DOD International Flight Plan. Prior to filing the flight plan, pilots
        will consult the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide, Airfield Suitability and Restrictions
        Report (ASRR), USAF Classified Foreign Clearance Guide, FM Immunity
        information in the appropriate FLIP General Planning document (interim FMI
        corrections are located in the DINS listed under the country's FIR ICAO identifiers),
        Flight Information Publication AP/2 for special instructions corresponding to the
        applicable USA code, and General Planning Guide. The 31 FW Pilot Aid contains
        information and checklists for planning cross-country sorties or diverts.
        8.1.2.11.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) ASRR. Flight leads will review the Airfield
        Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) and the Supplemental Theater
        Information File (STIF) anytime a flight will land off-station. These are available on
        the internet site: https://www.afd.scott.af.mil/.
        8.1.2.11.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Non-DOD Approaches.               If an operational
        requirement exists to deploy to an airfield where DOD approaches are not published
        or insufficient, then HQ USAFE/A3 must approve the use of a non-U.S. Government
        instrument approach procedure before the procedure can be flown under IFR. This
        includes host nation and Jeppesen products.
            8.1.2.11.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The approval process begins with the
            USAFE TERPs office, which is responsible for conducting the review. Submit
            review requests at least 7 duty days prior to the date of anticipated use to:
            https://wwwmil.usafe.af.mil/direct/a3/doy/doyf/apf/apf_set.htm
        8.1.2.11.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Jeppesen Products. If the host nation product is
        not suitable or compatible, then order commercial Jeppesen products within the
        following timeline: More than 60 days prior to the deployment, order Jeppesen
        products through DLA (ref: DMA Aero catalog pg 2-10, para c.2.), just like
        traditional flight publications. If there are less than 60 days remaining, order products
        directly from the Jeppesen company, no later than two weeks prior, using the IMPAC
        card.
        8.1.2.11.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) End of Runway (EOR) / Last Chance Checks.
        EOR checks or their equivalent in the chocks (after all other pre-flight checks are
        complete) are required on all sorties. Transient launch crews in USAFE should have
        procedures established to check fighter aircraft just prior to takeoff.
     8.1.2.12. (Added-AVIANOAB) Guest Pilot Procedures. Current and qualified guest
     pilots will complete the “Guest Pilot Checklist” prior to flight in a 31 FW aircraft. The
     checklist can be found in the 31 OG Syllabus (31 OG OI 11-2F-16 Vol 1).
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                    53


     8.1.2.13. (Added-AVIANOAB) Incentive / Familiarization Flights. Pilots will brief
     RCP passengers using the F-16D Passenger Brief found in the Pilot Aid. Pilots will
     personally ensure their passengers on orientation flights are correctly strapped in and
     familiar with the oxygen regulator location and operation. Pilots will ensure their RCP
     passengers are properly trained and can perform the required tasks while fully dressed
     and strapped in the aircraft. If they are unable to perform these tasks, they will not fly.
     This requirement does not apply to frequent FAM flyers. The ejection mode select handle
     will be set in AFT. Flights will not normally be flown over water. Simulated emergency
     procedures are not permitted with incentive flyers on board.
     8.1.2.14. (Added-AVIANOAB) FINI Flights. "Fini-Flights" will be annotated in the
     remarks column of the printed schedule. Fini-flight aircrew will plan and fly routine
     missions and mission elements based on the unit's current training program.
     8.1.2.15. (Added-AVIANOAB) Logistics Support Aircraft (LSA) Events or Exercises.
     31 FW aircraft will not be configured with live forward firing ordnance (i.e. no hot gun,
     missiles, or rockets). Inbound TDY aircraft with live forward firing ordnance attempting
     to land at Aviano will be diverted unless an emergency is declared. In the unlikely event
     that an aircraft lands with live forward firing ordnance during an LSA event or exercise,
     it will taxi clear to the north via A1 or A4 and hold in place until de-armed.
     8.1.2.16. (Added-AVIANOAB) TCAS Alerts. Heavy civilian traffic in USAFE makes
     avoiding conflicts with civilian traffic a challenge; especially civilian traffic equipped
     with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). TCAS is a predictive
     system and it is mandatory for airliners to execute the calculated avoidance maneuver
     when prompted, regardless of the actual threat to the aircraft. ATC routinely vectors
     civilian traffic within 1000' and/or 1-2nm of our training areas. Pilots must be aware that
     they can set off TCAS advisories even without leaving the training airspace. Pilots must
     avoid setting off TCAS advisories of civilian traffic. Therefore, pilots will exercise
     increased vigilance to avoid TCAS conflicts while operating VMC and will avoid any
     airliner's altitude by at least 2,000' within 10nm perpendicular or 5nm parallel. If
     required, flight leads are expected to terminate tactical maneuvering and/or air-to-air
     engagements for traffic operating in close proximity to the vertical/horizontal limits of
     the assigned airspace.

         8.1.3.1.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) ILS glide slope: 2.5o. Touchdown point is 815’
         past the threshold of RWY 05. There is no ILS capability to RWY 23. PAPI glide
         slope is aligned with the ILS glide slope for RWY 05 and PAPIs are available for
         RWY 23.
         8.1.3.1.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) WARNING: ILS LOC is unusable 15° or more
         north of RWY 05 centerline due to rising terrain.
         8.1.3.1.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) High and low altitude TACAN/ILS approach
         procedures are available to RWY 05 only. Circling is only authorized to the south
         due to mountainous terrain to the north.
         8.1.3.1.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft Arresting Systems (standard runway
         barrier configurations):

              E-5, Uni-directional, Barrier #6, 45 feet into Rwy 05 departure end
       overrun.

         8.1.3.1.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Normal barrier configuration is all departure-end
         barriers connected and raised. Barriers 2 thru 5 have eight-point tie-down systems.
         When the approach-end barrier is down, pilots should be aware that it takes
         approximately 15 minutes to string the cable once requested.
         8.1.3.1.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) The SOF vehicle is designated as the alternate
         SOF location.
         8.1.3.1.12. (Added-AVIANOAB) Transition altitude in the Aviano Approach
         Control airspace is 7,000’ MSL. (In Italy, each airdrome identifies its own transition
         altitude, and they vary from 5,500’ MSL to 8,500’ MSL.)
         8.1.3.1.13. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aviano approach airspace is Class C airspace.
         Aviano airfield is Class D airspace.
      8.1.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Preflight.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                   55


        8.1.3.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots or crew chiefs will not change the gun
        configuration. Only qualified weapons personnel will safe or arm the gun.
        8.1.3.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) All pilots will maintain continuous positive control
        of their RMC, DTC, and URITs cartridges. The PIC will personally install and
        remove all recording/data devices in the aircraft. In the event a mechanical
        malfunction occurs preventing the removal of any of these media, the pilot will
        remain at the aircraft until the media can be removed. Pilots will not transfer control
        of any recording/data media to maintenance personnel.
        8.1.3.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will use caution when fastening and
        unfastening the lap belt to ensure the fittings do not strike the side consoles.
        Repeated strikes will chip paint from the console possibly allowing NVG-hostile
        lighting to leak through or otherwise damage the side consoles.
     8.1.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Engine Start/Ground Ops.
        8.1.3.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will monitor ground control frequency
        during engine start until completion of the SEC and EPU checks.
        8.1.3.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Perform after start checks, to include SEC check,
        fuel main shut-off valve check, and EPU check, in the protected aircraft shelter
        (PAS), or outside the PAS after confirming jet blast direction is clear. Complete the
        SEC check prior to pulling the EPU pin.
        8.1.3.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) In order to mitigate EGI malfunctions, pilots will
        comply with the following:
           8.1.3.3.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Have the correct altimeter set prior to
           starting an alignment.
           8.1.3.3.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Align the EGI as long as possible without
           setting off NARF.
           8.1.3.3.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ensure the EGI switch is set to NAV prior to
           takeoff and not left in NORM.
        8.1.3.3.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) When planning to operate with live ALE-50s, the
        ALE-50 safety pins will be removed prior to taxi. This will allow for ALE-50 BIT
        check to be accomplished while still in the chocks.
           8.1.3.3.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Safety pin removal will be initiated by the
           pilot or with the concurrence of the pilot. Ensure the Master Arm switch is
           positioned to off prior to removal of the safety pins. Once the integrity of the
           system has been verified, safety pins will be reinstalled before aircraft will be
           allowed to taxi to the arming area.
     8.1.3.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hot Pit Refueling. Procedures are IAW T.O. 1F-16CM-
     1CL-1, page N-14, with the following additions:
        8.1.3.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Reference 31 FW Pilot Aid for flow direction.

        8.1.3.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) To de-conflict taxi flow and minimize traffic
        congestion on the parallel taxiways, pilots will remain on Squadron Operations VHF
        during de-arming and refueling.
        8.1.3.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will not begin or continue refueling
        operations without an operable intercom with the ground crew and a fire truck
        present.
        8.1.3.4.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) URITS and UHF/VHF radio transmissions are
        permitted during hot pit refueling. Radio frequency (RF) transmissions pose no
        danger of igniting fuel vapors.
        8.1.3.4.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) An EPU check will be performed after hot pit
        refueling in EOR, prior to arming, with the assistance of the EOR crew. For the EPU
        check, turn off any nonessential equipment and select 100% oxygen.
        8.1.3.4.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the EGI remained on during the EPU check,
        pilots will verify the EGI is still operating normally prior to takeoff.
           8.1.3.4.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will check their list-6 page to verify if
           the EGI has reset. The alignment status may read 00.0/9.9 if the EGI has reset.
           8.1.3.4.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Check the HSI, ADI, and HUD for proper
           movement and heading alignment when taxing and taking the runway for takeoff.
     8.1.3.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Taxi Procedures.
        8.1.3.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will check ATIS prior to taxi.
        8.1.3.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Minimum taxi interval is 150' staggered during
        daytime, dry runway operations on taxiways Alpha and Bravo. Minimum taxi
        interval is 300' on centerline for wet runway, live ordnance, and/or night.
        8.1.3.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maximum taxi speed is 25 knots; 10 knots in
        congested areas.
        8.1.3.5.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Due to parking limitations at Aviano, pilots should
        taxi with extreme caution. Do not taxi aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without
        a wing walker. Never taxi aircraft within 10 feet of any obstruction. Pilots will not
        taxi behind other aircraft parked in the Arm/De-Arm Area of Sierra Loop (Buzzard
        Arm/De-arm Pad). Pilots will not taxi behind or in front of aircraft parked in the
        Buzzard Marshall Area.
        8.1.3.5.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Conditions permitting, pilots will not point a
        parked jet with forward firing ordnance at any PAS, aircraft, or personnel.
     8.1.3.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ground Radio Procedures.
        8.1.3.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Engine Start. Flight leads will notify ground
        control of engine start in order to activate their flight plan. “Aviano Ground, Viper
        01, engine start.”
        8.1.3.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Taxi request. “Aviano Ground, Viper 01, taxi
        (number of aircraft), (location), with (ATIS identifier), IFR/VFR to (airspace
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                    57


        assigned).” Expect response using ICAO phraseology: “Taxi to holding point,
        runway [number], time[as required], hold short of runway.”
        8.1.3.6.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Clearance. Ground Control is also Clearance
        Delivery; expect clearance to be passed approximately 10 minutes prior to departure
        time. Pilots will notify Ground control when they are 10 minutes from departure.
        Pilots will read back clearance verbatim.
     8.1.3.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Arming/De-arming. Normal arming/de-arming will take
     place in a unit designated area (Reference Attachment 6).
     8.1.3.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Day-Time Lighting Requirements. Per AFI 11-218 and
     AFI 11-202V3, the minimum aircraft lighting required for daytime F-16 operations is the
     anti-collision strobe light (top of tail). Any other external lighting found to be non-
     operational after engine start will be Code 2 upon landing. In the event the anti-collision
     strobe light fails in flight or during a cross-country/deployment movement, the PIC may
     continue the mission to the first stop where repairs can be made (IAW AFI 11-202V3).
     8.1.3.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Night-Time Lighting Requirements.                   All interior
     instrument lights must be operational. All exterior lights must be operational with the
     exception of a maximum of one inop wingtip light per wing. The AAR lights must be
     operational if air refueling is planned. The anti-collision knob will be placed in position
     1 when operating in Norm on the ground. Set respective flight position (C, 2, 3, 4) prior
     to takeoff.
        8.1.3.9.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will remain “bright-flash, strobe on, taxi
        light off” anytime they are stopped on the north/south parallel taxiways. Exception:
        if dearming on the parallel taxiways prior to hot pit refueling.
        8.1.3.9.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Reduced Lighting Operations: In Italian restricted
        airspace (Zita, Sara, Lola, and Foligno), as well Speedy airspace, the minimum
        exterior lighting is covert all, dim/steady. Pilots may run “blacked out” to meet
        specific training requirements. Time blacked out should be kept to a minimum. Overt
        lighting will be used enroute to/from training airspace.
     8.1.3.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Wet/Dry Runway.
        8.1.3.10.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) After landing, pass runway braking action to
        Tower, if braking action is other than expected or reported. Report conditions using
        standard terminology:

Table 8.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Standard Terminology
               RCR             Braking Action        % Increase in Landing Roll
               19-25               “Good”                        15-0
               13-18                “Fair”                      45-16
               06-12               “Poor”                       99-46
               02-05                “Nil”                    100 or more

         8.1.3.10.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) AMOPS determines runway condition (wet or
         dry). If the runway is declared “wet”, the SOF will determine the presence of
         "standing water" for formation takeoffs.
         8.1.3.10.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Wet friction values for the runway are "Good",
         however pilots are advised that friction values will be reduced for an extended period
         after rain.
     8.1.3.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) FOD Prevention Procedures.
         8.1.3.11.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Local             conditions   including    substandard
         pavement, heavy traffic, and heavy rains, make FOD prevention at Aviano AB
         particularly challenging. Everyone on the flight line is responsible for ensuring all
         airfield ramp, taxi, and runway surfaces are clear of FOD.
         8.1.3.11.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) The following procedures will be used when
         reporting FOD:
             8.1.3.11.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will report FOD to ground/tower
             controller. Runway remaining markers may be used to help describe the location
             accurately for FOD located on taxi ways Alpha or Bravo. For example, "Ground,
             Viper 1, FOD Report, Westbound, Taxiway Alpha, abeam six board, 2 feet south
             of centerline, [FOD type: rocks, debris, acorns, etc.]" "Abeam six board" means
             the aircraft is abeam the six thousand feet remaining marker; use distances in .1
             increments to refine position (i.e. "5.3 board" means abeam 5300' runway
             remaining point in direction stated (westbound or eastbound)).
             8.1.3.11.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ground control will record the FOD report,
             ensure the FOD information is passed to other factor ground traffic, pass the FOD
             report to AMOPS, and coordinate for a sweeper if required. AMOPS is
             responsible for physically removing the FOD and is responsible for FOD tracking
             and reporting to the OG/CC.
             8.1.3.11.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) The SOF will ensure the above procedures
             are complied with in a timely manner. The SOF will annotate, on the SOF EOD
             report, any significant FOD found during the opening airfield inspection. This
             report will also be sent to AMOPS for FOD tracking.
  8.1.4. Section D. Flying Operations.
     8.1.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Local Flying Area (Reference Attachment 13).
         8.1.4.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The Aviano local flying area is northeastern Italy
         east of 9o East and north of 42o North.
         8.1.4.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Use of airspace in Italy is subject to restrictions
         imposed by controlled airspace, danger, restricted, and prohibited areas. VFR flight
         must be carefully planned IAW FLIP, GP, AP/2, AP2A, Italian AIP (MILAIP) and
         NOTAMs. Reference the low-level operational air traffic manual (BOAT Vol 2) for
         low-level rules.
         8.1.4.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) There are numerous firing areas in Italy. Firing
         areas (FRAs) are NOTAMed active in the daily ITAF NOTAMs located on the w:
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     59


       drive. IAW the ITAF MILAIP, all activated FRAs must be avoided by 2,000’ above
       the upper limit of the published altitudes, unless specified otherwise.
       8.1.4.1.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) 31 FW working areas are listed in Area Planning
       Special Use Airspace (AP/2A) and MILAIP.
       8.1.4.1.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) SARA (LIR21), FOLIGNO (LIR48), ZITA
       (LIR49), LOLA (LIR65), and LIR103 are restricted areas. Civilian traffic is
       prohibited from entering these areas unless cleared by ATC. However, 31 FW
       aircraft will remain VMC to the maximum extent possible.
       8.1.4.1.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Primo is authorized to provide advisory/broadcast
       service, IAW the Local Technical Arrangement (LTA), for Zita and Sara airspace.
       Primo will provide warnings of hazards affecting aircraft safety. However, pilots
       continue to be responsible for remaining inside the airspace and collision avoidance.
       8.1.4.1.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) SPEEDY (LID113) is a special use area for NATO
       Operations. It encompass both Croatian (Zagreb ACC) and Italian FIRs. ATC is not
       obligated to prevent civilian traffic from entering these areas. 31 FW aircraft will
       remain VMC unless they are operating under an IFR clearance and are in contact with
       Padova or Primo. In addition, ATC is not required to inform inbound flights about or
       separate them from flights already working in SPEEDY. Therefore, inbound aircraft
       will announce their presence in the blind on both SPEEDY North and SPEEDY South
       primary frequencies prior to entering the airspace.
       8.1.4.1.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Padova Mil Operations. Italian SCCs, including
       Padova Mil, are responsible for the coordination of Operational Air Traffic (OAT)
       flight plans to and from the training areas. Padova Mil is also responsible for the
       coordination and deconfliction of SARA, LOLA, and ZITA airspaces. When Padova
       Mil is closed, SARA, LOLA, and ZITA do not exist. Therefore, 20 minutes prior to
       Padova Mil closing, all flights must coordinate for recovery from SARA and LOLA
       in order to be established within Aviano Airspace by closing time. SPEEDY and
       FOLIGNO remain open when Padova Mil is closed, but they require a General Air
       Traffic (GAT) flight plan for use.
       8.1.4.1.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Airspace Extensions. Pilots still on the ground
       will coordinate airspace extensions through Squadron Top 3s (primary) or the SOF
       (secondary). Once airborne, flights must coordinate with the appropriate controlling
       agency. The following is a list of the tactical training areas and their corresponding
       controlling agencies: ZITA (Padova Mil – SCC), LOLA (Padova Mil – SCC),
       SARA (Padova Mil – SCC), FOLIGNO (Roma Mil – SCC or Roma Control – ACC),
       SPEEDY (Padova Mil – scheduled by CAOC5, coordinated through Wing
       Scheduling).
       8.1.4.1.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Latecomer Procedures. Latecomer is defined as
       one or more elements of the flight unable to take off within formation, but with the
       same procedure of the original mission (i.e. route, timings/slot) already approved, in
       order to rejoin with the flight. If unable to takeoff with the flight, individual aircraft
       or elements may execute latecomer procedures. If any flight member plans to take
60                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


        off outside of the +45 minute window, as defined in para. 8.1.2.4.6., an immediate
        must be filed. Aircraft wishing to invoke latecomer procedures will:
           8.1.4.1.10.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Contact tower requesting the activation of
           the latecomer flight plan with the new expected time of departure.
           8.1.4.1.10.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Renumber the flight as required to ensure
           aircraft executing latecomer procedures are the highest numbered flight members
           in the formation (i.e. #4 of a 4-ship).
           8.1.4.1.10.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Request approval by IT-AOC through
           ground.
           8.1.4.1.10.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Takeoff prior to remaining flight members
           actual land time.
               8.1.4.1.10.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) If a latecomer is unable to takeoff
               prior to assigned airspace expiration time, the ITAF-BOC may not allow him
               to takeoff.
        8.1.4.1.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) To ensure de-confliction between civil and
        military traffic, recovery from locally assigned airspace will be coordinated at least 5
        minutes prior to RTB. Failure to provide this notification may result in significant
        delays. Flights will remain inside the confines of the working area until a clearance
        to depart is received from ATC. To the maximum extent possible, RTB as a two/four
        ship.
        8.1.4.1.12. (Added-AVIANOAB) Coordinate non-standard recoveries as soon as
        possible with the controlling agency. Separate elements or flights recovering at the
        same time will deconflict recovery altitudes while remaining in the airspace. Each
        element or flight will coordinate a separate clearance with ATC.
        8.1.4.1.13. (Added-AVIANOAB) La Comina Airstrip. This airstrip oriented N/S is
        located approximately 3.5 nm southeast of the departure end of runway 05. It is used
        by light aircraft, VFR only. These aircraft should not be any higher than 700’ MSL
        and are required to stay east of the airstrip. The traffic is required to be in radio
        contact with Aviano tower. Aviano aircraft circling to land on RWY 23 pose a
        possible conflict, use caution. La Comina is authorized to conduct flying operations 7
        days a week.
     8.1.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Noise Abatement. Noise complaints are a serious
     problem in the Aviano area. 31 FW pilots will comply with the following:
        8.1.4.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Noise Abatement procedure (RWY 05). 31 FW
        aircraft will execute the following procedures if weather is ≥ 5,000’/5 km:
           8.1.4.2.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Climb and maintain between 700’ and 1,500’
           MSL until past departure end of runway. If using AB, pilots will select MIL
           power at 300 knots unless required for safety of flight, then:
           8.1.4.2.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fly runway heading until 1 DME, then turn
           right to heading 065 to stay North of the town of San Foca. Cross 4 DME at or
           above 3,000' MSL and turn right to desired heading while remaining East of San
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                61


          Foca tower. When active, avoid Cellina Meduna either laterally by completing
          the turn within 5 DME, or vertically by climbing above 6,000' MSL by 6 DME.
          Resume VFR/IFR departure as cleared. Pilots will maintain VMC throughout the
          procedure. Wingmen will fly the same ground track, and will not use cutoff to
          rejoin until southbound, past San Foca. This procedure is not authorized at night
          or when weather is less than 5,000’/5 km.
       8.1.4.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Training sorties are conducted between 0800L and
       2200L. Training sorties arriving between 2200L and 0800L or on weekends require
       OG/CC and ITAF/CC approval. All flights are required to perform a single straight-
       in approach/full stop weekdays from 2200L - 0730L, weekends, and Italian holidays.
       8.1.4.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Supersonic Flight. Supersonic flight is allowed
       over international waters with the following requirements met:
          8.1.4.2.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain > 12nm from the coastline with a
          diverging route of at least 20 degrees from the coast
          8.1.4.2.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain > 35nm from the coastline if the
          route runs toward or does not diverge at least 20 degrees from the coast
          8.1.4.2.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain VMC with at least 10km visibility
          8.1.4.2.3.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Have functional navigation equipment
          8.1.4.2.3.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain above 500’ AGL
          8.1.4.2.3.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Avoid areas outlined in MILAIP
          8.1.4.2.3.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Airspeed above .95 mach is prohibited over
          the Italian National Territory and National Waters (less than 12 nm from the
          coast) unless ALL of the following requirements are met:
              8.1.4.2.3.7.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Specifically approved for supersonic
              run by Italian Air Defense and can maintain radar and radio contact with
              Italian Air Defense controllers.
              8.1.4.2.3.7.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain above FL 360
              8.1.4.2.3.7.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain outside of sensitive areas
              (reference MILAIP)

              (reference MILAIP)
              8.1.4.2.3.7.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Monday – Friday between the hours of
              0900-2000 excluding holidays
       8.1.4.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Supersonic Flight Documentation. All supersonic
       flights over Italian National Territory (intentional and un-intentional) must be
       documented on a Supersonic Flight Report and AF Form 121 (copies can be obtained
       from the 31 OSS/OSOS web site). Completed supersonic Flight Reports will be
       forwarded to 31 OSS/OSOS who will provide copies to Airfield Management and the
       Italian BOC. The squadron is responsible for filling out the Supersonic Flight Report

        and the AF Form 121 (see Attachments 15 & 16). Complete procedures can be found
        at the Squadron's Aviation Resource Management section.
           8.1.4.2.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) All pilots are responsible for maintaining SA
           on their airspeed at all times and adapting tactical scenarios as required to stay ≤
           .95 Mach. In case of supersonic flight over the Italian landmass (including FCFs),
           pilot responsibilities are as follows:
               8.1.4.2.4.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) If supersonic activity is detected
               airborne, notify the controlling agency ASAP with best available coordinates,
               duration, and flight level. FS/Top 3 and FS/DO will be notified immediately
               upon landing.
               8.1.4.2.4.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) If supersonic activity is detected in
               debrief, notify FS/Top 3 and FS/DO immediately. Top 3 is responsible for
               ensuring the pilot completes the required forms, SARMs receive the forms for
               routing IAW the 31 OG Standard Operating Procedure for Sonic Boom (see
               Attachment 14), and will call the OG/CC with details of the supersonic event
               upon RMC review.
               8.1.4.2.4.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) In all cases, pilots will complete the AF
               Form 121 (Sonic Boom Log) and Italian Supersonic Flight Report. Pilots will
               use RMC and/or URITS data to accurately assess time, location, and duration
               of supersonic flight when filling out the required forms. The RMC will be
               kept for a minimum of 7 days (pilots may save the RMC to a file).
        8.1.4.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Afterburner is prohibited below 2,000’ AGL
        except for takeoffs, emergencies, or safety of flight.
        8.1.4.2.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Do not overfly Pordenone/Cordenons below
        3,000’ MSL or Sacile below 2,500’ MSL unless on final.
     8.1.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Takeoffs.
        8.1.4.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Advise tower if planning a non-standard departure
        or if excessive time on the runway is required. Expect ICAO phraseology for taxi
        into position and hold: “Viper 01, line up and wait.” Discontinue afterburner at 300
        KIAS unless safety of flight dictates otherwise.
        8.1.4.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) For bird strike avoidance, turn landing light on
        when taking the active.
        8.1.4.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Unrestricted Climbs. Minimum airspeed prior to
        pulling vertical is 400 knots (A/A configured) and 450 knots (A/G configured).
        Maximum climb angle is 70 degrees (A/G). Minimum recovery airspeeds are 200
        KIAS (A/A) and 250 KIAS (A/G).
     8.1.4.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) VFR Departures.
        8.1.4.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) RWY 05: Pilots will fly the noise abatement
        procedure if weather allows (see para. 8.1.4.2.1.). If weather does not permit a noise
        abatement departure, but still permits a VFR departure (1500'/5km), then on departure
        climb and maintain between 700’ and 1500’ MSL until past departure end, fly runway
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                             63


        heading until 2 DME, then turn right to 180º direct to EAGLE, completing turn
        within 5 DME. Resume VFR departure as cleared and maintain VMC (Reference
        Attachment 9).
        8.1.4.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) RWY 23:           Maintain between 700’ and 1,500’
        MSL until past departure end, then climb to 3500’ MSL or higher and turn left to
        FALCO. Expedite climb to 3,500’ MSL or above. Avoid the towns of Vigonovo and
        Sacile (Reference Attachment 10).
        8.1.4.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) VFR Entry/Exit Points. Point Eagle (AVI 141/10
        or N45 53.499 E012 44.105, Elev: 49’) is a intersection of an aqueduct and
        Autostrada 28, just northeast of Azzano Decimo. Point Falco (AVI 203/13 or
        N4549.837 E1227.882, Elev: 62’) is a bridge over a river.
     8.1.4.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) IFR Departures.
        8.1.4.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) File SIDs for all IFR departures. Aviano has
        seven DOD published SIDs compatible with the F-16: Risom 1A/B, Adriatica 1,
        Vicenza 6, Roska 1L/M, Tibro 1L/M, CHI 1L/M, and Chioggia 7.
        8.1.4.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Radar assisted trail (RWY 05). (Note: If the
        weather is greater than 5,000’/5 km execute the Noise Abatement Procedures, para
        8.1.4.2.1.)
           8.1.4.5.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Maintain MIL or AB takeoff power as
           required until 300 KIAS, MIL power until 350 KIAS, then maintain 350 KIAS
           with 750° FTIT (A-A) or 800° FTIT (A-G).
           8.1.4.5.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Trail members maintain 2-3 nm spacing.
           8.1.4.5.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Caution: The Risom 1A departure (Runway
           5) requires a 10-degree climb to clear Cellina Meduna Range by 1,500’ (6,000’
           MSL at 6 DME) and arrive at Risom at FL 130. High gross weights combined
           with high OAT will likely require non-standard power settings during trail
           departures.
        8.1.4.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Risom Departure. Fly the departure as depicted.
        If cleared off of the Risom departure (i.e. direct to Roska) use maximum of 30
        degrees bank angle enroute to cleared point and ensure altitude restriction over
        Cellina Meduna is met (6,000’ MSL at 6 DME).
        8.1.4.5.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Other than Risom Departure. Climb runway
        heading until 2.0 DME. At 2.0 DME (not earlier than 1,400 ft MSL at night or when
        the weather is below 1,500’/5 km) initiate a climbing turn to the specified SID
        heading/track. Complete the turn within 5 DME of AVI TACAN to avoid Cellina
        Meduna Range.
        8.1.4.5.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) When departing IFR in a non-standard formation,
        flight members will squawk mode C and mode 3 in sequence. For example, if the
        flight lead squawks 6131, #2 will squawk 6132, #3 6133, etc., until rejoined to a
        standard formation.
     8.1.4.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Zita De-confliction Procedures.
64                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


        8.1.4.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) 31 FW aircraft will not “cancel” upon entering
        Zita airspace, and are therefore on an IFR flight plan in Restricted airspace.
        Therefore, pilots are authorized to transit IMC while searching for VMC and
        deconflicting from other 31 FW aircraft via UHF 16 while utilizing Zita airspace.
        Flights will utilize FL130 to the maximum extent possible as a Zita transit altitude to
        and from Aviano. All established Zita traffic will maintain FL140 and above unless
        positive lateral deconfliction has been established.
        8.1.4.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Zita Entry. The first flight on departure to Zita
        airspace (making Zita “engaged”) should expect a clearance from ATC to climb to an
        altitude within the assigned Zita airspace. The flight lead will call “established Zita
        airspace, request tactical” once all flight members are established within the vertical
        confines of the airspace (≥FL130). Pilots must be aware that once they declare
        “established”, they are responsible for their own separation while operating in Zita
        airspace (similar to MARSA in the states). All subsequent flights proceeding to Zita
        will be cleared to FL130. Additionally, as a reminder to subsequent aircraft, the
        tower controller will add “Zita engaged” to their clearance any time Zita is currently
        active. For flights using the same Zita slot time, flight leads will deconflict their
        entry into the airspace, preferably pre-briefed with other Zita flights, or via Zita
        airspace tactical frequency (UHF 16). Unless deconfliction is pre-briefed, all flights
        not utilizing the same Zita slot time (i.e. 555 FS users have slot time following 510
        FS) will coordinate on Zita common (UHF 16) prior to take-off to deconflict
        entry/exits from current users (i.e. activate Zita transit altitude).
        8.1.4.6.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Zita Exit. On recovery, aircraft will transit Zita
        airspace at FL130, or at another altitude deconflicted from other Zita traffic, until
        established in the Aviano RAPCON airspace (within Zita South airspace) and in radio
        contact with Aviano Approach. Pilots are responsible for deconfliction from other
        Zita traffic until “radar contact” and issued radar vectors or other ATC instructions
        (i.e. “proceed direct to Risom/Silva/Penny/Falco”). On initial contact with Aviano
        Approach, flight leads will add "clear of Zita traffic" in addition to their initial arrival
        radio call. ATC will expedite clearing the flight to descend below FL130 in order to
        minimize time at FL130 while not on UHF 16.
     8.1.4.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) VFR arrivals.
        8.1.4.7.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Contact Aviano Approach with intentions
        approaching Aviano airspace. On initial contact with Aviano, respond with number
        of aircraft, position from Aviano, ATIS code, and intentions, “Viper 01, 4-ship, 30
        miles south of Aviano, with Alpha, Falco for Initial.” Pilots will remain on approach
        frequency for traffic advisories and not switch to tower frequency until crossing point
        Falco/Eagle.
        8.1.4.7.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) RWY 05 (Reference Attachment 9).
           8.1.4.7.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The VFR entry point is Falco. When cleared
           by ATC, depart Falco heading 320˚ at 3,500’ MSL until aligned with the runway.
           Avoid Sacile by offsetting to the north as safety allows. At 7 DME, begin descent
           to 2,000’ MSL. Arrive at 2,000’ MSL by 3 DME. Initial altitude is 2,000’ MSL
           with a north break for a left base to RWY 05.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                  65


          8.1.4.7.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) If required, re-enter to initial via the VMC
          Noise Abatement Procedure to point Eagle at 3,500’ MSL, then to point Falco.
          Example: "Viper 01, Re-enter Eagle."
          8.1.4.7.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) VFR straight-ins to RWY 05 will not
          descend to 2,000’ MSL until turning to extended final. Clear for radar traffic at or
          above 2,000’ MSL.
          8.1.4.7.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) VFR aircraft may depart Falco as low as
          2,500’ MSL when the ceiling is greater than or equal to 3,000’ MSL but less than
          4,000’ MSL. Coordinate with ATC prior to descending to 2,500’ MSL at Falco.
             8.1.4.7.2.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Use the same procedures as Rwy 05,
             except make a left turn at 5 DME, followed by a right turn to inside
             downwind. Do not overfly the base during the inbound portion of the
             recovery, until north of the extended runway centerline.
             8.1.4.7.2.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Re-enter via Eagle at 3,500’ MSL, then
             follow Rwy 23 VFR entry procedures.
          8.1.4.7.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Grappa Recovery (Reference Attachment
          11).
             8.1.4.7.2.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Request with desired altitude on initial
             contact with Aviano Approach, “Viper 01, 4-ship, 20 miles south of Aviano
             with Alpha, Grappa Recovery, 10,000.”
             8.1.4.7.2.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Depart Penny in the block 5,000’-
             10,000’ MSL, or as cleared, direct Aviano. At 5 DME (AVI 164/5), turn right
             towards the outside of the departure end of the runway, begin descent,
             maintain at or above 2,500’ MSL, and avoid over flight of the base until
             crossing runway centerline. Then turn left to arrive on inside downwind at
             2,000’ MSL for a normal overhead pattern. Wingmen will maintain line
             abreast formation until taking spacing in the left turn to downwind. Minimum
             weather required is 6,000’/8 km visibility.
             8.1.4.7.2.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Restrictions:         Day-only. Maximum
             airspeed is 400 KCAS. Wingmen will maintain a maximum of 6,000’ spacing
             from element lead. When recovering in a formation larger than a two-ship,
             ensure elements do not exceed two aircraft in order to avoid conflicts with
             aircraft on departure. Do not overfly the base during the inbound portion of
             the recovery.
             8.1.4.7.2.5.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the field is not in sight by 5 DME or
             directed to breakout while northbound, execute a right turn at 3,500’ MSL and
             re-enter via Eagle then Falco and contact Aviano Approach. For traffic
             deconfliction on initial, final, or inside downwind, maintain at or above 2,500’
             MSL and re-enter via High Downwind Re-Entry.
             8.1.4.7.2.5.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) The overhead SFO pattern is an
             inherent conflict with Grappa operations. Tower controllers may deny the
             concurrent execution of overhead SFOs and Grappa recoveries. The straight-
66                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


               in SFO holding pattern is deconflicted from Grappa recoveries to RWY 05.
        8.1.4.7.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) RWY 23 (Reference Attachment 10).
           8.1.4.7.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Entry point is Eagle. When cleared by
           tower, depart point Eagle heading 015o at 2,500’ MSL. Turn to parallel the dry
           river bed. Turn to initial around the second red striped tower at the edge of San
           Foca, then descend to 2,000’ MSL. Initial altitude is 2,000’MSL with a north
           break for a right base to RWY 23.
           8.1.4.7.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Reentry to initial via Falco then Eagle.
           Maintain between 700’ and 1,500’ MSL until departure end, turn left direct Falco,
           climb to 3,500’ MSL. Avoid the towns of Sacile and Vigonovo. Example:
           "Viper 01, Re-enter Falco."
           8.1.4.7.3.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Do not fly practice VFR straight-in patterns
           to RWY 23. If an emergency straight-in is required, the ground track is the same
           as if proceeding to initial. Depart Eagle at 1,500’ MSL.
           8.1.4.7.3.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Grappa Recovery (Reference Attachment
           11).
        8.1.4.7.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Tactical Initials. Authorized to RWY 05 only.
        Tactical Initial airspeed is 400 KIAS. Element leads will fly over the runway with
        wingman 6,000’ line abreast to the south. Tactical initials are prohibited during vault
        operations (31 FW SOF will advise via ATIS).
        8.1.4.7.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) High Downwind Re-Entry (Reference Attachment
        9). Tower may approve a high downwind re-entry if pattern spacing does not allow a
        closed pattern. Example: "Viper 01, Re-enter High Downwind."
           8.1.4.7.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Turn to the north, climbing to 2,500' MSL
           and then turn to intercept a 3 DME initial descending back to 2,000' MSL.
           Remain within 5 nm of the field.
           8.1.4.7.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots may request high downwind for an XX
           nm straight-in if a straight-in approach is desired. Climb to 2,500' MSL and
           proceed to the requested nm when cleared by tower. Begin a descent to 2,000’
           MSL turning left base for extended final. Clear for radar and VFR pattern traffic
           at or above 2,000’ MSL. Example: "Viper 01, Re-enter High Downwind for
           7nm Straight-In."
        8.1.4.7.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Low approaches. Cross departure end below
        1,500’ MSL. Request closed, SFO, High Downwind reentry or reentry via point
        Eagle/Falco.
        8.1.4.7.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Chase Procedures. Chase aircraft will offset no
        further south than Bravo taxiway.
     8.1.4.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) SFO Procedures and Restrictions.
        8.1.4.8.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) SFOs may only be accomplished at locations with
        an ATC memorandum of agreement and published procedures. In USAFE, current
        memorandums and procedures exist for Aviano, Spandgdahlem, and Incirlik.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                 67


       8.1.4.8.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Local SFO Procedures (Reference Attachment 12).
       Coordinate with ATC and/or Tower on initial contact with requested altitude. For an
       overhead SFO, “Aviano Tower, Cobra 01, approaching Falco, (straight in) SFO on
       request, 10,000’.” Once told to report High Key, climb to high key altitude while
       following the normal initial ground track.
          8.1.4.8.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Assumed High Key altitude is 10,000' MSL
          unless otherwise coordinated with ATC.
          8.1.4.8.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hold at high key following the ground track
          of the intended SFO pattern. Use a right hand holding pattern for RWY 05 and a
          left hand holding pattern for RWY 23. Pilots will state their altitude when
          directed to hold. Successive aircraft en-route to high key will de-conflict by
          1,000’.
          8.1.4.8.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Weather required for all SFO patterns is day,
          VMC, 8 km visibility.
          8.1.4.8.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will maintain VMC cloud clearance
          requirements for all SFO patterns.
          8.1.4.8.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Overhead SFOs will be accomplished in 4-
          ship formations maximum.
          8.1.4.8.2.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) “Random Entry” SFOs are approved with
          prior coordination and traffic permitting.
          8.1.4.8.2.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Overhead SFO from Falco/Eagle. The SFO
          pattern is a 360° descending turn to the south. Report “High Key”, “Low Key”,
          and “Base Key gear down low approach.”
          8.1.4.8.2.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Overhead SFO from low-approach. Climb to
          High Key via a climbing 360° turn to the north. For Runway 05 only, remain
          within 3nm, and do not start the turn south, back towards High Key until at or
          above 5500 MSL, due to straight-in SFO deconfliction.
          8.1.4.8.2.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) If weather does not allow a high key entry,
          request the SFO at low key using the same ground track. The lowest altitude that
          may be requested for low key is 3,500’ MSL.
          8.1.4.8.2.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Straight-in SFO. Coordinate altitudes with
          Approach and/or Tower.
              8.1.4.8.2.10.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Straight-In SFOs may only be flown
              to RWY 05.
              8.1.4.8.2.10.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Depart Falco at coordinated altitude
              following normal initial ground track. Report “5 mile straight-in SFO, gear
              down, low approach” at 5 nm on final.
              8.1.4.8.2.10.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hold for a straight-in SFO from 10
              nm to 5 nm aligned with the runway inbound, left turns. Pilots will state their
              altitude when directed to hold.

               8.1.4.8.2.10.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) "Re-enter Straight-In SFO" is a turn to
               the north and a climb to the coordinated altitude. Maintain 2,500’ MSL until
               cleared to climb to SFO altitude by Tower. Proceed to 10 nm, turn left back
               towards the airfield, and report “10 mile” and “5 mile straight-in SFO.”
               Example:      "Viper 01, Re-enter Straight-In SFO." "Viper 01, 10-mile
               Straight-in SFO." "Viper 01, 5-mile Straight-in SFO, Gear Down, Low
               Approach."
     8.1.4.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) IFR Arrivals.
        8.1.4.9.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) IFR inbound traffic should expect 2 minutes
        between approaches. On initial contact with Aviano respond with number of aircraft,
        position from Aviano, ATIS code, and request. “Viper 01, 4-ship, 30 miles south of
        Aviano with Alpha, request.”
        8.1.4.9.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) All IFR approaches are to RWY 05. Fly circling
        approaches to RWY 23 to the south due to mountainous terrain north of the field.
        Radar monitoring is not available on TACAN final.
        8.1.4.9.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) For all approaches originating at Penny (AVI
        164/11) or when provided radar vectors to final, the maximum airspeed is 250 KIAS,
        unless otherwise requested.
        8.1.4.9.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) If separate approaches are desired for wingmen,
        notify the controlling agency.
        8.1.4.9.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Lost communications procedures.                    If no
        transmissions are received for 30 seconds in the pattern attempt contact with Aviano
        Tower and proceed VFR. If unable to maintain VFR, maintain 3,000’ until
        established on final and proceed with the ILS/TACAN approach RWY 05. Do not
        proceed north of the AVI 233 radial unless established on a segment of the approach
        due to rapidly rising terrain. If landing RWY 23, circle southeast of the runway for a
        left base to RWY 23.
     8.1.4.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Radar Trail Recovery Procedures
        8.1.4.10.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Radar trail recoveries will be flown IAW AFI 11-
        2F-16V3 and this supplement. Recoveries will normally be flown using the
        published ILS/DME RWY 05/TACAN RWY 05 penetration and approach.
        8.1.4.10.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Four-ship maximum for TACAN and ILS trail
        recoveries.
        8.1.4.10.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots are responsible for gaining and maintaining
        aircraft/element spacing of 1.5 – 2 nm. Do not utilize S-turns on final to gain spacing
        behind previous aircraft. Spacing will be achieved utilizing briefed airspeeds and
        ranges from the destination field. Pilots must strictly adhere to published instrument
        procedures to maintain spacing.
        8.1.4.10.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) After splitting into a non-standard formation, trail
        aircraft will squawk mode 3/C in sequence.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     69


        8.1.4.10.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) All changes in airspeed/configuration are called
        by the flight lead and mirrored by the flight members. The standard airspeed
        contracts are 300 KIAS until contact with arrival and on radar vectors, 250 KIAS
        until 9 DME, 180 KIAS until 3 DME final, and then final approach speed.
           8.1.4.10.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Communication procedures:                       When
           configuring, flight leads will use the format of: “C/S, config, local altimeter” (i.e.
           “Nickel 01, config, 29.87”) to communicate a change in configuration and
           airspeed. Flight members will acknowledge in sequence, lower their gear and
           slow to 180 KIAS. At 3 DME flight leads will transmit, “C/S, final approach
           speed.” All flight members will acknowledge in sequence and slow to final
           approach speed.
        8.1.4.10.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) If an aircraft loses radar contact the pilot will
        transmit, “Call sign, lost contact,” and follow procedures in AFI 11-2F-16V3. If at
        any time spacing is in question, the affected wingman will inform the flight lead and
        execute missed approach procedures or, if able to maintain VFR, break out of the
        pattern and proceed to the appropriate VFR reentry point. In either case, inform the
        ATC controller.
        8.1.4.10.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) If an aircraft is NORDO, the NORDO aircraft
        will squawk 7600 and continue the trail recovery. ATC will notify flight members
        and potential traffic of an aircraft squawking NORDO.
        8.1.4.10.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) If an aircraft is NORDO, loses radar contact, and
        separation cannot be maintained visually, the NORDO aircraft will continue the
        approach and squawk 7700. Expect the rest of the flight to be vectored out of the
        way.
        8.1.4.10.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) If ATC issues breakout or go around instructions,
        they are for the lead aircraft only, unless otherwise specified by the controller. If
        wingmen are going to stay with the flight lead, advise the controller.
        8.1.4.10.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) For subsequent approaches the flight lead will
        coordinate the trail formation with ATC.
        8.1.4.10.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) The flight lead will call all changes in
        airspeed/configuration and all flight members will match the airspeed/configuration
        simultaneously.
     8.1.4.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) Approach and Landing Procedures.
        8.1.4.11.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Under normal circumstances, do not land with
        more than 5,000 pounds of fuel.
        8.1.4.11.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS)
        procedures are not authorized at Aviano AB. Full runway separation is required for
        aircraft in different formations.
           8.1.4.11.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Different formations are defined as:
               8.1.4.11.2.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Flights with different call signs (i.e.
               Nickel 01, Buzzard 01, etc).
70                                 AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


               8.1.4.11.2.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Members of the same flight which
               have executed a flight split-up for practice approaches and have not reformed
               the formation.
            8.1.4.11.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft may rejoin as a formation
            anywhere in the pattern, with the exception of base and final legs, by requesting
            like callsign procedures. Approval to rejoin will be dependent on current traffic
            conditions, and must occur prior to a landing clearance being issued. Pilots will
            use the following phraseology to request like callsign procedures:
               8.1.4.11.2.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) “Tower, Nickel 04 requests like
               callsign procedures with Nickel 01.”
               8.1.4.11.2.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Tower, Venom 01 requests like
               callsign procedures with Cobra 01.”
        8.1.4.11.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) ICAO rules dictate that ATC controllers may not
        issue landing clearance until the previous aircraft (if that aircraft belongs to a
        different flight or is not assigned to the 31 FW) has crossed the runway threshold.
        This may result in delays in receiving clearance; pilots should expect to hear
        “continue” until the previous aircraft (subject to the restrictions above) crosses the
        threshold. This restriction also applies to members of the same flight after split-up
        (i.e. after the first pitchout to land/low approach).
     8.1.4.12. (Added-AVIANOAB) Local Climbout. Applicable to RWY 05 only. For
     consecutive instrument approaches, approach will issue the following instructions or
     advise “Execute Local Climbout.” After low approach, touch and go, or missed
     approach, climb between 700’ and 1,500’ MSL until past departure end. If the weather is
     ≥ 5000'/5km, fly the noise abatement procedure, followed by a turn to heading 180 and
     climb to maintain 3000' MSL. If weather is < 5000'/5km, then maintain runway heading
     until 2 DME, then turn right to heading 180 and climb to maintain 3000' MSL. Complete
     the turn within 5 DME to avoid Cellina Meduna controlled firing area.
     8.1.4.13. (Added-AVIANOAB) IFF Procedures / Self Protection Procedures.
        8.1.4.13.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) When over the Italian landmass, all flight
        members will squawk modes I, II, and IV. When within standard formation, the
        flight lead only will squawk Mode III and C. When nonstandard, all players will
        squawk all modes and codes.
        8.1.4.13.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Use of the ALE-47 training mode is authorized.
        If using airspace where chaff/flare use is authorized, the ALE-47 will remain in
        STBY until over water and at least 5 nm from land. All flight members will ensure
        they turn the ALE-47 off, or to STBY, at fence-out.
     8.1.4.14. (Added-AVIANOAB) Low-Level Navigation.
        8.1.4.14.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Low-level flying in Italy is subject to specific
        rules, procedures, and limitations. These are published in Area Planning (AP/2),
        Italian Low-level Operational Air Traffic Flight Manual (Manuale BOAT), MILAIP,
        and Italian SMA 73. See Attachment 17, 31 FW Low-Level Procedures, for
        additional guidance on conducting low-level training in Italy.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      71


        8.1.4.14.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) All U.S. military pilots (assigned, TDY, or guest
        pilots) must receive an Italian low-level brief from 31 OG/OGV prior to flying in the
        Italian low-level structure. All assigned pilots must take the Low Level test
        administered by OGV prior to flying low levels in Italy. The test is correctable to
        100%.
        8.1.4.14.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Low-level flight over the Italian mainland must
        be specifically authorized by the Italian Air Staff (published on PVG or approved via
        “immediate flight plan”). Pilots will not request Marche Nord TA once airborne if
        not authorized by Italian Air Staff prior to takeoff.
        8.1.4.14.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots flying low-level missions in central Europe
        (Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, France) will comply with the BIRDTAMS
        requirements in AFI 11-202V3_USAFESUP1, chapter 2. Additionally, ensure
        national low level procedures and restrictions are followed.
     8.1.4.15. (Added-AVIANOAB) Night Minimum Altitudes. Minimum altitude at night
     is the MSA unless under positive IFR control from an ATC agency. Pilots who complete
     the NVG Low Altitude Qualification, IAW 31 OG Syllabus, are exempt from this
     restriction and may fly below the MSA during Hi Illum only (1,000’ AGL minimum).
        8.1.4.15.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Previous NVG Low Altitude Qualification from
        another F-16 assignment will be honored by the 31 OG; however, this qualification
        must be documented in the pilot’s gradebook.
     8.1.4.16. (Added-AVIANOAB) G-Awareness. G-Awareness procedures and exercises
     will be IAW AFI 11-2F-16V3 and AFTTP 3-3V5.
     8.1.4.17. (Added-AVIANOAB) Minimum Operational Equipment. In addition to the
     requirements in AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, and Flight Information
     Publications (FLIP), the following equipment will be operative for all flights: TACAN,
     INS, IFF/SIF Modes 3A and C, Pitot/Angle-of-Attack Probe Heat, Standby Attitude
     Indicator, and Anti-G System. See paragraphs 8.1.3.8. and 8.1.3.9. for day and night
     lighting requirements.
  8.1.5. Section E. Weapons Employment.
     8.1.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Prohibited Attacks. Do not perform simulated low
     altitude attacks on historical buildings, places of worship, or tourist areas. Avoid
     planning simulated low altitude attacks on populated areas. Do not simulate low altitude
     attacks on any target within city boundaries.
     8.1.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Laser Employment Modes (LANTIRN TGP).
        8.1.5.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) During ground ops, pilots will ensure the laser is
        set to the green 1.54 micron setting. If found in the red 1.06 micron “combat” setting,
        pilots will inform maintenance and will not attempt to change the setting themselves.
        8.1.5.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Prior to firing the laser near any potentially
        populated areas, pilots will take an area track, shift the Sensor Point of Interest off of
        any populated areas and fire the laser. Pilots will ensure a “T” is located next to the
        flashing “L” in the TGP display. This will be accomplished each time the laser is
        “armed”.
72                                  AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


         8.1.5.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the “T” is not present during this test or any
         other time in flight, pilots will stow the targeting pod for the remainder of the
         mission, write up the aircraft “Code 3”, and inform both Top 3 and SOF.8.1.5.3.
         (Added) Hit Criteria. For Air-to-Ground missions, flight leads will ensure AFTTP 3-1
         Hit Criteria is briefed during the mission brief.
  8.1.6. Section F. Abnormal Procedures.
     8.1.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) General. Procedures specified in this section and the 31
     FW Pilot Aid do not preclude the exercise of sound judgment in the interest of personnel
     safety or the safe recovery of an aircraft.
     8.1.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Emergency/SOF Procedures:
         8.1.6.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Declare an emergency anytime crash or fire
         equipment may be needed or the situation necessitates traffic priority. Time and
         conditions permitting, contact the SOF (UHF/VHF 20) for assistance with any aircraft
         malfunction or occurrence. At Aviano AB, emergency aircraft will utilize the in-
         flight emergency (IFE) Single Frequency Approach (SFA - UHF9) until termination
         of the emergency. Once the emergency aircraft has landed at Aviano AB, the Aviano
         Fire Chief is the authority for emergency termination.
         8.1.6.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) When recovering with a “land as soon as
         practical” situation, reduce fuel weight below 5,000 pounds prior to landing if
         conditions allow and land with a chase ship unless the rejoin will result in a
         significant delay.
         8.1.6.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) All landings at bases other than Aviano AB will be
         a two-ship minimum unless an emergency precludes subsequent landings.
         8.1.6.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ground engine flameout procedures. In the event
         of an uncommanded ground flameout, do not reset any cockpit switches except to
         safe the EPU. Do not attempt to isolate the malfunction by recycling switch
         positions.
         8.1.6.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) In the case of malfunctioning landing gear, have
         gear visually checked by another aircraft.
            8.1.6.2.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) If no other aircraft is available, emergency
            aircraft with malfunctioning landing gear shall execute a 300’ AGL low approach
            between the runway and the south parallel taxiway to permit visual gear check by
            the SOF or tower.
            8.1.6.2.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fuel and weather permitting, hold to allow
            other aircraft to land ahead of you.
            8.1.6.2.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Crash recovery personnel will meet the
            aircraft with landing gear pins. Stop straight ahead after landing and follow crash
            recovery crew instructions. Do not turn or taxi an aircraft with a known or
            suspected gear malfunction until the landing gear is pinned.
     8.1.6.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Fuel Burndown.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                   73


        8.1.6.3.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Engine related emergencies. Hold as required to
        maintain 1:1 to runway of intended landing.
        8.1.6.3.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Other emergencies. Pilots will use discretion on
        where to burn down fuel. Due to multiple noise sensitive areas in close proximity to
        Aviano AB, pilots should not plan to hold lower than 5K’ AGL when burning down
        fuel. If intending to use afterburner during fuel burn down, pilots will coordinate
        with Padova for over water holding or with Aviano approach to hold in Zita airspace.
     8.1.6.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Barrier Engagements.
        8.1.6.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots will advise the controlling agency as soon as
        possible if anticipating a barrier engagement. If the situation permits, the pilot will
        coordinate landing sequence, engagement, and missed engagement procedures with
        the SOF. Fire Department personnel are responsible for removing aircraft from the
        barriers and resetting the barriers. The barriers are connected and disconnected by
        barrier maintenance personnel who can connect any of the barriers in about 15
        minutes.
        8.1.6.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) CAUTION: Pilots should exercise caution when
        aborting takeoffs or during emergency landings to avoid unintentionally engaging the
        approach-end cable with the hook down. If an approach-end arrestment is not
        desired, delay putting the hook down until past the 6,000 feet runway remaining sign.
     8.1.6.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) EPU Activation.
        8.1.6.5.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hydrazine Procedures. F-16 aircrew with an
        activated EPU should advise the SOF as soon as practical and deal with the situation
        as the conditions warrant.
        8.1.6.5.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) The primary activated EPU/Hydrazine area is
        taxiway Alpha 4 (Reference Attachment 5). Park with the left wing into the wind if
        able. Await emergency response crews (UHF 2 or 9). The alternate EPU/Hydrazine
        areas are the South Ramp and the Nickel Marshal/De-Arm Area (Reference
        Attachment 5). When using the South Ramp, prioritize parking in locations one and
        four in order to minimize effects due to a subsequent 300’ cordon (Reference Figure
        8.1).

         8.1.6.5.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) The fire department will chock the left main
         landing gear. After the aircraft is chocked, the pilot will turn the EPU off, then shut
         down the aircraft and egress to minimize exposure to hydrazine.
         8.1.6.5.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) If recovering to another airfield, ensure the aircraft
         is recovered to an isolated parking area, then comply with the same procedures above
         (if the host base is able to chock the left main gear). If unable to have the aircraft
         chocked, the pilot will select the parking brake and turn off the EPU, then shut down
         and egress the aircraft to minimize exposure. EPU/Hydrazine procedures are listed in
         the 31 FW Pilot Aid.
      8.1.6.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hot Brakes.
         8.1.6.6.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) The primary Hot Brake area is taxiway Alpha 4
         (Reference Attachment 5). Do not taxi into the loops if hot brakes are suspected or
         confirmed. Proceed to the primary hot brake area. The alternate Hot Brake areas are
         the South Ramp and the Nickel Marshal/De-Arm Area (Reference Attachment 5).
         When using the South Ramp, prioritize parking in locations one and four in order to
         minimize effects due to a subsequent 300’ cordon (Reference Figure 8.2).
         8.1.6.6.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) The following procedures apply only to 31 FW F-
         16s. Aviano personnel should not declare hot brakes for transient aircraft.
            8.1.6.6.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) During F-16 operations, the following
            situations may lead to hot brakes:
                8.1.6.6.2.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aborting greater than 120 knots.
                8.1.6.6.2.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Abnormal landings (heavy/fast, engine
                in SEC, early brake application, etc) that cause the brake energy limits to
                reach the caution or danger zone per the brake energy chart in T.O. 1F-16CM-
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                     75


             1-1.
             8.1.6.6.2.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Ground crew reports indications of hot
             brakes (glowing, smoke, fire, etc).
             8.1.6.6.2.1.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Tires deflate (wheel fusible plugs
             blown).
          8.1.6.6.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) If hot brakes are suspected or confirmed, the
          supervisor of flying (SOF) will declare a ground emergency unless already
          declared. Once a hot brake emergency is declared, the Incident Commander will
          establish a cordon around the aircraft. Under normal circumstances, the cordon
          will remain in effect for 45 minutes to allow for the brakes to cool below a
          temperature safe for maintenance personnel to approach and test the temperature
          of the brakes.
             8.1.6.6.2.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) In situations where clearing the runway
             or moving the aircraft is the highest priority (impending diverts, another
             emergency aircraft inbound, etc), 31 MXS personnel may enter the cordon
             sooner than 45 minutes to ascertain the status of the brakes. The authority to
             enter the cordon prior to the expiration of the planned 45-minute wait period
             resides with the 31 FW/CC. The 31 FW/CC has delegated this authority to
             the 31 OG/CC or his designated representative (no lower than the squadron
             commander level).
             8.1.6.6.2.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) To prepare for situations where 31 FW
             leadership determines reopening the runway is a higher priority, the Incident
             Commander will keep Crash Recovery postured for entry into the incident
             cordon before the 45-minute wait period.
          8.1.6.6.2.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the pilot suspects hot brakes on landing,
          the pilot should proceed to the hot brake are. If unable to proceed to the hot brake
          area, pilots will attempt to pull at least 300 feet away from the runway to prevent
          closing the runway.
          8.1.6.6.2.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the pilot suspects hot brakes in a congested
          area, the pilot should consider taxiing to clear the area. If the aircraft remains in a
          congested area, all personnel and other aircraft should attempt to evacuate more
          than 300 feet away from the affected aircraft.
          8.1.6.6.2.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) If a hot brakes emergency was declared but
          circumstances reveal that the aircraft does not have hot brakes (ie the SOF
          determines the aircraft was not in the caution/danger zone according to the Brake
          Energy Limits chart), the SOF may coordinate with the Incident Commander to
          cancel the emergency. If 31 MXG Crash Recovery determines the brakes are not
          hot, barring any other issues with the aircraft, the Incident Commander will
          terminate the ground emergency and give the aircraft back to maintenance or
          release the pilot to taxi.

     8.1.6.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft Recall. 31 FW aircraft will be recalled via
     GUARD in the clear. Upon notification, pilots will contact the SOF and pass fuel
     remaining in minutes.
     8.1.6.8. (Added-AVIANOAB) Approach/Landing Requirements for Aircraft with Live
     Ordnance. When carrying live or heavyweight inert free-fall ordnance, recover via the
     following “safe recovery” procedures:
        8.1.6.8.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Day VMC. Fly a visual straight-in avoiding over
        flight of towns.
        8.1.6.8.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Night or IFR.              Fly the approved TACAN 05
        procedure.
        8.1.6.8.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots are responsible to ask ATC for a “safe
        recovery” if needed.
        8.1.6.8.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) If aircraft must divert with live or heavyweight
        inert free-fall ordnance, pilots must fly a “safe procedure” to the divert location.
        Note: The only night/IMC divert safe recovery procedure is to Grosseto (see 31 FW
        Pilot Aid). Grosseto is the primary divert for live/heavyweight inert.
        8.1.6.8.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft with forward firing ordnance only may
        proceed to initial via normal recovery procedures.
        8.1.6.8.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) Practice approaches and patterns are prohibited for
        aircraft carrying any free-fall ordnance (exception: hot gun).
     8.1.6.9. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hung Ordnance.
        8.1.6.9.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hung Secure/Hung BDU-33. Recover via filed
        routing and fly the full penetration from Penny. Fly a straight-in with chase, avoiding
        populated areas. After landing, clear the runway to the south. Await EOD personnel
        to safe the aircraft. Aircraft with secure bombs that have been pinned may taxi back.
        8.1.6.9.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hung Unsecure. If unsecure, jettison suspension
        equipment. Primary jettison for all ordnance is over the Adriatic. See para. 8.1.6.11.
        and reference the 31 FW Pilot Aid for specifics. If unable to jettison, fly a straight-in
        approach with chase, avoiding populated areas.
            8.1.6.9.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft with unsecure live and/or
            heavyweight inserts should land on RWY 23 if        conditions      permit      to
            minimize over flight of populated areas. If cables need to be reconfigured, notify
            ATC ASAP.
            8.1.6.9.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft with unsecure bombs will stop on
            the runway, de-arm, then shut down.
        8.1.6.9.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Hung forward firing ordnance. After clearing the
        runway to the south, point the nose of the aircraft down the infield between the
        runway and the south parallel. After the aircraft and the weapons are safe, shut down
        in place. Aircraft with safe hung rockets may taxi back. See also LSA
        Exercise/Events, para. 8.1.2.16.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                      77


        8.1.6.9.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) ALE-50 Fail to Sever.
            8.1.6.9.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) All attempts to sever an ALE-50 will be
            conducted over water. Cease all attempts to sever when over Italian land mass or
            when airspeed/heading/altitude may cause impact on Italian land mass.
            8.1.6.9.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Inform SOF immediately. SOF will notify
            MADDOG and tower. MADDOG will notify BLACKJACK and SFS CP rep.
            Tower will activate stop lights with sufficient time to halt perimeter traffic and
            notify Airfield Ops for runway inspection.
            8.1.6.9.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) If a confirmed or suspected separation occurs
            over land during recovery, notify SOF. SOF will record time, best known drop
            location, altitude, heading, airspeed, and wind at altitude. After landing, Top 3 will
            call MADDOG to pass words to initiate a dropped object OPREP through CP.
            8.1.6.9.4.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Avoid populated areas to the maximum
            extent possible. Land via a straight-in approach to RWY 05. Landing on RWY
            23 presents significant hazards and should be considered as a last resort to safely
            recover the aircraft.
            8.1.6.9.4.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) After landing, pilots will stop straight ahead
            on the runway to allow maintenance to visually inspect the aircraft. If required
            and able, sever LE-50 prior to taxiing clear of the runway. If mission
            requirements do not permit stopping on the runway, pilots will taxi clear at A4 to
            a distance allowing the ALE-50 and cable to be clear of the active runway. If
            ALE-50 does not sever during landing roll, the SOF, tower, and pilot will ensure
            further taxi does not present further hazards to the airfield environment. The SOF
            will inform the pilot if it is safe to taxi to de-arm or to de-arm/shutdown in place
            for a tow.
            8.1.6.9.4.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) The SOF will coordinate a runway inspection
            once aircraft is clear of the runway.
     8.1.6.10. (Added-AVIANOAB) Inadvertent/Unintentional Release. Mark the point if
     possible and notify the SOF. For inadvertent releases pilots will have the EOR ground
     crew hookup on the headset and explain the particulars of the occurrence. Pilots are
     reminded that once the aircraft is saved and is back in parking, it will be impounded IAW
     the 31 FW Pilot Aid.
     8.1.6.11. (Added-AVIANOAB) Jettison Areas/Procedures/Parameters
        8.1.6.11.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Adriatic Alternate Jettison Areas (Reference
        Attachment 19). Three jettison areas are available. Pilot safety is paramount, but if
        time, conditions, and fuel quantity permit, utilize one of these areas:
            8.1.6.11.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) EJ 3:               Radius 0.5nm from N4358.3
            E1414.983. AVI 150º/140nm, SFC-8K’
            8.1.6.11.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) EJ 6:             Radius 0.4nm from N4203.967

            E1844.00. AVI 133º/388nm, SFC-FL150
        8.1.6.11.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Primary Jettison Area (Local Area). Jettison at
        least 12 nm from the coastline over the Adriatic clear of all sea vessels. The TACAN
        reference is AVI 160º/45. Do not jettison LIVE ordnance at this location.
        8.1.6.11.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Secondary Jettison Area (Local Area). The
        secondary jettison area is the 820’ jettison circle south of the target on Maniago
        Range (N 4606 E 1243 Elev 750’ or AVI 091/07 nm). Release will be VMC at 2800’
        MSL, heading 170º. Pilots will coordinate with Tower, if possible.
        8.1.6.11.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) In the event jettison of fuel or stores is necessary,
        aircrew are requested to inform Italian BOC at DSN 632-4730/7108 upon landing
        with the following information: Date and time of jettison; mission number/callsign;
        number and type aircraft; number and type stores jettisoned; aircraft parameters to
        include, altitude, heading, and airspeed; and any other useful information.
     8.1.6.12. (Added-AVIANOAB) Controlled Bailout Areas.
        8.1.6.12.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Primary Bailout Area. Position the aircraft
        outbound on the AVI 154º radial. Eject at 30 DME approaching feet wet with
        optimum airspeed and altitude.
        8.1.6.12.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Secondary Bailout Area. If the Primary Bailout
        Area is not feasible, position the aircraft outbound on the AVI 040º radial. Eject at
        optimum airspeed at 7,000’ MSL at 8 DME on a heading of 040º.
     8.1.6.13. (Added-AVIANOAB) Weather Watch. Standard operations may continue.
     All returning aircraft will remain at EOR until de-armed normally. All personnel should
     prepare to implement Weather Warning procedures without delay. Pilots will report any
     lightning or adverse weather observed in the local area to the SOF immediately.
     8.1.6.14. (Added-AVIANOAB) Weather Warning. The SOF will declare WX hold.
     Pilots will not step to aircraft or start engines. Aircraft that have not taxied will shut
     down. Cease all outside activities and seek shelter. Close hangar doors. Contingency
     sorties may continue only with OG/CC and CAOC approval.
        8.1.6.14.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the Weather Warning is due to lightning within 5
        nm:
            8.1.6.14.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft taxiing for launch will remain at
            EOR until warning is terminated. Pilots contact SOF for guidance.
            8.1.6.14.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft landing with forward firing
            munitions (such as rockets, but not including a hot gun) and/or live munitions will
            contact the SOF and remain at EOR until properly de-armed. Taxi back only with
            OG/CC approval and MX coordination. Words will be passed through the SOF.
            Aircraft landing with chaff/flare, training munitions, and/or a hot gun will contact
            the SOF and proceed directly to PAS/parking spot.
            8.1.6.14.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) Aircraft arriving at the PAS/parking spot will
            be chocked, pinned, saved, and shutdown expeditiously. Pilots and MX crews will
            then seek shelter.

    CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                 EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS (T-1)

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish procedures
   for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available along the taxi
   route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be
 92                                    AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


   available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If
   protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with Command
   and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center,
   Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.

             RWY 05 DEPARTURE PROCEDURES & NOISE ABATEMENT


                  RWY 05 DEPARTURE PROCEDURES
  ALL Departures:
  Climb and maintain between 700’ and 1500’ MSL until past departure end of
  runway, cancel AB at 300 KIAS unless required for safety of flight, then…
  VFR Departure (WX >1500’/5km but < 5000’):
  Fly runway heading until 2 DME, then turn right direct to EAGLE, completing
  turn within 5 DME. Resume VFR departure as cleared and maintain VMC.
  IFR Departure (WX < 5000’/5km or Night):
  Fly runway heading until 2 DME. At 2 DME (not earlier than 1400’ MSL at night
  or when the weather is < 1500’/5km) initiate a climbing turn to the specified SID
  heading/track.
     o Risom/Roska departure: Use maximum of 30 degrees bank. Ensure
     altitude restriction over Cellina Meduna is met (6,000’ MSL at 6 DME) if
     vectored off of the departure procedure (i.e. “direct to Roska passing 3000”).
     o All other departures: Remain within 5 DME of AVI TACAN in order to avoid
     Cellina Meduna firing range. Resume Aviano SID as cleared.
  VFR or DAY IFR Departure (WX ≥ 5000’/5km):
  Execute the Noise Abatement Procedure depicted below, then resume the VFR
  departure or IFR SID as cleared.


  RWY 05 NOISE ABATEMENT PROCEDURE (DAY >5K’/5km)
  Fly runway heading until 1 DME, then turn right to heading 065 to stay North of the
  town of San Foca. Cross 4 DME at or above 3,000' MSL and turn right to desired
  heading while remaining East of San Foca tower. When activated, avoid Cellina
  Meduna either laterally by completing the turn within 5 DME, or vertically by climbing
  above 6,000' MSL by 6 DME. Resume VFR/IFR departure as cleared. Pilots will
  maintain VMC throughout the procedure. Wingmen will fly the same ground track,
  and will not use cutoff to rejoin until southbound, past San Foca. This procedure is
  not authorized at night or when weather is less than 5,000’/5 km

                            31 FW LOW-LEVEL PROCEDURES

A17.1. (AVIANOAB) Scope. The purpose of this attachment is to establish procedures for 31
FW low level operations in Italy. This read file supplements operational directives and
establishes local procedures for all pilots assigned or attached to the 31 FW.
A17.2. (AVIANOAB) Scheduling. Low level flights are permitted Mon –Fri 0700L-2300L.
Low level flights are not permitted Saturday, Sunday, or on Italian Holidays. A maximum of
25% of weekly scheduled sorties are allowed to be low level. AVI-08 and AVI-11 will be the
only stereo routes allowed for 31 FW aircraft until further notice.
A17.3. (AVIANOAB) Low Level Structure.
   A17.3.1. (AVIANOAB) General. The low level structure in Italy is defined as below 2000’
   AGL. Italian directives refer to low level flight as BBQ or BOAT. In order to operate below
   2000’ AGL in Italy, aircraft must adhere to the published flow directions based on odd or
   even days. Refer to MILAIP and Italian LFC (Low Flying Chart) for specifics on flow
   direction. Flow directions vary based on geographic area. For example, the flow in Marche
   Nord is NW to SE on odd days, SE to NW on even days. The exception to flow direction is
   turns up to 360° are allowed at low level for rejoins, safe escapes, threat reactions, or other
   specific training tasks. In order to flow opposite to the published flow direction, the aircraft
   must be established above 2,000’ AGL. Minimum altitude is 1000’ AGL unless established
   in a Tactical Area. Low level maximum airspeed is 480 KCAS, except for IP-TGT runs
   when aircraft may increase airspeed to 510 KCAS or 560 KCAS if performing a loft attack.
   AB use is prohibited when low level except for safety of flight or for specific training tasks
   (pops, threat reactions, etc.)
   A17.3.2. (AVIANOAB) Tactical Areas. There are multiple Tactical Areas in Italy. AVI-08
   and AVI-11 utilize the Marche Nord tactical area with a standard delay of 20 minutes. When
   established in a tactical area, the low level structure extends from 500’ AGL to 2,000’ AGL.
   Note: Aircraft must adhere to the published flow direction when below 2,000’ AGL at all
   times, regardless of whether or not established in a Tactical Area.
   A17.3.3. (AVIANOAB) Firing Ranges. There are multiple Firing Areas located throughout
   Italy. For information on the boundaries reference MILAIP, section ENR 5.2.1-1 and
   Manuale Boat, Low Flying Manual. These areas have specified vertical and lateral limits for
   the purpose of conducting military firing activities on a recurring basis. Activation of such
   areas will be notified each time by NOTAM, and can be found on the Wing Drive among the
   ITAF NOTAMs.
   A17.3.3. (AVIANOAB) 1 When firing areas are activated, IFR flight shall overfly such
   areas at least 2000’ above the upper limit, unless otherwise published.
   A17.3.4. (AVIANOAB) VFR Rules. From 2,000’ AGL to FL 195 aircraft may operate
   VFR (VOAT). Maximum speed when operating VFR is .95 mach. When operating VFR,
   aircraft will adhere to the following VFR hemispheric altitudes: From MH 090°-269°, odd
   thousands + 500’. From MH 270-089, even thousands +500’.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                       117


A17.4. (AVIANOAB) Mission Planning
   A17.4.1. (AVIANOAB) Stereo Route. PEX will indicate in the remarks section which
   stereo route the flight is filed for. Odd days will use AVI-11; even days will use AVI-08.
   A17.4.2. (AVIANOAB) NOTAMS. Pilots must check the “BBQ NOTAMS” (Italian low
   level NOTAMs) prior to flying low level in Italy. Base Ops will post daily ITAF BBQ
   NOTAMs on the “wing” drive at W:\31OG\ITAF NOTAMS. FS Intel will plot the BBQ
   NOTAMS daily on the master NOTAM map located in the squadron mission planning area
   and . Flight members will check the master NOTAM map and transfer applicable NOTAM
   information to their strip charts. Pilots will update the date on the strip charts each time this
   is accomplished. The mission flight lead is responsible for ensuring all mission planning
   materials are updated before flight.
   A17.4.3. (AVIANOAB) CHUM. The Manuale BOAT Low Flying Manual (green book)
   contains all CHUM information for Italian low-level operations. It is published every six
   months. Each squadron will maintain a master LFC-Italy map that is updated using the
   Manuale BOAT. FS/Intel will update this map daily with the Italian BBQ (low-level)
   NOTAMS. ECHUM is not reliable and will not be used for mission planning. Charts will be
   updated by hand with CHUM information from the BOAT manual and BBQ NOTAMs. The
   BBQ NOTAMs will address new CHUM between publication cycles. Prior to flight, pilots
   will ensure that squadron developed strip charts are updated with CHUM information to
   match the squadron master LFC-Italy map.
   A17.4.4. (AVIANOAB) Maps. Aircrews will utilize strip charts developed from current
   1:500,000 LFC-Italy maps. IAW AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP, NGA CADRG products from
   PFPS/FV may be utilized for reference only. FS/DOW will generate strip charts in a smart
   pack format for mission planning and flight. This pack will include a “big picture” map with
   divert field information. All flight members will have a current copy of strip charts to fly
   with.
   A17.4.5. (AVIANOAB) Attack planning. The FS/DOW generated strip charts will not
   contain preplanned attacks. These attacks must be planned by each individual flight.
      A17.4.5.1. (AVIANOAB) Flights will not pop into the VFR structure (above 2,000’
      AGL) until cleared by Padova Mil. If the flight is planning a pop attack that extends out
      the top of the low level structure (>2,000’ AGL), a low show backup attack will be
      planned that keeps the flight below 2,000’ AGL. If the primary attack keeps the flight
      below 2,000’ AGL, no backup attack plan is required. The low show backup is required
      in case Padova Mil denies the use of VFR altitudes above 2,000’ AGL for the pop attack.
      Multiple attacks on the same target may be executed in designated Tactical Areas (March
      Nord, etc.) if the run-in axis is changed by at least 30 degrees.
A17.5. (AVIANOAB) Ground Operations
   A17.5.1. (AVIANOAB) Flights will be scheduled for an IFR departure with a clearance
   limit of Chioggia. Flights may depart IFR and cancel as soon as practical or request a VFR
   departure with Aviano Ground.
   A17.5.2. (AVIANOAB) IFF procedures are IAW local Chapter 8 and the 31 FW standards.
   If departing VFR with no assigned IFF code, the flight will squawk 2600 in sequence.
 118                                   AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014


A17.6. (AVIANOAB) Route Procedures
   A17.6.1. (AVIANOAB) Weather Requirements. Low level weather requirements are as
   follows: Ceiling of 2000’ or 500’ above planned altitude (whichever is higher), 1nm
   horizontal cloud clearance, and 8km visibility. If LOWAT is planned, 11-214 minimums
   apply (2000’ vertical and 1nm horizontal cloud clearance, 8km/5nm visibility, and a
   discernable horizon).
   A17.6.2. (AVIANOAB) Flight leads will advise controlling agency of intent to cancel IFR
   (if applicable) and descent in to low level structure. The flight will descend to 1,000’ AGL
   as a default.
   A17.6.3. (AVIANOAB) G-Awareness Exercise.        G-Awareness               exercise   will   be
   accomplished IAW AFI 11-2F-16V3 and AFTTP 3-3V5.
   A17.6.4. (AVIANOAB) Over-flight Restrictions
       A17.6.4.1. (AVIANOAB) Plan your route to remain at least 1.5 NM either side of any
       town shown on the LFC 1:500,000 chart. Climb to 2,000’ above if you can not avoid
       them.
       A17.6.4.2. (AVIANOAB) Avoid Carpenga Range in Marche Nord by 1nm up to 7000’
       MSL at all times. Carpegna Range max ord. altitude is 6,300’ MSL.
       A17.6.4.3. (AVIANOAB) Flights are limited to one attack on a given axis per target.
       For multiple attacks on the same target, change run in axis by a minimum of 30° for each
       attack.
       A17.6.4.4. (AVIANOAB) Do not overfly the following:
          A17.6.4.4.1. (AVIANOAB) Areas specified by NOTAM
          A17.6.4.4.2. (AVIANOAB) “P” and “R” Areas (Zita, Speedy, Foligno, etc.)
          A17.6.4.4.3. (AVIANOAB) 1 NM abeam and 1,500 ft above:                  hospitals, jails,
          industries, known obstacles (ski lifts, antennas….).
          A17.6.4.4.4. (AVIANOAB) Glider : 2 NM
          A17.6.4.4.5. (AVIANOAB) Hang-glider : 1 NM or 1,000 ft AGL
          A17.6.4.4.6. (AVIANOAB) Parachute drops: 1.5 NM
   A17.6.5. (AVIANOAB) Communications
       A17.6.5.1. (AVIANOAB) 31 FW aircraft will be pushed to appropriate frequencies by
       the controlling agencies. Flights will check in with call sign, flow direction and altitude.
       Flights may not get a response from the controlling agency due to line of sight. However,
       flights will make every effort to establish communications with the controlling agency.
       Flights may continue to operate along the flight planned route without radio contact, to
       include entering Marche Nord, but will continue to attempt contact. Once contact is
       reestablished, confirm your intentions with the controlling agency. The FS/DOW strip
       charts contain approximate locations for frequency changes, controlling agencies, and
       frequencies that will be used. These are shown on the strip charts as green lines.
AFI11-2F-16V3_AVIANOABSUP_I 25 MARCH 2014                                                 119


     A17.6.5.2. (AVIANOAB) Approaching Marche Nord, flights will contact Padova Mil
     on UHF CH 5 and inform them of the following:
        A17.6.5.2.1. (AVIANOAB) Estimated time of delay in Marche Nord
        A17.6.5.2.2. (AVIANOAB) Requested VFR altitude above Marche Nord (“Viper 01
        request Marche Nord 500’ AGL to FL180, for the next 20 minutes”). Flights will not
        pop into the VFR structure (above 2,000’ AGL) until cleared by Padova Mil.
     A17.6.5.3. (AVIANOAB) Five minutes prior to departing Marche Nord, advise Padova
     Mil of requested RTB intentions, i.e. VFR, IFR, low level.
  A17.6.6. (AVIANOAB) LOWAT SPINS
     A17.6.6.1. (AVIANOAB) LOWAT scenarios will be pre-briefed and will adhere to the
     following maneuvers:
        A17.6.6.1.1. (AVIANOAB) Ensure the flight is cleared VFR altitudes above
        Marche Nord to a minimum of 3,000’ AGL.
        A17.6.6.1.2. (AVIANOAB) A low block and a high block will be used. The low
        block is defined as 500’ AGL to 2,000’ AGL. The high block is defined as above
        3,000’ AGL.
        A17.6.6.1.3. (AVIANOAB) Fighters in the low block (below 2K AGL) will adhere
        to the published flow direction. Red fighters in the low block will adhere to the low-
        level flow directions and will be non-maneuvering until 3/9 passage, then may react
        IAW 11-214 LOWAT training rules.
        A17.6.6.1.4. (AVIANOAB) Fighters in the high block will flow opposite direction
        at or above 3,000’ AGL and will maintain VFR hemispheric altitudes to the max
        extent possible prior to the merge (see para. A13.3.3.).
        A17.6.6.1.5. (AVIANOAB) Flight leads will stress ground avoidance in the low
        altitude environment during the coordination brief.
  A17.6.7. (AVIANOAB) Route Abort
     A17.6.7.1. (AVIANOAB) Pilots may deviate from flow direction long enough to obtain
     VFR altitude or IFR clearance prior to executing a route abort. For example, in the case
     of a sloping weather deck, the flight lead may turn the flight around and flow opposite
     direction in the low level structure momentarily in order to climb to VFR altitude or
     obtain an IFR clearance. Do not delay a route abort if the need arises.
     A17.6.7.2. (AVIANOAB) Pilots will avoid the Bologna area by a minimum of 10nm at
     all altitudes. In addition, Bologna will be used as a divert field only as a last resort.
