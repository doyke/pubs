such that at least 90 percent of the materials they produce or supply will meet or exceed the specified
values with a 95 percent confidence level.
acceptable hazard—determination of the acceptability of any hazard imposed by a launch vehicle/
missile or orbital vehicle launched from or onto the range is solely the responsibility of the Space Wing
Commander; the acceptability varies with operational requirements and/or national need and is
determined by the Space Wing Commander on a case-by-case basis.
acceptable launch risk—the figure of 30 x 10-6 used by the AFSPC ranges as the acceptable launch level
for each hazard without high management review and approval; the figure of 1 x 10-6 used by the AFSPC
ranges as the acceptable risk level for an individual without high management review and approval.
acceptance tests—the required formal tests conducted on hardware to ascertain that the materials,
manufacturing processes, and workmanship meet specifications and that the hardware is acceptable for its
intended use; also the formal required tests conducted on software to ascertain that the code meets
specifications and is acceptable for its intended use.
accepted risk—a residual hazard that has been accepted by the Program Manager and the Space Wing
Commander.

accumulated risk—the combined collective risk to all individuals exposed to a particular hazard through
all phases of an operation.
adequate source—a data source that enables the Mission Flight Control Officer to determine when a
launch vehicle violates established in-flight safety criteria.
Aerozine 50—a 50-50 blend of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.
aggregated risk—the accumulated risk due to all hazards associated with a flight; see also accumulated
risk.
all-fire level—the minimum direct current or radio frequency energy that causes initiation of an
electroexplosive initiator or exploding bridgewire initiator or laser initiated device with a reliability of
0.999 at a confidence level of 95 percent as determined by a Bruceton test. Recommended operating level
is all-fire current, as determined by test, at ambient temperature plus 150 percent of the minimum all-fire
current.
allowable load—(stress) – the maximum load (stress) that can be allowed in a material for a given
operating environment to prevent rupture or collapse or detrimental deformation; allowable load (stress)
in these cases are ultimate load (stress), buckling load (stress), or yield load (stress), respectively.
allowable strength—the ratio of material strength to the specified factor of safety.
antenna—a device capable of radiating or receiving radio frequency energy.
applied load—the static or dynamic load applied to a structure, excluding load amplification factors.
applied load—(stress) – the actual load (stress) imposed on the structure in the service environment.
arm/disarm device—an electrically or mechanically actuated switch that can make or break one or more
ordnance firing circuits; operate in a manner similar to safe and arm devices except they do not physically
interrupt the explosive train.
arming plug—a removable device that provides electrical continuity when inserted in a firing circuit.
automatic destruct system—a flight safety system that is installed on each propulsion system on the
launch vehicle, including stages, upper stages, and payload systems; the automatic destruct system is
installed during assembly; this system functions autonomously during flight to render the powered stage
non-propulsive in the event of the inadvertent breakup of a vehicle.
ballistic coefficient—a design parameter indicating the relative magnitude of inertial and aerodynamic
effects; used in performance analysis of objects moving through the atmosphere; also referred to as beta
( ); it is given by the expression W/CdA, where W is the weight, Cd is the drag coefficient, and A is the
reference area of the object in motion through the atmosphere.
battery capacity—(1) rated capacity: the capacity assigned by the battery manufacturer based on a set of
specific conditions such as discharge temperature, discharge current, end of discharge voltage, and state
of charge at start of discharge; (2) measured capacity: the capacity determined by the specific
qualification tests, including any time the battery is under load during qualification; the end of discharge
voltage is the minimum voltage that flight termination system components have been qualified to.
blast danger area –—a hazardous clear area; clearance prior to establishment of a major explosive
hazard such as vehicle fuel/oxidizer load and pressurization; the area subject to fragment and direct
overpressure resulting from the explosion of the booster/payload.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V7 1 JULY 2004                                                                                 29


boat exclusion area—an area that consists of the downrange hazard or caution areas; private surface
vessels are prohibited in downrange hazard and caution areas. The flight safety analysis evaluates the risk
to a boat in the downrange hazard or caution area by plotting the boat’s position on a map and examining
the corresponding risk contour. Downrange vessels supporting the operation may support in the caution
area.
brittle fracture—(1) a type of failure mode in structural materials that usually occurs without prior
plastic deformation and at extremely high speed, (2) a type of failure mode such that burst of the vessel is
possible during cycling [normally this mode of failure is a concern when cycling to the maximum
expected operating pressure (MEOP) or when the vessel is under sustained load at MEOP], and (3) a type
of fracture that is characterized by a flat fracture surface with little or no shear lips (slant fracture surface)
and at average stress levels below those of general yielding.
brittle materials—see materials, brittle.
Bruceton test method—a statistical method for determining the all-fire and no-fire characteristics of an
electroexplosive device using a small sample size, but with high reliability.
burst factor—a multiplying factor applied to the MEOP to obtain the design burst pressure; synonymous
with ultimate pressure factor.
casualty –—a serious injury or worse, including death, to a human.
casualty area—area about a hypothetical impact point of a fragment in which a defined injury to persons
may occur.
Category A EED/ordnance—electroexplosive devices or ordnance that, by the expenditure of their own
energy or because they initiate a chain of events, may cause serious injury or death to personnel or
damage to property.
Category B EED/ordnance—electroexplosive devices or ordnance that, by the expenditure of their own
energy or because they initiate a chain of events, will not cause serious injury or death to personnel or
damage to property.
certified inspector—a person qualified and certified in nondestructive examination inspection
techniques according to the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, recommended practices
(SNT-TC-1A).
collective risk—the total combined risk to all individuals within a category (for example,
launch-essential personnel, general public) exposed to a particular hazard during a specific period of time
or event; unless otherwise noted, the mean number of casualties predicted (Ec) to result from a given
