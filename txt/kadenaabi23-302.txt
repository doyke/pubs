    1.3. Vehicle Abuse: Damage caused by willful or negligent acts of improper operation or
    care. Some examples of vehicle abuse are listed in Attachment 2. Note: For suspected
    abuse damage, the Vehicle Management Flight Chief or Superintendent will consider the
    facts and determine whether the vehicle is processed as an accident or abuse.
    1.4. Vehicle Incident: Damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters, mechanical
    failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe operation or
    adequate vehicle care during non-use. Using organizations are not required to reimburse

    2.1. The 18th Wing Chain of Command will be used to resolve any conflicts.
    2.2. The 18th Logistics Readiness Squadron (18 LRS) will:

       2.2.2. Provide an accident/abuse notification letter (Attachment 3), photos, and AF
       Form 20, Repair Cost and Repairable Value Statement, to the Commander and Vehicle
       Control Officer (VCO)/Vehicle Control Noncommissioned Officer (VCNCO) of the
       assigned organization (may not be the unit responsible for damage). A copy of the repair
       estimate work order may be provided upon request.
    2.3. Assigned or using organization will:
       2.3.1. IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property, chapter 18, an
       investigation is required to determine if gross negligence or willful misconduct is evident.
       If it is determined that either of these criteria are met, you must decide whether to seek
       recovery of the vehicle repair cost associated with the accident/abuse.
       2.3.2. Using organizations will provide 18 LRS/LGRV a “Vehicle Release” letter
       (Attachment 4) and a memorandum describing the results of the investigation. This
       memorandum must state the commander’s decision to process or dismiss the ROS.
    2.4. Funding accident and abuse repairs.
       2.4.1. In accordance with AFI 23-302, all O&M funds expended for vehicle accident and
       abuse repair costs, including contract cost, will be reimbursed by the owning
       organization, or the organization responsible for the damage if not the owner.
       2.4.2. Funding avoidable repairs with using organization’s funds will underscore the
       need for management involvement in a viable squadron-level accident and abuse
       prevention program. It will also foster an effective operator training program, encourage
       operator care, prevent needless repairs and ultimately save government dollars annually

           2.4.3.1. Upon receipt of the Vehicle Release letter outlining investigation results and
           confirmation of available funding, Vehicle Management will commence vehicle
           accident/abuse repairs.
           2.4.3.2. Once the actual costs are determined, 18 LRS/LGRV will submit a Standard

                             EXAMPLES OF VEHICLE ABUSE

A2.1. Vehicle Management will initiate vehicle abuse action for vehicle/equipment damage or
failure resulting from:
   A2.1.1. Tampering with engine governors.
   A2.1.2. Operating vehicle with insufficient oil or coolant because operator failed to check
   levels according to established requirements, or failure to monitor dash instrumentation.
   A2.1.3. Operating vehicle with applied/dragging parking brakes.
   A2.1.4. Improper distribution or securing of loads in vehicle cargo areas or not following
   established loading and unloading procedures.
   A2.1.5. Using a vehicle for other than its intended or designed purpose (e.g. 6K F/L used to
   transport a 10,000 pound pallet).
   A2.1.6. Failure to accomplish proper operator care and maintenance (i.e. clean/maintain
   vehicle’s interior/exterior to meet corrosion control and appearance requirements).
   A2.1.7. Unauthorized wiring, marking, or modification of a vehicle (VCO/VCNCO must
   submit all modification requests through LGRV for approval).
   A2.1.8. Unqualified/untrained personnel operating vehicles without an instructor present.
   A2.1.9. Operating a vehicle with improperly inflated tires (i.e. not in accordance with
   manufacturer’s recommendations).
   A2.1.10. Tire wear beyond limits (e.g. below minimum acceptable safe tread depth of 2/32
   inch). Tire wear that exposes the cord renders tires useless for the recapped/re-grooved
   process.
   A2.1.11. Intentional destruction/disfigurement of vehicle’s interior/exterior.
   A2.1.12. Operating a vehicle/equipment in conflict with published DoD, AFOSH, OSHA,
   Air Force Instructions/Manuals/Technical Orders, or Japanese law concerning vehicle safety.
   A2.1.13. Failing to protect the painted surface(s) from corrosion and/or oxidation.
   A2.1.14. Allowing water to accumulate in the vehicle interior (e.g. washing out the interior
   with a hose, failing to close windows during a rainstorm, etc.).
   A2.1.15. Over-filling the engine crankcase, transmission, or hydraulic reservoirs.
   A2.1.16. Servicing the vehicle fuel tank or hydraulic reservoir with incorrect fuel or oils.
   A2.1.17. Failure to report vehicle discrepancies.
   A2.1.18. Failure to bring vehicle/equipment in for scheduled maintenance before an overdue
   condition exists. An approved rescheduling by vehicle management due to mission
   requirements is permitted.
   A2.1.19. Failure to secure vehicle doors from overextending when opening during high
   winds.
