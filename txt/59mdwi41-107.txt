SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include added member responsibilities and patient registration guidelines.
1. Responsibilities.
     1.1. Member Services:
        1.1.1. Verify eligibility on all patients who request medical care, and whose eligibility is
        in question.
        1.1.2. Submit monthly DEERS Ineligibility Report to the Uniform Business Office
        (Third Party Collections). Patients identified as ineligible for care will be billed for
        services rendered.
     1.2. Outpatient Clinics:
        1.2.1. Verify eligibility on all patients presenting for care.
        1.2.2. Complete 100% DEERS check for all outpatient visits.
        1.2.3. Verify eligibility.     Verification is a two-step process requiring a DoD
        identification (ID) card and a DEERS checks. For family members and retirees, check
        the reverse side of the ID card to ensure they are Direct Care Eligible. The expiration
        date must be verified on all ID cards when the patient presents for an appointment. This
        card identifies eligibility of care and medical services authorized to member. If the
        patient does not present a card, contact the Member Services office. DEERS checks are
        made automatically between the Ambulatory Data System and the Composite Health
        Care System (CHCS), and are transparent to the user.
        1.2.4. Require all patients without a valid ID to complete a 59 MDW Form 5036,
        Medical Treatment Eligibility Statement. Authorized personnel must ensure the patient
        reads, understands and signs the 59 MDW Form 5036 before proceeding with the
        scheduled appointment.
        1.2.5. Forward the completed 59 MDW Form 5036 to Member Services. The clinic will
        also direct the patient to report to the Member Services office within 30 days with proof
        of eligibility.
     1.3. The WHASC Third Party Collections office will bill patients determined ineligible for
     medical care.
2. Invalid ID Cards.
     2.1. If a patient is identified as having an invalid ID card due to expiration, change in status
     or mutilation, any commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer or civilian equivalent
     must confiscate the ID card. All invalid ID cards will be immediately turned in to the 802d
     Force Support Manpower and Personnel Squadron, Customer Service.
     2.2. For cases involving fraud, misuse, or abuse of an ID card, the clinic personnel will
     immediately notify Hospital Automated Resource Protection System at extension 292-6070.
3. Reserve/National Guard.

   provide a copy of their current active duty (AD) orders.
