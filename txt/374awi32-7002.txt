This instruction implements AFPD 32-70, Environmental Quality, and assigns responsibilities
for the use, operation, and maintenance of oil and water separators at Yokota Air Base (AB) to
prevent hazardous waste, fuels, and oils from flowing into the storm drainage and sanitary
sewage systems. It applies to all 374th Airlift Wing (374 AW) units, tenant units, support
organizations, and off-base sites. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of IAW the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through
their appropriate functional chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: The 374 AW Committee name has been changed, and deleted 374 AW Environmental
Protection Working Group (paragraph 1.2.).
1. Responsibilities Assigned:
   1.1. Organizations generating hazardous waste materials, oils, and fuel will not drain
   hazardous materials or wastes into the drainage systems. Always recover, containerize, and
   dispose of these wastes through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) by
2                                                          374AWI32-7002 29 MARCH 2012


    coordinating with 374th Logistics Readiness Squadron Hazardous Material Pharmacy (374
    LRS/LGRMH). Hazardous waste disposal will be coordinated with 374th Civil Engineer
    Squadron Environmental Flight (374 CES/CEAN). Organizations will recover and recycle
    used fuels and oils through 374 CES/CEAN as energy recovery materials. Coordinate with
    374 CES/CEAN for disposal of waste oil if they are contaminated or mixed with other waste.
    No fuel will be allowed to flow into the drainage systems connected to an oil and water
    separator unless it is a result of an accidental spill.
    1.2. Yokota Environmental Safety Council and 374 CES Operations Utilities Section (374
    CES/CEOIW), will control and monitor operation and maintenance of water pollution control
    facilities. If a spill of hazardous material occurs that is beyond the user’s capabilities,
    immediately contact 374 CES Fire Protection Flight (374 CES/CEF) at DSN 225-7125.
    1.3. 374 CES/CEAN and 374 CES Maintenance Engineering (374 CES/CEOE) will provide
    engineering and contract management support for all water pollution control facilities.
    1.4. 374 CES/CEOE will administer and monitor the oil and water separator cleaning
    contracts in close coordination with the 374th Contracting Squadron (374 CONS). Personnel
    responsible for monitoring (quality assurance personnel [QAP]) must be knowledgeable and
    qualified.
    1.5. 374 CES/CEAN will provide sanitary engineering and environmental protection support
    for this program.
    1.6. 374 CES Operations Flight (374 CES/CEO), through 374 CES/CEOIW, will be
    responsible for the operation and maintenance of oil and water separators.
    1.7. 374 CES/CEOIW will conduct monthly, semi-annual, and annual inspections depending
    on usage of the oil and water separators to establish work requirements. Personnel assigned
    to these duties must be thoroughly knowledgeable of the various types of oil and water
    separators. Such duties include, but are not limited to the following:
       1.7.1. Checking the effluent chamber to ensure no oils, fuels, or greases are being passed
       into the effluent. Report discrepancies to 374 CES/CEAN.
       1.7.2. Observing the accumulation of sludge in all of the chambers.
       1.7.3. Checking the oil collection chamber or separate storage tanks to see if oil removal
       is needed. Notify 374 CES/CEOE if pumping is required.
       1.7.4. Checking all valves and piping for breaks, leaks, or obstructions. Notify 374
       CES/CEAN and open work order to perform repairs.
       1.7.5. Checking whether the water level is normal (bottom of the outlet pipe). Open
       work order to perform repairs if needed.
    1.8. 374th Aerospace Medicine Squadron Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (374
    AMDS/SGPB) will:
       1.8.1. Identify environmental health threats and potential adverse health effects on
       personnel.
374AWI32-7002 29 MARCH 2012                                                               3


     1.8.2. Collect environmental data which includes environmental sampling when 374
     AMDS/SGPB determines the data is needed to characterize an environmental health
     threat.
     1.8.3. Conduct health risk assessments based on characterization of a health threat and
     inform commanders about health risk minimization options.
  1.9. The contractor will:
     1.9.1. Pump and/or clean oil and water separators and remove the accumulation of all
     sludge as identified by 374 CES/CEOIW and scheduled by quality assurance personnel in
     accordance with the statement of work contained in the service contract.
     1.9.2. Report to the QAP any pans that need replacement or equipment that needs repairs
     found during normal servicing.
