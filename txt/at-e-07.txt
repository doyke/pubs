                                              INTRODUCTION


This publication is designed to complement hands-on training and classroom instruction on operational
uses of the AN/TPX-42A. It doesn't replace equipment technical orders that are the official directives for
this equipment. The publication is divided into three sections:

Section I. Description and characteristics of the AN/TPX-42A controls, functions and operating
indications.

Section II. Familiarization and display interpretations.

Section III. TPX-49 operating instructions.




                                                      5
AT-E-07                                                                                               JULY 04


The AN/TPX-42A interrogator set provides a beacon system that works with, but gives separate and
additional capabilities to our radar air traffic control facilities. The set has four major modes available,
Modes 1, 2, 3/A, and C. Modes 1 and 2 are for military use. Mode 3/A, which now has a 4096 code
capability, is the common civil/military mode. Mode C displays direct altitude read-out and is
continuously operable. It is automatically interlaced with Mode 3/A, and causes specific altitude data from
cooperative IFF targets to be displayed on the plan position indicator (PPI) when desired. The AN/TPX-
42A will interrogate aircraft on all selected modes used, within an altitude range of -1,000 feet to 127,000
feet.

An indicator control (A box), installed at each operating position, permits you to select up to 10 channels
using basic (64 code) and/or discrete (4096 code) decoding for display on the associated PPI. You have
the option of selecting beacon radar video on aircraft replying to discrete codes, or a combined
presentation. Through target filtering, only those targets meeting specific identity or altitude criteria are
displayed to the controller concerned. This reduces target clutter on the radar indicators. The AN/TPX-
42A reinforces the primary radar target through the use of brackets, and beacon and radar video
information also complement one another on the radar display since the systems are made range coincident.
The information presented is unmistakably associated with the corresponding aircraft’s radar return.

The data displays, or tags, consist of target symbols, numeric identity codes, altitude numerics, bracket
video, and other special symbols. This allows you to rapidly identify, understand, and control your aircraft
individually at each PPI. The AN/TPX-42A also provides constant monitoring of emergencies,
communications failures, and hijackings independent of indicator range. Feature included are aural and
visual alarms for such activity. To aid in target identification, a Special Position Identification (SPI) pulse
may be used with any of the codes upon request. You also have the choice of displaying small position
symbols, called trail dots, showing the previous locations of traffic. This feature gives you an indication of
the aircraft’s direction and velocity. You have the option to hold back part, or all, of the information, and
place the identity code and altitude numerics (tag) in a position north, south, east, or west of the aircraft
position symbol, or centered upon it. This gives you some control in relieving overlapping display
situations.

These AN/TPX-42A features minimize controller-to-controller and controller-to-pilot coordination by
providing needed information automatically. This allows both the controller and pilot to devote more time
to other critical tasks. It also relieves frequency congestion, and allows both the controller and the pilot to
make necessary radio contacts without delay. Aircraft equipped with an automatic altitude reporting
transponder will continuously provide you with their altitude information, simplifying traffic advisories
and reducing frequency congestion.

                            DESCRIPTION AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS

            AN/TPX-42A CONTROLS, FUNCTIONS, AND OPERATING INDICATIONS

The operational controls of the AN/TPX-42A consist of two types of control boxes: A box and B box. An
A box (Indicator Control) is located at each ASR scope and contains the controls and indicators required
by the operator to control the selection of target data at each particular radar display. The B box
(Interrogator Set Control) is the master control panel and contains the controls and indicators needed for
selecting the various AN/TPX-42A capabilities and available features. It is used to monitor and control
major functions of all operating positions. Both the A and B boxes include press switches that have off/on
functions and illuminate when on. At those locations equipped with Programmable Indicator Data
Processor (PIDP) systems, not all of the switch functions of the A and B Box apply, those switch functions
not used at PIDP locations will be identified by an “*”. Some switch functions in this document have been
replaced by a keyboard sequence or moved to the Indicator Control Front panel assembly of the PIDP
equipment. See the PIDP Operators Manual for functions transferred to the PIDP equipment.

                                       A BOX (INDICATOR CONTROL)

This section describes the operational controls of the A box. Using Figure 4, located in the back of this
guide, and Table 1 below, associate the function of each control to its location on the A box.

                                                  with numeric indicators that limit the display of Mode C
                                                  readouts to a specific altitude/flight level layer, and an ALT
                                                  FILT (altitude filter) button. The desired layer is selected by
                   UPPER LIMIT                    setting the top elevation of the layer with the UPPER LIMIT
                                                  switches, and bottom elevation of the layer with the LOWER

AT-E-07                                                                                  JULY 04


                                  NOTE 1: Above FL 180 the AN/TPX-42A sensors
                                  produce an altitude signal referenced to standard
                                  altimeter 29.92. Below FL 180 this signal is corrected to the
                                  station altimeter. Use caution when setting the top layer
                                  elevation at or near FL 160 since aircraft passing through
                                  FL 180 can have a variance in altitude readout of up to 2,000
                                  feet. With the ALT FILT switch on, a descending aircraft
                                  could be filtered from the display until descending through
                                  16,600 feet.
                                  NOTE 2: Altitude correction in the continental US is based on
                                  the transition altitude (FL 180). Areas outside the US use
                                  different transition altitudes.
                                  Targets replying without Mode C, or garbled / invalid Mode C
                                  replies are forced displayed as if they were within the altitude
                                  filter zone with the appropriate position symbols (X or O)
                                  surrounded by a box. This box isn't displayed for "ident" or
                                  "SPI " replies. Forced displays only occur when the controller
                                  has activated either the same select code channel position
                                  switch as the target, or the ALL A/C POSN switch. Again, as
                                  in all altitude displays, slash characters (///) indicate that no
                                  altitude data is available and is displayed in conjunction with
                                  the box symbol and code. Valid Mode C replies from targets
                                  reported over 99,900 feet still display three dashes ( - - - ) in
                                  place of altitude numerics. Regardless of the altitude/flight
                                  level, emergency, hijack, and communications failure replies,
                                  with or without Mode C, are forced displayed onto the radar
                                  indicator. Positions are displayed by the symbol X
                                  (surrounded by a box if not within the altitude filter layer)
                                  with the appropriate code and altitude, if selected.

                                  Each switch position lights an associated green indicator. The
                                  actual interlace pattern being transmitted is observed on the
                                  1/2/3A/C indicators described above. The position for ATC
                                  use is 3C.
                                  CAUTION: Unattended A boxes should be left in the 3C
                                  position at all times to prevent “lock out” at the other
                                  positions.

                                      NOTE: The AN/TPX-42A can interrogate in four separate
                                      Modes: C, 3/A, 2, and 1. However it can only interlace three
                                      different modes at any one time. Mode C is always
                                      interrogated so there are two options for all indicators
                                      positions. If this limitation is exceeded, there are two types of
                                      priority systems that select which request is dropped or
                                      disregarded (the particular priority system in use at your
                                      location depends on equipment configuration and is selected
                                      by maintenance). One priority system automatically drops
                                      Mode 1. With this information, you can see the importance of
                                      returning your MODE SELECTOR to mode 3A when not
                                      actually being used to interrogate Mode 1 or 2.

INDENTITY FILTER SWITCHES                   *In the center of the A box are ten rows of switches. Each
                                             row consists of four thumbwheel switches with numeric
                                             indicators that are used to select one to ten discrete identity
             0       4           4    4      codes. This feature allows discrete displays of ten different
                                            codes at different radar indicators, either in the same mode or
                                             a different mode. To select a specific code, Rotate the
                                             thumbwheel switches until the desired code appears in the
             0       0           0    0      windows. We have selected 0444 in the top row.

                                             CODE. These switches are used to display the

POSITION SWITCH                               *Activating this switch displays the identify/code that is
                                              contained in the associated thumbwheel window. As a result,
                                              any aircraft answering that code bracket is marked with the
        POSN      D     CODE                  select position symbol (X) on the radar scope. The center of
                                              the X indicates the aircraft's true position. For example, with
                                              code 0444 selected, when POSN is depressed, all aircraft
                                              squawking code 0400 through 0477 will be displayed as an X
                                              on the scope, because the radar indicator inspects only the
                                              first two digits of the code for a match.

DISCRETE SWITCH                               *Activates the discrete feature of the indicator when the
                                              associated POSN switch is already activated. When selected,
                                              the indicator rejects all replies that don't match all four digits
          POSN    D     CODE                  of the selected code. Symbo1ogies/numerics are displayed
                                              only on those replies that completely match the discrete code
                                              selection. No other formats will be displayed with an X
                                              except specific forced target replies, which will be discussed
                                              later.

CODE SWITCH                                   *Causes display of a four-digit code readout adjacent to the
                                              position symbol (X) of all beacon replies that match the first
                                              two digits of the selected code. The code switch can only be
         POSN     D    CODE                   activated if POSN is activated.




NOTE: A special identification pulse may be generated for display at your option. On voice command to
"IDENT" the pilot activates this ident feature, and the select aircraft position symbol (X) or all aircraft
position symbol (O) is modified to show reception of a civil ident (I/P) reply on the radar indicator.
Position symbols will be enclosed in open circles with diameters that "shrink" from approximately 1/4 to
1/16 inch. The "shrinking" circles give the impression of bouncing balls and are displayed for the duration
of a complete scan each time an ident reply is received. Replies are displayed for all selected aircraft or all
aircraft targets.

1. POWER ON/OFF SWITCH: Energizes or de-energizes the TPX-49A System.

2. POWER ON LAMP: Illuminates RED when power is on.

3. OPERATING MODE: Selects LOCAL or REMOTE control of system. (Select LOCAL for
normal operation).

4. REPLY SELECTOR: Six position switch to select the type of reply to be generated for an
interrogation.

        a. NORMAL: Outputs code selected by reply code switches (5).

        b. MIL EMERGENCY: Outputs code 7700 in mode 3/A plus 7360 in mode 1 and 7777
        in mode 2.

        c. CIVIL EMER: Outputs code 7700 in mode 3/A only.

        d. COMM FLR: Outputs code 7600 in mode 3/A only.

        e. I/P: Outputs code 7777 in mode 3/A only, with the IDENT pulse.

        f. SPI: Outputs code 7777 in mode 2 and 3/A and the IDENT pulse.

5. REPLY CODE: This group of twelve switches is divided into four subgroups designated A, B, C and
D. Each subgroup contains switches marked 1, 2, and 4. These switches when selected to the IN position
form a binary code equal to one digit of a IFF/SIF code in the designated subgroup. To set in a code of
1476 in the REPLY CODE section, set subgroup A switches(1 IN, 2 and 4 OUT); B switches (l and 2
OUT, 4 IN); C switches (1, 2 and 4 IN); D switches (l OUT, 2 and 4 IN). The sum of the switch values
selected to the IN position for each subgroup equals the value of the corresponding digit of the IFF/SIF
code.

6. RANGE DELAY: This set of seven switches determines the range at which the TPX-49A generated
target will be displayed on the radar indicator. Ranges can vary from 1/8 to 15 7/8 miles. Range is
determined by the sum of the value of the switches set to the IN position.

7. TEST SELECTOR and TIME OPERATED: are maintenance functions/indicators.

                                   OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Turn TPX-49 system on (on/off switch).

2. Check OPERATING MODE, select LOCAL.

3. Set RANGE DELAY for proper range. This is normally set by maintenance personnel and should not
need to be changed.

4. Set REPLY SELECTOR to desired function. If NORMAL is selected, set desired code in CODE
REPLY section.

                              TARGET DISPLAY INTERPRETATION

1. SIDE LOBE SUPRESSION (SLS) and REFLECTIONS: The TPX-42 system is designed
to transmit SLS pulses to properly equipped aircraft that inhibits replies to antenna side lobes. Aircraft
transponders not equipped with SLS capabilities may respond to side lobe signals and be processed causing
false target returns at the same range as the true target, but with varying azimuth positions. This display
of false targets is commonly referred to as ring-around and should not be confused with reflected targets.
Reflected targets generally appear from aircraft operating in the same general area and altitude and the
reflected target can be displayed at any range or azimuth. Neither of these undesirable effects are the
fault of the TPX-42 system, but rather old style aircraft avionics and local topography.

2. Figure 3 is a composite display of all possible display formats of the TPX-42 system. This will help
you recognize and interpret the various format symbology and numerics displayed.

3. Figures 4 and 5 are graphic drawings of the TPX-42 "A" and "B" Boxes.
