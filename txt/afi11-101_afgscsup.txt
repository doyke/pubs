  2.7. (Added) Flying Hour Reports:
  2.7.1. (Added) Aircraft Utilization Report (AUR). In order to verify and validate the
  transferability of data between the IMDS and REMIS databases, HQ ACC/A3TB requires a
  monthly AUR-B from the wing designated flying hour POC; the report will be an operations and
  maintenance validated breakout of the sorties and hours loaded in IMDS. Reporting requirements

2.7.2. (Added) Monthly Flying Hour Execution Report. HQ ACC/A3TB receives all monthly
execution data through the FHOL Web Site https://accfhol.acc.af.mil. Changes and reflows will
be sent via the FHOL Web Site.
2.7.3. (Added) Mid-Year/Last Quarter Assessment. In addition to a periodic monthly review of
their programs, units will complete a full assessment each quarter. The assessments will
included: a historical review of flying hour execution and a forecast of wing capabilities over the
remaining portion of the year and the unit's ability to fulfill their flying hour "contract". If
adjustments to programs are warranted, they should not be unnecessarily delayed while trying to
improve conditions beyond the unit's control.
2.7.4. (Added) End-of-Year Reporting. Units should plan their flying training program to use all
available flying days. There is no requirement to stop flying prior to the end of the fiscal year to
simplify HHQ accounting for the flying hour program. At the discretion of the commander, units
may fly up to the last day of the fiscal year.
