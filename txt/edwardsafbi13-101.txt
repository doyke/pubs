1. General
     1.1. Aircraft Harmonization Range. Harmonization is the procedure used to orient the guns
     and fire control systems in aircraft. To achieve harmonization, the guns, sight and gun
     camera are precisely aligned by using a harmonization target.
     1.2. Inspection and Maintenance. The range requires periodic inspections and recurring
     maintenance to ensure that a buildup of projectiles does not occur and changes in sand
     composition are immediately identified. Either situation can contribute to a high incidence of
     projectile ricochet. Facility inspection rests with the ROO, 412th Maintenance Group (412
     MXG) Plans, Programs & Operations Division (MXF), Base Civil Engineer (412 TW/CE)
     with assistance from the Safety Office (412 TW/SE). The 412 MXG/MXF and 412 TW/CE
     are responsible for maintenance and repair.
2. Roles and Responsibilities
     2.1. The Range Operations Officer (ROO) is responsible for coordinating range maintenance
     and day-to-day operating activities.
     2.2. The Range Control Officer (RCO) is responsible for range operations and safety.
     Because of the unique aspects and demands of the various aircraft and projects supported, the
EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                  3


   RCO is delegated complete authority over all range operations. If the RCO feels that any
   portion of the operation is unsafe, they can cancel a specific firing or the entire firing day.
   2.3. The Assistant RCO will assist and maintain visual contact with the RCO during the
   entire firing sequence.
   2.4. The 412th Maintenance Squadron (412 MXS) Director will appoint RCOs and ROOs by
   letter.
   2.5. Range Layout. A wooden protective facing to trap ricochets will be provided. Plywood
   3/4 inch to 5/8 inch thick is recommended for this facing. The plywood will be replaced
   when more than 50 percent of the surface is shattered.
      2.5.1. Dry-screened sand is used for absorbing bullets. If the sand is too wet, it will not
      close the bullet holes. If it is too fine, the sand will cake. Dry-screened sand must
      conform to the following US Standard Sieve:

Table 1. Dry screen sand conformance following US Standard Sieve
 US Standard Sieve       Percentage Passing          US Standard          Percentage Passing
     Number                   Number                    Sieve                  Number
         4                       100                      30                   35 to 75
         8                    95 to 100                   40                   25 to 55
        10                    80 to 100                   50                   15 to 35
        16                    60 to 100                  100                    2 to 15
      2.5.2. The roof and sidewalls must be 12-inch thick concrete or built to keep the sand dry
      and resistant to penetration equivalent to at least 12 inches of concrete.
      2.5.3. The concrete slab must have tie down rings and markers so the aircraft may be tied
      down in proper position in relation to the target. Tie down serves two purposes during
      gunfire: it prevents aircraft movement with reference to the target and it keeps aircraft
      from being displaced from the aircraft jacks.
   2.6. Range Maintenance. Annually and prior to all firings, the sand will be inspected to
   ensure it is dry and will prevent tunneling of the bullets. The wooden protective facing will
   also be inspected to ensure it is adequate to trap ricochets. The ROO will maintain a record
   of the number of rounds fired into the range on an EAFB Form 5470, Harmonization Range
   Worksheet. The sand should be screened after 100,000 rounds and replaced after 200,000
   rounds. If the sand shows signs of pulverization or cratering (that is, the sand fails to absorb
   the bullet penetration and does not close the hole), it should be replaced, regardless of
   number of rounds that have been fired into it. When the RCO determines a need to screen or
   replace the sand or replace the wooden protective facing, the 412 TW/CE will be responsible
   for doing the work.
   2.7. RCO Qualification. The RCO may be military or civilian. The RCO must be at least a
   7-level or equivalent. As a minimum, RCOs must have prior knowledge and experience in
   the following areas:
      2.7.1. Aircraft Armament Systems
      2.7.2. Ground and Explosive Safety
4                                                   EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014


       2.7.3. Aircraft Familiarization
    2.8. Assistant RCO Qualifications. The assistant RCO may be military or civilian. The
    assistant RCO must be at least a 7-level or equivalent and must possess knowledge and
    experience in the same areas as an RCO. The assistant RCO may not assume any other
    responsibilities while they are performing the duties of assistant RCO. The assistant RCO
    can be trained on their duties on the day of the firing. At no time will the assistant RCO
    assume the duties of RCO unless they are trained for the position of RCO.
    2.9. Training. To ensure the safety of all personnel directly involved in live-fire operations
    training will be given to all personnel selected to perform the duties of RCO. Academic
    training will consist of reading this instruction, the RCO Training Plan located in Tab 5 of
    the Gun Harmonization Log and the Gun Harmonization Range checklist. Hands-on training
    will be given during actual live-fire operation by a fully qualified RCO. The trainer will
    walk through the operation with the trainee following the guidelines outlined in the RCO
    Training Plan. Completion of academic training, hands-on training and successful evaluation
    of range operation by the fully qualified RCO is sufficient to qualify an individual. Training
    is documented within individual training records or Training Business Area (TBA).
    Refresher training will be given annually and will be a review of the academic portion only
    and documented within the Gun Harmonization Log Book, Tab 5.
    2.10. The Control Tower will protect the range clear zone by ensuring no vehicles enter the
    Lakebed north of Runway 22L/4R. Pilots will avoid the range clear zone when active. The
    range clear zone is defined as a cone, 2 SM from the aircraft to either edge of the abutment
    area, extending to an altitude of 5,000 feet above ground level (see attachment 2). The
    Tower will broadcast on the ATIS and all tower frequencies when the gun range is active and
    inactive. The Tower will ensure any violation of the range clear zone, during or immediately
    before firing periods, is immediately brought to the attention of the RCO. Once notified by
    the RCO that firing operations are over, the Tower will resume normal Lakebed and flying
    operations. The Tower will request dispatch of emergency response crews if required.
    NOTE: The flyby line and flyby tower, building 115, located at the edge of the lake bed
    between the range and the Hot Gun Line (22 end of the runway), is not included in the clear
    zone.
    2.11. The Requesting Agency will:
       2.11.1. Be responsible for policing the range and aircraft parking area upon termination
       of the operation.
       2.11.2. Ensure that all personnel firing aircraft gun are fully qualified and have obtained
       all required Maintenance, Weapons Safety, Egress and Cockpit Familiarization Training.
       2.11.3. Be responsible to provide targets as necessary.
       2.11.4. Assist the RCO in ensuring that only the minimum essential personnel are
       present during harmonization operations.
       2.11.5. Notify and coordinate with 412 MXS Mechanical Team at 7-4084 at least 30
       calendar days in advance of planned operation date to allow time for proper range
       preparations.
    2.12. The RCO will:
EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014                                                               5


      2.12.1. Enforce the elements of this instruction.
      2.12.2. Retain final authority to approve or deny clearances to fire.
      2.12.3. Use only those checklists authorized by the Technical Data Working Group.
   2.13. The 412 TW/CE will:
      2.13.1. Assist the ROO accompanied by 412 TW/SE, in performance of an annual
      inspection of the facility. Results of the inspection will be documented; scope of work
      will be identified for contractual/in-house accomplishment and work accomplishment
      will be scheduled in a time frame compatible with facility need and use.
      2.13.2. Perform minor maintenance and repair (Civil Engineering Job Order type work)
      through in-house Civil Engineering resources on an as-needed basis through consensus of
      412 TW/CE, 412 TW/SE and the ROO.
      2.14.1. Draw up a maintenance type contract (regular or on-call) for the removal of
      projectiles and replacement of deteriorated sand (maximum 15 cubic yards). This
      contract will be funded by the 412th Test Wing via 412 MXG/MXF.
   2.15. The 412 MXS Mechanical Team Chief (Armament) or Mechanical Section Supervisor
   will:
      2.15.1. Ensure RCO training requirements are met.
      2.15.2. Develop and carry out checklists to support range operations.
      2.15.3. Develop and carry out range maintenance and enhancement plans with 412
      MXG/MXF, 412 TW/CE and 412 TW/SE.

         3.1.1.1. Aircraft type and serial number.
         3.1.1.2. Objectives to be met (for example, harmonization under TO XX-XX~X-X,
         test of special device under Test Plan XX-X, etc.). NOTE: When other than standard
         USAF technical data is required to be used to support the operation, the local agency
         mandating the use of the data is responsible for having the material validated/verified
         by the Technical Data Working Group IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
         Maintenance Management, Edwards AFB Sup.
         3.1.1.3. Special criteria, procedures and limitations (for example, aircraft engine
         must be operating, telemetry must be obtained, gun camera required, etc.).
6                                                    EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014


           3.1.1.4. Time frames involved (i.e., date aircraft will be positioned, anticipated
           number of days on the range, etc.).
       3.1.2. Arrange for the delivery and loading of ammunition (Target Practice (TP) Only) as
       specified by local instructions.
       3.1.3. Set up aircraft and equipment in accordance with Attachment 3 through 6.
       3.1.4. Coordinate range requests through Plans and Scheduling (412 OSS/OSOS) for
       inclusion in the maintenance schedule.
       3.1.5. Coordinate range request through 712 TSS/DRB for Job Order Number
       assignment as applicable.
    3.2. Before the Firing Day Inspection. RCO will inspect the range before each day's firing
    then make the determination to screen or replace the sand and/or to replace the wooden
    protective facing. The 412 MXG/MXF and 412 TW/CE are responsible for maintenance and
    repairs as needed.
       3.2.1. Inspect the sand to ensure it is dry and prevents tunneling of the bullets. The sand
       should close back around a hole when penetrated with a metal or wooden rod.
       3.2.2. Inspect the wooden facing to ensure it is adequate to trap ricochets and not shot
       away.
    3.3. In addition to paragraph 3.2 above, the range inspection prior to use will consist of the
    following checks, but is not limited to:
       3.3.1. Projectiles accumulating on the surface of the sand in the abutment.
       3.3.2. Sand slopes up to the top of the range and that no more than 3 feet of the back wall
       is visible.
       3.3.3. Imbedded foreign objects in the impact area.
       3.3.4. Excessive erosion of revetment.
       3.3.5. Flag, flagpole and ropes on revetments are serviceable.
       3.3.6. Target suspension ropes are hung and serviceable.
       3.3.7. Have available, and in working order, a phone or radio for direct communication
       to the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and the Control Tower when required.
       3.3.8. Warning signs are available at the firing area entry point and are serviceable
       3.3.9. No large objects, such as static aircraft, are forward of the firing aircraft tie down
       point
       3.3.10. Verify the overall safety of the range area.
    3.4. Safety Precautions. Gun firing operations by their nature are inherently hazardous
    because of potential malfunctions, delayed ignition and explosion, fires, cook off and
    ricochets. Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure that personnel and ground equipment
    are clear of gunfire. The Gun Butt can only have 30 MM and lower gun system rounds fired
    into the Range. The following procedures are necessary for the safe operation of an aircraft
    gun harmonization range:
EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                 7


     3.4.1. A pole displaying a red flag must be provided when test firing. The red flag is
     placed on a tall flagstaff in clear view of any entrance to the range. The flag dimension
     will be at least 18 feet long by 5.5 feet wide. A fully raised flag signifies that firing is
     scheduled or is in progress. At half-staff it signifies that the range is occupied but no
     firing is permitted. A flashing rotating red beacon light is required if the range is used at
     night.
     3.4.2. Signs warning that gunfire is imminent will be posted at main entry point of
     approach to the range area and stored at the range area.
     3.4.3. Aircraft safety precautions listed in the appropriate aircraft maintenance technical
     orders must be followed.
     3.4.4. Firefighting equipment will be readily available.        The minimum firefighting
     equipment is two 150-pound Halon 1211 extinguishers.
     3.4.5. Direct communication will be maintained between the target area and aircraft.
     Firing only begins after the RCO has ensured that the target crew has cleared the area.
     3.4.6. The airfield control tower will be notified by the RCO via phone or by radio
     through the MOC when gunfire is about to begin. Gunfire will not be initiated until
     cleared by the tower. Stop gunfire immediately upon discovering a hazardous condition.
     3.4.7. The RCO will keep ultimate control over all personnel on the range. The RCO
     will ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed to remain in the range area during
     firing periods. A firing period begins with the arming of the gun system and ends when
     the gun has been safed. The assistant RCO must keep in telephone contact with Edwards
     Control Tower during all firing periods. Only the RCO may authorize personnel to
     proceed down-range from the gun. The RCO will terminate range operations whenever
     the RCO feels events or circumstances warrant.
         3.4.7.1. During firing periods, RCO will not be assigned or assume any other duties
         (i.e., as monitor, harmonization team chief or fire the weapon, etc.) and utilize the
         Assistant RCO to assist them as required.
  3.5. Pre-firing Procedures. Before commencing range operations:
     3.5.1. The ROO will:
     3.5.2. Review the inputs of the requesting agency before assigning an RCO to the
     operation.
     3.5.3. Coordinate with 412 TW/SE to determine Safety Review Board applicability.
     3.5.4. Manage and coordinate range inspections as listed in Attachment 7.
  3.6. The RCO will:
     3.6.1. Review EAFB Form 5470 from previous firing to determine total number of
     rounds on the range.
     3.6.2. Ensure that all calculations are complete.
     3.6.3. Verify required range inspections completed and documented.
8                                                      EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014


       3.6.4. Notify fire department of intent to fire prior to firing and at the end of firing for the
       day. No standby truck or medical team is required.
       3.6.5. Notify control tower that firing operations will be taking place prior to firing and
       at the end of firing for the day.
       3.6.6. Ensure the aircraft is de-armed.
       3.6.7. Bring and raise flag on revetment.
       3.6.8. Post warning signs at firing area entry point.
       3.6.9. Ensure that no equipment is present down range.
       3.6.10. Ensure that no personnel are working behind range.
       3.6.11. Ensure that the aircraft is grounded, jacked and tied down.
       3.6.12. Boresight firing barrel to ensure that gun is centered on range.
       3.6.13. Ensure that two Halon 1211 fire extinguishers are present.
       3.6.14. Ensure all equipment is positioned (see attachment 3 through 6 for example).
       3.6.15. Perform pre-fire briefing to include, but not limited to:
           3.6.15.1. Emergency procedures.
           3.6.15.2. Hazard areas.

           ground personnel).
EDWARDSAFBI13-101 4 AUGUST 2014                                                               9


         3.8.1.2. Any member of the firing team observes an unsafe condition.
         3.8.1.3. Any unauthorized vehicle or person enters the firing area (from the warning
         signs forward).
         3.8.1.4. Directed to do so by the control tower.
         3.8.1.5. Any member of the team feels unsure about any aspect of the operation.
  3.9. Special Situations.
     3.9.1. Hang fire. If a hang fire is encountered, all personnel will remain clear of the gun
     area and follow the actions stipulated in the RCO's checklist.
     3.9.2. Cook off. If a gun system jams during firing or rounds otherwise remain inside
     the gun housing, it is possible for a cook off to occur. Allow a minimum of 5 minutes to
     elapse after completion of a firing sequence before the possibility of a cook off is
     considered abated. The RCO will make the decision if how much more time will be
     required if an exceptionally long burst has been fired or if the ambient temperature
     exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
     3.9.3. Gun System Jam. Ammunition may be ruptured and significant damage may
     result to the gun or gun system. This can result in a cook off or other unexpected
     ammunition detonation. If a “jam” occurs while rounds remain in the firing cam path of
     the gun, follow the directions for “cook off.” Also follow checklist procedures in EAFBI
     13-100, Flying and Airfield Operations, paragraph 15.9., Hung Munitions Ground
     Procedures (Including flares and jammed guns). In all instances, cease all operations,
     call MOC and request assistance from the 412 MXS Mechanical Element (Armament)
     Section, 277-4084.

Terms
Boresight Method.— The boresight method is normally done on a 1,000-inch range (the
distance between aircraft and target), using a boresight target. The guns are aligned with the
target by adjusting them while sighting through the gun bore with a breech boresight tool. The
sight and gun camera are then adjusted until aligned with this target. The boresight method is
used after repair or replacement of certain gun components outlined in the equipment technical
order.
Gunfire Method.— The gunfire method may be used to verify the boresighting. This method is
done on firing ranges that vary from 305 meters (1,000 feet) to 683 meters (2,240 feet). The
range must have an aircraft tie down slab placed at the selected distance from the firing
abutment. The target is placed in the firing abutment and positioned in correct relationship to the
secured aircraft. The sight head and gun camera are adjusted during the harmonization to align
the sight line and camera to view the target index. The guns are then fired and adjusted to obtain
the maximum number of hits in the desired dispersion area, as indicated on the target.
Cook Off.— A round of ammunition that may or may not receive a firing impulse, but fires as
result of the heat buildup within the gun housing.
Gun System Jam.— A “jam” is a mechanical difficulty within the gun or the gun system where
the movement of ammunition is precluded; it normally occurs when ammunition does not
accomplish the clearing cycle within the gun.
Hang Fire.— A round of ammunition that received a firing impulse, either electronically or
mechanically, but did not fire.

Range.— For the purpose of this instruction, the term range will indicate the Edwards Aircraft
Gun Harmonization Range.
Range Control Officer (RCO).— The RCO is a representative of the 412th Test Wing
Commander for all range operations.
Assistant RCO.— Although assistant RCOs are not mentioned directly in any instruction, it is
necessary to have one. Due to the conditions around the firing aircraft, RCOs are unable to
continually monitor the actions of all personnel involved in the firing operation.
Range Operation Officer (ROO).— For matters of safety, the ROO will be subordinate to the
RCO during range operations. The ROO can be certified as an RCO. The ROO will normally be
the Chief of the Mechanical Team (Armament) within the 412th Maintenance Squadron (412
MXS).
