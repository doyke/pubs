   license recognized by German authorities and a GOV license do not require a USAREUR
   license to operate a GOV.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
   2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
   Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
   impoundment of motor vehicles at OCONUS installation gates, to include Air Force
   restricted and controlled areas.
   2.2.2. The following principles govern the stopping of motor vehicles:
       2.2.2.1. In overseas areas, SF may stop, search, and detain vehicles on- or off-base as
       determined by host nation agreements and local command policy.
       2.2.2.2. In areas where off-base patrols are authorized, patrols will not engage in the
       enforcement of host nation laws against non-U.S. personnel operating vehicles bearing
       non-U.S. license plates.
       2.2.2.3. Traffic stops on-base of POVs are authorized when there is a reasonable belief it
       is necessary to enforce a traffic regulation or when there is suspicion of criminal activity.
       Coordinate all searches and impoundments with local SJA.

to Joint Publication USAFE Instruction 31-202/AE 190-1.
   2.3.1. Drivers give consent to evidential tests for alcohol or other drug content of their blood,
   breath, and/or urine as a condition to accepting installation driving privileges. This consent
   applies when lawfully detained, apprehended, or cited for any impaired driving offense
   committed while driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle on an Air Force
   installation.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment.
   2.4.1. As a condition to accepting installation driving privileges, drivers give their consent

(under 60 days) an officer or civilian equivalent immediately senior to the licensee in the chain
of command or an officer who has been designated by a commander (O-4 or above, but normally
the Squadron commander) will act as suspension/revocation authority for a unit or organization.
However, 52 SFS/S5R shall oversee drafting of suspension/revocation paperwork and submit it
through the proper channels for the suspending authority.
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
       2.5.1.1. The 52 FW/CC may suspend driving privileges for serious violations or when
       lesser measures fail to improve a driver’s performance. The commander may also
       suspend or revoke licenses for up to 12 months if a driver continually violates installation
       parking standards, or habitually violates other standards considered non-moving in
       nature. The Installation Commander has discretionary authority and may withdraw
       anyone’s authorization to operate a government or privately owned motor vehicle on the
       installation.

   2.5.2. Revocations.
       2.5.2.1. The Installation Commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
       period of not less than 1 year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs
       and the Installation Commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
       required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
       The Installation Commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a period of
       not less than 1 year in the following circumstances:
           2.5.2.1.1. A person is lawfully detained for intoxicated driving and refuses to submit
           to or complete tests to measure blood alcohol or drug content as required by the law

           2.5.2.1.2. A conviction, non-judicial punishment, or a military or civilian
           administrative action resulting in the suspension or revocation of a driver’s license for
           intoxicated driving. Official documentation is required as the basis for this type of
           revocation action.
       2.5.2.2. The Deputy Force Commander (DFC) develops plans and procedures to forward
       revocation, suspension, and driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate
       appropriate staff action when receiving similar records from losing commanders of
       inbound personnel. Additionally, gaining commanders can request a members driving
       record at anytime through SF Reports & Analysis.
       2.5.2.3. The Installation Commander or designated representative may impose multiple
       suspensions to run consecutively or concurrently.

       revocation period from the original suspension date.
   2.5.3. All other revocations will follow normal administrative channels IAW Attachment 3.
2.6. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders
will direct drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor
vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is
reasonable suspicion of drug use. If the member refuses to provide consent for testing,
coordinate and perform a magistrate ordered search and seizure.
   2.6.1. Refer military personnel involved in any intoxicated (drug or alcohol) motor vehicle
   incident to Substance Abuse Office, Drug and Alcohol Control for evaluation.
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                          11


   2.6.2. The Director of Base Medical Services will notify SF whenever competent medical
   authority has recommended an individual be medically disqualified from driving, or has been
   identified as a problem drinker or drug abuser to the extent which renders him or her
   incapable of safely operating a motor vehicle. The Installation Commander or designated
   representative may consider such individuals for suspension or revocation.
2.7. Reciprocal Procedures.
   2.7.1. The 52 FW/CC will honor revocations issued by other DoD Installation Commanders
   regardless of service component affiliation.         Revocations remain in effect during
   reassignment unless the issuing authority terminates the revocation before reassignment. The
   Installation Commander may honor suspensions as determined on a case by case basis.
   Anyone with suspended or revocated privileges may petition the Installation Commander for
   partial or limited driving privileges.
2.8. Administrative Due Process for Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.8.1. When considering suspending or revoking someone’s driving privileges, notify that
   person in writing and tell them what action will be taken and the reason. Coordinate this
   notice with the base legal office.
   2.8.2. Do not suspend or revoke a person’s driving privileges until they are notified (or
   reasonable attempts made) and offered an administrative hearing. The Installation
   Commander or designated representative determines when a suspension or revocation takes
   effect. Only in unusual circumstances should verbal notifications be made. Unless an
   application for a hearing is made within the prescribed period, suspension or revocation takes
   place on the prescribed date and time. The Installation Commander determines the time
   period for staying a suspension or revocation action after receiving a request for an
   administrative hearing. For offenses outlined above, the Installation Commander will
   authorize an immediate preliminary suspension based on reliable evidence. Such evidence
   can include witness statements, a military or civilian police report, chemical test results, a
   refusal to complete chemical testing, video tapes, written statements, field sobriety test
   results, or other evidence.
   2.8.3. The 52 MSG/CC is the designated authority to review available evidence to determine
   if immediate suspension of driving privileges of personnel suspected or charged with drunk
   or reckless driving is warranted. If immediate suspension is warranted, the individual will be
   issued a Preliminary Suspension of Driving Privileges letter from the 52 FW/CC.
      2.8.3.1. Hearing procedures for incidents, suspensions or revocations: Within 10 duty
      days from receipt of notice, individuals may submit a request for a hearing to vacate the
      action. The request must be made in writing through the individual’s commander for
      recommendation of hearing approval/disapproval to 52 MSG/CC. Any suspension or
      revocation will remain in effect pending the outcome of the hearing. The 52 MSG/CC
      will evaluate each case to determine appropriate action. Only pertinent facts may be used
      to determine the appropriate action to be taken. An individual’s character or service
      record will not be used to determine action. In the case of a drunken or reckless
      operation of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel, 52 MSG/CC will only review incidents where
      the individual is charged with operating a POV with a BAC of 0.5mg (0.05g/100ml) or
      more per 1.0ml (0.10g/100ml) of whole blood or while under the influence of any
12                                       SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013


     controlled substance, and should find in favor of the individual only if the individual was
     not operating the POV or the BAC or other test results were incorrect or invalid. Once a
     decision is made to impose administrative sanctions, 52 MSG/CC will notify 52 SFS/S5R
     in writing of the action taken in the hearing. 52 SFS/S5R will in turn notify USAREUR
     Registry of Motor Vehicle (RMV) in writing of the action taken. 52 SFS/S5R will also
     annotate any changes deemed necessary by 52 MSG/CC in Security Forces Management
     Information System (SFMIS).
     2.8.3.2. For active duty military personnel, send a written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving to their commander or reasonable equivalent. For non-
     installation, non-DoD affiliated civilians, present the written notice of preliminary
     suspension for intoxicated driving either in person (preferred) or by certified mail. If the
     person is employed on the installation, send to their commander or reasonable equivalent.
     2.8.3.3. Advise the individual of the following in the preliminary suspension notification
     for intoxicated driving:
         2.8.3.3.1. Suspension can be made a revocation under the authority of           the 52
         FW/CC.

         counsel requests.
         2.8.3.3.4. The right of DoD civilian employees to have a personal representative
         present at the administrative hearing IAW applicable laws and instructions.
         2.8.3.3.5. Amount of time the individual has to respond and request the
         administrative hearing before the preliminary suspension or revocation becomes
         permanent.
         2.8.3.3.6. Direction to sign the acknowledgement of receipt and to return the signed
         letter to the address shown in the letter.
         2.8.3.3.7. Requested hearings must take place within a reasonable period which is
         determined by the Installation Commander, not to exceed 30 days. A preliminary
         suspension for intoxicated driving remains in effect until the Installation Commander
         makes a final decision.
  2.8.4. Hearings for intoxicated driving will cover only the pertinent issues of whether: 1)
  The law enforcement official had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or
  was in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other
  drugs; 2) The person was lawfully cited or apprehended for an intoxicated driving offense; 3)
  The person was asked to submit to a test for alcohol or other drug content of blood, breath, or
  urine and was informed of the consequences for refusing to take or complete such a test; 4)
  The person refused to submit to the test for alcohol, breath, or urine; failed to complete the
  test; submitted to the test and the result exceeded the amount of allowed blood alcohol
  content; results indicate the presence of other drugs for an on-installation apprehension or in

       effective date of the revocation.
       2.8.4.3. Notice of automatic revocation may be placed in the suspension letter, or sent in
       a separate letter. Revocation is not effective until receipt of the written notice, or the
       showing that reasonable attempts to notify the individual were made.
       2.8.4.4. Revocations cancel any partial or restricted driving privileges previously
       granted. Once revocation is acknowledged, a person may petition for the restoration of
       all or partial driving privileges.
   2.8.5. Petitions for reinstatement:
       2.8.5.1. The 52 FW/CC designates the 52 MSG/CC as the individual authorized to grant
       restricted driving privileges. Prior to granting restricted driving privileges, personnel will
       complete Driver Improvement and Rehabilitation Course (DIRC) and the Substance
       Abuse Seminar through the Substance Abuse Control Office (if revocation/suspension
       was drug or alcohol related). Individuals must also successfully complete the USAREUR
       written POV test prior to the granting of restricted or reinstated driving privileges if
       license was revoked.
       2.8.5.2. After completing the entire period of the revocation/suspension and the directed
       remedial measures, the individual may apply for reinstatement of driving privileges. This
       procedure is initiated from the individual through the first sergeant. This will be a written
       request from the individual to the 52 MSG/CC. The reinstatement letter template will be
       issued to the member by 52 SFS/S5R to complete and return to 52 SFS/S5R for the
       routing process.
           2.8.5.2.1. Military and military dependents may be required to complete the 52
           FW/SE DIRC before reinstatement of driving privileges. Contact Wing Safety for
           additional guidance.
           2.8.5.2.2. The completed reinstatement letter will be routed through: 1) individuals
           unit commander; 2) 52 FW/SE; 3) 52 MDOS/SGOHA if Substance Abuse Training
           was required; 4) 52 SFS/S5R; 5) 52 SFS/S5B for driver’s testing/licensing; 6) 52
           SFS/CC for recommendation of approval/disapproval; 7) 52 MSG/CC for
           approval/disapproval; and 8) 52 SFS/S5R for filing.
       2.8.5.3. Foreign nationals who have their driving privileges revoked/suspended will
       make a written request to the 52 MSG/CC. All letters will be routed through: 1)
       Sponsoring/individual unit commander; 2) 52 SFS/S5R; 3) 52 SFS/CC for
       recommendation of approval/disapproval; 4) 52 MSG/CC for approval/disapproval; and
       5) 52 SFS/S5R for filing.

amounting to intoxicated driving, vacate the suspension of driving privileges except when:
 14                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013


   2.9.1. The preliminary suspension was based on refusal to take a BAC test.
   2.9.2. Operating a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.10 percent by volume or higher.
   2.9.3. The individual was driving or in physical control of a motor vehicle while under
   another preliminary suspension or revocation.
   2.9.4. The host nation authorities made an administrative determination to suspend or revoke
   driving privileges based on local law or pertinent regulations.
   2.9.5. The individual failed to complete a formally directed substance abuse or driver’s
   training program.
2.10. Restricted Driving Privileges or Probation.
   2.10.1. Unless prohibited by higher authority, host nation authority, or other publications,
   Installation Commanders may authorize partial or restricted driving privileges to those whose
   authority to drive on military installations was suspended or revocated by a military service
   authority. Ensure the individual’s driving credentials (civilian state, international, host
   nation, etc.) are still valid. Requests to allow operation of a government vehicle during a
   period of suspension or revocation must be justified by the unit commander as mission
   essential.
   2.10.2. Without due cause, do not grant restricted driving privileges, probation, or
   reinstatement to any person whose civilian driver’s license is under suspension or revocation
   by a state, federal, or host nation licensing authority. If absolutely necessary to do so (and
   for on-base privileges only), coordinate with the installation SJA. Only consider requests in
   which there is extreme hardship and there are no other workable alternatives.
   2.10.3. Procedures for restricted driving privileges, probation, or reinstatement will follow
   the outline given in 2.8.5
   2.10.4. When an individual is authorized restricted driving privileges, the individual will
   keep a copy of the limitation letter with him or her or in the vehicle while operating it. This
   letter must be produced upon demand by proper authorities. Limited privileges must be
   specific, indicating type of limitation, and the date and time the privileges are reinstated. If
   the suspension or revocation was the result of host nation court action, close coordination is
   required with the SJA’s office regarding any restricted driving privileges.
2.11. Extension of Suspensions and Revocations.
   2.11.1. Increase by two years the suspension or revocation period when someone is
   discovered driving in violation of their original suspension or revocation.
   2.11.2. Extend the suspension or revocation of driving privileges until the offender
   completes the approved DIRC, drug or alcohol program, or other program deemed necessary
   by the Installation Commander or local authorities.
2.12. Reciprocal Host Nation-Military Action.
   2.12.1. The Installation Commander should honor the reciprocal agreements with the host
   nation driver licensing authorities. On receipt of written notice, the receiving party may
   suspend or revoke driving privileges as if the violations or incidents occurred within its own
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                        15


  jurisdiction. Use the following procedures if statutory authority does not provide for formal
  military reciprocity:
     2.12.1.1. When such authority suspends or revokes a license, automatically terminate the
     individual’s installation GOV and POV driving privileges. Take only comparable
     military administrative actions (suspensions, revocations, or point assessment) for those
     off-base violations reported by local or host nation authorities.
     2.12.1.2. Provisions of the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and the law of
     the host nation concerning reciprocal suspension and revocation can affect OCONUS
     Installation Commanders. When permitted at a particular overseas installation and to the
     extent an agreement concerning reciprocity exists, the Installation Commander must have
     prior authorization to negotiate and conclude such an international agreement IAW
     applicable directives.

                            TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Traffic Planning
   4.1.1. Safe and efficient movement of traffic on an installation requires traffic supervision.
   A strong traffic supervision program includes sound traffic circulation planning, supervision,
   and control of motor vehicle traffic. Proactive publication and enforcement of traffic laws
   and regulations together with timely and professional investigation of motor vehicle
   accidents are also important. Finally, every successful program must include meaningful
   interaction, education, and communication with general public.
   4.1.2. Installation Commanders develop traffic circulation plans that provide for the safest
   and most efficient use of primary and secondary roads. A major focus of installation traffic
   planning is circulation control. The base traffic engineer, 52 SFS/CC, safety officer, and
   other concerned staff agencies develop the traffic circulation plan. Consult with highway
   engineering representatives from adjacent civilian communities to ensure the installation plan
   is compatible with plans developed by the state and surrounding local communities. As a
   minimum, the base traffic plan should consider the following:
      4.1.2.1. Normal and peak load routing based on traffic control studies.
      4.1.2.2. Effective control of traffic, using planned traffic flow patterns which include
      measures for special events and adverse road conditions.
      4.1.2.3. Point control at congested location by law enforcement personnel or designated
      traffic directors or wardens, including trained school-crossing guards.
      4.1.2.4. Use of traffic control signs and devices.
      4.1.2.5. Efficient use of available parking facilities.
      4.1.2.6. Efficient use of mass transportation.
      4.1.2.7. Every Installation Commander should appoint a primary and alternate base
      traffic engineer. The engineer directs, develops, and staffs the base traffic circulation
      plan. This is normally a civil engineering responsibility and those considered for the
      position should have an infrastructure planning and engineering background.
   4.1.3. Traffic control studies provide factual data on existing roads, traffic density and flow
   patterns, and points of congestion. The 52 SFS/CC and traffic engineer usually conduct
   coordinated traffic control studies to obtain the data. Accurate data helps determine major
   and minor routes, locations for traffic control devices, and special conditions requiring
   engineering or enforcement services.
   4.1.4. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency
   (MTMCTEA) will help Installation Commanders solve complex highway traffic engineering
   problems. MTMCTEA traffic engineering team services include:
      4.1.4.1. Traffic studies of lifted areas and other special situations.
      4.1.4.2. Complete studies of traffic operations of entire installations.
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                           19


       4.1.4.3. Assistance in complying with established traffic engineering standards.
   4.1.5. Installation Commanders submit requests for MTMCTEA assistance IAW AFR 75-
   88, Highways for National Defense.
4.2. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.2.1. Commanders in overseas areas establish a traffic code to the extent military authority
   is empowered to regulate traffic under applicable treaties or agreements. Installation traffic
   codes must contain the base rules of the road and will, to the degree possible, conform to the
   code of the state or host nation in which the installation is located. The 52 SFS/CC is
   responsible for developing the traffic code and for ensuring it meets all local and legal
   requirements, this SABI, and the standards published in the following:
       4.2.1.1. The National Highway Safety Program Standards, as published in 23, CFR
       1230.
       4.2.1.2. Applicable portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code and Model Traffic Ordinance
       published by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances, which is
       contained in 23, CFR 1204.
       4.2.1.3. DoDI 6055.4, DoD Traffic Safety Program.
       4.2.1.4. AFMAN 31-116, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision.
4.3. Vehicle Operational Requirements.
   4.3.1. Restraint systems.
       4.3.1.1. Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on Air Force installations must
       wear restraint systems. In addition, operators and passengers of GOVs must wear
       restraint systems when driving or riding off the installation as well.
       4.3.1.2. All Air Force active duty and reserve component members on active duty must
       wear restraint systems while driving or riding in a POV whether on or off the installation.
       4.3.1.3. Refer to AFMAN 31-116 for child seat specifics.
       4.3.1.4. Cars manufactured after model year 1966 require a manufacturer-approved
       restraint system meeting federal traffic safety standards.
       4.3.1.5. Operators using vehicles equipped with air bags must still wear the
       manufacturer’s primary restraint system (seat belts).
       4.3.1.6. Proper use of a seat belt is defined as going across the occupants shoulder; not
       under the arm. Individuals who operate a vehicle while the seat is leaned too far back to
       prohibit the chest strap from resting on the occupants shoulder will be classified as
       improper use of a restraint system. All personnel within a vehicle will wear seat belts,
       regardless if they are on- or off-base, or in a POV or GOV. Infant/child restraint devices
       will be required in POVs for children 4 years old or under and not exceeding 45 lbs.
       Note: Restraint systems are only required for vehicles manufactured after model year
       1966.

  seat, pets, fogged or iced windows will be corrected on the spot.
  4.3.7. The use of front fog lights will only be permitted during periods of inclement weather.
  Additionally, the rear fog light will only be used when visibility is less than 50 kilometers. If
  the rear fog light is in use; the maximum speed allowed is 50 Kilometers Per Hour (KPH).
  4.3.8. USAREUR registered vehicles are required to have “adequate tires” for winter
  driving, proper tires will be installed by 15 Nov and remain on until 1 Mar. At all times
  vehicles must be operated with adequate tires for the road conditions. Acceptable tires are
  snow tires, all season tires with an “M/S”, “M+S”, or a snowflake symbol. In contrast winter
  tires need to be removed in the summer.
  4.3.9. School bus stops: At no time will traffic in either lane pass a stopped school bus that
  is picking up or discharging passengers on-base. Off-base, personnel are allowed to pass
  school buses at walking speed.
  4.3.10. Speed Limits: Motor vehicles will comply with the following speed limits unless
  traffic or road conditions warrant slower speeds:
     4.3.10.1. Arnold Blvd: 50 KPH (31 Miles Per Hour (MPH)) (unless otherwise posted).

          suspension of base driving privileges.
          4.3.10.5.3. Third offense within a 12 month period will result in a 180 day
          suspension of base driving privileges.
          4.3.10.5.4. Citations issued for speed in excess of 30 KPH the posted speed limit,
          will be considered reckless driving and will result in a 30 day suspension of base
          driving privileges. Refer to Attachment 3.
   4.3.11. Only window tinting manufactured within the glass by the manufacturer of the
   vehicle is authorized. This will be considered a “fix-it-ticket” and will follow the procedures
   listed in Ch 4, para. 4.10.2.1.
   4.3.12. Unattended vehicles will be LOCKED at all times. Vehicle operators are prohibited
   from turning on a vehicle unattended for the purposes of “warming up”. Vehicles with the
   engine running and idling must be driver occupied with the intent to immediately start
   driving when permitted.
   4.3.13. All obstructions must be clear of windows prior to operation, i.e. snow & fog. All
   snow must be removed from vehicle prior to operation to include the hood of the vehicle.
   Failure to do so could cause a driving hazard for other drivers on the road.
   4.3.14. All personnel who ride bicycles, skateboards, roller blades etc. on SAB or Bitburg
   Annex military housing area must wear an approved (i.e. American Standard Institute, Snell
   Memorial Institute, or host nation certified) helmet. The chin strap must be properly fastened
   under the chin while wearing the helmet. All bicyclists subject to this instruction must wear
   a bicycle helmet when riding bicycles off the installation. Bicyclists are required to obey all
   traffic signs and signals while operating on a road way. Refer to AFI 91-207_USAFESUP
   for further information.
   4.3.15. Take only administrative actions (reprimand, assessment of points, loss of
   installation driving privileges, etc.) for off-installation violations.
4.4. Traffic Law Enforcement Principles.
   4.4.1. Traffic law enforcement should motivate drivers to operate vehicles safely within
   traffic laws and regulations and maintain an effective and efficient flow of traffic. Effective
   enforcement should emphasize selective enforcement and voluntary compliance by drivers.
   4.4.2. Standard signs, markings, and signals were adopted IAW National Highway Safety
   Program Standards (NHSPS) and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets
   and Highways.
   4.4.3. Ensure enforcement personnel establish courteous, personal contact with drivers, and
   act promptly when driving behavior is improper or when observing a defective vehicle in
   operation.
 22                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013


   4.4.4. Maintain an aggressive program to detect and apprehend those who drive with
   suspended or revoked privileges.
   4.4.5. Use sound discretion program to detect and apprehend those who drive with
   suspended or revoked privileges.
   4.4.6. Enforcement activities against intoxicated driving will include:
       4.4.6.1. Detecting, apprehending, and testing persons suspected of driving under the
       influence of alcohol or drugs.
       4.4.6.2. Training law enforcement personnel in special enforcement standards, detection,
       techniques, and equipment standards unique to the specific location and jurisdiction.
       4.4.6.3. Enforcing blood-alcohol concentration standards (see paragraph 4.11).
       4.4.6.4. Denying installation driving privileges to those whose use of alcohol or drugs
       prevents their safe operation of a motor vehicle.
4.5. Speed Measuring Devices. Use speed measuring devices in traffic control studies and
enforcement programs. 52 SFS is authorized to conduct speed and traffic enforcement on public
roadways IAW treaty agreements. 52 SFS may conduct speed and traffic enforcement to ensure
good order, discipline, and safety in all areas under control of the 52 FW. 52 SFS patrols may be
used for directed patrols as determined by the 52 SFS/CC and coordinated through local police
authorities as appropriate.
   4.5.1. Training and certification standards.
       4.5.1.1. The 52 SFS/CC should strive to ensure operators of speed-measuring devices
       meet training and certification requirements established by the Security Forces
       Operations Section (S3O) and Security Forces Training Section (S4T). Obtain specific
       information on course dates, costs, and prerequisites for attending by contacting the
       agency responsible for police traffic radar training. Ensure qualification and training
       standards are admissible as evidence and considered reliable by both military and civilian
       authorities. This requirement applies to courts-martial, non-judicial proceedings, and
       civilian courts used to prosecute civilian offenders. Coordination between the military
       SJA is necessary.
       4.5.1.2. Develop local training programs or attend a civilian institution or manufacturer’s
       training program if SF are unable to attend local or host nation-sponsored radar
       certifications courses. Certified operators are tested on the following:

SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                             23


          4.5.1.2.6. Demonstrate basic skills in preparing and presenting records and
          courtroom testimony relating to radar speed measurement and enforcement.
       4.5.1.3. The objective of civilian or manufacturer-sponsored courses is to improve the
       effectiveness of speed enforcement through the proper and efficient use of speed-
       measurement radar.
   4.5.2. Recertification. Certify operators every three years or more frequently when required.
   The 52 SFS/CC must document and maintain certification and training standards in the unit
   training section. Forward records to gaining unit commanders when personnel PCS.
4.6. Traffic Investigation.
   4.6.1. Conduct detailed investigations of the following:
       4.6.1.1. All accidents involving a fatality or personal injury.
       4.6.1.2. Vehicle and private property damage over the amount specified by the
       Installation Commander. This applies to government as well as private vehicles and
       property damage; however, the Installation Commander may establish different damage
       amounts for each category.
   4.6.2. Conduct investigations of off-installation accidents involving personnel subject to this
   instruction according to local policy developed by the 52 SFS/CC and local police leaders.
4.7. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.7.1. Anyone involved in an on-base vehicle accident must immediately report the incident
   to 52 SFS, regardless of the degree of damage.
   4.7.2. Vehicle operators who are involved in traffic accidents off-base must report the
   accident immediately to German Polizei and within 72 hours to 52 SFS regardless of the
   degree of damage. IAW German Criminal Code Section 142, a person involved in a traffic
   accident must remain at the scene if injuries or damage to property of other are inflicted. The
   person involved must make his identity known to the victim and exchange information as
   required by host nation law (driver/owner of the other vehicle involved or owner of damaged
   property). The person involved in a traffic accident may leave the scene only if they waited a
   reasonable period of time, considering the circumstances, but must report the accident to
   proper authorities.
       4.7.2.1. If the accident is not reported to the 52 SFS within 72 hours, the vehicle operator
       will be issued a citation for Failure to Report Accident. For accidents occurring while the
       vehicle operator is on leave or a considerable distance from the installation (i.e., on leave
       in Southern Germany, Austria, etc.), the operator can either report it to the nearest
       military law enforcement agency or report it immediately after returning to the
       Spangdahlem area. The commander of a military member involved in a major vehicle
       accident that is found at fault will be required to ensure the member attends the DIRC.
       4.7.2.2. Off-base traffic accidents will be investigated by German Polizei. The on-scene
       52 SFS will act as the focal point for information or assistance. Only when granted
       permission from German Polizei, will on-scene SF conduct a traffic accident
       investigation off-base. A Spangdahlem Form 8, will be completed to provide the officer
       with the information needed for a clear and concise blotter entry.
 24                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013


       4.7.2.3. If an off-base traffic accident involves a fatality, injuries requiring any medical
       treatment, complaint of injuries, over $10,000 in damage or disabling damage, an AF
       Form 1315, Accident Report, will be accomplished in addition to the investigation
       accomplished by the German Polizei. Specific responsibilities for off-base fatality
       response are outlined in a memorandum of understanding between the 52 MSG and 52d
       Medical Group (52 MDG), which is maintained by the 52 FSS.
   4.7.3. SF respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents to accomplish the following:
       4.7.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.7.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.7.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.7.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.7.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.7.3.6. The 52 SFS/CC determines (with Installation Commander approval) when
       and/or if minor vehicle accidents require investigation or a police response. He or she
       may delegate the authority to on-duty Flight Chief.
   4.7.4. Minor accident will be classified as an accident which does not meet the following
   criteria: Disabling damage where the vehicle is inoperative or unsafe to operate, property
   damage in excess of $10,000, personal injury requiring any type of medical treatment or
   complaint of injuries or fatal injuries. Note: Broken headlights or    taillights during the
   hours of darkness does not constitute disabling damage, nor does a flat or blown tire without
   a spare. Minor accidents require the Spangdahlem Form 8 and a 52 SFS blotter entry. If
   there is any uncertainty pertaining to the accident, the AF IMT 1168, Statement of
   Suspect/Witness/Complainant must be accomplished. All AF IMT 1168s and Spangdahlem
   Form 8s will be maintained by 52 SFS/S5R for one year.
       4.7.4.1. Injury is defined as any one of the following caused or aggravated by a motor
       vehicle accident:
          4.7.4.1.1. Any condition requiring medical attention.
          4.7.4.1.2. Complaint or report of pain or injury regardless if medical attention is
          sought.
   4.7.5. Administration of chemical tests may be delayed following a POV accident or offense.
   When administered, the results of the test will be considered valid under this publication
   despite the delay. For example, if someone drinks an alcoholic beverage after an incident but
   before administration of a chemical test, the results of the test will be used for purposes of
   suspension or revocation.
   4.7.6. USAREUR licensed personnel who leave the scene of an accident are prohibited from
   consuming any alcoholic beverages for a period of 6 hours after the accident occurs IAW
   German Law.
4.8. Use of Traffic Accident Investigation Report Data. Unit commanders will designate in
writing, personnel authorized to review, retrieve, and sign for reports of command action
referencing only those persons assigned to their respective units. These authorized may review
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                             25


SFMIS Reports, the AF IMT 1168s, AF Form 1315s and the driver’s records in SFMIS. These
letters must be updated accordingly and maintained on file in 52 SFS/S5R. A 10 day suspense is
normally used when processing all reports.
   4.8.1. 52 SFS/S5R will analyze data derived from traffic accident investigations to determine
   accident causes in coordination with 52 FW/SE. When frequent accidents occur in one area,
   analyze location conditions, type of accidents, and other factors in an attempt to isolate
   causes. With the exception of privacy act information, make accident data and trend analysis
   available to agencies requesting the data for reporting and analytical purposes. With the
   exception of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act, the 52 SFS/CC determines
   the agencies cleared to receive accident and incident data.
   4.8.2. Law Enforcement personnel and others who prepare traffic accident investigation
   reports will indicate if a seat restraint was used at the time of the accident, and where
   applicable, if air bags deployed.
4.9. Parking. Illegal parking contributes to congestion and slows traffic flow on the
installation. Strong enforcement of parking rules results in better use of available parking while
reducing traffic accidents and hazards. Combine enforcement with community education and
awareness initiatives in areas where illegal parking is a problem. When education and awareness
fail, Installation Commanders may authorize more serious enforcement measures such as towing
and “booting” of vehicles. Do not use towing and booting if less severe means of enforcement
such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, revocations, etc., prove effective.
   4.9.1. Prohibited parking areas. The following areas are identified as prohibited parking
   areas:
       4.9.1.1. Within 15 feet of fire hydrants, intersections or pedestrian crosswalks.
       4.9.1.2. Within 45 feet of bus stops.
       4.9.1.3. Within designated fire lanes.
       4.9.1.4. More than 18 inches from a curb or roadway edge where curbing does not exist.
       4.9.1.5. When blocking driveways, intersections, roadways, or parking lanes, includes
       parking on sidewalks.
       4.9.1.6. Double parking.
       4.9.1.7. In a reserved parking space designated for the use of another person.
       4.9.1.8. When blocking trash receptacles.

   enforcement measures to offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. When a
   person is tested evaluate the results of the test as follows:
      4.12.1.1. If the percentage of the alcohol in the person’s blood is greater than .03, but
      NOT greater than .049 and is involved in a vehicle accident; the individuals driving
      license will be suspended for 30 days.
      4.12.1.2. If the percentage of the alcohol in the driver’s blood is not greater than .049 and
      is NOT involved in a vehicle accident; the individuals driving license will not be
      suspended unless further investigation reveals reason for suspension/revocation.
      4.12.1.3. If the percentage is 0.05 but no more than 0.10, presume the driver is impaired.
      Consider this standard with other competent evidence in determining whether the driver
      was under the influence of alcohol. Suspend driving privileges for 180 days.
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                         29


      4.12.1.4. If the percentage is 0.101 but less than 0.149, presume the driver is impaired.

      the time of admission or receipt of the body of the victim.
      4.13.3.3. Subject to military jurisdiction, the body will be transported to Landstuhl
      Regional Medical Center via German Red Cross. Medical authorities from LRMC will
      examine, autopsy, or provide forensic testing/examinations for anyone killed in an on-
      base motor vehicle accident or mishap.
      4.13.3.4. As provided by law and medical conditions permitting, obtain a blood or breath
      sample from any surviving operator whose vehicle is involved in a fatal accident.
 30                                         SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013


   4.13.4. Medical authorities will examine the bodies of those persons killed in a motor
   vehicle accident to include drivers, passengers, and pedestrians subject to military
   jurisdiction. They will also examine the bodies of dependents, who are 16 years of age or
   older, if the sponsors give their consent. Tests for the presence and concentration of alcohol
   or other drugs in the person’s blood, bodily fluids, or tissues will be made as soon as possible
   and where practical within 8 hours of death. Test results will be included in medical reports.
4.14. Detection, Apprehension, and Testing of Intoxicated Drivers.
   4.14.1. Impaired drivers may be detected by observing unusual or abnormal driving
   behavior. Stop these drivers and determine the cause of their unusual driving behavior. If it
   can be reasonably concluded that the individual in control of the vehicle is impaired, perform
   field sobriety tests. The DD Form 1920 is used in examining, interpreting, and recording
   results of such tests. Use the standard field sobriety tests outlined in para 4.11.3. Specific
   procedures for administering them can be found in SFOI 31-101, Security Forces
   Operations, Chapter 16. Also see SFOI 31-101 for procedures and guidance concerning the
   use of traffic mazes, DWI checkpoints execution.

   4.15.1. Implied consent policy is explained in paragraph 2.3
   4.15.2. Administer tests only when the following conditions are met:
      4.15.2.1. The person was lawfully stopped while driving or while in physical control of a
      motor vehicle on the installation.
      4.15.2.2. Reasonable suspicion exists to believe the person was driving under the
      influence of alcohol or drugs.
      4.15.2.3. A request was made of the person to consent and he or she was advised that
      failure to voluntarily submit to or complete a chemical test of bodily fluids or breath may
      result in revocation of on-base driving privileges.
   4.15.3. The driver will be advised the Installation Commander may revoke driving privileges
   if they fail to voluntarily submit to or complete a requested chemical test and that they do not
   have the right to have an attorney present before deciding if they will or will not take the test.
   Testing will follow policies and procedures listed in this instruction. Advise the driver that
   the results of chemical tests conducted under the implied consent provisions of this
   instruction may be used as evidence in courts-martial, non-judicial proceedings under Article
   15 of the UCMJ, administrative action, or civil court proceeding.
   4.15.4. Special rules exist for persons who have hemophilia, other blood-clotting disorders,
   or any medical or surgical disorder under treatment with an anticoagulant. Such people may
   refuse a blood extraction without penalty, but may be offered a breath or urine test, or both.
   These procedures must be outlined and the type of medical conditions that qualify for non-
   punitive refusal in readily available medical guidelines located in emergency rooms or other
   reasonable areas where blood samples might be drawn from those suspected of drunk
   driving. Valid refusals must have the concurrence of a medical doctor.
   4.15.5. If a person suspected of intoxicated driving refuses to submit to a chemical test, do
   not administer a test except those specified above.
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                          31


4.16. Involuntary Extraction of Bodily Fluids in Traffic Cases.
   4.16.1. These procedures pertain only to the investigation of military personnel stopped,
   apprehended, or cited on a military installation for any offense related to driving a motor
   vehicle and for whom probable cause exists to believe that such individual is intoxicated.
   Rule 312d, Military Rules of Evidence, and regulatory rules concerning requesting and
   granting authorizations for searches govern the extraction of body fluids in furtherance of
   other kinds of investigations.
   4.16.2. Involuntary bodily fluid extractions (blood or urine) require valid search and seizure
   authorizations. A person subject to the UCMJ who does not consent to chemical testing, and
   who subsequently refuses a lawful order to surrender to the test, may nonetheless be forced to
   submit to an involuntary extraction of bodily fluids. Refer to AFMAN 31-201 Vol 3, Flight
   Operations for specific guidance on authority to search and seize property.
       4.16.2.1. Law enforcement personnel should relay to individuals that additional tests will
       be paid at their own expense. The test must be approved by the State or host nation and
       completed as soon as possible with any delay noted on results.
   4.16.3. A search authorization by the military magistrate obtained pursuant to Rule 315,
   Military Rules of Evidence, is required prior to such nonconsensual extraction.
   4.16.4. Conduct warrantless searches only after coordination with the servicing SJA and
   attempts to gain authorization from an appropriate official fail because of the unavailability
   of the military magistrate.
   4.16.5. If authorization from the military magistrate proves unsuccessful (due to
   nonavailability), the commander of a medical facility is empowered by Rule 315(d), Military
   Rules of Evidence, to authorize such extraction from an individual located in the facility at
   the time an authorization is sought.
       4.16.5.1. Before authorizing the involuntary extraction, the commander of the medical
       facility should, if circumstances permit, coordinate with the servicing SJA.
       4.16.5.2. The medical facility commander authorizing an extraction under Rule 315(d)
       need not be on duty as the attending physician. Any qualified medical person can
       perform the extraction.
       4.16.5.3. The authorizing official may consider his or her own observations of the
       individual in determining probable cause.
   4.16.6. Authorization for the nonconsensual extraction of blood samples for evidentiary
   purposes by qualified medical personnel is independent of and not limited by provisions
   defining medical care, such as the provision for nonconsensual medical care pursuant to AFI
   44-102, Medical Care Management.            Only qualified medical personnel administer
   extractions and use only reasonable measures to accomplish the procedure. Assistance to
   overcome an individual’s resistance to the extraction is normally provided by law
   enforcement personnel or unit personnel acting under orders from the member’s
   commanding officer or designee. Do not use any form of life endangering force to effect
   nonconsensual extractions.

   Medical personnel determine the priority given to involuntary fluid extractions when other
   medical treatment is required.
4.17. Off-installation Traffic Activities. There is a “No Passing Policy” on Highways B-50, L-
39, and L-46. This policy applies to all SAB personnel. It is prohibited to pass any vehicle
traveling on the B-50 (between Bitburg and Binsfeld), the L-39 (between Speicher and Herforst),
and on L-46 (from A-60 exit to the B-50) except for slow-moving vehicles. A slow-moving
vehicle is defined as any vehicle traveling less than 40 km/h, except in areas where the posted
speed limit is 40 km/h or slower. When passing slow-moving vehicles, drivers have the
responsibility to do so only where passing is safe and authorized by German traffic laws.
   4.17.1. IAW AFMAN 31-116, Commanders/First Sergeants will be notified by BDOC when
   personnel under their authority are involved in serious off-base incidents (i.e. major
   accidents, DUI, hit & run, etc.).
4.18. Compliance With Local and Host Nation Laws.
   4.18.1. The Installation Commander will encourage compliance with local traffic laws for
   drivers when operating government vehicles off-base through the establishment of policies
   and procedures.
   4.18.2. Commanders coordinate with the proper civil law enforcement agency before
   moving government vehicles or property that require special handling or exceed legal limits
   such as weight, length, width, or other standards.

       involved in accidents or incidents, with the following exceptions:
          4.18.3.1.1. The offense warrants detention.
          4.18.3.1.2. The person’s condition is such that further operation of a motor vehicle
          could result in injury to the person or others.
       4.18.3.2. Prompt notice to military authorities when military personnel or drivers of
       government motor vehicles are involved in traffic accidents or detained for serious
       violations of civil traffic laws.
       4.18.3.3. Prompt notice of any host nation action to suspend, revoke, or restrict the
       driving privileges of personnel assigned to the installation.

   system applies to military personnel operating GOVs and POVs on and off the installation
   and to dependents, civilian employees, and all other individuals subject to this instruction
   operating POVs on the installation. Unless an individual submits a rebuttal, assess points
   according to Table A2. Also assess points to individuals found guilty by a military or
   civilian court, or upon payment of fine or forfeiture of pay and allowances, or posted bond or
   collateral.
5.3. The USAREUR Registrar or 52 SFS/S5R: will notify the Commander and First Sergeant
concerned when a subordinate’s point assessments reach a total of either 12 or more points in 1
year or 18 or more points in 2 years.
   5.3.1. Points assessed against an individual will remain in effect for 2 years. The 52
   SFS/S5R and the USAREUR RMV will maintain driving record entries as required by this
   instruction.
   5.3.2. If a military member or dependant receives a German citation, it will be accessed
   using the US point system. Commanders who receive warning notices through the mail from
   Mannheim RMV or any other location are required to forward a copy of the warning notice
   to 52 SFS/S5R for point assessment.
   5.3.3. When requested, military members or dependents are required to give Polizei or any
   other law enforcement personnel from other countries their sponsor’s units address.

     accident.
  5.4.5. The Installation Commander or designated representative may suspend or revoke
  driving privileges as provided by this instruction regardless of whether these improvement
  measures are accomplished.
  5.4.6. Notify in writing anyone whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked (for one
  violation or an accumulation of 12 traffic points within 12 consecutive months, or 18 traffic
  points within 24 consecutive months). Installation Commanders determine suspension and
  revocation periods for offenses not covered in Table A3; however, any revocation must be
  for a period of 6 months or more. The Installation Commander may impose a longer
  suspension or revocation period (to include offenses in Table A3) based on the person’s
  overall driving record. Consider the frequency, flagrancy, and severity of moving violations,
  and the response to previous driver improvements measures. In all cases, military members
  must successfully complete DIRC before reinstatement of driving privileges.
  5.4.7. Points assessed against a person remain in effect for point accumulation purposes for
  24 consecutive months. Routinely review driver records to delete traffic points during
  records update while recording new offenses and forwarding records to new duty stations.
SPANGDAHLEMABI31-104 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                         35


   Completion of a revocation-based on points requires removal from the driving record of all
   points assessed before the revocation.
   5.4.8. Removal of points does not authorize removal of driving record entries for moving
   violations, chargeable accidents, suspensions, or revocations. Recorded entries will remain
   posted on individuals driving records.
   5.4.9. When two or more violations are committed on a single occasion, points may be
   assessed only for the violation with the highest corresponding point value.
5.5. Disposition of Driving Records. Follow AFI 33-364, Records Disposition—Procedures
and Responsibilities, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released from active
duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of officer
component, or military and civilian retirement when records on civilian personnel who are
terminating on-base employment or on-base registration.
   5.5.1. If persons transferred to another Air Force installation have valid points or other
   entries on their driving records, the DFC through the 52 SFS/S5R office must forward the
   records to the DFC of the gaining installation. The gaining DFC should coordinate with
   applicable commanders and continue and Air Force suspension or revocation-based on
   intoxicated driving or accumulation of points as specified in paragraph 5.4.7
   5.5.2. Forward driving records of military family members containing point assessments or
   other entries to the sponsor’s gaining installation and review in the same manner as for
   service members. Do not delete points accumulated or entries on the driver record regarding
   suspensions, revocations, moving violations, or chargeable accidents from the driver records
   except per paragraph 5.4.7 and 5.4.8

NOTES:
Note #1 Evaluate a driver’s physical or mental ability after a physician has submitted a
statement that the person is capable of safely operating a POV. The suspension will end and the
USAREUR license will be returned only when a physician provides a statement that the person
can safely operate a vehicle.
Note #2 When imposing a suspension because of an off installation offense, the effective date is
the same as the date of civil conviction or the suspension or revocation date of the state or host
nation driving privileges. This effective date can be retroactive.
Note #3 Investigate motor vehicle related incidents involving the driver. The driving privileges
of persons involved in motor vehicle related incidents may be suspended until the investigation is
completed. In alcohol related incidents, the driver’s USAREUR POV license must be suspended
immediately, pending the outcome of the investigation. Also misconduct reflecting the
licensee’s qualifications as a driver. Examples are: Abuse of alcohol, controlled substances and

habitual acts of violence.
Note #4 No points are assessed solely for revocation or suspension actions. Except for implied
consent violations, base revocations on a conviction by a civilian court, military courts-martial,
non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or a separate hearing as otherwise
addressed in this instruction. If revocation for implied consent is combined with another
revocation such as one year for intoxicated driving, revocations will run consecutively.
Revoking authorities will declare a person ineligible for a USAREUR POV driver’s license for
the same applicable period of suspension or revocation.
Blood alcohol concentration is expressed in percent weight by volume (%w/v) based upon grams
of alcohol per 100 cubic centimeters of blood or per 210 liters of breath. A BAC of 0.10%w/v
means 0.10 grams of alcohol per 100 cubic centimeters of blood (0.01g/100cc) or 0.10 grams of
alcohol per 210 liters of breath. The conversation factor of 210 is a commonly used value
recognized by the Committee on Alcohol and Other Drugs of the National Safety Council; that is
210 liters of deep lung air at 34 degrees centigrade contains exactly the same quantity (mass) of
ethanol (alcohol) as 100cc of pulmonary blood.
If a USAREUR licensed individual commits multiple offenses which carry suspension or
revocation time, those suspension or revocation offenses shall run consecutively.
If privileges have been suspended by a German court, requests for restricted driving privileges
will not be granted until the German suspension has expired.
Some violations may require the attendance of the DIRC, to be determined by the
suspension/revocation authority.
Individuals who have a record of three alcohol related offenses over any time period will be
prohibited from ever receiving a USAREUR POV driver’s license.
