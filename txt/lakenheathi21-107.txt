1. Responsibilities for Commanders and Key Leaders.
    1.1. General Responsibilities. Squadron commanders and supervisors are responsible for
    ensuring compliance with this instruction. Supervisors at all levels must recognize the
    sources of hazards and apply appropriate safety practices to minimize their effect. There is
    an infinite variety of possible emergency and crash recovery situations. Therefore specific
    procedures cannot be prescribed for every situation. All aircraft recovery actions are
    coordinated through the disaster control group, to the Incident Commander (IC).
    Practice/participation in wing crash recovery exercises and implementations of operational
    risk management techniques are imperative for all emergency and crash recovery operations.
    1.2. The 48th Maintenance Group Commander will identify Crash Recovery Team Chiefs
    (CRTC) by memorandum. CRTCs will be qualified to the 7 skill level (minimum) and meet
    the requirements as prescribed in AFI 21-101 CAF Supplement, Aircraft and Equipment
    Maintenance Management, Chapter 14, paragraphs 14.10.5., 14.10.5.1., and 14.10.7.2.
    CRTCs respond to and coordinate all aircraft lifts (segmented bags or crane) for exercise and
    real world scenarios. As a minimum, CRTCs will respond to all CDDAR incidents.
    1.3. 48th Equipment Maintenance Squadron Repair and Reclamation (R&R) Section Chief
    Responsibilities:
       1.3.1. Ensure enough CRTCs are trained and Crash Recovery Teams (CRTs) are formed
       to cover all RAF Lakenheath local flying operations. For normal flying operations, each
       CRT will consist of a team leader, tow supervisor and brake rider. CDDAR response
       teams will consist of a team chief, crane operator (as required) and the required manning
       (designated by the team chief) to facilitate recovery procedures. CRTs must receive
       training as directed by AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
       Planning and Operations. In addition, 48 CES/CEF requires CRT members to be trained
       in the local Standard Operating Guide (Procedures) for Incident Command and
       Accountability IAW AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program. The CRT’s flight
       chief will ensure training is scheduled through 48th Civil Engineering Squadron’s Fire
       Department (CEF) and Emergency Management (CEX). Team Leads will be a SSgt or
       TSgt, 7-skill level R&R technician for F-15C/D/E MDS. The team leader is the on-scene
       technical advisor to the fire chief.
       1.3.2. Ensure a standby CRT is designated for all non-scheduled flying hours. A list of
       standby CRT personnel will be published monthly and furnished to the Maintenance
       Operations Center (MOC) through 48 EMS supervision on the standby duty roster.
       1.3.3. Ensure CDDAR special equipment, general purpose vehicles and special purpose
       vehicles are available for 24-hour emergency dispatch as per AFI 21-101, Chapter14,
       paragraph 14.10.3.1.

    EMERGENCY AIRCRAFT CABLE/BARRIER ENGAGEMENT PROCEDURES

A2.1. This attachment supersedes all agencies’ Operating Instructions (OIs) and plans dated
prior to this instruction and pertaining to cable/barrier engagement procedures. The following
procedures are listed in order of sequence of events:
   A2.1.1. Runway operations are automatically suspended when an aircraft engages the cable
   or barrier
   A2.1.2. Ensure clearance from the Control Tower (TWR) prior to runway access.
   A2.1.3. When responding to barrier engaged aircraft from any direction, do not run over
   exposed BAK-12 cable tapes.
   A2.1.4. The Fire Department controls the immediate area until a fire safe condition is
   determined. CRT will standby clear of the zone until cleared by the IC. The IC is the
   representative for all Civil Engineering functions during barrier engagement operation.
       A2.1.4.1. If the aircraft is not fire safe, the IC will direct shutdown and the aircrew will
       egress or be extracted from the aircraft, and the IC will retain control of the area until the
       area is determined to be fire safe. In dire emergencies, visual signals can be used for
       engine shutdown. Ordnance configuration and fire fighting withdrawal will be
       considered if unexpended or hung ordnance are subjected to fire conditions.
       A2.1.4.2. If the aircraft is fire safe, the IC will direct CRT to take control of the aircraft.
       CRT will then direct the pilot to shutdown. After the tail hook is free from the cable, the
       CRT team will strap or sling the tail hook up, attach the tow vehicle, and tow the aircraft
       clear of the runway. Note: Depending on which BAK-12 barrier is engaged, CRT will
       only tow recovered aircraft to the closest de-arm or mobility pad. This is necessary to
       immediately return the tow vehicle to stand-by status as soon as possible for the next
       IFE/GE.
       A2.1.4.3. Hot brake conditions will always be assumed until otherwise determined by
       the IC or CRT. (See Attachment 3 for hot brake procedures).
       A2.1.4.4. Ordnance consideration (unexpended, hung or jammed) will normally be dealt
       with after the aircraft is removed from the runway, however the IC will make final
       determination.
       A2.1.4.5. Contaminated (Code Four) aircraft engaging the barrier will be
       decontaminated as required by the CRT and then automatically towed to the designated
       decontamination area.
       A2.1.4.6. Refer to 48 FW Plan 10-2 for post recovery cleanup.

                    EMERGENCY AIRCRAFT HOT BRAKE RESPONSE

A3.1. Brakes on the F-15 are made of advanced carbon material. Traditional indications of
hot brakes- smoking or glowing brake discs – are not reliable indicators for the F-15. Smoking
brakes are usually caused by contamination of the brakes by oil or hydraulic fluid. Note: Hot
brakes will smoke very little because the intensely hot brakes will have vaporized any
contaminant.
A3.2. Hot brake procedures are explained in TO 4B-1-1, Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and
Wheels During Ground Operations.
A3.3. The pilot (based upon aircraft landing weight, speed, and stopping distance) normally
declares hot brakes. However, increased taxi time may result in a hot brake condition that may
be undetected by the aircrew. If hot brakes are suspected, return aircraft to locally designated hot
