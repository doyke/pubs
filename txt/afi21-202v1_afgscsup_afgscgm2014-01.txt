is an opportunity to receive assistance from experienced HQs personnel who develop
maintenance policy and guidance, and compliance criteria. It is not an inspection, nor is its
intended purpose solely to prepare units to pass inspections. AFGSC/A4M will conduct the
MSAV in conjunction with Nuclear Surety SAVs when possible. The MSAV is an opportunity
to resolve and clarify issues between the unit and HQ functional managers. The MSAV
objectives are to:
NOTE: For the purpose of this chapter, MXG/CC will also apply to 576 FLTS/CC.

9.1.1. (Added) Determine if HHQ guidance is adequate/clear.

9.1.2. (Added) Provide feedback to the MXG/CC on whether the unit is properly applying sound
procedures to implement current guidance.

9.3.3. (Added) AFGSC/A4MX will coordinate a schedule of events (SOE) and provide a
confirmed SOE NLT 14 days prior to MSAV team arrival. After the visit and events schedule is
confirmed, any scheduling conflicts must be immediately brought to the attention of the AFGSC
MSAV POC for resolution.

9.4. (Added) MSAV Funding. AFGSC/A4M will fund TDY costs associated with providing
MSAV visits to all nuclear wings and 576th Flight Test Squadron.

work center requirements through the unit POC.

9.6. (Added) MSAV Duration and Meetings. AFGSC/A4M will determine the duration of
MSAVs based on mission requirements. Direct interaction between the team lead, all team

(Added) Attachment 8-LAUNCH FACILITY RECOVERY PROCEDURES

(Added) Attachment 8

LAUNCH FACILITY RECOVERY : (Added) The following steps will be used to perform LF
recovery under the direction of the Missile Potential Hazard Network. These procedures will be
used to shut-down and electrically isolate the LF(s) in the event of a sortie execution. Due to the
scope of recovery operations, the following procedures cannot be all inclusive for all actions
required to gain access to the Launcher Equipment Rooms (LER). Unit personnel will provide a
detailed report of all LF damage, after completion of an on-site assessment.

A8.1. (Added) A two-person team will be dispatched to provide security as soon as possible
following sortie execution. Electrically adjacent sorties are accessible via HICS lines, until site
isolation is accomplished at electrical interconnects. The two-person concept team will monitor
the sortie from 2,000 feet upwind until released or directed on-site by MMOC/Wing Security
Control.

A8.2. (Added) Using the appropriate 21M-LGM30X-2-21-X technical order, identify all
LFs/LCCs electrically interconnected to the executed sortie.

A8.3. (Added) Parent LCC. Using the 21M-LGM30F-12 and the appropriate 21M-LGM30X-
2-21-X technical order, disconnect and separately tape the wires between the ESA and the High
Energy Spark Gap for command receive, command transmit, SIN receive, and SIN transmit
lines. Install a shorting wire, 18 gauge or larger, between out terminal 1 and 2 of each
disconnected ESA module.

A8.4. (Added) Interconnected LFs. Using the 21M-LGM30F-12 and the appropriate 21M-
LGM30X-2-21-X technical order, determine interconnects for electrically adjacent sites.
Disconnect and separately tape the command transmit and receive lines for the executed sortie at
the ESA IN 1 and 2 terminals. Install a shorting wire, 18 gauge or larger, between the IN 1 and 2
terminals.

A8.5. (Added) Executed Sortie. A toxic atmosphere could be present. The LF shall not be
entered without the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) unless the area has been
declared free of contaminated air by Bio-Environmental personnel. All personnel will wear
protective clothing, as directed by Bio-Environmental, when entering the topside area until the
area is sampled and declared safe for entry. The buddy system (one person continually
monitoring the work of another during hazardous operations) shall be used during initial LF
entry until the LF has been declared safe by Bio-Environmental.

A8.5.1. (Added) Dispatch Bio-Environmental personnel to verify the LF atmosphere is safe for
maintenance actions.

A8.5.1.1. (Added) Don protective clothing and SCBA before approaching LF.

A8.5.1.2. (Added) Test environmental conditions topside as directed by the MPH team chief.
A8.5.1.3. (Added) Evaluate topside condition and report results.

A8.5.1.4. (Added) Access LERs and perform environmental testing as directed by the MPH
team chief.

A8.5.2. (Added) Ordnance devices are extremely hazardous. MMT will determine if LF
ordnance is safe for removal. Coordinate with MMOC to dispatch Explosive Ordnance Disposal
EOD personnel if required.

A8.5.3. (Added) Perform LER Electronic Rack Power Removal procedures, IAW T.O. 21M-
LGM30G-2-10.

A8.5.4. (Added) Remove the KS-60 IAW T.O. 21M-LGM30G-2-12-2.

A8.5.5. (Added) Remove the R/T Alarm Set drawer, IAW T.O. 21M-LGM30G-2-4.

A8.5.6. (Added) Coordinate with unit Codes personnel for administrative decertification or
removal of all remaining critical components IAW T.O. 21M-LGM30F-12-1.

A8.5.7. (Added) Inspect LF for damage and report findings.

A8.5.8. (Added) Install an environmental cover IAW TO 21M-LGM30G-2-28 to protect the
open launch tube. CE may be dispatched to construct launch tube covers on site.

A8.5.9. (Added) Repair/replace LF security fence as required to provide appropriate level of
resource protection.

unaccomplished TCTOs that are within 60 days of grounding

A9.2.3.2. (Added) Reconcile TCTO Kit status monthly in conjunction with base supply. The
reconciliation process will include a cross-check of AF Form 2001 for accuracy.

A9.2.3.3. (Added) Load TCTOs under status code 14 for LFs/MAFs until scheduled and/or
kits/parts are ordered/received. Proper documentation of TCTO status codes is a joint effort
between the performing work center and P&S.

A9.2.3.1. (Added) Determine total number of end items applicable to the TCTO. Send copy of
AFTO Form 2001 Notification of TCTO Kit Requirements to TCTO Kit Monitor in LRS
indicating number of items to be modified by serial number. A copy of the AFTO Form 2001
will be retained in the TCTO folder.

a minimum 60 days out from “Rescission Date/Remove from Service Date,” whichever is
earlier.

A9.2.3.8. (Added) Establish and maintain a TCTO folder for active TCTOs. Once the TCTO
has reached its rescission date, place a current copy of IMDS Screen 525 in folder and move to
an inactive TCTO file. Once TCTO has been rescinded, the folder is no longer required.

A9.2.3.9. (Added) Organize TCTO folders as follows:
A9.2.3.9.1. (Added) Outside cover will be labeled with TCTO/MCL/OTI number, data code,

REMIS, notify the ALC to attempt a second REMIS push. If the second attempt is unsuccessful,
manually load TCTO in IMDS. If the TCTO is loaded manually, units must immediately
reconcile data with REMIS Screen GFM0400 (TCTO Master Data) and GFM0410 (Applicable
Equipment Data) to prevent REMIS rejects during TCTO loading/completion. Units must
ensure equipment designator/part number matches.

IMDS as an initial TCTO.

A9.2.3.12. (Added) Conduct Implementation Meeting for new TCTOs and for supplements

remove-from-service date, rescission date, review of TCTO procedures by QA and supply/kit
requirements. The completed AFGSC TCTO/MCL Comprehensive Review Checklist will be
posted in TCTO folder.

A9.2.3.13. (Added) Chair monthly TCTO planning meeting. Meeting will cover current TCTO
status, completion percentages, supply status, scheduling factors, anticipated problems, trends,
