3.7.1.1. The 52 OG/52 MXG Scheduling Meeting is held every Thursday, 1400L, or as
requested by group leadership, in the 52 MXG or 52 OG Conference room. This meeting
disseminates information concerning execution of the flying mission. AMUs forecast aircraft
availability for the next two weeks. 52 MOS/MXOOA presents selected aircraft statistical data.
52 OSS/OSOS presents training opportunities, aerial event participation, tasking suspenses,
aircraft Coronet and contingency movement status, squadron one month outlook, squadron
specific two-week flying schedules, and a current plus one month CTS projection. Inputs to
briefing slides are due to 52 OSS/OSOS NLT 1300L, Thursday. 52 OSS/OSOS consolidates the
data, builds and posts the 52 OG/52 MXG scheduling brief on the 52 OSS/OSOS LAN site, NLT
Thursday, 1345L. The 52 MOS Plans and Scheduling section will incorporate any changes from
this meeting and submit updated data for the 52 FW/CC scheduling meeting. Any operations or
maintenance changes to the flying schedule after this meeting will be made via AF Form 2407.
3.7.1.2. The proposed schedule for the following week is presented to the 52 FW/CC at the 52
FW Scheduling Meeting for approval. During the 52 FW/CC Scheduling Meeting held every
Thursday in conjunction with Wing Stand-up, the weekly schedule and all related data is
reviewed. In accordance with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
and ACCI 21-165, the schedule must be distributed NLT 1200 on Fridays. If Friday is not a duty
day, Pen and Ink AF Form 2407 changes are due the last duty day of the week, NLT the
scheduled production meeting, or 1600L. Any further changes are coordinated by the initiator of
the change and approved using the AF Form 2407 procedures outlined in paragraph 9. of this
instruction. Changes to names, call-signs, mission type, and Supervisor of Flight (SOF) names
do not require an AF 2407. 52 OSS/OSOS consolidates and submits this data to 52 OG and 52
MXG leadership, and the MOC prior to this meeting. After this meeting, 52 OSS/OSOS will
firm the schedule in PEX.
3.7.6. Print the next day‘s schedule and load into IMDS once notified by the FS that the Air
Tasking Order (ATO) (if applicable) has been finalized in PEX.
3.7.6.1. Sortie line number assignment. The following line numbers are assigned for use by
each AMU PS&D for wing flying operations.

3.7.6.1.1. (Added) Cross country missions originating from home station will be flown out using
local line numbers. If take off times are known they will be printed on the flying page.
3.7.6.1.2. (Added) Missions executed while away from home station will use the most accurate
line number as represented in the above table.
3.7.6.1.3. (Added) Cross country return missions will be flown home using XCR line numbers.
The lines will be printed on the flying page. Times will be ―As required‖ (A/R).
3.7.6.1.4. (Added) Configurations. Aircraft will not be reconfigured within the execution week
without prior 52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC approval. Multiple configurations must be kept to a
minimum. Spares are based on 20 percent of first go or 1 spare per required configuration in
accordance with ACCI 21-165. To minimize the impact to maintenance, variations to spare
configuration standard may be scheduled based upon training needs and approval of the 52
MXG/CC or designated representative.
3.7.6.1.5. (Added) Turn Times. The minimum turn time scheduled for both F-16 and A-10
aircraft will be 2hr +30 minutes from scheduled land time to next scheduled take-off time. For
aircraft configured with live ordnance, the minimum turn time will be 3 hours. If aircraft land
later than 2hr+15 minutes prior to the next scheduled take-off time for operations reasons, and
the subsequent take-off is late, operations will be charged with the deviation.
3.7.6.1.6. (Added) Hot Pit Operations. Standard turn times for pit-n-go operations is 50 minutes
for a 2-Ship and 1 hour for a 4-Ship. For all flights, stagger turn times by 15 minutes for each 2-
ship. Late take-offs following pit operations are chargeable deviations. If a squadron is hot
pitting, both arms of that squadron‘s hot pits will be open when possible. If both squadrons are
hot-pitting, four arms will be open when possible.
3.7.6.1.7. (Added) Standard Fly Window. 52 OSS/OSOS will schedule airspace, take-off and
land times so that 52 FW fly window does not exceed 10 hours during non-surge operations.
Last land time and next day‘s first go time will allow for 12 hour turn. Scheduling outside this
fly window requires 52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC approvals.
3.7.6.1.8. (Added) Crew show will be 1 hour prior to the printed take off time. Failure to meet
this timeline may result in late takeoff deviations due to red ball maintenance being charged to
Operations. The 52 MXG/CC will determine if sufficient time for the red ball maintenance was
hampered due to late crew step.
3.7.6.1.9. (Added) Proposed Goal Days. Fighter squadron‘s will schedule sorties on goal days,
but will not plan contract sorties on Proposed Goal Days.
3.7.6.1.10. (Added) Quiet Hours. In addition to quiet hour policies annotated in SABI 21-101,
6.2.2.28.15.1, the following guidance has been established by the 52 FW/CC:
3.7.6.1.11. (Added) Quiet hours for Change of Command for Group Commanders are limited to
one hour.
3.7.6.1.12. (Added) Quiet hours for Change of Command for Squadron Commanders are limited
to half an hour.
3.8.1.1. The deadline for changes to next week‘s schedule is 1000L Thursday for the upcoming
week. After this deadline, non-chargeable AF Form 2407 Pen and Inks may be coordinated and
submitted to MOC until 1600L Friday or the final daily maintenance Production meeting of the
ACCI21-165_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                   9


week, whichever happens first. Pen and Ink changes are authorized for minor changes and
should not be used as an opportunity to rewrite the schedule. All changes to the printed Weekly
Aircraft Utilization & Maintenance Schedule will be coordinated and approved with an AF Form
2407 IAW ACCI 21-165 paragraph 3.8.1. The table below outlines required routing and level of
coordination. A 'Coord' agency must be personally contacted (e-mail does not suffice unless the
‗Coord‘ agency responds back) to ensure supportability of the requested change. Approval will
not be granted unless all 'Coord' agencies are contacted. An 'Info' agency must only receive a
copy of the approved AF Form 2407, but is not a prerequisite for approval.

3.8.1.2. AF Form 2407s will be coordinated, signed and distributed NLT the daily production
meeting for the next day‘s flying schedule (Exception: NLT 1600L Friday or the last production
meeting of the week, whichever occurs first, for Pen & Ink changes). Only fully coordinated and
52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC approved AF Form 2407s will be accepted. The completed AF
Form 2407 will be sent to all affected agencies by the initiator. If faxed, the initiator will follow
up with a phone call to ensure receipt. Changes will be posted to the weekly utilization & flying
schedule located on the LAN by 52 FW PS&D, in PEX by the affected FS, and in IMDS by
MOC. Deviation reporting will be instituted.
3.8.2. Procedures. Initiating, coordinating, and distributing an AF Form 2407.
3.8.2.1. AF Forms 2407 will be initiated, coordinated and distributed by the agency requesting
the change (FS scheduling for OPS and Higher Headquarters (HHQ) changes, AMU supervision
for MX changes, AMU scheduling for tail number additions/deletions).
3.8.2.2. AF Form 2407 entries will contain specifics and avoid generalizations. For example:
"A0123, Add Line 511, T.O. 0900, LND 1100, Config. TB2, (Reason: Weather add due to
exceeding weather attrition for the month)". Attachment 3 is the approved wing template for AF
Form 2407s and includes examples of the required level of detail.
3.8.2.3. The initiator will:
3.8.2.3.1. (Added) Complete the AF Form 2407 with all pertinent information to include:
3.8.2.3.1.1. (Added) Rank, name, phone number, and squadron/AMU of initiator. Identify as
―Pen & Ink‖ as needed, number of pages, and date/time initiated.
3.8.2.3.1.2. (Added) Tail number (For Adds, FS schedulers will get this from the Dedicated
AMU Scheduler or Pro-Super during the coordination process. For all other changes, use data in
the printed weekly schedule, for the affected line).
3.8.2.3.1.3. (Added) Change type and effective date using pull-down menus in the ―Charge to‖
block. IMDS deviation is left blank for use by MOC.
3.8.2.3.1.4. (Added) Notification section (see paragraph 9.1). Designate agencies as 'Coord' or
'Info'. Mark 52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC blocks not applicable (N/A) as needed.
3.8.2.3.2.1. (Added) Telephone each 'Coord' agency in the notification section and inform them
of the requested changes. Email may be used for coordination/approval of AF Form 2407, as
long as a confirmation reply is obtained.
3.8.2.3.2.1. (Added) Enter name/rank of person contacted and time/date of notification.
3.8.2.3.2.2. (Added) Email or hand carry the AF Form 2407 to the proper approval authorities
for signature. Email may be used for coordination/approval of AF Form 2407s as long as a
confirmation reply or digital signature is obtained (requesting a read receipt does not constitute
confirmation).
3.8.2.3.2.3. (Added) Email, Fax or hand-carry approved AF Form 2407 to all agencies in the
notification section NLT 1700L the day prior. The best forum to coordinate changes to the next
day‘s schedule is the maintenance scheduling/production meeting. Pen & Ink changes must be
completed NLT than the last production meeting of the week prior to be counted as non-
chargeable deviations. Pen & Ink AF Form 2407s not completed by this meeting will be
recorded as chargeable deviations.
ACCI21-165_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 12 OCTOBER 2011                                                  11

Schedule on the LAN NLT 1800L the day prior to the affected date. Enter Pen & Ink changes
NLT 1600L Friday or NLT one hour after the last production meeting of the week, whichever
occurs first.
3.8.2.3.4. (Added) FS scheduling. Enter all fully coordinated and approved AF Forms 2407 in
PEX NLT 1800L the day prior to the affected date. Enter Pen & Ink changes NLT 1600L
Friday, or the last production meeting of the week, whichever comes first.
3.8.2.3.5. (Added) MOC. Enter all fully coordinated and approved AF Forms 2407 in IMDS
NLT 1800L the day prior to the affected date. Enter Pen & Ink changes NLT 1600L Friday.
3.8.3.1. The 52 OG/CC and 52 MXG/CC (or CDs) or a designated representative will approve
the following AF 2407 changes, to include Pen & Inks and exercise termination revisions:
3.8.3.1.1. (Added) Line number and tail number adds or deletes.
3.8.3.1.2. (Added) Take-off and land times.
3.8.3.1.3. (Added) Configuration changes.
3.8.3.1.4. (Added) Cancellation, delay, or acceleration of scheduled maintenance that requires
support by agencies outside the AMU (52 MXG/CC(CD) only).
3.8.3.1.5. (Added) If the AMU SUP is the approval authority, 52 MXG/CC(CD) will appear in
the notifications container. Use 52 MXG/CC approval block for AMU SUP signature approval.
4.3.1. The 52 FW primary source document for executing and recording deviations is the signed
weekly aircraft utilization and maintenance schedule. 52 MOS/MXOOM is the primary POC for
charging and reporting deviations IAW ACCI 21-165. 52 MOS/MXOOP are the Subject Matter
Experts for interpreting the instruction. Only reportable deviations will be tracked and charged
in accordance with ACCI 21-165 and ACCI 21-118, Logistics Maintenance Performance
Indicator Reporting Procedures. All reportable deviations will be coordinated and agreed upon
daily between FS Top-3 and the applicable AMU and be annotated in the Daily Operations
Summary, before being finalized. If an agreement cannot be made between the FS and AMU, 52
OG/CC or deputy commander (52 OG/CD) and 52 MXG/CC (52 MXG/CD) will resolve the
conflict.
4.6.8. (Added) Dedicated AMU Scheduler will:
4.6.8.1. (Added) Annotate ―scheduled exercise‖ on the applicable flying pages on days that units
plan to exercise.
4.6.8.2. (Added) Delete the affected days‘ schedules from IMDS if an unannounced exercise is
initiated.
4.6.8.3. (Added) FS scheduling section will:
4.6.8.3.1. (Added) NLT 2 hours after the ATO has been received, load the ATO and any
applicable local flying in PEX ensuring that line numbers are in sequential and take-off order.
 12                              ACCI21-165_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP 12 OCTOBER 2011


The first line number used for the day will be the next available line number from the original
schedule. (Example: if last line number on original schedule was 840, then the first line number
on the new schedule would be 841). Note: Line numbers will be assigned IAW this instruction.
4.6.8.3.2. (Added) Notify Dedicated AMU Scheduler and 52 OSS/OSOS once schedule is
loaded in PEX.
4.6.8.4. (Added) 52 OSS/OSOS scheduling will:
4.6.8.4.1. (Added) Ensure the schedule is loaded in PEX by the FS‘s. Note: Must be loaded
NLT 2 hours after the ATO has been received.
4.10.1. A Surge day is defined as 50% more than the normal turn pattern reflected on the flying
hour contract (i.e. 12 x 10 daily schedule requires 33 lines to qualify as a surge day). Surges will
be de-conflicted to the maximum extent possible.
4.10.1.1.2. (Added) If conducted, Squadron 4-day surges will be limited to a maximum of 2 in
one month. However, two squadrons may do a 4-day surge simultaneously, thus allowing both
FSs to surge once a month if desired. Each squadron will be given one airspace priority week
per month, which will coincide with planned surges.
4.10.1.3. Only first go take off and land times need to be published as all subsequent goes are
considered flown as scheduled. All printed lines must be flown.
