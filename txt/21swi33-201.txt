This instruction describes procedures for use of the Peterson Classified Destruction Facility (CDF)
(Building 600). This instruction applies to all 21 Space Wing (SW) organizations and tenants whose
host-tenant support agreements authorized the receipt of this service to include contractors whose con-
tracts specify classified destruction support. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of pre-
scribed processes in accordance with AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule (will become
AFMAN 33-322 Vol 4). This instruction incorporates information previously found in 21 SW Policy Let-
ter, Policy and Procedures for use of the Peterson AFB Classified Destruction Facility, 14 August 2000.



1. General. The CDF is the primary facility on Peterson AFB for the destruction of classified material
and is managed under a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) contract. MEO personnel provide training to
users on the operation and safety requirements prior to allowing use of the destruction equipment. The
user certifies the training by signing the certification at Attachment 1.

2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. Customers will prepare material for destruction as follows:
       2.1.1. Remove all plastic, metal, clips, rubber bands, masking tape, etc., from material to be
       destroyed.
       2.1.2. Place all material to be destroyed in paper bags. These bags are available through GSA,
       stock number 8105-00-262-7363.
       2.1.3. Ensure only classified (TOP SECRET SCI, TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDEN-
       TIAL) material is placed in the bag. Exception: If a classified package contains unclassified
       attachments, the unclassified documents may also be submitted for destruction.
       2.1.4. Mark the exterior of the bags to show the highest classification of the contents, organiza-
       tional designation, office symbol and telephone number.
2                                                                    21SWI33-201 22 JANUARY 2002


NOTE: Bags containing material other than authorized above, and/or bags that are improperly marked,
will be refused by the MEO personnel. The destruction of non-classified may result in the user not being
authorized to use the facility.
    2.2. MEO personnel provide limited pick-up services on Wednesdays. Personnel are cleared to
    receive SECRET and/or CONFIDENTIAL. Schedule is as follows:
       2.2.1. From 0800 hours to 0830 hours: Building 1 dock.
       2.2.2. From 0835 hours to 0900 hours: Rear of Building 1470.
       2.2.3. From 0905 hours to 0910 hours: Rear of Building 845.
    2.3. Self-Help Procedures:
       2.3.1. Call 556-4055 for an appointment to bring classified to Building 600 for destruction.
       Appointments will be on a first come basis and will be established between the hours of 0930 and
       1030 on Wednesdays and between the hours of 0730 and 1030 on Thursdays. Due to workload
       scheduling, it is imperative that customers arrive on time and bring no more than 10 bags for
       destruction. If customers arrive 15 or more minutes late for their scheduled appointment, they may
       be asked to reschedule due to customer and destruction volume.
       2.3.2. During customer service hours, the appropriately cleared and trained customers must
       remain with the SECRET and/or CONFIDENTIAL material until it is placed in the disintegra-
       tor and has been completely destroyed. Trained customers and/or a MEO employee may operate
       the disintegrator and perform the actual destruction of the material while the other acts as the wit-
       ness. Safe and proper operating procedures must be followed to ensure:
           2.3.2.1. Safety of personnel.
           2.3.2.2. Proper care of equipment.
           2.3.2.3. Adequate destruction of classified material.
           2.3.2.4. Adequate cleanup of machine, attachments and area.
       2.3.3. Customers may destroy TOP SECRET and SCI. Customer provides two appropriately
       cleared and trained personnel to operate the disintegrator and perform the actual destruction. They
       are required to remain with the TOP SECRET and SCI material until it is completely destroyed.
    2.4. Operating Procedures:
       2.4.1. Check the waste containers to ensure the lid is open and there is enough space to hold the
       waste.
       2.4.2. Ensure that ear plugs are put on before the disintegrator is turned on.
       2.4.3. Check to ensure all circuit breakers are turned on. The breakers for the building are located
       on the wall as you enter the building.
       2.4.4. Not more than 3/16 inch of paper (approximately 20 sheets of 20-lb. paper) will be placed
       into the disintegrator at one time. If the machine motor skips, you are feeding too much material
       too fast.
       2.4.5. Allow at least 10 seconds between each feeding of material to ensure proper destruction.

       2.4.6. Check the waste container located outside the building every 15 minutes to ensure it is not
       full. Exchange the waste container when it is full.
       2.4.7. Allow the disintegrator to completely destroy material before it is turned off. Let the disin-
       tegrator run for 10 minutes after the last document is fed into it.
       2.4.8. Turn off the disintegrator and allow it to come to a complete stop. Before opening the dis-
       integrator flip the switch to the “off” position.
       2.4.9. Inspect the feeder area to ensure that no legible material remains in disintegrator.
       2.4.10. Complete the “Classified Destruction Facility Log.”
   2.5. Clean-up Procedures:
       2.5.1. Inspect the area to ensure no unshredded material has been left.
       2.5.2. After turning off the disintegrator pull the cords to remove paper dust from the filter and
       open the door to let the dust fall into the container.
       2.5.3. Clean and vacuum the machine of dust and debris.
       2.5.4. Sweep the area floor to remove all residue.
NOTE: At any time the machines are damaged due to user misuse or failure to follow prescribed proce-
dures, the user is responsible for the cost of the repair.
   2.6. All users of the disintegrator equipment are required to complete the “Classified Destruction
   Log.”

A1.7. Lift handle to “On” position on GE General Duty Safety Switch (Large Disintegrator).

A1.8. Lift handle to “On” position on GE General Duty Safety Switch (Small Disintegrator). The small
disintegrator is to be used only as a back up.

A1.9. Put on protective earmuffs.

A1.10. Put on protective gloves.

A1.11. Push the “Start” button on the disintegrator.

A1.12. Remove all metal clips, masking tape from papers to be destroyed.

A1.13. Feed approximately ¼ inch of paper into disintegrator every 30 seconds.

A1.14. Make sure all classified destruction is logged in on Classified Destruction Log.

A1.15. Periodically check outside dumpster (approximately every 5 bags) to make sure exhaust is work-
ing properly.

A1.16. Upon completion of destroying material, let disintegrator run for 10 minutes, then push “Off” but-
ton on disintegrator, and pull handle to “Off” position on the GE General Duty Safety Switch (both disin-
tegrators, if used), and place padlocks to ensure disintegrators cannot be turned back on.

A1.17. Let the Rotary Air Lock Valve and the FC-30 Cyclone run for an additional five minutes, then turn
off the FC-30 Cycle first. Then turn off the Rotary Air Lock Valve.

A1.18. Use the crescent wrench to open disintegrator(s) used.
21SWI33-201 22 JANUARY 2002                                                                                     5


A1.19. Use the vacuum cleaner to vacuum the disintegrator screen, and then use a screwdriver to lift the
disintegrator screen and vacuum the bottom of the disintegrator(s). This must be done to both disintegra-
tors if both are used.

A1.20. Make sure to leave the hopper open, as this will show that the disintegrators were cleaned and no
classified waste is left.

A1.21. Vacuum around both disintegrators.

A1.22. Making sure that both the Rotary Air Lock Valve and the FC-30 Cyclone Systems are “Off”, need
to rotate the rope (up and down) vigorously on the Filter Tube Shaker (about 10 times). At the bottom of
the Filter Tube Shaker, is a metal plate that keeps the dust/residue in-place. With a plastic box underneath
it, pull out the metal plate. Be advised, a lot of dust/residue will fall into the plastic box. At this time, need
to rotate the rope (up and down) again, approximately 10 more times vigorously. After this is done, go
ahead and push the metal plate back in.

A1.23. If at any time the machine jams or you are having problems, shut down the disintegrator(s) and
call 6-7367 or 6-7845.




I certify that I have received training on the proper use of the disintegrators to include safety procedures.
