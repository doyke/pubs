6. Social Security Numbers.

6.1. The AFSVA TOP staff must have a social security number (SSN) before they can send

in lieu of writing the SSN on the check which can lead to identity theft.

6.1.1. Collecting and maintaining SSNs will be treated For Official Use Only (FOUO) and
safeguarded in accordance with AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, para 3.3, and The Privacy Act
of 1974, U.S.C. Title 552a as amended.

6.1.2. When asking an individual for his or her SSN, always provide a verbal or written Privacy

manager writes, and HQ AFRC/A1SR approves, OIs establishing procedures for the use, control,
and protection of all change and imprest funds.

9.3. Change funds should be turned in when no longer required, or reduced due to a reduction in
the scope of the operation.

all times. HQ AFRC/A1SR consolidates these revisions to provide more accurate cash flow
projections and trend analysis throughout the year.

12.3. Activity managers forward completed budgets to the Services Chief for review. The

fulfillment of his/her responsibilities by checking the “approved” box for the transaction in
PaymentNet.

17.8.1. When the cardholder is not available, it is the AOs responsibility to ensure the
cardholder’s transactions are reallocated to the correct line of accounting within four business
days after the transaction is posted in PaymentNet.

17.9. Disputed items must be resolved between the cardholder, the vendor, and the bank.

17.9.1. If a cardholder and AO work a disputed item with a vendor and/or bank without
resolution, the cardholder can dispute a transaction electronically in PaymentNet up to 90 days
after the transaction has been posted.

17.9.2. Do not dispute sales tax, exchange rate, or shipping and handling charges.

18. NAF Funded Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel.

18.1. In accordance with AF policy, AFRC installations must utilize APFs for NAF travel
whenever authorized. When NAF-funded travel is deemed appropriate, staff members from the
NAF activity sending the employee TDY will prepare the travel orders, or whoever normally
performs this function. Follow local procedures for processing TDY orders within your
organization. Block 19 of the travel order, DD Form 1610, must have the statement “NAF
FUNDS APPLY.”
12                                                     AFRCI34-204 5 NOVEMBER 2008

18.2. Estimate travel costs to include lodging and per diem. Your local travel pay section can
determine the rates for a given TDY location. This can be done via telephone or on website
http://perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem/. The Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) determines these
rates for DoD travelers. The installation Services Chief, or designee, should be the approving
official for all NAF travel orders.

18.3. If the NAF employee requires a travel advance, the Business Specialist completes a
Disbursement Request in NAFDIS and attaches a copy of the completed TDY order. An amount
not to exceed 80 percent of the total estimated cost, less airfare cost, may be advanced to the
traveler, see TA-AFSFMS-05 – Disbursement Requests.

18.4. The employee is required to complete a DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher, and forward it
to the local Travel Pay Office for computation only within five workdays of return from TDY
travel.

18.4.1. Forward the computed travel voucher and supporting documents to the Business
Specialist who will, in turn, complete a Disbursement Request in NAFDIS and attach a copy of
the completed TDY reimbursement package. HQ AFRC/A1SR staff will review and approve for
payment by the SSC for employee’s final settlement.

18.4.2. If the TDY cost is reimbursable by HQ AFSVA, the settlement voucher must be
processed, paid, and received by the Services Agency no later than 45 days after completion of
the TDY travel.

19. NAF Payroll Procedures.

19.1. Payroll processing transferred from HQ AFRC/A1SR to HQ AFSVA/SVT the first Pay
Period in Calendar Year 2005. Employee hours are transferred to HQ AFSVA/SVT using the
AF approved time system.

19.1.1. Add employees to or remove them from AF approved time system only after receiving
an AF Form 2545, NAFI Notification of Personnel Action, from the Human Resources Office.

19.2. Officially designated timekeepers are responsible for all reporting and generation of time
cards. Managers/Supervisors must ensure timekeepers are notified of all new employees.

19.3. The AF approved time system information will be attached to an e-mail message and
transmitted to afrc.payroll@afsv.net by 1200 hours local time on the Monday following the end
of the pay period.

AFRCI34-204 5 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                 13

19.5. When a holiday falls on the Monday following the end of the pay period, an estimated
payroll will be submitted on Friday prior to the end of the pay period. Submit hours based on
schedule and past experience.

19.6. Payroll Products and Reports are provided by HQ AFSVA/SVT.

19.6.1. Earnings Statements. Activity managers make every attempt to ensure employees
receive their earning statements which are available through “MY Money”.

19.6.2. NAF Payroll Liabilities Report. These reports should be reviewed to verify employer’s
liability cost for accuracy, e. g. health and life insurance and NAF Employees’ Wage and Tax
Data Report to verify rate of pay, cost center, and deductions are accurate.

19.6.3. NAF Leave Record. Managers verify employee leave accrual rates and leave balances.

19.6.3.1. Use the report to verify leave balances prior to approving requests for leave and to
ensure use or lose leave is forecasted.

19.6.3.2. Notify HQ AFRC/A1SRH of any discrepancies or corrective actions required.

20. Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Funds.

20.1. SM&W funds are NAF dollars used to contribute to the overall morale and welfare of the
military community. They must be used conservatively, be in the best interest of the Air Force,
benefit the military community, and not be limited to specific grades or levels of personnel.

20.1.1. Due to past abuses and questionable spending practices, the Air Force Chief of Staff
directed each MAJCOM Commander to establish guidelines for using SM&W funds. MAJCOM
Commanders ensure the program’s integrity by personally monitoring base-level expenditures
and requiring/reviewing quarterly reports from their bases which are signed by the senior
installation commander. REMEMBER: SM&W expenditures require special oversight due to
the high level of scrutiny to preserve the program, contain costs, and preclude embarrassment to
the Air Force.

20.1.2. When APFs are authorized for an event, purpose, or function, SM&W funds cannot be
used even if APFs are not available.

20.1.2.1. The senior installation commander at each AFRC base is responsible for the integrity
of the SM&W program on his/her base. The installation Services Chief, or designee, monitors
requests for SM&W funds and ensures they are authorized before forwarding for approval.
SM&W funds requests must be submitted/approved in advance of the event, no exceptions.

20.1.2.2. Requests for SM&W funds at base level must be submitted to the Services Chief or
designee in the format included in the AFRC SM&W Guidelines. Use AFRC Form 211, Request
for Special Morale and Welfare (SM&W) Funds.
14                                                     AFRCI34-204 5 NOVEMBER 2008

20.1.3. In accordance with AFI 34-201, paragraph 12.2.1.2, the installation Services Chief may
submit an annual request for delegated expenditure authority to the installation commander. This
annual request should include approval to spend SM&W funds for recurring functions, such as
Individual Recognition (cost center 1601), Civic Affairs and Events (cost center 1602),
Memorial Observances (cost center 1603), Welcoming and Orientation (cost center 1604), and
Change of Command Ceremonies (cost center 1608) up to a maximum of $1,000.00 per
function/event. NOTE: If delegated this authority, the installation Services Chief will be
authorized to approve most requests for SM&W funds.

20.1.3.1. Make the delegated authority a matter of record in the next NAF council minutes. This
provides flexibility and speeds up the SM&W approval process.

20.1.4. When a request is received, the installation Services Chief, or designee, researches AF,
AFRC, and base guidance (if any) to ensure SM&W funds are authorized before approving or
forwarding for approval. The rule number listed in the AFRC SM&W Guidelines that applies
must be referenced on the AFRC Form 211.

20.1.5. If the SM&W request meets the recurring function criteria in paragraph 20.1.3, the
installation Services Chief completes, signs, and forwards AFRC Form 211 (sample 1 in the
AFRC SM&W Guidelines) to the requestor.

20.1.5.1. The Services Chief keeps a file copy and forwards a copy of AFRC Form 211 to the
club if they are providing food for the event.

20.1.6. If the SM&W request does not meet the recurring function criteria in paragraph

20.1.3, the installation Services Chief completes, signs, and forwards AFRC Form 211 to the
installation commander or designated approving official.

20.1.6.1. When the Services Chief gets the approved AFRC Form 211 back, forward a copy to
the requestor and one to the club if they are providing food for the event.

20.1.7. The installation Services Chief prepares and obtains the installation commander’s
signature on a quarterly SM&W report (sample 2 in the AFRC SM&W Guidelines). These
reports must be clear, complete, and detailed to include names, numbers of people, types of food
served, and etc. Reports are due to HQ AFRC/A1SR on or before the last day of January, April,
July, and October.

20.1.8. HQ AFRC/A1SR staff will check to ensure the amounts in each base’s SM&W report
balance to the financial statement each quarter.

20.1.9. Annually, the installation Services Chief establishes Base SM&W Guidelines to ensure
that the levels of SM&W expenditures are not so high that they detract from Services programs.

20.1.9.1. The Guidelines should be briefed to the NAF Council at the beginning of each fiscal
year and include the following as a minimum:
AFRCI34-204 5 NOVEMBER 2008                                                                15

20.1.9.1.1. Base SM&W Guidelines should explain the paperwork to be completed and steps to
be taken when requesting funds to include points of contact, address, and phone numbers.

20.1.9.2. In all cases, no exceptions, SM&W expenditure requests must be received in writing
and approved in advance of the event.

20.1.9.3. If SM&W funds are used to support base-wide Awards Programs, then individual unit
award programs cannot also be supported with SM&W funds.

20.1.9.4. AFRC SM&W expenditure policy allows installation commanders to host quarterly
base-wide promotion ceremonies at which all promotes are recognized. Light refreshments may
be served. These ceremonies are great unit morale builders.

20.1.9.5. Installation commanders decide if their MWR Fund is healthy enough to support
commander’s calls with SM&W funds. Include this information in the annual Base SM&W
Guidelines.

20.1.9.6. If SM&W funds are used to support base newcomer’s orientations, then individual
units cannot also have newcomer’s orientations supported by SM&W funds.

20.1.9.7. If base spending authority for a particular SM&W cost center is going to be less than
that authorized by AF or AFRC, include it in the Base SM&W Guidelines.

20.1.9.8. If the installation commander wants to host distinguished visitors by having fruit
baskets placed in their rooms, include the rank of visitors to be hosted in the Base SM&W
Guidelines. The Guidelines should cover tenant units on base. NOTE: When 4-star generals
visit, use appropriated Official Representation Funds (ORFs) to purchase their fruit basket.

20.1.9.9. The Base SM&W Guidelines should encourage project officers to spend SM&W funds
in Services activities to the maximum extent possible.

20.1.9.10. When Services Chiefs, their representatives, or commanders and/or their staff are
unsure whether a proposed SM&W expenditure is authorized, they should request a
determination from HQ AFRC/A1SR.

21. Unit Funds (cost center 1502) and Special Events/Special Observances (cost center
1503).

21.1. Unit funds (cost center 1502) are NAFs used to support social events such as
organizational parties and picnics that the installation commander authorizes.

21.1.1. Unit funds should fund events that contribute to the overall morale and welfare of the
military community. Commanders/staff must exercise care to assure all eligible personnel, to the
maximum extent possible, are invited and are able to attend functions funded with Unit Funds.
16                                                     AFRCI34-204 5 NOVEMBER 2008

21.1.2. MAJCOMs establish guidelines on Unit Fund expenditure levels. Under AFRC policy
installation commanders may approve expenditures of 10% of prior year net income adjusted for
depreciation (NIAD) or $4.00 per assigned military member, whichever is less. If a base MWR
Fund experiences a prior year net loss, HQ AFRC/A1S will be the approving authority.

21.1.3. The installation Services Chief must keep the installation commander informed to ensure
the level of Unit Funds being spent does not hamper with the basic needs of the MWR Program.

21.1.4. The Services Chief must establish base procedures to ensure that tenant units are treated
the same as base units when they request Unit Funds.

21.1.5. All Unit Funds must be requested and approved in writing in advance of the actual
event. Base procedures must inform commanders concerning how they go about requesting Unit
Funds including points of contact, address, and phone numbers.

21.1.6. Unit Funds may be used to fund food, beverages, paper plates, napkins, and plastic
spoons/forks. Do not use Unit Funds to purchase alcoholic beverages, tablecloths, dishwashing
liquid or powder, dishes, pots, pans, charcoal, propane gas, or any other like items that will not
be eaten or used up during the event.

21.1.7. If Unit Funded events are going to be catered, ensure that Services activities receive the
business if they are capable of supporting the event.

21.2. Special events/special observances (cost center 1503) include Open House, Armed Forces
Day, holiday celebrations, festivals, one-time activities, and special events such as base-wide
successful UCI celebration.

21.2.1. The installation commander is the approving official when special events/special
observance funds are going to be used.

21.2.2. As with SM&W and Unit Fund requests, special events/special observance fund requests
must be received and approved in advance of the event.
