       6.8.2. Ensure the 48 FW Board Score Sheet (Attachment 2) is utilized.
           6.8.2.1. Board members will score nomination packages using a 6.5 through 10 point
           scale and the merit rank order of 1 through 5. When developing scores, primary
           consideration should be given to mission accomplishment, including level of task
           difficulty and level of responsibility. Secondary consideration should be given to
           community service and personal growth as mission accomplishment often hinders
           participation in these otherwise vital areas.
           6.8.2.2. Board members will assign a score to all nominations. The board president
           will compile the scores from each board member’s sheet. Once the scores are

LAKENHEATHI36-2803 8 MARCH 2012                                                                     7


           whole points). Significant disagreements are discussed among the members who are
           in disagreement to seek resolution. The Board president’s vote will not be used
           unless required to break a tie. They will provide final recommendations to the 48
           FW/CCC.
   6.9. Face-to-Face Board. The military enlisted annual board will be a presentation or face-
   to-face board.
       6.9.1. If a military enlisted nominee cannot attend the board due to unforeseen
       circumstances (contingency deployment, TDY, emergency leave, hospitalization), the 48
       FW/CCC or designated representative will determine if the member will receive the
       average board score of those members who met the presentation board (Example: if there
       are three candidates and only two candidates met the board and one member scored an
       eight and the other score a ten, nine is an average board score). The areas scored by the
       board include: Bearing and Behavior, Dress and Appearance, and Communication.
       Regular leave is not an unforeseen circumstance unless the member will incur a personal
       loss and/or the leave is unrecoverable (cannot be taken at another time).
       6.9.2. Board questions.
           6.9.2.1. The board members will ask opinionated questions. The questions will cover
           general military knowledge and current events.
           6.9.2.2. The board president is a non-voting member and the president’s score will
           only be used in the event of a tie.
