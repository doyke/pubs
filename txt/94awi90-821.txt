SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The series was changed
from 48 (Aerospace Medicine) to 90 (Command Policy) series.


1. Maintenance of Workplace Written Hazard Communication.
   1.1. The workplace written hazard communication program will be maintained at each work area and
   include the following:
       1.1.1. A copy of this written workplace plan to include a copy of AFI 90-821, Hazard Communi-
       cation as Attachment 1.
       1.1.2. The work area hazardous chemical inventory as Attachment 2.
       1.1.3. A list of the non-routine tasks involving hazardous materials as Attachment 3.

2. Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).
   2.1. The Bioenvironmental Engineering Services shop, (94th MSG/SGPB, B-922, 5-5781), maintains
   the MSDS master file containing all hazardous chemicals used at Dobbins ARB.
       2.1.1. This master file consists of the Hazardous Material Information Resource System (HMIRS)
       and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Form 174, Material Safety Data
       Sheet, or equivalent forms.
2                                                                         94AWI90-821 12 JULY 2006


       2.1.2. This MSDS information will be readily available to all workers through the HMIRS Online
       Web Application—a web-based system used by workers at industrial facilities to access Electronic
       hazardous material documents that are assigned to specific work locations in each facility.
       2.1.3. Shops can also contact the chemical manufactures by phone, e-mail or internet to request a
       MSDS.
    2.2. Workers desiring MSDS information will contact SGPB at 5-5781 to establish a mutually accept-
    able time and place during the current workshift to review the MSDS. SGPB will review the MSDS
    with the employee and provide an explanation of the MSDS information. Requests after normal duty
    hours can be made by contacting SGPB at (678) 249-8279, 8281 or the base fire department at (678)
    655-4840.
    2.3. Supervisors will notify the Hazardous Materials Pharmacy (HAZMART) at 5-5021, each time a
    new chemical is needed for the work area. Supervisors will follow the current procedures for procur-
    ing chemicals and MSDS outlined in 94th AWI 32-7001, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Manage-
    ment Program.

3. Employee Information and Training.
    3.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials receive train-
    ing using the guidance found in AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7. These supervisors will be trained by the
    94th SGPB. The supervisors must contact SGPB at 5-5781 to schedule this training.
    3.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7. The
    supervisor, the organization’s occupational health coordinator, or other formal organizational training
    structure may provide this training. Supervisors should supplement this training to provide informa-
    tion on work area specific chemical hazards. Before presenting supplemental training, the supervisor
    will ensure the following appropriate agencies review the information for technical accuracy.
       3.2.1. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services: 94th MSG/SGPB, ext.5-5781
       3.2.2. Base Safety: 94th AW/SEG, ext. 5-4434
       3.2.3. Base Fire Department, Technical Services: 94th MSG/CEF, ext. 5-3400
       3.2.4. Base Environmental Flight: 94th MSG/CEV, ext. 5-5264

4. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
    4.1. The hazardous chemical inventory for this area will be developed by the work area supervisor.
    SGPB will review this inventory IAW the assessment priority established in AFI 48-145, Occupa-
    tional Health Program.
    4.2. The supervisors will maintain the hazardous chemical inventory in the work area and update it as
    necessary. When new chemicals need to be introduced into the work area, the supervisor will contact
    the HAZMART at ext. 5-5021.
    4.3. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of hazardous
    materials known to be present in a work area/shop. The identity that is used on the MSDS must be
    cross-referenced to the inventory. Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained electronically,
    provided that all shop personnel can retrieve the inventory.

5. Contractor Operations:
   5.1. The Contracting Office (94th LGC) will advise contractors of hazardous chemicals they may
   encounter and protective measures needed in the normal course of their work. The LGC may request
   assistance from Bioenvironmental Office (94th SGPB) or the appropriate work area supervisor, if
   needed. LGC will also inform the contractor that MSDS information is available through SGPB.
   5.2. At the pre-performance conference, and subsequently during the contract performance period,
   the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator will advise work area supervisors and AF employees
   monitoring the performance of contractors of hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. The
   contractor is required to submit information on the use of hazardous materials according to FAR
   clause 5352.223.9002, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.

6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   6.1. Non-routine tasks are:
      6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed on a greater than
      annual basis.
      6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or job
      series.
   6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in this work area, which
   involve hazardous materials (Attachment 2). The supervisor will ensure work area operating instruc-
   tions (OIs) thoroughly describe the non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls for the infre-
   quent tasks performed in this work area. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TOs) or
   other official documents adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers review
   these procedures before performing any non-routine tasks.
   6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of the activity
   will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the activity:
      6.3.1. The initial Employee Information and Training Program described in paragraph 2.7. of
      AFOSH Standard 90-821, Hazard Communication, for workers not previously trained.
      6.3.2. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and associated
      controls.
   6.4. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal supervisor describing
   the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, or
   equivalent, can be updated.
