                                            INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose of the AFI. This instruction assigns responsibilities and prescribes policies and procedures
for standardizing and modernizing Air Force (AF) physical training (PT) in concert with AFI 10-248, Fit-
ness Program and sister-service directives. The AF will use PT Courses (PTC) and Conditioning Obstacle
Courses (COC) to train Airmen re alistically, consistent with current and future doctrine, threat analysis,
and force structure. The AF will realize economy in developing these training ranges while ensuring these
ranges support the training required by the fielding of new and improve d ground warrior tactics, tech-
niques, and procedures as well as published environmental, safety, and health guidance. Furthermore, it
provides broad administrative, management and operational guidance for th e AF Obstacle Course Pro-
gram Manager (OCPM) and subordinate command level obstacle course programs. Deviations from this
instruction are not authorized unless approved by AF OCPM. Sub mit proposed changes through your
chain of command to AF/A3O-AS (AF OCPM), 1480 AF Pentagon , Washington DC 20330-1480 and
AF/A3O-AS Workflow (scats.xoos@pentagon.af.mil) on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication.

1.2. AF Obstacle Courses. The AF has developed two categories of courses define d as the Obst acle
Course Program (OCP) to provide al ternate PT, enhance confidence in physical abilities, build dynamic
leadership problem solving under physical stress and to enhance understanding of teamwork while devel-
oping fundamental warrior ethos. The MAJCOM/A3 maintains overall responsibility and approval
authority for Airmen utilizing obstacle courses within their Command.
    1.2.1. Category I: PTC. This course is designed for every Airman in the AF with low obstacles that
    must be negotiated quickly. Running the course can be a test of th e Airman’s basic motor skills and
    physical conditioning. These courses should be run as an alternat e form of physical conditioning.
    They provide an opportunity for an entire body workout within the normal AF PT program and should
    not be used as a pass/fail training tool unless specifically requir ed by Air Force Specialty Code
    (AFSC) or unit. CAT I obstacl es are designed for crawling, jumping, dodging, traversing, climbing,
    vaulting and balancing. These obstacl es will not have an ORM seve rity assessment above negligible
    with a residual risk of Lo w after implementation of c ounter-measures IAW AFPAM 90-902, Opera-
    tional Risk Management (ORM) Guidance and Tools.
    1.2.2. Category II: COC. This course is designed with higher and more di fficult obstacles than the
    PTC. The COC can be run for time or used to enhance the confidence, mental and physical abilities of
    the Airmen while cultivating the warrior ethos. If not used as a ti med event; Airmen are encouraged,
    but not forced to complete each obstacle. CAT II obstacles will not have a potential fall distance above
    14 feet without a direct connection to safety lines attended by a qualified, trained safety observer or a
    full-body-harness with lanyard a ttached to a supporting structur e IAW Association of Challenge
    Course Technology or like standa rds. These obstacles will not ha ve an ORM severity assessment
    above moderate with a residual risk of Low after implementati on of counter-measures IAW AFPAM
    90-902. CAT II obstacles not listed in Attachment 3 must get AF OCPM a pproval prior to use IAW
    paragraph 5.3.3. CAT I obstacles are approved for use on a CAT II course.
NOTE: MAJCOM/A3s may authorize the us e of individual kit (load bearing equipment, rucksack, etc.)
on all AF obstacle courses.
AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007                                                                                  5


1.3. Alternate Insertion and Extraction (AIE) and mountaineering training walls. The AF has addi-
tional AIE and m ountaineering operational requirements which are cove red by other service and joint
directives. These training aids (Fast Rope / Rappel Towers and Climbing Walls) will not be covered under
this instruction and will remain under the operational directives and specific AFSC training and Standard-
ization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) guidance. These training aids, regardless of location, will remain avail-
able for those Airmen with documented training requirements.

1.4. Fire Training Facilities. The AF has additional fi re training facilities wh ich are covered by AFI
32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program. These fire training facilities are
used for training specific to the Civil Engineering career field and will not be covered under this instruc-
tion.

1.5. Medical Readiness Training. AF medical personnel are required to train on stretcher carrying tech-
niques in a variety of simulated terrain conditions IAW AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and
Training. The Medical Readiness Training Site at Sheppard AFB TX maintains these training courses and
they will not be covered under this instruction.

1.6. Academic Leadership and Development Courses. Academic Leadershi p and Development
courses are designed to promote teamwork and camaraderie in the Professional Military Education envi-
ronment. By definition these co urses will not include any obstacles with a residual ORM assessment
above negligible. Examples of this course are Project X, Lead ership Reaction Cour ses, and Assaul t
Courses currently being utilized by Air University and the United S tates Air Force Academy (USAFA).
These academic leadership and development courses will adhere to the following:
   1.6.1. The course owner completes an inspection, identifies off-limits areas, and completes an ORM
   brief to mitigate training risk. Base safety assists as requested.
   1.6.2. Base/installation commander (o r equivalent) authorizes the use of the course after re viewing
   the conditions and risks associated with the training events.
   1.6.3. Base/installation commander (or equivalent) en sures all instructors and safety observers are
   experienced with the training events, understand the ORM techniques, risk mitigation implementation
   procedures, and that they provide a safety and ORM brief to all participants prior to use.
   1.6.4. Courses in question will be referred to the MAJCOM Obstacle Course Program Manager
   (OCPM) for clarification. If the MAJCOM OCPM is unable to provide the required guidance/clarifi-
   cation, the issue will be addressed to the AF OCPM.

1.7. Ropes Course. These are commercial “Challe nge Courses” installed, operated and inspected in
accordance with Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT) standards. These courses are spe-
cifically designed to bui ld leadership, trust, team-building and prob lem resolution sk ills. Examples of
these courses are the USAFA ropes course and the rope s course at select ANG installations and training
sites. Ropes courses meeting these criteria are approved for use with the following oversight:
   1.7.1. The course owner completes an inspection, identifies off-limits areas, and completes an ORM
   brief to mitigate training risk (any obstacles with a residual ORM assessment above negligible will not
   be used). Base safety assists as requested.
6                                                                           AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007


    1.7.2. Base/installation commander (or equivalent) en sures all instructors and safety observers are
    experienced with the training events, understand the ORM techniques, risk mitigation implementation
    procedures, and that they provide a safety and ORM brief to all participants prior to use.
    1.7.3. Use of of f-base commercial Challenge Cour ses by the ANG requires approval through he
    MAJCOM OCPM (NGB).
    1.7.4. Courses in question will be referred to the MAJCOM OCPM for clarification. If the MAJCOM
    OCPM is unable to provide the required guidance/clarification, the issue will be forwarded to the AF
    OCPM.

1.8. Sister-Services, Coalition Forces or Other Outside Agencies Requesting Use of AF Obstacle
Course(s). Sister-service or coalition units may utilize existing AF obstacle courses using their applicable
guidance and directives or this AFI. Outside agencies may utilize exis ting courses with base/installation
commander (or equivalent) approv al. These agencies will conduct operations in accordance with this
instruction when lacking their own published guidance or directives.

1.9. AF Use of Sister-Service or Coalition Unit Obstacle Course(s). AF units may us e Sister-service
or coalition unit obstacle course(s) with MAJCOM/A3 approval. MAJCOM OCPMs will establish proce-
dures for request/approval of Sister -service or coalition unit courses fo r unilateral AF use. Airmen who
are attached to a sister -service, joint unit, or coal ition unit, may utilize the co urse with, and under the
direct control of that unit.

1.10. References. The primary guidance for this AFI was developed from Army FM 21-20, Physical Fit-
ness Training. Obstacle designs were deve loped based on Department of Army Engineering Drawings
28-13-95, Confidence Course Layout Plan. Safety and ORM procedures are IAW AFPAM 90-902, Oper-
ational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools. AF PT standards are IAW AFI 10-248, Fitness
Program.

                                         SAFETY PROCEDURES

3.1. Considerations Prior to Use. This chapter outlines safety requirements and areas for consideration
prior to any obstacle course use by AF personnel.

3.2. Operational Risk Management. The installation commander will ap point an installation OCPM
for all issues pertaining to the course. The installation commander will ensure an ORM analysis is initially
accomplished and documented upon appointment and updated whenever procedures, obstacles, or condi-
tions of the course change.
   3.2.1. Application of ORM is animportant element for protecting our Airmen. The ORM process pro-
   vides leaders and individuals a systematic approach to make risk decisions.
   3.2.2. An ef fective ORM assessment is critical to obstacle course mana gement. OCPMs and course
   officials must analyze and attempt to anticipate as ma ny hazards and associat ed risks as po ssible
   before allowing personnel to attempt to negotiate th e obstacle course. Risk is the potential for injury
   or loss, and is present at every obstacle course. Itis measured by several factors including the potential
   severity and the probability of occurrence. Hazards are conditions that have the potential to negatively
   impact course negotiation by partic ipants. To manage risk, identify potential hazards, then, take the
   steps necessary to prioritize and mitigate the potential hazards. Risk management is based on an accu-
   rate perception and i ncludes all probable options. Risk d ecisions must refl ect controls guaranteeing
   the minimum risk necessary for safe obstacle course ma nagement and desired training accomplish-
   ment. Attachment 6 provides the ORM matrix/considerations for the OCP. Further guidance on how
   to conduct an ORM can be found in AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guid-
   ance and Tools.

3.3. Medical Considerations. Airmen have a cardiovascular scre ening annually during their physical
health assessment and have an additional screen prior to their AF fitness test. Assuming they pass all com-
ponents of their AF fitness test and have no profile limiting physical performance , they are cleared to
negotiate the course. The OCPI and OCSO have the authority to pull anyone from the course they feel are
not fit to participate, e.g. physically disabled/injured, unfit, exhausted, or acutely ill and taking medication
that may interfere with performance etc.
NOTE: Standard line of duty dete rmination will apply to ANG personnel IAW AFI 36-2910, Line of
Duty (Misconduct) Determination.

3.4. Climate Considerations. Refer to AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Injury (http://www.e-publish-
ing.af.mil/pubfiles/af/48/afpam48-151/afpam48-151.pdf) for detailed considerations.
   3.4.1. Hot Temperature. Individuals in hot climates should be given time to become acclimated to the
   local climate prior to at tempting to negotiate any category cour se. The level of humidity should also
   be taken into consideration. Th e wet bulb globe temperature inde x (WBGTI) may be used to deter-
   mine when the course may be used and what precautions are to be taken during training. When using
   the course during hot weather, course officials should be aware of personnel displaying the following
   symptoms:
       3.4.1.1. HEAT CRAMPS – muscle cramps of the abdomen, legs, or arms.
14                                                                          AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007


        3.4.1.2. HEAT EXHAUSTION – head ache; excessive sweating; we akness; dizziness; nausea;
        muscle cramps; and pale, clammy skin.
        3.4.1.3. HEATSTROKE – profuse sw eating; collapse or unconsciou sness that is sudden or pre-
        ceded by headache, dizziness, fast pulse, nausea, vomiting, and mental confusion. Heat stroke is
        a medical emergency, call for medical support immediately.
     3.4.2. Cold Temperature. When training on the obstacl e course during cold weather, course officials
     will ensure the obstacles are not wet, or icy , and the landing areas are not frozen. Participants must
     wear appropriate hand protection to prevent cold related injuries and allow for positive grip. During
     periods of extreme temperatures, the training period will be kept to the minimum necessary to reduce
     personnel exposure to the elements.
     3.4.3. High Altitude. Several factors mu st be considered when training in high altitudes. As the alti-
     tude increases, blood oxygen leve ls decrease. The resulting lowe red blood oxygen leve ls can induce
     certain problems. Increased heart rate and breathlessness are common. In extreme cases, unconscious-
     ness can result when the brain is denied oxygen.Additional time should be added to a preconditioning
     program when preparing to complete a course in higher altitude areas.
     3.4.4. Rain. When conducting OCP training in the ra in, check Airmen for hypothermia. Ensure par-
     ticipants wear proper clothing for the elements while allowing safe nego tiation of the obstacles.
     Ensure Airmen wear proper footwear. Conduct a pre-inspection of the course to check for washouts or
     changes in the course that would cause potential problems. Conduct ORM to mitigate any newly iden-
     tified hazards prior to negotiating the course. If id entified hazards cannot be mitigated to an accept-
     able level, the obstacle will be placed off-limits.

3.5. General Safety Precautions. OCPMs, OCPIs, OCPSOs, and participants will ensure safety precau-
tions are taken to prevent injury on obstacle courses. Th e following minimum sa fety requirements must
be met prior to using the obstacle course:
     3.5.1. Annual and pre-use inspections will be accomplished. At a minimum, inspections will address:
     each obstacle being used, paths between obstacles, construction, protruding nails, sharp edges, rotten
     logs/poles, condition of fall protection and pads, la nding pits and areas, overgrown weeds/vegetation
     and other hazards.
     3.5.2. Obstacles with safety, design, or construction deficiencies that cannot be corrected prior to start
     of training will be placed off limits until corrected. These obstacles will be clearly marked as off-lim-
     its utilizing orange cones and signs on both entry and exit to/from the obstacle. All participants will be
     advised which obstacles are of f-limits prior to course negotiation an d pointed out during the course
     demonstration IAW paragraph 2.4.13.4. After major repairs are made to any obstacles a safety inspec-
     tion must be conducted by the personnel listed in Attachment 5 and paragraph 2.4.9.2. above (base
     OCPM, base safety office, CES representative) using the checklist found in Attachment 5.
     3.5.3. Rake and refill landing/fall areas under obstacles, as needed, before each use.
     3.5.4. Personnel will conduct warm-up ex ercises as outlined in paragraph A4.11. before they are
     allowed on the course.
     3.5.5. Ensure all obstacles have the correct number of properly trained safety personnel present IAW
     Attachment 5.
AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007                                                                                 15


   3.5.6. Consider postponing training on the course when weather conditions may affect footing or
   handhold surfaces unless it is mission essential or directed by the commander.
   3.5.7. Ensure medical personnel and equipment are readily available within acceptable response time
   to CAT II courses. Medical coverage consists of trained personnel equipped with emergency lifesav-
   ing and stabilization equipment and the means to tr ansport injured personnel to appropriate medical
   facilities.
   3.5.8. Ensure a primary and backup means of communication are available and operational. At a min-
   imum the OCPI must have the ability to summon immediate help by landline, radio or cellular phone.
   3.5.9. Participants should not be allowed to nego tiate obstacle courses if they have donated blood
   within the previous 72 hours.

3.6. Negotiating Obstacles. Participants must be instructed in the proper technique for negotiating each
obstacle. The technique to be used must be explained and demonstrated in detail, with emphasis on avoid-
ing injury. Alternate methods of obst acle negotiation to those listed in Attachment 3 may be authorized
as long as they do not increase the safety risk or significantly alter the procedure described. The decision
to negotiate any obstacle is left to the discretion of the participant.

3.7. Safety Requirements. The following minimum safety require ments must be in place and used
whenever the obstacle course is in use. OCPI and OCPSO (when required) will be qualified IAW Chap-
ter 4 and perform the duties outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction:
   3.7.1. The OCPIs and OCPSOs must ensure spectatorsare kept a safe distance away from each obsta-
   cle and ensure they do not interfere with participant’s progress.
   3.7.2. The OCPI must have the ability to summon immediate help by la ndline, radio, or cellular
   phone for both CAT II courses.
   3.7.3. The obstacle course should not be used during limited visibility unless adequate lighting is pro-
   vided and an ORM assessment is conducted covering the condi tions. Unit commanders should make
   this determination balancing the risk to Airmen against realistic training to meet unit mission require-
   ments.
   3.7.4. No rings, jewelry , watches, or breakable items will be allowed on the obstacle course. Rings
   which cannot be removed must be completely taped over to ensure no edges are exposed which may
   cause a snag hazard.
   3.7.5. All participants will wear appropriate battledress (utility) uniform with the sleeves down.
   3.7.6. Open toed footwear is prohibited.

3.8. Equipment Requirements. The following are the minimum safe ty equipment requirements for the
safe operation of an obstacle course. Units may need to add to this list to meet unique local requirements.
   3.8.1. OCPI must have a copy of this instruction and OCPM approved safety briefing.
   3.8.2. Radio or telephone communication must be present to summon immediate help.
   3.8.3. First aid kit to treat minor injuries.
   3.8.4. Drinking water must be available.

                         COURSE LAYOUT, DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE

5.1. Standardized Course Design. This chapter prescribes the requi rements for the layout, design and
maintenance for AF obstacle courses.

5.2. Course Layout. Obstacle courses will be laid-out with safety as the primary focus.
     5.2.1. CAT I course layout should take advantage of existing natural obstacles and terrain where pos-
     sible. Consideration should be given to presence of existing structures, erosion potential, accessibility
     and possible hazards such as overhead utilities.
     5.2.2. Possible CAT II course layout is contained in Attachment 2. At a minimum, consider ation
     should be given to fatigue as Airmen negotiate the course with positioning of the most difficult obsta-
     cles at or near the start.

5.3. Design. Obstacles should be designed for safe ne gotiation while challenging various physical
aspects of the individual negotiating the course.
     5.3.1. CAT I obstacles are designed for crawling, jumping, dodging, traversing, climbing, vaulting
     and balancing. CAT I obstacles will not exceed four feet in height ( above ground) and will have an
     ORM assessment of negligible IAW AFPAM 90-902.
     5.3.2. CAT II obstacles will not ha ve a potential fall distance above 14 feet without a direct connec-
     tion to safety lines attended by a qualified, trained safety observer or a full-body-harness with lanyard
     attached to a supporting structure IA W Association of Challenge Course T echnology or like stan-
     dards. These obstacles will not have an ORM assessment above “m oderate” with a residual risk of
     “negligible” after implementation of counter-measures IAW AFPAM 90-902.
     5.3.3. Attachment 3 contains the list of CA T II obst acles approved fo r AF ob stacle courses.
     Non-CAT I qualifying obstacles that do not exceed CAT II design criteria, but are not listed in Attach-
     ment 3, must be approved for use by th e AF OCPM prior to being li sted in a MAJCOM supplement
     to this instruction. AF OCPM approved additions will be added into future revisions of this AFI.
     MAJCOM suggested obstacles not included in Attachment 3 will be forwarded to the AF OCPM and
     include the following minimum information:
NOTE: Obstacles exceeding CAT II criteria listed in paragraph 1.2.2. are not authorized on AF Obstacle
Courses. These obstacles will be place off-limits until removed permanently.
        5.3.3.1. Instructions for negotiating the obstacle.
        5.3.3.2. Number of personnel allowed on the obstacle at one time.
        5.3.3.3. Number of safety personnel required.
        5.3.3.4. ORM assessment with mitigation factors identified.
        5.3.3.5. Special safety considerations or equipment.
        5.3.3.6. Specify type of fall zone protection equipment, if required.
        5.3.3.7. Digital photo (file) of the obstacle.
AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007                                                                                   19


   5.3.4. Obstacle design specifications are contained in the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers’ web page at
   http://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/stddgn/StdIndex.aspx?id=13
   The following link provides additional information on inspections and fall zone criteria.
   http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/p385-1.pdf (Appendix C).

5.4. OCP Course Inspections. Consider frequency of use and ef fects of the local climate on the obsta-
cles to determine the frequency of inspections by the OCPM. The OCPM performs course inspections
using the Attachment 5 checklist. After repairs to the obstacle course have been performed, request a
joint safety inspection of the obstacle course with their unit safety monitor, installation safety office, and
CES (preferably a Structural Engineer). The results of this inspection will be filed by the OC PM for the
life of the obstacle.

5.5. Maintenance. OCP Course(s) maintenance will only be performed by qualified personnel trained to
perform structural maintenance. This maintenance may be performed by base civil engineer or by a con-
tractor qualified to perform such a task. Self-help maintenance of obstacles is authorized but, the obstacle
will remain off limits until certified by a qualified structural engineer.
   5.5.1. Obstacle Course Records.
       5.5.1.1. Maintenance and inspection logs. The OCPM will maintain maintenance and inspection
       logs for individual obst acles and for the overall course un der the Records Informat ion Manage-
       ment System (AFRIMS). As a minimum, the logs will include:
           5.5.1.1.1. A detailed checklist for course and obstacle inspection, see Attachment 5.
           5.5.1.1.2. A record of all insp ections, hazards, deficiencies , and maintenanc e conducted on
           the course.
           5.5.1.1.3. A record of all deficiencies/safety hazards and any actions taken to lessen the unsafe
           condition. This must be tracked until the problem is completely fixed. Any countermeasures to
           mitigate risks to personnel must also be listed.

5.6. Security. The installation comm ander will work in concert with the OCPM to develop a security
strategy protecting the structural integrity of the OCP course(s) and prevent unauthorized use. As a mini-
mum, the OCP course will:
   5.6.1. Develop a single point of entry into OCP compound secured with a lockable chain link or solid
   construction fence. Courses that are located within a secure training complex (i.e. USAFA Jacks Val-
   ley) are exempt from the requirement for individual fences around each course.
   5.6.2. Post “Authorized use only” signs with the OCPM contact information.

5.7. Funding. OCP funding is a MAJCOM responsibility.

NOTE: Picture may not clearly depict fall zone or additional safety precautions (i.e. padding).
Refer to sub-paragraphs 5 & 6 below for safety requirements.
     A3.1.1. To successfully negotiate this obstacle you must approach the obstacle from a short run, grasp
     the rope at shoulder height a nd swing your body forward until over the wall. Release the rope once
     balanced on the wall and jump forward to the ground.
     A3.1.2. Number of personnel allowed on obsta cle. No more than three particip ants are allowed on
     this obstacle at one time.
     A3.1.3. Number of safety personnel required for the obstacle. Ob stacle will be ne gotiated using the
     wingman concept (i.e. One person negotiates the obs tacle while wingman watches then they switch).
     Courses designed with multiple lanes may run these lanes simultaneously. In these cases, additional
     safety observers may be used in lieu of the wingman method.
     A3.1.4. Level of safety risk (sever ity) for this obstacle. This obsta cle has a moderate safety risk due
     to possibility of participants improperly swinging and striking logs or falling.
     A3.1.5. Special safety considerations and equipment. Due to the possibility of lower extremity inju-
     ries, participants must be briefed to swing high enough to ensure they do not strike any part of their
     body against the horizontal log/wall. Participants must also ensure a straight swing to avoid support
     poles/braces. They must ensure th eir knees are bent slightly when landing to absorb the impact. The
     support braces should be padded.
     A3.1.6. Fall zone ar ound and under the obst acle must be constructed of material that is capable of
     absorbing the impact of someone falling of f the obstacle (18” sand, 12” ground rubber , or 24” saw-

   decline side using the following technique. Place your feet on the log to be crossed, hold your arms at
   out from your sides at shoulder level and fix your eyes on the log approximately five yards in front of
   your feet. Walk the log by placing first one foot then the other on the center of the log, moving forward
   using your arms to maintain balance.
   A3.2.2. Number of personnel allowed on obstacle. One per log.
   A3.2.3. Number of safety personnel required for the obstacle. Ob stacle will be ne gotiated using the
   wingman concept (i.e. One person negotiates the obstacle while wingman watches then they switch.).
   Courses designed with multiple lanes may run these lanes simultaneously. In these cases, additional
   safety observers may be used in lieu of the wingman method.
   A3.2.4. Level of safety risk (sever ity) for this obstacle. This obsta cle has a moderate safety risk due
   to steep angle of the logs and the possibility of falling to the ground or landing on a support log.
   A3.2.5. Speci al safety considerations and equipment. Participants mu st be briefed that the logs are
   designed to move and they must ensure that they have positive footing while progressing through this
   obstacle. As participants progress through this obstacle they may help their teammates.

                             OBSTACLE COURSE SAFETY BRIEFING

A4.1. Obstacle courses are not playgrounds. The obstacles are difficult and require your full attention.
Personnel have been seriously, and in a few instances, fatally injured while attempting an obstacle. To pre-
vent occurrences of this nature we must make safety "our primary concern."

A4.2. Remain alert. Personnel on the course are to be constan tly alert for any unsafe acts or conditions
(loose bolts, protruding nails, exce ssive splinters, loose or frayed rope s, rotten or split lumber). I f any
unsafe conditions are noted, you must notify an instructor immediately.

A4.3. Participation. Participants are encouraged to attempt al l obstacles, but have the right to decline
any obstacle that may be too difficult.

A4.4. Instructor intervention. Instructors will intervene and stop you from completing an obstacle, or
the entire course, if they determine you are overly fatigued, appear to have a fear of an obstacle, or a re
negotiating an obstacle in an unsafe manner. Do not argue with the instructor s if they stop you, they are
doing so in your best interest.

A4.5. Non-interference with obstacle negotiation. No one may attempt to make an obstacle more diffi-
cult by shaking ropes, rolling logs, etc., or attempt to humiliate participants into attempting an obstacle.

A4.6. No horseplay on the course. Horseplay or deliberate unsafe act s will not be tolerated on the
course. Anyone involved in such activities will immediately be removed from the course and reported to
their commander.

A4.7. Uniform. All personnel should wear BDU/AB U shirts, trousers (with belt), socks, and properly
laced ankle-supporting boots. Additionally, a good pair of gloves is re commended to prevent rope burns
while running the course. Tight clothing and rubberized or plastic suits are not to be worn. Extra items are
not to be carried or strapped to the body unless approved by the installation commander.

A4.8. Weather assessment. Prior to conducting trai ning, the senior leader will access Air Force
approved weather sources for current and forecasted conditions to include wind speed. If it is raining the
senior ranking instructor will make an operational risk management decision on the determination to con-
tinue or stop training.

A4.9. Work / rest cycle. Work and rest cycles today are     /     . It is recommended you drink a min-
imum of ______quarts of water pe r hour. Water is located at ___________ locations along the obstacle
course

A4.10. Minimum physical fitness requirements. Personnel attempting to negotiate the course must be
within fitness standards and able to pass a ll phases of the AF phy sical fitness test wh en they arrive for
training on any obstacle course.
NOTE: At the USAFA, the Commandant of Cadets is the decision authority for approving cadets to
participate on obstacle courses as part of military training. Cadets will be thoroughly screened for
AFI36-2202 7 AUGUST 2007                                                                               47


the physical capability to safely negotiate obstacles prior to participating on any course. All
non-cadet participants will comply with A4.10.

A4.11. Minimum warm-up / cool-down. Obstacle course participants will conduct a minimum of five
minutes of warm-up and stretching exercises prior to and after negotiating the course. These events will
be led by either the OCPI or OCPSO.

A4.12. No jewelry. Individuals will remove al l jewelry, Camelbacks, backpacks, and empty all pockets
prior to negotiating the course (EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3s may authorize competitions using CAT II
courses and the use of individual kit (load bearing equipment, rucksack, etc.) on all obstacle courses.).

A4.13. Medication. If anyone is on medication or has any phys ical reasons why they do not feel com-
fortable attempting the course, they should say so at this time.

A4.14. Walk thru. The senior OCPI and OCPSO (if required) will conduct a walk through with all par-
ticipants and brief/demonstrate the following for each obstacle:
   A4.14.1. Definition of the obstacle
   A4.14.2. Out-of-Bounds areas
   A4.14.3. Any additional ground rules
   A4.14.4. Number of personnel allowed on obstacle at one time
   A4.14.5. How to negotiate the obstacle (see paragraph 3.6.)
   A4.14.6. Safety considerations
   A4.14.7. A demonstration will happen at each obstacle
   A4.14.8. If participating Airmen are still in question; they may receive additional instructions and/or
   conduct a “walk-through” rehearsal prior to negotiating the obstacle course.
