This instruction implements AFPD 38-1, Organization, policies and procedures for operations
within the assigned air defense region. It defines the personnel status individuals must be in
when performing the Federal mission. It also defines those events involving a Federal mission
that will activate the 11 AF/CC’s delegated authority to order a member of the Air National
Guard (ANG) to active duty under 10 U.S.C § 12301(d). The procedures specified in this
instruction must be followed on a day-to-day basis. This instruction applies to all personnel
assigned to the 176th Air Control Squadron (176 ACS), Alaska ANG (AKANG). Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR (see Attachment 1)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route the AF Form 847
through the appropriate chain of command. Ensure all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document has been revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Mission of Eleventh Air Force. HQ 11 AF plans, conducts, controls, and coordinates air
operations in accordance with the tasks assigned by the Commander, Pacific Air Forces, and is
the force provider for Alaskan Command, the Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense
Command Region (ANR), and other unified commanders. This mission is accomplished largely
through the 611th Air Operations Group (611 AOG) and the 611th Air Support Group. Together
2                                                                 11AFI38-101 14 APRIL 2005


they provide a network of critical air surveillance and command, control, and communication
functions necessary to perform tactical warning and attack assessment in defense of Alaska, and
activities necessary for the defense of National Command Authority (NCA), designated critical
infrastructure within the State of Alaska.
2. Structure of Eleventh Air Force.
    2.1. HQ 11 AF and the 611 AOG are U.S. Air Force organizations gained by Pacific Air
    Forces (PACAF).
    2.2. The 176 ACS (ANGUS) is a U.S. Air Force organization.
    2.3. The 176 ACS (ANG) is an Alaska ANG state organization which supports the 611 AOG
    operations.
3. Personnel/Duty Status.
    3.1. HQ 11 AF and 611 AOG. All military personnel assigned to HQ 11 AF and 611 AOG
    are in active duty Title 10 status. There are no Title 32 ANG personnel assigned. The
    commander of the 611 AOG will provide the federal mission link between the 176 ACS
    (ANG), 611 AOG and 11 AF.
    3.2. The 176 ACS (ANG). All military personnel assigned to the 176 ACS (ANG),
    including the commander, are in Title 32 status until the initiation of an “air sovereignty
    event.” When an “air sovereignty event” is declared, those personnel involved in the air
    sovereignty event, regardless of location —including the commander, who upon such
    occasions becomes the commander of the 176 ACS (ANGUS)—are instantaneously recalled
    to Title 10 status pursuant to their self-executing orders and 10 U.S.C. §12301(d). Upon self-
    activation to Title 10, such personnel are assigned to the 176 ACS (ANGUS) and become
    subject to federal Title 10 command authority. At the termination of the “air sovereignty
    event” personnel immediately revert back to their appropriate Title 32 status in the 176 ACS
    (ANG).
    3.3. As a condition of their employment, all 176 ACS (ANG) personnel are required to
    execute an individual voluntary consent statement which sets forth their consent to be
    recalled to Title 10 duty pursuant to 10 U.S.C § 12301(d) and paragraph 3.2, this instruction.
4. Events Involving a Federal Mission.
    4.1. The Secretary of the Air Force has authority under 10 U.S.C. § 12301(d) to activate
    ANG members to federal active duty, with the consent of the member, and the Governor of
    Alaska. This authority has been delegated to 11 AF/CC.
    4.2. The 11 AF/CC authorizes instantaneous voluntary activation of ANG members upon a
    declaration of an “air sovereignty event.” The 11 AF/CC, or his/her delegee, may declare an
    “air sovereignty event.”
    4.3. An “air sovereignty event” is any event that involves the federal mission of aerospace
    warning and control, and includes but is not limited to, the surveillance of the assigned
    airspace, the identification of unknown aircraft, the initiation and authorization of an active
    air scramble, and the control of aircraft engaged in an active air scramble or North American
    Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) mission. An “air sovereignty event” also includes
11AFI38-101 14 APRIL 2005                                                                         3


   any activity in direct support of the NORAD mission and activities necessary for the defense
   of NCA, designated critical infrastructure within the State of Alaska.
   4.4. All 176 ACS (ANG) personnel who participate in an “air sovereignty event,” including
   those who provide direct operational support and/or supervision of the event, are
   participating in the Federal mission of aerospace warning and control and upon declaration of
   the “air sovereignty event” are instantaneously recalled to Title 10 status. The physical
   location of personnel involved in an “air sovereignty event” is not a controlling factor in their
   instantaneous activation to Title 10 status. They do not need to be on base or at any other
   specific location if they are directly supporting an “air sovereignty event.” Those personnel
   who are involved in an “air sovereignty event” and who leave on break or who are relieved
   from duty at the end of a shift during an “air sovereignty event” immediately revert back to
   Title 32 status.
   4.5. An “air sovereignty event” involving an unknown aircraft terminates when the aircraft is
   identified, when an active air scramble mission is terminated, or when 11 AF/CC, or his/her
   delegee, declares the event is terminated.
