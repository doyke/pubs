     and ensure the taxiway is free of taxiing aircraft.            Establish two-way radio
     communications and receive permission from the Control Tower.
     3.8.4.3. Routine vehicle traffic operating on the taxiways will stay to the immediate right
     of the taxiway/taxilane centerline and avoid driving on taxiway shoulders. When leaving
     vicinity of aircraft, make a 90 degree turn and proceed back to the yellow
     taxiway/taxilane centerline.
     3.8.4.4. When requesting to cross the runway or access onto the runway, state the
     runway crossing or access point and destination.
     3.8.4.5. All vehicles will hold short of all CMA hold lines (200 feet from runway edge)
     and stop bars until the control tower's approval is received.
     3.8.4.6. When driving on the runway, vehicles will stay to the immediate right of the
     runway centerline. Note: Emergency response vehicles, AM and Civil Engineering may
     deviate from normal traffic patterns while performing official duties.
     3.8.4.7. During periods of inclement weather or at night, the Control Tower may instruct
     vehicles to hold short at the instrument hold lines located approximately 650 feet from
     the edge of Runway 01 (See Attachment 9 for depictions of the various hold lines and
     critical areas).
     3.8.4.8. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or emergency

         3.8.8.2.3. The following airfield markings are unique to Dover:
             3.8.8.2.3.1. Taxiway A, Main Ramp Clearance. A white line is painted behind
             the C-5's on spots E thru CC. When a C-5 is taxiing on Taxiway "A" centerline,
             there is 25' wing tip clearance between that line and the rear of the parked
             airplanes.
             3.8.8.2.3.2. Taxilane on Main Ramp. A white line is painted on either side of the
             taxi lane between spot E and Delta Row that indicates wing-tip clearance. If all
             vehicles and equipment are behind these lines, a C-5 has the necessary 25' wing
             tip clearance while taxiing.
             3.8.8.2.3.3. Vehicle Stop Bar, Delta Taxiway. A short white line is painted
             perpendicular on Delta Taxiway, near the Hazardous Cargo Pad. The white line
             is a vehicle stop bar representing the beginning of the CMA; vehicles will stop
             and contact Tower before proceeding.
  3.8.9. Airfield Lighting.
     3.8.9.1. Runway lights: White lights located on the runway edges. These high-intensity
     lights run the length of the runway and identify the runway edge.
     3.8.9.2. Taxiway Lights: Blue lights used to outline taxiways.
     3.8.9.3. Dover AFB airfield is illuminated by a variety of lights (ramp lighting, taxiway,
     runway, etc). Two lights you will encounter while driving at night on the CMA are
     taxiway lights and High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), see Attachment 10. Taxiway
     lights are used to outline the edges of taxiways during reduced periods of darkness and/or
     restricted visibility. They emit a blue color. HIRL’s are used to outline the edges of the
     runways. HIRL’s emit a white light and are evenly spaced the full length of the runway.
     3.8.9.4. Taxiway Entrance/Exit Lights: Double blue lights used to identify entrances and
     exits.
     3.8.9.5. Airport Rotating Beacon: Green and split (double peaked) white light. The

     is safe, the vehicle may proceed.
     3.8.11.4. Never drive between a ground marshaler and an aircraft.
     3.8.11.5. Except for "FOLLOW ME" vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or
     driven into the path of taxiing aircraft. Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing
     aircraft and its FOLLOW ME guide.
     3.8.11.6. Headlights of a stopped vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft at night will
     be turned off immediately so the pilot's night vision will not be affected. The vehicle
20                                                       DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013


     parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its position will be known. The
     headlights of the vehicle will remain off until the aircraft is out of range. Headlights will
     be turned ON prior to putting the vehicle in motion.
     3.8.11.7. Drivers operating vehicles on the taxiways and parking ramps will give way to
     taxiing aircraft. An aircraft with landing and/or taxi lights operating or rotating beacon
     indicates it is about to start engines, has engines running, or is about to taxi. Vehicles
     will exit the taxiways by the shortest route. Only as a last resort will the vehicle drive off
     prepared surfaces to ensure adequate clearances for the aircraft.
     3.8.11.8. Ramp road does not provide adequate wing tip clearance from Echo to Papa
     parking spots. When aircraft are taxiing or being towed vehicles must move to the south
     of ramp road or clear the area completely.

     200 feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or
     unloading, servicing, or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed
     towards an aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from
     being backed into aircraft. Note: The white rectangle boxes are very close to within 25
     feet, these spots are approved.
     3.8.12.2. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they will not interfere with the
     aircraft being towed or taxied. Ignition will be turned off; keys will be left in the
     ignition; and the gear lever will be put in reverse gear for vehicles with manual
     transmissions and in the "park" position for vehicles with automatic transmissions.
     3.8.12.3. All vehicles parked and left unattended will have brakes set or will have chocks
     placed both in front of and behind one of the rear wheels. One chock will be placed
     between the tandem wheels of dual (tandem) axle vehicles. The only vehicles exempt
     from these requirements are alert and emergency vehicles responding to an alert or
     emergency (i.e. ambulance and fire department).
     3.8.12.4. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will be braked or, if not
     equipped with brakes, chocked.
     3.8.12.5. When aircraft engines are operating or being started, no vehicle will be parked
     or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft, except as
     prescribed in the applicable aircraft tech order. Large frame aircraft require additional
     separation criteria. Do not operate vehicle within 300 feet to the rear of B-747, C-5, C-
     17, KC-10, KC-135 type aircraft when engines are running at low power settings.
     Increase this distance to 800 feet to the rear when the engines are running at high power
     settings. Vehicles parked at the side of the aircraft will be located clear of the wingtips,
     clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
     3.8.12.6. Vehicles will not be left unattended except in designated vehicle or AGE
     parking areas.
     3.8.12.7. Vehicles parked in front of or behind an aircraft will be parked perpendicular to
     the aircraft. Vehicles parked beside an aircraft will be parked parallel to the aircraft. At
DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013                                                                21

     3.8.19.4. Parking procedures around flare-loaded aircraft.
         3.8.19.4.1. Standing, stopping, or parking directly in front of aircraft while
         loading/unloading flares will be limited to no closer than 350 ft. Anytime the aircraft
         visor is open while flares are loaded; the Countermeasures Dispensing System
         becomes a forward firing ordnance. Ref: DOVERAFBI 91-102.
         3.8.19.4.2. When flares are being loaded, vehicles not directly involved with the
         loading will not use the parking boxes in front of the aircraft. Use parking locations
         adjacent the aircraft instead.
     3.8.19.5. Transient Alert Vehicle Procedures: FOLLOW ME vehicles used for guiding
     aircraft will be equipped with signs, easily visible at night, reading, "Stop" and "Follow-
     Me." They will be equipped with two-way radios for communication on Control Tower
     frequencies.
         3.8.19.5.1. Transient Alert vehicles performing "FOLLOW ME" services to arriving
         aircraft are granted approval to access portions of Taxiways Bravo and Delta without
         Control Tower approval. Portions are as follows:
            3.8.19.5.1.1. Taxiway Bravo - from Alpha parking row to the hold line at
            Runway 14/32.
            3.8.19.5.1.2. Taxiway Delta - from Taxiway Alpha to the hold line at Runway
            14/32.
         3.8.19.5.2. During periods of reduced visibility, the Control Tower cannot see
         taxiways so normal entry authorizations will apply.
         3.8.19.5.3. Transient Alert vehicles not performing "FOLLOW ME" services will
         adhere to current procedures for entering all CMA's.
     3.8.19.6. Jet Blast Areas:
         3.8.19.6.1. Vehicles with direct radio contact with the Control Tower will make
         certain no aircraft engines are running prior to entering Taxiway Alpha behind the
         parked aircraft. Maintain radio contact with the Control Tower until your vehicle
         exits the area.
         3.8.19.6.2. Vehicles without direct radio contact with the Control Tower will contact
         Airfield Management at 677-4192 to determine if aircraft engines are running before
         operating a vehicle behind parked aircraft. Use your control center to contact Airfield
         Management.
         3.8.19.6.3. During aircraft loading operations, a 25K or 60K loader may operate
         behind the aircraft when the aircraft engines are running at idle speed (based on
         weight of the K loader and low profile). The Air Terminal Operations Center
         (ATOC) will coordinate with the Command Post maintenance representative so
         ground support personnel conducting engine runs can direct and control throttle
         adjustment and vehicle traffic flow.
  3.8.20. Hot Spots.
DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013                                                                   25

     3.8.21.1. Use perimeter roads, in-field, or other airfield roads to access the airfield to the
     maximum extent possible to reduce non-essential vehicle traffic on the airfield.
     3.8.21.2. Vehicles needing to transit various areas, but not in the performance of
     assigned duties, are to use the perimeter road.
  3.8.22. Procedures to Limit Vehicle Traffic Crossing the Runway.
     3.8.22.1. Keep vehicular traffic in the CMA to an absolute minimum.
     3.8.22.2. Runway crossings are restricted to vehicles transporting hazardous materials,
     vehicles engaged in the continued operation of the airfield (snow plows, Airfield
     Management, mowers, etc.), K-loaders, tugs, responding emergency vehicles, and those
     vehicles that have been designated as too large to transit the perimeter road. Only
     mission essential vehicles will cross the runway. Note: When crossing a runway is
     required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
     3.8.22.3. Runway crossing for convenience or to save man-hours is prohibited. The
     primary route to the far side of the airfield, i.e. South Ramp, Hazardous Cargo Area or
     Christmas Tree, is perimeter road.
     3.8.22.4. Work details consisting of two or more persons will assign one individual to
     communicate specifically with the Control Tower using two-way radio communication
     for access to the CMA. This individual will not communicate with any other
     persons/units (over a radio) while the work detail is in a CMA. Radios are primarily the
     work detail unit's responsibility to provide. AM can provide a radio on a case by case
     basis.

        preposition on a suitable taxiway or in the Main Parking Area. Ambulances, if
        needed, will be requested by Fire Chief and will call tower to enter the Runways.
        3.8.24.1.3. Vehicles responding to emergencies will advise the Control Tower of
        their intentions. Crash/Fire Department vehicles already operating on controlled
        portions of the airfield when the emergency begins will advise the Control Tower of
        their intentions immediately.
        3.8.24.1.4. Control Tower will ensure responding emergency vehicles are given
        priority and will hold all other ground traffic that may interfere with emergency
        responses.
        3.8.24.1.5. During emergencies, response vehicles may use the most prudent route to
        their required location; however the Control Tower's approval is still required to enter
        the CMAs.
        3.8.24.1.6. Security Forces will remain at the Transient or North ramp and will not
        proceed onto the CMA unless requested by the Fire Chief. Security Forces will ask
        tower ground control for permission to proceed into the CMA.
     3.8.24.2. Airfield Drivers.
        3.8.24.2.1. During emergency situations (actual or simulated), vehicles or equipment
        will not be driven or parked in front of emergency vehicles. All vehicles will be at
        least 25 feet to the rear of emergency vehicles or parked upwind of the scene of the
        emergency. Permission to enter the emergency scene area must be obtained from the
        On-Scene Commander.

      restriction "R" for Ramp Access Only and expiration date. Note: If a sponsoring unit
      ADPM accomplishes the local training/briefing, forward an information copy to the
      DAFM.
      3.10.2.3. DAFM will maintain a copy of this training in accordance with Air Force RDS,
      Table 33-42, Rule 04.00.
      3.10.2.4. Contractors will have it written into their contracts that they will adhere to the
      provisions in DOVERAFBI 13-213 if operating on the airfield.
3.11. Privately Owned and Government Leased Vehicle Passes.
   3.11.1. POVs and Government Leased Vehicles access to the airfield is prohibited without
   an Airfield Vehicle Pass issued by Airfield Management. An example of a Government
   Leased Vehicle that requires a pass includes but is not limited to rental vehicles used in
   support of exercise team evaluators. The AFM or DAFM will approve and strictly control
   the passes to ensure the total number of passes. Current AF policy in AFI 13-213 and
   security directives are to discourage and restrict the use of POVs on the airfield to an
   absolute minimum.
   3.11.2. Airfield Vehicle Passes are controlled items and are issued by Airfield Management.
   3.11.3. Personnel whose duties require an airfield Vehicle Pass, annual or temporary, will
   complete the memorandum in Attachment 13. When completed, forward to the AFM or
   DAFM (436 OSS/OSAA or via email). The AFM/DAFM will review the request to ensure it
   meets AF guidance for approval. Personnel requesting vehicle passes must meet all training

   3.12.1. Issued for short-term use on the airfield, normally to contractors performing contract
   work on the airfield or to TDY personnel with a valid need to drive on the airfield. A limited
   number of passes are available to be signed out from AMOPS. Personnel requesting
   Temporary Airfield Vehicle Passes/Colored Cones must meet all training requirements of
   this instruction.
DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013                                                                    33


   3.12.2. Temporary Airfield Vehicle Passes/Colored Cones are normally valid for that day
   only. Members may request the pass to be valid for the duration of their stay with the
   approval of the AFM or DAFM.
   3.12.3. Temporary Airfield Vehicle Passes/Colored Cones issued in support of construction
   or special projects will be issued for the duration of the project, but limited to the
   construction site area or specific project.
   3.12.4. When a Temporary Airfield Vehicle Pass/Colored Cone is issued, AMOPS notifies
   the Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Desk with the cone number, a general description of the
   vehicle, the driver’s name, and the area it will be operated in.
   3.12.5. The cones design/color will be changed as necessary to ensure integrity.
   3.12.6. Cones are displayed on the driver's side roof of the vehicle so it is clearly visible
   prior to entering the airfield. Display the cone on your dashboard during periods of
   inclement weather (snow and ice coating on vehicle or high winds).
   3.12.7. After exiting the airfield, remove the cone from the roof or dashboard and secure it.
   Ensure cones are secured when not in use. Return the cone to AMOPS when you are
   finished using it.
3.13. Disabled Vehicles.
   3.13.1. If you are in the CMA, immediately inform the Control Tower of your location, the
   vehicle problem, and the estimated length the vehicle will be out of commission. Use every
   means to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. Contact the Mobile Maintenance section of
   Transportation through your control center. Do not leave the vehicle unattended. Control
   Tower will inform Airfield Management, who can respond.
   3.13.2. The vehicle operator will avoid blocking the runway, taxiway, or roadway. Make all
   efforts to remove defective vehicles from aircraft parking and movement areas to prevent
   interference with airfield operations.
   3.13.3. If vehicle is radio-equipped (security police, civil engineering, transportation, etc.),
   contact their control center and have the information relayed to Airfield Management (677-
   4192) and Tower.
   3.13.4. Stay with the vehicle and continue attempts to get the attention of the taxiing aircraft,
   if vehicle is not equipped with a radio.

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. See AFI 13-213, para 4.1.
4.2. Radio Techniques.
   4.2.1. See AFI 13-213, para 4.2.
4.3. Phraseology.
   4.3.1. See AFI 13-213, para 4.3. for additional guidance.
       4.3.1.1. Use the following guidelines and phraseology in communicating with the control
       tower:

Table 4.1. Communication With the Control Tower
Vehicle Operator                                "Dover Ground, Airfield One (use your call
                                                sign)."
Control Tower response                          "Airfield One, Dover Ground."
Vehicle Operator                                "Dover Ground, Airfield One is on taxiway
                                                Charlie. Request permission to cross runway
                                                14."
Control Tower response                          "Airfield One, proceed across runway 14 from
                                                taxiway Charlie, report when off."
Vehicle Operator                                "Airfield One proceeding across runway 14
                                                from taxiway Charlie, will report when off."
Vehicle Operator                                "Dover Ground, Airfield One is on taxiway
                                                Charlie. Request to cross runway 14."
Control Tower response                          "Airfield One, Hold short runway 14 at
                                                taxiway Charlie."
Vehicle Operator                                "Airfield One, Holding short runway 14 at
                                                taxiway Charlie."
Control Tower response                          "Airfield One, proceed across runway 14 from
                                                taxiway Charlie, report when off."
Vehicle Operator                                "Airfield One proceeding across runway 14
                                                from taxiway Charlie, will report when off."
Vehicle Operator                                "Airfield One is off runway 14, on taxiway
                                                Charlie."
Wait for the tower controller to respond        "Airfield One, roger."
DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013                                                              35


     4.3.1.2. The only word authorizing a vehicle to operate near, enter or cross any CMA is
     "PROCEED." The word "PROCEED" may be accompanied with other words or phrases.
     "ROGER" does not mean approval of a request.
     4.3.1.3. The driver will acknowledge receipt of tower’s instructions by repeating the
     instructions verbatim back to the tower. Under no circumstances will the driver proceed
     into the CMA if there is any uncertainty concerning the approval of the request.
     4.3.1.4. If the driver does not understand the Tower's instructions, ask the Tower to
     repeat it with "Say again". Tower will repeat and explain the instructions when time
     allows. There must not be any misunderstanding of the instructions issued. If the driver
     fails to repeat back the tower instructions verbatim after the second attempt, the tower
     controller will disapprove the request and advise the driver to contact Airfield
     Management.
     4.3.1.5. "HOLD" will indicate disapproval of a driver’s request. "HOLD" may be
     accompanied with other words or phrases; however, if this word is used, DO NOT
     ENTER the CMA.
     4.3.1.6. Once the Control Tower deems it safe to cross the runway they will authorize the
     crossing.
     4.3.1.7. Notify the Control Tower as soon as possible after exiting the CMA.
        4.3.1.7.1. When reporting off a CMA, the driver will ensure a response indicating the
        tower understands the vehicles have exited. Note: The control tower is often busy on
        other frequencies and may take some time to respond. Be patient and wait at least
        one full minute before calling again.
     4.3.1.8. Radio discipline.
        4.3.1.8.1. The phrase "CLEAR" must not be used by personnel or vehicle operators
        in the CMA or in communication with ATCT. Exception: Vehicle operators may
        reply "Loud and Clear" in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission quality
        or clarity.
        4.3.1.8.2. Keep all radio calls to a minimum and make each transmission, short and
        clear. Do not use the net for conversations between workers and work centers.
        4.3.1.8.3. Before speaking, ensure no one else is talking on the radio. Use the proper
        phraseology. Citizen's Band (CB) lingo and obscene, sarcastic, and superfluous
        language is not authorized.
     4.3.1.9. Vehicle Call Signs.
        4.3.1.9.1. Vehicle drivers operating in the CMA must use a call sign coordinated by
        the Airfield Manager (AFM). To avoid duplication units will coordinate with the
        AFM when wishing to change call signs, or when initiating new call signs. Only the
        AFM can approve vehicle call signs.
        4.3.1.9.2. Drivers will ensure the tower always uses their exact call sign during
        communications with the tower. Hearing the correct location of your vehicle but the
        wrong call sign or no call sign does not give approval for your request. For example,
        your vehicle's call sign is Airfield 1 and you are requesting to cross the runway from
 36                                                          DOVERAFBI13-213 12 APRIL 2013


              Taxiway Bravo. The tower gives approval to proceed across the runway from
              Taxiway Charlie, but does not state your call sign. You do not have approval to cross
              the runway until the tower states your call sign, even if it appears obvious you are the
              only vehicle at that location.
              4.3.1.9.3. Vehicle Call Signs are:
