(HILLAFB) AFI31-601_ HILLAFBSUP expands on the guidance provided by AFI31-601 and
applies to Air Force personnel and on-base DOD contractors performing services under the
terms of a properly executed contract and associated security agreement or similar document, as
determined by the installation commander. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,

Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication;

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access
to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the
DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a
Visitors Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction;
requiring contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated
information systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and
eliminating the requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report.
(NOTE: As used in this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it
negate the “security and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and
Procedures. The term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a
classified contract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R,
Information Security Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC is
at the last attachment.

(HILLAFB) This supplement incorporates all guidance contained in AFI 31-
601_HILLAFBSUP1, dated 10 December 2007 and implements the realignment of 75 SFS/S5X
to 75 ABW/IPD.

                                            Chapter 2

                                 SECURITY CLEARANCES

2.1. Facility Security Clearances (FCLs).
   2.1.1. Sponsoring FCLs. The contracting office (CO) is responsible for Facility Security
   Clearance (FCL) sponsorship. Defense Security Service is the authorizing agent for the
   FCL. DSS establishes and maintains all FCLs within the NISP. Also see DOD 5220.22-M,
   DOD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, AFPD 31-5, Personnel Security, and AFI 31-
   501, Personnel Security Program Management.
       2.1.1.1. To request an FCL sponsorship, write to the CSO with oversight responsibility
       for the sponsored facility.
       2.1.1.2. Give the full name for the sponsored facility, its physical and mailing address,
       telephone number, and a specific point of contact at the facility, when known. Give the
       full name, job title, and direct-dial telephone number of the Air Force sponsor.
       2.1.1.3. Establishing final FCLs through DSS may take several months. When
       circumstances do not permit such delays, sponsors may request an interim FCL through
       DSS.
   2.1.2. Sponsoring Interim FCLs. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential
   and Secret FCLs for interim clearances when possible. However, Air Force sponsorship of
   interim Top Secret FCLs must be justified on a case-specific basis in accordance with DOD
   5220.22-R. To request a Top Secret interim FCL, the CO prepares and routes sponsorships
   through command channels to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval. Each
   request must include these items:
   2.1.2. (HILLAFB) Requests for interim top-secret facility security clearances (FCL) are
   routed through 75 ABW/IPD.
       2.1.2.1. An explanation of why an interim Top Secret FCL would prevent a crucial
       delay in the award or performance of a classified contract.
       2.1.2.2. A listing giving the legal name of the facility being sponsored, its complete street
       address, and the names and positions of people who are applying for interim Top Secret
       access authorization.
       2.1.2.3. The address of the authorizing DSS.
   2.1.3. Establishing FCLs. DSS establishes and maintains FCL for contractor operations
   participating in the NISP.
       2.1.3.1. The ISPM with oversight responsibility for a cleared facility conducts required
       security reviews of the operation and assists the CSO, as necessary.
       2.1.3.2. The ISPM also conducts surveys and/or administrative inquiries pertaining to an
       on-base cleared facility as requested by the CS O and ensures contractor
       compliance with DOD 5220.22-M, NISPOM.
14                                         AFI31-601_HILLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


        2.1.3.3. Complete the survey by using the DD Form 374, Facility Security Clearance
        Survey Data Sheet, [DOD 5220.22-R], or an equivalent/acceptable automated format
        when conducting survey for an on-base cleared facility and forward a copy to the CSO.
        2.1.3.4. (Added-HILLAFB) The PCO will verify the FCL and authorized safeguarding
        capabilities through the Industrial Security Facilities Database on the Defense Security
        Service website at http://www.dss.mil for all DD Forms 254 received for review. The
        PCOs may contact 75 ABW/IPD for assistance in verification of the FCL.
2.2. Contractors with Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI).
     2.2.1. The CSO tells COs if a contractor performing on a classified contract has foreign
     ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) or whether it can be negated. Such influence might
     jeopardize the security of classified information held by the contractor.
     2.2.2. To resolve a FOCI problem, the CSO may establish a facility clearance that limits the
     level and type of classified information to which a FOCI contractor has access. Such
     restrictions might affect ongoing, pending and future classified contracts with the
     contractor. The CO should discuss this impact with the ISPM and servicing Foreign
     Disclosure office.
     2.2.3. The CO considers sponsoring a National Interest Determination (NID) after receiving
     written justification from the requesting program office or activity. This justification
     must address and explain how the FOCI contractor’s product or service is crucial or is the
     sole available source to the AF. If applicable, the program or activity must also provide a
     written explanation when contract cancellation would cause unacceptable delays for
     mission-essential weapons systems in the field or for support organizations.
        2.2.3.1. The requesting program office or activity is responsible for obtaining written
        release approval authority from the functional owner of the “proscribed information,”
        prior to submitting the NID to the contracting office. The program office or activity
        contacts the OCA for Top Secret (TS), NSA for Communications Security (COMSEC),
        DCI for Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), and DOE for Restricted Data
        (RD) or Formerly Restricted Data (FRD) to obtain release approval. (NOTE: All
        release determination request (NID) involving/for SCI must be submitted to HQ
        USAF/XOIIS for review, coordination and processing).
        2.2.3.2. The CO reviews, validates, and processes the NID and associated written
        approvals as follows:
            2.2.3.2.1. Forward request for NID related to special access program (SAP)
            performance through the appropriate SAP and command channels to the Deputy for
            Security and Investigative Programs, Office of the Administrative Assistant
            (SAF/AAZ), 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20330-1720 for approval.
            2.2.3.2.2. Forward request for non-SAP NID through command ISPM channels to
            HQ USAF/ XOS-FI for review and coordination. The NIDs are then be forwarded to
            SAF/AAZ for review and endorsement.
        2.2.3.3. SAF/AA endorse the NID and forwards it to the Office of the Under Secretary of

2.3. Contractor Personnel Security Clearances (PCLs).
   2.3.1. The Defense Security Service grants and maintains contractor PCLs. DSS also
   terminates contractor PCLs when the contractor no longer needs them or when a contractor
   employee is terminated. Administrative termination of a PCL carries no adverse
   implications regarding the employee or the contractor.
   2.3.2. The Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review, DOD Office of General
   Counsel, may suspend or revoke contractor PCLs following due process.
   2.3.3. DSS automatically processes all requests for Confidential or Secret PCLs for
   interim clearances, where possible.
   2.3.4. When a contractor employee who is not cleared for access to Top Secret
   information needs such access to perform on an Air Force classified contract, the employing
   contractor may sponsor the individual for an interim Top Secret PCL.
       2.3.4.1. The contractor should send requests to the CO who seeks concurrence of the
       system program office (SPO), system manager (SM), or program manager (PM).
       2.3.4.2. The contractor's request should document clearly why the individual needs an
       interim PCL, why contract requirements may not be satisfied with another
       individual more suitably cleared, and what the potential adverse impact would be on
       contract performance if an interim PCL were not granted. The contracting officer
       will deny contractor requests that do not meet these criteria.
       2.3.4.3. The CO routes the appropriate contractor’s request for interim Top Secret
       PCLs to the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander for approval.
       2.3.4.3. (HILLAFB) Send requests through 75 ABW/IPD.
       2.3.4.4. The CO sends favorably endorsed requests to the contractor, who then
       includes the endorsement in the personnel security questionnaire package for
       transmission to DSS for action. The CO promptly returns denied requests.
2.4. Processing Trustworthiness Determinations.
   2.4.1. When contractors require unescorted entry to restricted areas, access to sensitive
   unclassified information, access to government automated information systems (AIS) and/ or
   sensitive equipment, not involving access to classified information, the contractor’s personnel
   security questionnaire is processed by the sponsoring Air Force activity per DOD 5200.2-R
   and AFI 31-501.
   2.4.1. (HILLAFB) Process requests through the 75th Air Base Wing Personnel Security
   Program office (75 ABW/IPP). Facility Security Officers (FSOs) shall initiate security
   clearance actions and or investigations for their respective company.
2.5. Reciprocity. The CO, ISPM, and other installation security disciplines offices of primary
responsibility (OPRs) work together to resolve issues pertaining to reciprocity, as applicable to
inspections, surveys, audits, security clearances, security reviews, etc. Elevate reciprocity issues
to the next higher level of command when they can not be resolved locally.

   4.1.1. The AF program, project, activity and contracting office (CO) implements
   NISPOM, DOD 5200.1-R, and installation security requirements through contract
   documents. Only COs can sign, modify or negotiate changes to contracts.
   4.1.2. When a contractor requires access to classified information, the AF program, project or
   activity prepares the required DD Forms 254, DOD Contract Security Classification
   Specifications. The contractor should use the security requirements in this form to accurately
   estimate the cost of security measures. More detailed security requirements are specified in
   the statement of work (SOW), statement of objectives (SOO), performance work statement
   (PWS), Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA), etc.
   4.1.3. The responsible AF program, project, or activity will identify (by title, functional
   OPR, and approval date), the specific security classification guidance or guides (SCGs)
   applicable to the contract in Block #13 of the DD Form 254. The AF activity/program will
   provide copies of the SCG to the contractor prior to the contract commencing.
   4.1.4. (Added-HILLAFB) 75 ABW/IPD is responsible for ensuring all Hill AFB Security
   Classification Guides (SCG) are current and reflect accurate classification instructions. 75
   ABW/IPD will ensure all Hill AFB SCGs are reviewed at least once every 5 years.
4.2. DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specifications.
   4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
   contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
   the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under
   the terms of the solicitation/ contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form
   254 is forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
   classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements listed
   in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
   4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
   disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security
   guidance is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the
   requesting AF entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards
   an original DD Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
   4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected
   security disciplines and/or functional OPRs have reviewed and coordinated on the draft DD
   Form 254. This review and coordination action will be recorded/annotated in Block 13
   (office symbol, date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file
   and maintain a copy of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file.
   When SAPs are involved, coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office
   responsible for SAP security oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and
   SAPs unclassified, whenever possible.

   ABW/IPD, and all other offices identified above and in the DD Form 254, Block 17.
4.5. Visitor Group Security Agreement (VGSA).
   4.5.1. Execute a VGSA with all contractor operations located on Air Force installations
   that will require access to classified information. At the IC’s discretion, the VGSA execution
   requirement may be extended to contractors performing on contracts that require access to
   sensitive unclassified information, sensitive resources or frequent "entry" to the installation.
   4.5.2. The installation ISPM, security disciplines and functional OPRs work in concert with
   the AF program, project and/or activity to develop the Visitor Group Security Agreement
   (VGSA) requirements. The requirement to execute a VGSA is in addition to preparing the
   DD Form 254.
   4.5.3. The VGSA must address those security requirements and/or procedures that are
   unique to the installation for which the contractor will be held contractually liable. VGSAs
   need only address those areas of security, safeguarding and/or protection that have not been
   covered elsewhere within the contract, DD Form 254, SOW, SOO, PWS, etc.
   4.5.4. The ISPM is the technical OPR for development and preparation of the VGSA. For
   coordination purposes, the ISPM routes the VGSA to all installation security discipline
   OPRs and/or other agencies lending expertise to the contractual security requirements.
   4.5.5. The ISPM signs the VGSA on behalf of the installation commander. The ISPM

                                       SAFEGUARDING

5.1. Designation of On-Base Visitor Groups. The IC works in concert with the Air Force
activity, CO and ISPM to determine the designation of an on-base visitor group (cleared
facility, integrated visitor group or intermittent visitor).
5.2. Integrated Visitor Group.
     5.2.1. Integrated visitor groups operate in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R and
     supplemental guidance thereto. They handle, generate, process, and store classified
     information per AF guidance. The exception being, their “access” is limited to “need-to-
     know” contract-specific classified performance information.
     5.2.2. The AF must stipulate the specific DOD 5200.1-R and supplemental guidance, which
     is applicable under the terms of the executed VGSA.
     5.2.3. The guidance conveyed to on-base contractor operation via the VGSA is limited to
     the AF installation and the AF solicitation/contract which it was executed to support. All
     other NISPOM mandated security requirements not addressed or specifically exempted by
     the executed VGSA or other contracting document must be implemented by the contractor.
     5.2.4. The VGSA must clearly reflect that the Air Force is accountable for and controls all
     classified information. Integrated contractor visitor groups are prohibited from establishing
     separate classified information controls. (NOTE: Integrated visitor group personnel can not
     be appointed as primary or alternate security managers for AF activities. However, they can
     be required (via the VGSA) to provide other security program support, under AF
     direction, such as, conducting end-of-day security checks, security training/briefings, etc.).
5.3. Cleared Facility. An on-base cleared facility operates under the security mandates and
requirements of the NISPOM. See AFPD 31-6 for further guidance regarding their
establishment.
5.4. Intermittent Visitors. Intermittent visitors may operate under the security requirements of
the NISPOM or the installation security program. The IC makes this determination after
considering the intermittent visitor’s relationship and interface with the AF activity and/or
installation.
5.5. On-Base Contract Completion or Termination. The program, project or AF activity will
notify the ISPM in writing when the contractual services and/or performance has been completed
or terminated.
5.5. (HILLAFB) The program official will furnish 75 ABW/IPD written notification when
contract performance has been completed or terminated.

                                           Chapter 6

            OVERSIGHT REVIEWS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Conducting Industrial Security Reviews (SRs).
   6.1.1. Industrial Security Reviews. The ISPM conduct security reviews (SRs) of on-base
   cleared facilities that performs classified work on Air Force installations. Such SRs evaluate
   the contractor’s compliance with contract specific-security requirements and pertinent
   DOD and Air Force security instructions.
   6.1.2. Scheduling Industrial Security Reviews. Conduct (SRs) of on-base cleared facilities
   per DOD 5220.22-M and DOD 5220.22-R. Unless conducting an unannounced security
   review on a cleared facility, provide contractor activity’s management 30 days advanced
   written notification.
   6.1.3. Performing Industrial Security Reviews. ISPMs coordinate with other Air Force
   security discipline OPRs such as; Operations Security (OPSEC), Computer Security
   (COMPUSEC) and Communications Security (COMSEC), to provide specialized
   expertise when necessary to complete a security review. The SR is complete when all
   security requirements imposed under the terms of the contract have been evaluated.
      6.1.3.1. When SRs are conducted for cleared facilities, provide copies of completed
      SR report, with all related correspondence, to the CSO. Use DSS’ automated format to
      document the results of the SR. Contact HQ USAF/XOS-FI to obtain a copy of the
      automated DSS format.
      6.1.3.2. Facility security clearance (FCL) files must contain all key documentation
      prescribed by DOD 5220.22-R and the CSO, to include DD Form 254 and related
      contract security requirement documents.
   6.1.4. Post-Industrial Security Review Requirements.
      6.1.4.1. Send a letter/report to senior management officials of the cleared facility within
      10 days of completing the security review. The letter should:
      6.1.4.2. Confirm the contractor's security status as discussed during the exit interview.
      6.1.4.3. List any deficiencies requiring corrective action.
      6.1.4.4. Within 30 days, request written confirmation on the status of any open major
      discrepancy (condition which resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in the
      loss or compromise of classified information).
      6.1.4.5. The ISPM may extend the time for corrective action if required changes are
      significant and the contractor is making a conscientious effort to resolve problems
      expeditiously.
   6.1.5. Unsatisfactory Industrial Security Reviews.
      6.1.5.1. The ISPM assigns an on-base cleared facility an unsatisfactory SR rating:
          6.1.5.1.1. To a cleared facility visitor groups if it fails to satisfactorily perform its
          contractual security responsibilities.
22                                          AFI31-601_HILLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009


            6.1.5.1.2. When major failures in the contractor's security program have resulted in
            or could reasonably be expected to result in the loss or compromise of classified
            information.
            6.1.5.1.3. When the contractor is clearly responsible for the security problems cited
            during a security review.
            6.1.5.1.4. The ISPM coordinates with the CSO and contracting officer when
            assigning an unsatisfactory SR rating for an on-base cleared facility.
            6.1.5.1.5. The home office facility (HOF) for the cleared facility is ultimately
            responsible for meeting contract security requirements. When assigning an
            unsatisfactory SR rating, the ISPM notifies the HOF immediately through the
            contracting office and requests prompt and complete corrective action. If the HOF
            fails to take corrective action, its security clearance may be affected. The servicing
            security activity should notify the HOF’s CSO if problems continue.
     6.1.6. Invalidating the Facility Security Clearance (FCL).
        6.1.6.1. The CSO notifies the contracting officers in writing when the FCL of a
        contractor under their jurisdiction is invalidated.
        6.1.6.2. A contractor who fails to correct security deficiencies that subsequently results
        in invalidation may lose its FCL.
        6.1.6.3. Although most contractors resolve invalidations promptly, contractors with
        foreign owned, controlled, or influence (FOCI) invalidations may have to wait for many
        months. Where FOCI is evident, the facility clearance may remain invalidated for more
        than a year while methods to resolve the FOCI are considered, approved, and
        implemented. The FCL is invalidated while DSS negotiates voting trusts, proxy
        agreements, or special agreements with foreign interests.
        6.1.6.4. Document SR for an on-base cleared facility as required by the DOD 5220.22-
        M, DOD 5220.22-R, and CSO guidance. Keep copies of completed SR reports with pre-
        security review letter and completed post-review correspondence for 2 years from the
        date of the most recent SR.
        6.1.6.5. Maintain copies of self-inspection reports or reviews for 2 years from date of
        the most recent self-inspection.
6.2. Conducting Information Security Program Reviews.
     6.2.1. Information Security Program Reviews. On-base integrated visitor groups will be
     evaluated and conduct self-inspections collectively with the AF activity per DOD 5200.1-
     R and AFI 31-401, guidance. Integrated visitor groups will not be subjected to the SR
     requirements of the NISPOM. The installation prescribes the report for documenting
     program reviews.
     6.2.2. Scheduling Information Security Program Reviews. Schedule program reviews
     per DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 guidance.
     6.2.3. The AF activity is responsible for ensuring its integrated visitor group implement and
     comply with DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 requirements.

     6.2.4.5. Copies of last two self-inspections reports. The annual program review can be
     used to substitute for one of the self-inspections. (NOTE: The maintenance of self-
     inspection reports is optional for ISPMs).
     6.2.4.6. (DELETED)
  6.2.5. For visitor groups, the ISPM briefs key Air Force and designated visitor group
  managers on the status of the unit’s security program. Provide both parties a copy of the
  PR report and any other related assessment, survey or staff assistance visit (SAV) report.
  Do not furnish copies of these reports to the CSO.
     6.2.5.1. When warranted, AF commanders notify the contractor’s home office facility
     (HOF), in writing, through the contracting office of major security program deficiencies
     or non-compliance with the terms of the VGSA.
  6.2.6. The ISPM will maintain files/records on each on-base integrated visitor group in
  accordance with paragraph 6.2.4, this publication.
     6.2.6.1. (Added-HILLAFB) 75 ABW/IPD will maintain a copy of the required
     files/records for NISPOM visitor groups, with the exception of the self-inspection.
     However, the visitor group’s self-inspection program will be evaluated during industrial
     security program reviews and any discrepancies will be documented in the review
     memorandum.

Terms
Classified Contract—Any contract that requires or will require access to classified
information by the contractor or the employees in the performance of the contract. A contract
may be classified even though the contract document itself is not classified.
Cleared Facility—A non-government owned and operated industrial, educational, commercial,
or other facility for which DOD has made an administrative determination (from a security
viewpoint) that the entity is eligible for and requires access to classified information of a
certain category (Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret).
Cognizant Security Office—The designated Department of Defense (DOD) agency
responsible for industrial security program administration. The Secretary of Defense
(SECDEF) has designated the Defense Security Service (DSS) to perform this function. The
Director of DSS has further delegated this responsibility downward within the agency. DSS
Regional Directors provide industrial security administration for DOD contractor facilities
located within their respective geographical area. One exception, for which ISPM has
responsible, is DOD contractors on Air Force installation who have been designated as “visitor
groups.” When used, the language “Cognizant Security Office” (CSO), always refers to DSS or
an entity thereof.
Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)—This AF entity implements and
administers the installation’s information, personnel and industrial security programs. The
ISPM is responsible for supervising and overseeing on-base contractor’s security programs
and/or operations.
Installation—An installation is an area in which the Air Force holds a real property interest
or real property over which the Air Force has jurdisdiction by agreement with a foreign
government or by right of occupation. The term installation also includes all auxiliary off-base or
detached installations under the jurisdiction of the commander of the primary installation.
Integrated Visitor Groups—An on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that
requires access to classified information and operates under the direct control/supervision of the
Air Force. The integrated visitor group is authorized to function in accordance with DOD
5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 per the VGSA. The Air Force maintains control of all classified and
provides day-to-day supervision over this type of contractor operation. It basically differs from
the on-base cleared facility because of its close interaction and/or relationship with the AF
organization it supports.
Interim Facility Security Clearances (Interim FCL)—Interim FCL are temporary, limited
company security clearances established by the DSS. It does not permit access to Restricted
Data, COMSEC, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), SCI, SAP, or Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency classified Information. However, if an interim Top Secret FCL is
issued, the contractor may access such information at the level of Secret and Confidential.
Interim FCLs may not be appropriate for all contractual needs and are not available for all
sponsored companies.
Intermittent Visitor—A contractor or company, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that require
“entry” to an Air Force installation for brief periods of time on a scheduled or on call basis
to perform contractual duties. An intermittent visitor’s presence on an installation usually does
not exceed 90 consecutive days.
AFI31-601_HILLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2009                                                      33


Invalidation—A condition at a cleared facility caused by changed conditions or
performance under which the facility may no longer be eligible for an FCL unless the facility
promptly initiates appropriate corrective actions.
Major Discrepancy—A condition, which resulted in or could reasonably be, expected to
result in the loss or compromise of classified information.
On—Base Cleared Facility—An on-base contractor operation cleared under the provisions of
the NISP and established at the discretion of the IC per DOD 5220.22-R. These entities
operate under NISPOM guidance and the ISPM has been designated by the IC to provide
security oversight.
Reciprocity—A reciprocal condition, relationship, mutual or cooperative agreement,
between two or more agencies, components, or departments agreeing to recognize and accept
the efforts (requirements, procedures, actions, etc.) of the other in exchange for the same
compensation.
Visitor Group—Any on-base contractor operation, cleared per the NISP or ISR, that requires
access to classified information. The installation commander determines their “official” on-
base designation. (NOTE: All on-base contractor operations are considered “visitor groups,” per
this AFI. The IC assesses and evaluates the working relationship and interactions between the
visitor group and AF activity to determining their “official” designation, i.e., cleared
facility, integrated visitor group or intermittent visitor).
Visitor Group Security Agreement—A documented and legally binding contractual
agreement between an Air Force activity and a DOD contractor whereby the contractor
commits to complying with, rendering or performing specific security tasks or functions for
compensation. The VGSA attest to and certifies the existence of such an agreement, including
applicable changes and amendments, attachments, supplements and exhibits.

 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
 This revision incorporates Interim Change 2005-1 and aligns this guidance with the revised Air
 Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-6, Industrial Security. Revisions include renumbering the
 chapters; updating office symbols and publication references; requiring the identification of
 government information and sensitive resources that require protection in classified contract
 documents; mandating the integration of on-base contractor operations into the installation
 information security program per AFPD 31-6; requiring the execution of a security agreement
 with contractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations and require access
 to classified and gives installation commanders the discretionary authority to also require the
 execution of an security agreement with on-base contractors that require access to sensitive
 unclassified information or frequent "entry" to the installation; clarifying responsibilities and
 procedures for processing National Interest Determinations (NIDs); requiring a review of the
 DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, at two year intervals; requiring
 subcontractors that perform contractual services on Air Force installations to execute a Visitors
 Group Security Agreement (VGSA) when execution is required per this instruction; requiring
 contractors that use government information technology (IT) and automated information
 systems (AISs) to undergo a background investigation prior to IT usage; and eliminating the
 requirement to use the DD Form 696, Industrial Security Inspection Report. (NOTE: As used in
 this publication, the term “security review” is not synonymous nor does it negate the “security
 and policy review” requirement of AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. The
 term "sensitive unclassified information" refers to information identified in a classified
 contract that has been marked "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" per DOD 5200.1-R,
 Information Security Program, and is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information
 Act (FOIA)). A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition. The entire text of the IC
 is at the last attachment.

 4.2.1. The AF program, project or activity prepares a draft DD Form 254 for each classified
 contract. When drafting the DD Form 254s, the program, project or activity will consult with
 the CO, ISPM and other installation security discipline or functional OPRs affected under the
 terms of the solicitation/contract to ensure accuracy. Once drafted, the draft DD Form 254 is
 forwarded to the CO for processing. The contractor should use the security
 classification/declassification specifications and other contractual security requirements listed
 in the DD Form 254 to accurately estimate the cost of security.
 4.2.2. The CO reviews and coordinates the draft DD Form 254 with all affected security
 disciplines and functionals, as appropriate. This action ensures that approved security guidance
 is being provided to the contractor. Once the review has been completed, the requesting AF
 entity/activity incorporates the necessary changes and prepares and forwards an original DD
 Form 254 to the CO for subsequent approval and signing.
 4.2.3. Prior to signing the original DD Form 254, the CO will verify that all affected security

date and initial’s of reviewer) of the draft DD Form 254. The CO will file and maintain a copy
of the annotated draft DD Form 254 in the respective contract file. When SAPs are involved,
coordinate draft and original DD Form 254 with the office responsible for SAP security
oversight. Keep DD Form 254 for collateral programs and SAPs unclassified, whenever
possible.
4.3.1. The ISPM reviews the draft and original DD Form 254 to ensure that the security
classification guidance is accurate, approved and appropriate. However, the ISPM only
