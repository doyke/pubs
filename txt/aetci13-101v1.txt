                                            Chapter 1

                                  POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction. The purpose of this instruction is to provide the basic guidelines units use to
train AETC battle management personnel. The objective is to set training policy, management
criteria, and administrative practices, to achieve and maintain Basic Mission Capable (BMC),
positional instructor (PI) status, or a certification (either higher headquarters [HHQ] established
or squadron unique). Basic Qualified (BQ) refers to the qualification status of an individual who
has successfully completed IQT and an INIT QUAL. BMC refers to the mission status of an
individual, who has satisfactorily completed Initial Qualification Training (IQT) and Battle
Management Instructor Training (BMIT), but does not maintain Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
status.
1.2. Training Concepts, Policies, and Requirements.
   1.2.1. Training Concepts. Major Commands (MAJCOM) design unit training programs and
   ensure units implement them to achieve the highest degree of mission capability possible
   with available resources. Unit commanders ensure operations personnel are trained to the
   maximum level of proficiency to meet training mission requirements. Units will schedule all
   training to attain and maintain continuity and will tailor training requirements (TR) to meet
   individual proficiency and experience. (T-2) TRs are expressed in terms of missions and
   events.
       1.2.1.1. Training consists of academic and positional training in both live and simulated
       environments.
       1.2.1.2. Training culminates in either a qualification or a certification status for an
       individual. Although similar, there are stipulations associated with each status that
       differentiate between the two, primary of which is Stan/Eval determines qualification
       status. They are not normally involved with certification status. However, some
       certifications, such as live aerial refueling, may be evaluated by Stan/Eval as part of
       recurring evaluations if that event is observed during the course of the evaluation. Award
       of a qualification status requires:
           1.2.1.2.1. Enrollment and completion of a formal HHQ syllabus. (T-2)
           1.2.1.2.2. An evaluation administered by Stan/Eval and subsequent AF Form 8,
           Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. (AF Form 8 is prescribed in AFI 11-202,
           Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.) (T-2) Refer to this
           publication and AETCI 13-101 Volume 2, Battle Management Standardization and
           Evaluation, for guidance on filling out this form.)
           1.2.1.2.3. Recurring evaluations. (T-2)
           1.2.1.2.4. Lookback fulfillment to ensure currency, if applicable. (T-2) Note:
           Lookback is associated with BQ, not PI requirements.
       1.2.1.3. Certification requirements are dependent upon whether the certification is HHQ
       established or is a squadron-unique function. These requirements are discussed in
       Chapter 5.
6                                                               AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


       1.2.1.4. The training program is divided into four sections: Initial Qualification Training
       (IQT), Continuation Training (CT), Battle Management Instructor Training (BMIT), and
       certification training.
           1.2.1.4.1. IQT provides a general overview of the unit, mission, local environment,
           and the necessary training to attain BQ. Refresher training for individuals transferring
           into the unit with a current like system qualification is also considered as part of IQT.
           Requirements for these individuals are detailed in paragraph 1.4.
           1.2.1.4.2. CT consists of training to maintain or increase proficiency.
           1.2.1.4.3. BMIT qualifies personnel as battle management formal school instructors
           who will perform academic, simulator, and (or) live mission instruction. A
           qualification or certification status is given to each individual upon the successful
           completion of IQT and (or) BMIT.
           1.2.1.4.4. Certification is the required training to perform a specific role, mission,
           job, etc., for which no qualification training program exists (e.g. aerial refueling).
           Certifications are normally associated with squadron-unique requirements but may be
           associated with HHQ requirements.
    1.2.2. Training Policies:
       1.2.2.1. Commanders may adjust the training time or remove personnel from training
       due to medical disqualification (including duties not including controlling [DNIC]),
       emergency leave, or administrative action IAW applicable syllabus directives.
       1.2.2.2. Commanders may enter newly assigned personnel awaiting a security clearance
       into IQT, BMIT, or a squadron certification training program but may not give training
       that involves classified information.
       1.2.2.3. Individuals not performing duties in the operations section for reasons of
       Uniform Code of Military Justice prosecution or conviction, drug abuse, conscientious
       objector status, or loss of a security clearance, will not be entered into or continued in
       training. (T-1)
       1.2.2.4. Air Battle Managers (ABM) must maintain a class III flight physical profile
       according to AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. Weapons Directors
       (WD), Weapons Technicians (WT), Surveillance Technicians (ST), Electronic Protection
       Technicians (EPT), Interface Control Technicians (ICT) and civil service (General
       Schedule [GS]) performing live operations will maintain, as a minimum, a ground based
       aircraft controller profile according to AFI 48-123. (T-1)
       1.2.2.5. Unit commanders may multi-qualify personnel who demonstrate the knowledge
       and proficiency required to maintain multiple duty positions or systems.
       1.2.2.6. ABM and WD personnel with less than two years in the career field (as a 1C5D
       for WDs) will be placed in a formal apprentice training program approved by HQ
       AETC/A3ZA. (T-2) As a minimum, all “junior” ABM/WDs (JABM/JWD) will be BQ
       qualified as part of their formal training program. (T-2) JABM/JWDs will not perform
       instructor duties, to include academic platform instruction, prior to BQ (in addition to
       appropriate tracks of BMIT). (T-2) Aerial Refueling (AR) certification is not a
       requirement; however it is recommended.
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                       7


       1.2.2.7. (N/A for 173 OSS/C2) As a minimum, either the Squadron Commander (CC)
       or Operations Officer (DO) will be BQ. (T-2) Both will be Positional Instructor (PI)
       qualified (live PI preferred). (T-2) Either the CC or DO will be a certified SEE. (T-2)
   1.2.3. Training Requirements:
       1.2.3.1. This instruction establishes the minimum training requirements that unit
       commanders use to ensure operations personnel are adequately trained during IQT,
       BMIT, and CT. Assigned personnel will have varying backgrounds and different levels of
       experience and proficiency. Therefore, the unit Chief of Training (COT)/Operations
       Training Superintendent (OTS) ensures the individual’s training records and
       accomplishments are reviewed prior to entry into training, and ensures the course of
       training established by the DO is completed. (T-2) Reference throughout this publication
       to COT implies either COT or OTS dependent on unit manning structure.
       1.2.3.2. The unit DO manages trainee Temporary Duty (TDY) and leaves, so these
       absences will not hamper the trainee’s progression. (T-2) This is particularly critical for
       TDY or leave during IQT training periods.
       1.2.3.3. Personnel TDY for 30 consecutive days (two Unit Training Assemblies [UTA])
       or more to locations where IQT or CT is available will accomplish training. (T-2)
       1.2.3.4. COTs will use the HQ AETC approved IQT syllabus to accomplish academic
       and positional IQT. (T-2)
       1.2.3.5. COTs, in coordination with DOs, will strive for early identification of
       individuals who cannot satisfactorily accomplish IQT requirements or cannot perform or
       meet the unit training mission requirements. (T-2)
       1.2.3.6. Live training requirements for inexperienced and experienced individuals are
       discussed in Chapter 3.
       1.2.3.7. BQ prerequisites. Prior to qualification, each trainee must:
           1.2.3.7.1. Complete an AETC formal battle management course (AFSC awarding).
           (T-1)
           1.2.3.7.2. Complete IQT. (T-1)
           1.2.3.7.3. Successfully complete proficiency evaluations according to this instruction
           and AETCI 13-101, Volume 2, Battle Management Standardization and Evaluation
           Program. (T-2)
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. HQ AETC/A3V is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction. HQ
   AETC/A3V will:
       1.3.1.1. Provide command guidance and monitor the overall training program.
       1.3.1.2. Provide command assistance in the resolution of major training problems and
       coordinate with agencies both internal and external to the command for training
       equipment.

   1.3.6. (N/A for 173 OSS/C2) Units will generate timely and accurate training reports. (T-2)
   This should include, but not be limited to, academic and/or positional Letter of Xs, and
   training deficiencies. Although updates to Letter of Xs are IAW Chapter 4, monthly
   submission of Letter of Xs to HQ is not required; however, they must be available on request.
   Submit training deficiencies on an as needed basis and update quarterly IAW paragraph
   3.6.3. (T-2)
1.4. Transfers.
   1.4.1. The squadron COT will ensure the training records of inbound individuals are
   reviewed to determine experience, qualifications, and currency of training. The COT records
   the review on AF Form 4141. (T-2) Based on this review, they will recommend to the
   squadron DO a suggested training plan to meet the unit’s mission under the following
   allowances (T-2):
       1.4.1.1. If the individual is qualified in like battle management systems, they may
       transfer their qualification from another MAJCOM to AETC (or within AETC).
       1.4.1.2. Any individual who was previously qualified in the unit’s weapon system, has
       been unqualified in that system for less than 48 months, but is current and qualified to
       perform weapons/surveillance crew duties in another system, may enter requalification
       training. Prior to determining the requalification training plan for the individual, the unit
       will administer an academic assessment test and a positional assessment in addition to the
       DO and COT reviewing the individual’s records. The results of these assessments will
       determine the appropriate amount of training in each academic and positional area. The
       quantity of training will not exceed that allowed in IQT.
       1.4.1.3. The individual may be placed in a formal IQT program, proficiency advanced or
       complete IQT in its entirety.
1.5. Training Extensions.
   1.5.1. Course lengths vary depending on the applicable syllabus or formal training plan.
   Training extensions are as specified in the appropriate syllabus or formal training plan. If not
   specified, squadron commanders may grant a 30-day extension if required.
   1.5.2. Forward recommendations for subsequent training extensions through channels to
   AETC/A3Z, via E-mail or message. (T-2)
1.6. Waivers.
   1.6.1. Policy and procedures are enacted to provide for quality and consistency in training
   and evaluation. Occasionally, unique circumstances may warrant special consideration and
   possible waiver of policy provisions. At the same time, because it is important to preserve
   fidelity of training, evaluation, and policy implementation throughout the command, a
   process must be established for review of proposed waivers. The authorities to waive
   wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-
   3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
   Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.
   Waivers that change the intent of the policy outlined in this instruction are not authorized
   without AETC/A2/3/10 (T-2) approval. Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs
10                                                           AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


  (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in
  this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances.
  1.6.2. AETC units will coordinate waivers through AETC/A3V or AETC/A3Z as
  appropriate. Squadron commanders will submit all T-2 waiver requests through command
  channels in electronic format. Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual
  or unit cannot comply with requirements. AETC/A3Z will send a copy of all approved
  individual personnel waivers to HQ AETC/A3V and NGB/A3Y, as required, for file. Units
  will file a copy of approved written waivers to this volume according to AFI 33-360,
  Publications and Forms Management.
  1.6.3. The OG/CC of local supplements will handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance.

                                           Chapter 2

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines training for personnel, including those individuals assigned
to a MAJCOM HQ staff, who maintain BQ status. IQT prepares the individual for live mission
qualification in a duty position for which he/she is being trained. (NOTE: In lieu of a COT, the
607 ACS may use a Formal Training branch chief for students attending IQT with follow-on
orders to a gaining unit. The term COT will apply to both functions for simplicity in the
document). COTs ensure trainees meet the minimum requirements outlined in the IQT syllabus.
COTs develop local training materials as indicated in the syllabus. COTs may use proficiency
advancement as outlined in the syllabuses to advance personnel through the blocks of training.
2.2. Entry. The Squadron DO and COT will review the records of newly assigned permanent
party personnel and ensure an appropriate course of training is established based on the
individual’s background and experience. (T-2) The COT records the review on AF Form 4141.
(T-3) The squadron DO identifies permanent party individuals for entry into IQT based on unit
training mission requirements and available resources (sorties). (T-2) Permanent party
individuals not selected for immediate entry into IQT will be enrolled into BMIT. (T-2) (NOTE:
173 OSS/C2 Weapons Technicians that do not perform battle management instruction are
excluded from BMIT requirements). Regardless of which program is initiated, training will
commence NLT 45 calendar days (3 UTAs) after the permanent party member reports to the unit
(or completes First Term Airmen Course if required). (T-3) The commander must request
exceptions for permanent party individuals in writing through channels to applicable parent OG
for approval. (T-3)The DO will ensure the COT provides the appropriate amount of training in
each academic and positional area. (T-2) The COT uses the AETC-approved syllabuses to
conduct IQT. (T-2) Non-permanent party students, to include individuals enrolled in an IQT
course that exceed TDY limitations, but with follow-on orders to a gaining unit, will be
processed IAW AETCI 36-2205 Volume 9, “Formal Flying Training Administration and
Management –Battle Management Training”. (T-2)
2.3. Training Progression. Trainee normal progression is defined as meeting the performance
standards for each unit or block of training as specified in the applicable IQT syllabus on the
appropriate day of training. A trainee must complete all training objectives in each unit or block
of the syllabus in order to progress to the next unit or block. For non-permanent party, the COT
records individual training accomplishments (see chapter 6 of this instruction and AETCI 36-
2205 Volume 9), to monitor the trainee’s progress. (T-2)
   2.3.1. NLT the syllabus specified timeline, one of the following occurs (T-2):
       2.3.1.1. The trainee does not complete IQT requirements and is not certified ready for
       INIT QUAL by the COT.
       2.3.1.2. The trainee completes IQT requirements, is certified ready for INIT QUAL by
       the COT, and is released to Stan/Eval.
           2.3.1.2.1. Upon completion of the last block of IQT, the COT enters the trainee in a
           formal review period to prepare for the Stan/Eval INIT QUAL. To accomplish this,
           the COT administers a 50-question IQT nongraded written test and a nongraded
           positional review. (T-2) The test is composed of 40 questions drawn from the training
 12                                                             AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


          materials and ten unit local procedures questions, except for the 607 ACS. 607 ACS
          tests will consist of 85 questions from the ACC CRC MQF and 10 questions from the
          local procedures MQF, and 5 questions from the AETC MQF. The test is correctable
          to 100 percent. The positional pre-evaluation will include a mission/event brief and
          debrief given by the IQT student, and an instructor debrief. (T-3)The COT will
          maintain two tests that are different than the tests maintained by Stan/Eval. (T-3) The
          COT administers the test NLT the syllabus-directed timeline. (T-3)
          2.3.1.2.2. The COT certifies on AF Form 4141 that the trainee has completed IQT
          and releases the trainee to Stan/Eval for the INIT QUAL according to AETCI 13-101
          Volume 2. Upon successful completion of the INIT QUAL, individuals are
          designated BQ and placed into CT.(T-2)
       2.3.1.3. Training extensions or waivers are as specified in the appropriate syllabus or
       formal training plan. Individuals failing an elimination check will be entered into the
       commander’s review process as prescribed by the syllabus and AETCI 36-2205, Formal
       Flying Training Administration and Management Volumes 1 and 9. .(T-2)
   2.3.2. Once released to Stan/Eval, one of the following occurs (T-2):
       2.3.2.1. The trainee successfully completes an INIT QUAL and is entered into CT.
       2.3.2.2. The trainee fails INIT QUAL and is referred to the unit commander who may
       grant a 30 calendar day (2 UTAs) extended training period, or take appropriate
       administrative action according to AFI 11-402, or AFI 36-2101. Upon completion of the
       training period, the trainee will be released back to Stan/Eval for a RECHECK. If the
       trainee successfully completes the RECHECK, the individual is entered into CT. If the
       trainee fails the RECHECK, the trainee is referred to the unit commander for
       administrative action according to AFI 11-402 or AFI 36-2101.
   2.3.3. The COT will ensure that additional training identified during the INIT QUAL or
   RECHECK is accomplished within 30 days (2 UTAs). Annotate qualification on AF Form 8.
   (T-2)
2.4. Multiqualified/Certified Personnel.
   2.4.1. Personnel who are BMC/BQ in a position and are selected to train in another position
   must complete IQT requirements and upgrade requirements according to this chapter (T-2).
   Time limitations, forms, and certification for completion of training are according to this
   chapter and the appropriate syllabus or formal training program (to include proficiency
   advancement). The squadron DO identifies the duty positions and weapon system
   qualifications of multiqualified personnel on AF Form 4141(T-3). A separate AF Form 4142
   must be maintained for each duty position an individual is qualified to perform. (T-3)
   2.4.2. The intent of multisystem certification training is to train the individual on a different
   system, i.e. equipment characteristics and performance. Repeating previous training (and
   subsequent evaluation) on individual unit profiles/duties is not required. However,
   individuals who are multisystem certified may be evaluated on both systems (Example- the
   QUAL portion of their evaluation on one system and the positional instructor evaluation on
   the second system).
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                    13


2.5. AR Certification. AWOs/WDs selected to enter AR upgrade training will complete the
squadron AR training program within 60 calendar days (3 UTAs). (T-3) TRs and certifications
are according to the SQ/CC approved AR training plan. WTs do not require AR certification in
order to participate in AR missions.
2.6. Like System. Like systems fall into two categories: same equipment but different units
(e.g. MCS qualified individuals at one unit PCS’ing to an AETC unit), and individuals qualified
on control platforms identified as “like systems” (e.g. those based off of TDF architecture).
AETC units will adhere to the following concerning TDY personnel: Squadron COTs, in
conjunction with SQ/DO will review individual training folders to verify qualifications and any
difference training required. (T-2) After review, the squadron will maintain as a minimum,
copies of the current Form 8, AF Form 1042, and a certification memorandum signed by SQ/DO.
(T-3) NOTE: Currencies must be renewed within six months. Certifications that have not been
used for six months require OTO to validate that the individual is still competent.
   2.6.1. Individuals in TDY status to another like unit to perform operational duties need only
   complete gaining MAJCOM or unit-directed training and Stan/Eval requirements prior to
   performing BMC duties unsupervised. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) duties require upgrade
   by gaining unit.

                      CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT) FOR BMC

3.1. Purpose. CT provides battle management personnel with the volume, frequency, and mix
of academic and positional training necessary to maintain proficiency in their assigned duty
position or system. CT is composed of annual mission or event requirements, lookback mission
or event requirements, and academics.
   3.1.1. The unit DO will ensure there is sufficient academic instruction and positional training
   for crew members to maintain BMC. (T-2)
   3.1.2. The COT records accomplishment of academic and positional TRs and instructor or
   Stan/Eval-monitored accomplishments on AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training
   Record. (AF Form 4142 is prescribed in AFI 13-1CRC, Volume 1. (T-3) Refer to that
   publication and Chapter 6 of this publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
3.2. Frequency. CT positional TRs are completed on an annual basis supported by 3-month
sliding window lookback periods. (T-2) Annual requirements begin 1 October. Personnel who
become BQ after the beginning of the annual training period accomplish a prorated share of the
TRs for the remainder of the period beginning with the first day of the following month.
   3.2.1. Annual Currency (Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.). Annual currency requirements should
   ensure the average crew member maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given event.
   Annual currency requirements are expressed in TRs, by mission.
       3.2.1.1. If an individual fails to meet annual TRs, to include annual academics, the DO
       will regress that individual to non-basic mission capable (N-BMC) status for up to 60
       days. (T-2) N-BMC is used primarily to identify a temporary loss of currency or
       proficiency.
          3.2.1.1.1. Instructors must monitor individuals who are N-BMC for a minimum of
          two effective missions. (T-2) Upon the instructor’s recommendation, the COT will
          place the individual back into BMC status. (T-2)The individual is not excused from
          fulfilling any remaining annual TRs during this 60-day extension (unless prorated
          according to paragraph 3.2.1.4) but does not require instructor monitoring. (T-2)
          Document regression to N-BMC status and back to BMC status on AF Form 4141.
          (T-3)
       3.2.1.1.2. If after 60 days the individual has still failed to meet annual TRs, regress the
       individual to Unqualified (UQ) status. (T-2) UQ is the status to which the commander
       downgrades a formerly BMC individual for failure to regain currency or proficiency.
       Note: UQ may also result when the individual fails any positional evaluation, fails to
       complete a recurring evaluation by the scheduled date, or the commander or DO
       determines an individual to be nonproficient for reasons such as a safety of flight
       infraction.

NOTES:
1. Fifty percent of the required missions will be air-to-air.
2. Fifty percent of live requirements may be substituted with simulation under the following
guidance. Except for JWD/JABMs, external high performance simulation (example: Network
Training Center (NTC)/Full Mission Trainer (FMT)/Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) of a
minimum 2V2 or greater may be counted at a 1-for-1 ratio. JWD/JABMs must count
NTC/FMT/DMO simulations on a 2-for-1 basis. The DO may authorize unit- generated
simulation as a substitute at a 2-for-1 ratio, but only after a training deficiency report has been
submitted.
3. Multiple system qualified personnel only need to meet lookback and annual TRs as if qualified
on a single system.
4. MU-2 missions fulfill TR requirements on a 1-for-1 basis, not to exceed 50 percent of live
requirements. There is no minimum time-hack requirement; however, to maintain the integrity of
continuation training, a controller shall control at least two intercept events of an MU-2 mission
for that mission to count towards requirements.
5. Minimum of 50 % live; FMT/Sim = 2 for 1 (up to 50% of total required); AR qualifying events
will include a minimum of 1 receiver. A single AR event will require check-in of all aircraft to
handoff of all aircraft. (Multiple-receiver hacks in one mission count as 1 event).
6. Live missions controlled at other units (and other systems) may be counted toward annual
training requirements with squadron operations officer approval.
NOTE: HQ personnel may count evaluations as TRs (one for one) up to 50%. Instructors may
credit one mission for every two student missions for which they were primary instructor (up to
50%). This does not include airmanship TRs.

 NOTES:
 1. Fifty percent of live requirements may be substituted with simulation under the following
 guidance. Except for JWD/JABMs, external high performance simulation (example:
 NTC/FMT/DMO) of a minimum 2V2 or greater may be counted at a 1-for-1 ratio. JWD/JABMs
 must count NTC/FMT/DMO simulations on a 2-for-1 basis. The DO may authorize unit-
 generated simulation as a substitute at a 2-for-1 ratio, but only after a training deficiency report
 has been submitted.
 2. Multiple system qualified personnel only need to meet lookback and annual TRs as if qualified
 on the CRC system. 25% of TRs must be accomplished on secondary system.
 3. Minimum of 50% live; FMT/Sim = 2 for 1 (up to 50% of total required)
 4. Missions controlled at other units may be counted toward annual training requirements with
 squadron operations officer approval.
 5. The AWO/WD credits one Link 16 event each time they perform in their respective
 CMR/BMC duty position and a Link 16 interface is functioning. The crew should be involved in
 duty related tasks such as preparing to link, entering/exiting/maintaining the link, ensuring
 current/accurate air situation data, designing/implementing/monitoring filters, and coordinating
 changes to frequencies/crypto modes/ keys and the areas of responsibility.
 NOTE: HQ personnel may count evaluations as TRs (one for one) up to 50%. Instructors may
 credit one mission for every two student missions for which they were primary instructor (up to
 50%), this includes link events.

4. ST event training is accomplished during the conduct of live daily flying, live/simulator exercises,
performed tactical tracking of surveillance objects for a minimum of one hour.
5. ICTs must set up, establish, and monitor/maintain links IAW OPTASKLINK with a minimum of
an hour positional time. STs may credit one TDL event each time they perform in their respective
BMC duty position and conducts air picture maintenance in a TDL environment. The crew should be
involved in duty related tasks such as preparing to link, entering/exiting/maintaining the link,
ensuring current/accurate air situation data, designing/implementing/monitoring filters, and
coordinating changes to frequencies/crypto modes/keys and the areas of responsibility.




      3.2.1.2. The unit COT is authorized to prorate annual TRs when:
          3.2.1.2.1. An individual is TDY, medically disqualified or DNIC, or on emergency
          leave for 30 cumulative days (2 UTAs) or more.
          3.2.1.2.2. An individual is upgraded after the start of the annual period. For example,
          the annual TR for a WD is 28 live missions. Individuals are upgraded during March;
          their prorated share of the annual TRs would be 21 live, accomplished during the
          period 1 April through 30 September. Record prorated requirements on AF Form
          4141.
      3.2.1.3. COTs must identify training deficiencies through channels to HQ AETC/A3Z as
      soon as a potential shortfall of missions may result in individuals not meeting their annual
      TRs. (T-2)
   3.2.2. Lookback (Table 3.4 and 3.5). Lookback is a periodic sliding window management
   tool used to monitor crewmember currency. Lookback allows DOs to better manage training
   resources (for example, sortie allocation). COTs are encouraged to monitor lookback on a
 18                                                           AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


    monthly basis. Table 3.4 requirements apply to all AETC units. 607 ACS cadre and attached
    personnel must also meet currency requirements in Table 3.5.
       3.2.2.1. Unit commanders may keep experienced individuals without a 3-month history
       or 60 day currency (for example, returning from TDY, DNIC) current but N-BMC until
       such history is established. An instructor must monitor the individual until the minimum
       (60 day: one mission for AWO/WD or one event (one hour minimum) for EPT/ICT/ST;
       3-month: two effective missions for AWO/WD/WT or 2 events (one hour minimum
       each) for EPT/ICT/ST) history is established. (T-2)This restarts the lookback or currency
       windows.

 NOTES:
 1. Any combination of missions may be used to attain the TRs.
 2. Instructors may credit one mission for every two student missions for which they were
 primary instructor (up to 50%). This does not include airmanship TRs.
 3. Live requirements may be substituted with simulation under the following guidance. A
 minimum of one live event must be accomplished within the 3-month sliding window.
 Remaining requirements may be fulfilled as follows: Except for JWD/JABMs, external high
 performance simulation (example: NTC/FMT/DMO) of a minimum 2V2 or greater may be
 counted at a 1-for-1 ratio. JWD/JABMs must count NTC/FMT/DMO simulations on a 2-for-1
 basis. These exceptions do not relieve the individual from annual requirements.
 4. Live missions controlled at other units may be counted towards lookback requirements with
 squadron operations officer approval.
 5. NOTE: HQ personnel may count evaluations as TRs (one for one) up to 50%. This does not
 include airmanship TRs.
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                        19

  NOTE: HQ personnel do not have to meet these currencies but do have to meet annual and 3-
  month lookback requirements.
      3.2.2.2. For individuals that were not TDY or DNIF/DNIC, if the 3-month lookback or
      the 60 day currency is not met, the commander may grant a 1-month extension to
      complete training requirements.
          3.2.2.2.1. The commander’s use of this probation period will be documented on the
          AF Form 4141. (T-3) (Note: Instructor qualifications are not affected during this 1-
          month probation period). If lookback is not achieved in the additional month, the
          individual will be downgraded to N-BMC. (T-2)
          3.2.2.2.2. Individuals that are N-BMC or not current cannot positional instruct (live
          or SIM). (T-2) The DO determines whether or not Academic Instructor (AI) status is
          affected. Crewmembers that are regressed to N-BMC status must be monitored by an
          instructor for a minimum of two control events for weapons personnel, two event
          operations for all other crew positions. (T-2) Crewmembers that are non-current must
          be monitored by an instructor for a minimum of one controlled event for weapons and
          one event operation for all other crew positions. (T-2) After the effective mission(s),
          BMC status or currency may be reinstated and a new lookback window established.
              3.2.2.2.2.1. Upon completion of requirements, the instructor recommends to the
              COT, that the individual’s currency status be restored. If the COT concurs the
              recommendation is passed to the DO. If the DO concurs the DO forwards
              concurrence to the commander for approval. The individual then begins
              proficiency requirements for the next month.
              3.2.2.2.2.2. If the instructor determines the N-BMC individual is not proficient,
              the instructor recommends to the COT, that the individual be downgraded to UQ
              status; if the COT concurs , the recommendation is passed to the DO. If the DO
              concurs, the recommendation is passed to the Commander for a decision IAW
              3.2.2.2.3.
          3.2.2.2.3. When an individual is downgraded to UQ, the commander will approve
          trainee entry into remedial training for 30 calendar days (2 UTAs), as required; or
          take appropriate administrative action according to AFI 11-402 or AFI 36-2101. (T-2)
              3.2.2.2.3.1. Accomplish UQ remedial training within 30 days (2 UTAs), and
              accomplish an evaluation within 30 days (2 UTAs) from completion of remedial
              training. (T-2) If the trainee does not complete the training or the trainee fails the
              evaluation, the commander will take appropriate administrative action according
              to AFI 11-402 or AFI 36-2101. (T-2)
      3.2.2.3. Commanders will not prorate missions to meet lookback requirements. (T-2)

   3.2.3. N-BMC or UQ Effect on Instructor Ratings.
       3.2.3.1. Instructors placed into N-BMC status for failure to achieve annual TRs or
       maintain lookback (for reasons other than TDY will not lose their instructor rating;
       however, they will not instruct (positional) until lookback is reestablished or annual TRs
       are achieved, and they are declared BMC. (T-2) Note: Individuals taken from BMC to
       N-MBC due to deployments or medical status (DNIC or DNIF) may still perform
       simulation instructor duties. They will not perform live positional duties.
       3.2.3.2. Instructors (simulation or live) downgraded to UQ status will lose their PI rating
       and must complete a positional RECHECK and be requalified as an instructor before
       resuming duties as an instructor. (T-2)
       3.2.3.3. Squadron DOs will            determine whether academic platform          instructor
       qualification is affected. (T-2)
       3.2.3.4. Dropped Qualifications. Due to operational requirements or squadron
       commander desires, it is sometimes necessary or prudent for individuals to no longer
       maintain qualifications (e.g., reduced sortie availability, change in manpower
       requirements for live positional instructors, multiple system qualification no longer
       needed, etc.). Dropping a qualification is not to be confused or viewed as a Commander
       Directed Downgrade (as detailed in AETCI 13-101, Volume 2). BMC individuals whose
       qualifications are modified by the SQ/CC (e.g. HP to MU-2 only) are not considered as
       “dropped qual”, but must be annotated on a memorandum in the individual’s training/stan
       eval records. (T-3)
3.3. Positional Training Requirements. Positional TRs are expressed in terms of missions.
   3.3.1. Individuals may credit a mission when they:
       3.3.1.1. Brief the mission.
       3.3.1.2. Take radar and radio control of the aircraft performing the mission.
       3.3.1.3. Accomplish at least one air-to-air or AR mission.
       3.3.1.4. Meet the learning objectives set for the mission as briefed.
       3.3.1.5. Debrief the mission.
   3.3.2. Definitions and criteria follow:
       3.3.2.1. Air-to-Air Event. AWO/WD personnel must provide close, tactical, or broadcast
       control to a fighter or flight of fighters where flight integrity is maintained that enters a
       tactical engagement. The AWO/WD provides control to a fighter or flight where the
       primary objective is to practice intercept procedures and techniques against a defensive
       maneuvering aircraft or practice air combat tactics or defensive combat tactics according
       to AFI 11-214 and the AETC supplement. To meet requirements, missions should consist
       of at least two engagements or a single continuous engagement lasting at least 10
       minutes.
       3.3.2.2. AR Event. The AWO/WD provides control to an aircraft or flight conducting
       aerial refueling according to NATO Allied Tactical Pamphlet (ATP-56, Air to Air
       Refueling (AAR), AFI 11-214 and the AETC supplement. The AWO/WD must provide
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                      21


      close or tactical control to an aircraft, or flight of aircraft (where flight integrity is
      maintained), that rendezvous with a tanker or cell (or fighter simulating a tanker). In
      ARs, the AWO/WD may credit one AR mission per set of receivers. The AWO/WD may
      also credit more than one type mission during a refueling in cases where the flight
      conducts a mission in addition to the refueling. For example, if the AWO/WD conducts a
      rendezvous on tanker, then takes the fighters off tanker and conducts intercepts, the
      AWO/WD credits both an AR and an air-to-air mission.
      3.3.2.3. Air-to-Surface Event. The AWO/WD directs at least one flight of aircraft
      conducting air-to-surface tactics against a ground objective. Weapons personnel will
      provide tactical or broadcast control to an aircraft or flight of aircraft where flight
      integrity is maintained that enters an air-to-surface tactical engagement. To meet training
      requirements, the mission should consist of at least two engagements, or a single
      engagement lasting at least 10 minutes.
      3.3.2.4. Link Event. The crew member credits one TDL event each time they perform in
      their respective CMR/BMC duty position and a TDL interface is functioning.
          3.3.2.4.1. The crew member should be involved in duty related tasks such as
          preparing to link, entering/exiting/maintaining the link, ensuring current/accurate air
          situation data, designing/implementing/monitoring filters, and coordinating changes
          to frequencies/crypto modes/ keys and the areas of responsibility.
   3.3.3. Simulation. DOs and COTs share the responsibility to ensure that simulated missions
   (if used) are accomplished in the most effective manner possible and that simulated missions
   accomplish training where live missions are deficient (for example, if the majority of a unit’s
   live missions are tactical control, the weapons individual should practice close control during
   simulation). Simulated missions should also stress increasingly more difficult missions as the
   weapons personnel become more proficient. Finally, simulated missions should stress skills
   or situations that are not normally controlled under live conditions (for example, aircraft
   emergencies or multiple intercepts).
3.4. Academic Training Requirements. The MAJCOM approved IQT syllabus identifies
training objectives and depth of knowledge for academic subject areas. Units will develop
training topics based on these objectives for annual academic training. (T-2) Unit DOs will
approve an annual list of training topics and ensure it is made available for MAJCOM review
upon request. (T-2) Unit Training Development (TD) branches will ensure academic materials
are available and current for COTs to utilize. (T-2)
   3.4.1. The COT establishes, with DO approval, an annual training plan based on unit
   requirements and may adjust this plan to meet individual needs. (T-2)
   3.4.2. Groups and units may supplement AETC academic materials with local training
   materials to meet unique positional requirements.
   3.4.3. Units are authorized local reproduction of all study guide and computer-based training
   materials.
   3.4.4. Continuation training should reinforce the crewmember’s crew resource management
   (CRM) academic knowledge. Quarterly CRM topics should focus on the role CRM plays in
   preventing mishaps, reinforcing CRM skills, and enhancing student training techniques.
 22                                                               AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


   Although CRM is specific to the crewmember’s position, avoid separating training by crew
   position. Using evaluation trends and mishaps, update training annually according to AFI 11-
   290/AETC Sup 1, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. NOTE: This
   requirement also applies to undergraduate students once placed on aeronautical orders.
   3.4.5. Multiqualified BMC personnel must achieve the academic training requirements (TR)
   for each position; however, when the academic requirements are identical, they need only be
   accomplished once. (T-2) For secondary qualifications that are intrinsic to the primary
   qualification, only 50 percent of positional training requirements must be accomplished. (T-
   2)
3.5. Communications Jamming Training. Accomplish academic training annually as a
minimum, simulation or live as feasible. (T-2)
3.6. Training Deficiency Reports (TDR). The following are methods for units to submit
TDRs:
   3.6.1. The unit commander submits a TDR to identify problems beyond the unit’s ability to
   resolve that may prevent the unit or individuals from satisfying academic or positional TRs.
   (T-2) TDRs identify known or potential training problems to higher headquarters for
   information and management purposes. TDRs do not need MAJCOM approval and are
   resolved at the lowest level of command.
   3.6.2. At a minimum, the commander submits the following information (T-2):
      3.6.2.1. Broken equipment that has an impact on training (to include simulation
      equipment).
      3.6.2.2. Lack of live flying for training.
      3.6.2.3. Lack of live flying for evaluations.
      3.6.2.4. Instructor or evaluator shortfalls.
      3.6.2.5. Airspace limitations.
      3.6.2.6. Computer operations to include hardware and software problems.
   3.6.3. A TDR should be submitted from the unit to the parent OG commander. Send an info
   copy to AETC/A3V, AETC/A3Z, and NGB/A3Y (as appropriate). Include the following:
      3.6.3.1. Title: Training Deficiency Report.
      3.6.3.2. Unit: Unit submitting the training deficiencies.
      3.6.3.3. Description of problem.
      3.6.3.4. Date problem began or expected to begin.
      3.6.3.5. Corrective action taken or anticipated.
      3.6.3.6. Estimated date of problem correction.
      3.6.3.7. Recommended solution to resolve the training deficiency.
      3.6.3.8. Remarks.
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                 23


  3.6.4. The OG commander will take necessary action on problems not requiring waivers. (T-
  2) Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a report, the OG commander will present a solution
  to the unit or recommend proposed corrective action to AETC/A3V, AETC/A3Z or
  NGB/A3Y (as appropriate) for problems the OG cannot correct. (T-2) AETC/A3V,
  AETC/A3Z or NGB/A3Y (as appropriate) will take necessary action on these problems
  within 10 calendar days of receipt.

                          BMIT PROGRAM (N/A TO 173 OSS/C2)

4.1. Purpose. Effective instructors are essential to the training program. Instructors are
knowledgeable in the duties of the positions they train as well as skilled in training methods.
BMIT provides battle management personnel with academic instructor (AI) and PI training for
their assigned battle management system. The course is designed with multiple tracks to provide
a training program tailored to the future needs of the graduate. The instruction outlined in the
syllabus is divided into the following five major tracks (as applicable) with subgroups based on
end assignment of the instructor: Track 1—Academic Instructor Training; Track 2—Console
Familiarization; Track 3—Simulation Instruction; Track 4—Live Instruction; and Track 5—
Airmanship.
   4.1.1. Individuals who complete Track 4 do not require Track 3 to qualify as simulation
   instructors. At squadron DO discretion, Track 4 instructors may complete Track 3 sim
   instructor training which will be documented on AF Form 4141. (T-3)
   4.1.2. All prospective instructors will go through Track 1 (unless a MAJCOM waiver has
   been granted) and other tracks as appropriate to their initial instructor assignment. (T-2) For
   PIs, Track 2 is mandatory unless Track 3 or Track 4, as applicable, contains all graded
   mission elements associated with Track 2. (T-2)
       4.1.2.1. During BMIT, the student will observe, demonstrate or perform, and instruct
       academics, simulation training, and live training (if appropriate) for the assigned block of
       instruction. (T-2)
       4.1.2.2. Once students have completed the appropriate training, they will receive an
       academic platform instructor qualification evaluation. (T-2) PIs will receive a simulation
       or live qualification evaluation by Squadron Stan/Eval (CCV) or Group Stan/Eval
       (OGV). (T-2)
       4.1.2.3. Graduates of BMIT who are assigned in a duty or controlled AFSC according to
       the manning document are awarded the "T" prefix to their AFSC according to AFI 36-
       2101 after successful completion of the Track 1 qualification and are authorized to
       perform academic platform instruction.
4.2. Prerequisites. All instructors must have previously attained, as a minimum, BMC status in
a battle management system (AWACS, MCS, Battle Control Center (BCC), Joint Surveillance
Target Attack Radar System [JSTARS], etc.) prior to instructing, whether live or simulation. (T-
2) CMR is preferable (instructor Weapons Simulation Technician [WST] and/or Pilot Simulator
[PS] excluded).
4.3. Training Progression. Based on type of instructor qualification or certification (academic,
simulation, or live), all instructors must complete the appropriate tracks specified in the BMIT
syllabus or applicable HHQ-approved instructor certification training program under the
management of DOT. (T-2) Subsequently, they will receive an evaluation on the system they
instruct. (T-2)
   4.3.1. Individuals with prior AETC instructor qualification do not require BMIT Track 1;
   once entered into BMIT, they may be proficiency advanced according to syllabus guidelines
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                     25


   provided they meet stated proficiency levels and standards within the BMIT syllabus. An
   Academic Instructor (AI) qualification via AETC Form 281, Instructor Evaluation Checklist,
   or AETC Form 620, Academic Instructor Monitoring Checklist, is still required. (T-2)
   4.3.2. BMIT tracks are independent of each other and may be accomplished as needed.
   However, once a track is started, it must be completed. (T-2)
   4.3.3. BMC qualification on a specific system is not a requirement to instruct simulation on
   an AETC battle management training system (for example, previous BMC or CMR on
   AWACS is not required for simulation instructors on the Battlefield Control Systems-
   Tyndall (BCS-T). However, current BQ qualification is a prerequisite to Track 4 of the
   BMIT syllabus.
4.4. Completion of BMIT Track 1.
   4.4.1. Upon completion of BMIT Track 1, individuals will receive a qualification evaluation
   as an academic platform instructor IAW AETCI 36-2604. (T-2) AETC Forms 281 or 620
   will be used to document academic platform instructor qualification. (T-3)
   4.4.2. Staff personnel are not required to maintain academic platform instructor currency.
   Staff personnel are defined as: squadron commander, squadron operations supervisor, DO,
   DOT, CCV, DOW, TD, HQ, OGVs, and attached personnel. (Note: The COT must maintain
   platform instructor currency due to BMIT oversight requirements. (T-2)) Staff personnel may
   choose to maintain this status so that they may do academic platform instruction. Guest
   lecturing is not permissible without an instructor monitor.
   4.4.3. Flight or block commanders and chiefs are tasked with determining if individuals are
   capable of instructing individual academic lessons. (T-2) Certification requirements are IAW
   AETCI 36-2204.
   4.4.4. If there are no tests associated with the block or flight an instructor is assigned or
   teaches in, then only master question file (MQF) requirements apply (if applicable for BMC
   requirements).
   4.4.5. Academic Letter of Xs:
      4.4.5.1. (N/A for 173 OSS/C2) Flight or block commanders will maintain an Academic
      Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs) for all squadron personnel and personnel attached to
      the squadron. (T-3) Update the Letter of Xs monthly and send to DOT. (T-3) The Letter
      of Xs may be maintained and updated on paper or electronically. Monthly, the squadron
      CC reviews the Letter of Xs and certifies the review by signing the paper copy. (T-3) For
      electronically maintained Letter of Xs, the squadron CC may sign a memorandum
      indicating the monthly review has been accomplished. A master paper copy (or master
      electronic copy) will be accessible at the squadron operation's scheduling office or duty
      desk, and will always take precedence over any other copies. (T-3) The squadron CCs
      may make pen and ink changes to the master paper copy to preclude printing out a new
      Letter of X's or memorandum indicating review. This authority may be delegated no
      lower than the squadron operations officer (SQ/DO).

individuals will receive an evaluation representative of their instructor duties by CCV to qualify
them as a Positional Instructor (PI). (T-2) The evaluation will assess their judgment, technical
knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of student activity), and use of grading
documents as well as proficiency in their specialty (AWO, WD, WT, etc.). (T-2) The evaluation
will be conducted on an actual instructional mission whenever possible. Criteria for PI
evaluations are defined in AETCI 13-101, Volume 2.
   4.5.1. PIs will also be certified as academic platform instructors except those exempted in
   paragraph 4.4.2. (T-2)
   4.5.2. Positional Letter of Xs:
       4.5.2.1. Squadron CCV or DOT will maintain a Positional Letter of Xs (Qualification
       and Certification) for all squadron personnel and personnel attached to the squadron. (T-
       3) The Letter of Xs may be maintained and updated on paper or electronically. Monthly,
       the squadron CC reviews the Letter of Xs and certifies the review by signing the paper
       copy, this is considered the master copy. (T-3) For electronically maintained Letter of
       Xs, the squadron CC may sign a memorandum or indicate on the electronic letter of Xs
       indicating the monthly review has been accomplished, the electronic copy that has been
       reviewed by the CC is considered the master electronic copy. A master paper copy or
       master electronic copy will be accessible at the squadron operation's scheduling office or
       duty desk and will always take precedence over any other copies. (T-3) The squadron CC
       may make pen-and-ink changes to the master paper copy to preclude printing out a new
       Letter of Xs or memorandum indicating review. This authority may be delegated no
       lower than the squadron operations officer (SQ/DO).
       4.5.2.2. At a minimum, annotate the following information in the Positional Letter of Xs
       (T-3):
           4.5.2.2.1. BMC status.
           4.5.2.2.2. Instructor qualification or certification.

automatically reinstated. The COT records any loss of instructor status and subsequent
requalification or recertification on AF Form 4141. (T-3)
   4.7.1. Failure of any portion of an instructor academic evaluation results in loss of AI status
   until remedial training or recertification in the academic area of failure.
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                      27


  4.7.2. Failure of an academic evaluation (block test) or AETC Form 281 evaluation does not
  affect mission qualification or PI qualification status.
  4.7.3. Flight or block commanders and chiefs will identify remedial training for failure of an
  academic test or academic platform evaluation. (T-2) Training period will be a minimum of a
  24- hour period and a maximum of 30 days. (T-2) Upon completion of remedial training,
  administer the applicable RECHECK within 30 days. (T-2)
  4.7.4. Failure of a PI evaluation results in loss of instructor status to include AI until
  remedial training and RECHECK.
  4.7.5. Area of failure in the PI evaluation determines whether or not an individual loses their
  mission qualification, for example, failure of a safety item or a technical item of magnitude
  results in loss of mission qualification. However, if the failure was due to poor instructor
  ability but had nothing to do with technical or safety performance, then there is no loss of
  mission qualification. CCV will make the determination.
  4.7.6. Failure of a mission qualification evaluation not only results in UQ status but also
  results in loss of PI status. Squadron DOs will determine whether academic platform
  instructor qualification is affected. (T-3) Upon successful completion of remedial training or
  RECHECK and return to BMC, the squadron DO will determine whether or not to reinstate
  instructor status, or if additional training or RECHECK for instructor capabilities is required.

                                      CERTIFICATIONS

5.1. General. A certification is the designation by the organization commander of an individual
as having completed required training and being capable of performing in a role, mission, job
etc., for which a qualification training program does not exist. A certification may be associated
with either a HHQ-recognized position or a squadron-unique position.
5.2. Aerial Refueling Certifications.
   5.2.1. AR (live) is a certification according to a unit developed training plan and documented
   on AF Form 4141. (T-3) Live A/R certifications require associated live or NTC/FMT/DMO
   currencies and are subject to recurring Stan/Eval evaluations.
5.3. Hardware/Software Control System Upgrade Certifications.
   5.3.1. On occasion the hardware or software for a control system will be upgraded in a
   manner that will require difference training. This training can be documented on AF Form
   797, AF Form 1098 and/or AETC Form 87.
5.4. Squadron-Unique Certifications. All other certifications are associated with squadron-
unique requirements. These certifications occur when the squadron commander deems positions
other than BMC or instructor qualified as necessary for the unit’s battle management training
mission.
   5.4.1. These certifications do not require a formal HHQ syllabus. Squadrons will use either a
   local training plan or syllabus approved by the squadron commander. (T-3)
   5.4.2. Squadron commanders determine if evaluations are required. Certification status may
   be given by formal appointment in lieu of an evaluation. Evaluations, if used, are not given
   by Stan/Eval.
   5.4.3. AF Form 8 is not required. Units may use AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
   Crew Training; AETC Form 281; AETC Form 87, Training Certification; or locally
   approved forms and memorandums to document certification status. (AF FORM 1381 is
   prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the
   form.)
   5.4.4. There is no requirement for recurring evaluations.
   5.4.5. There are no lookback requirements.
   5.4.6. Certification status will be annotated on Letter of Xs.
   5.4.7. Management oversight of squadron certification programs is at the discretion of the
   squadron commander.
5.5. Non-progression in a Certification Program. Notify the squadron DO of individuals who
cannot perform or meet the unit training mission requirements. (T-2) These individuals will be
referred to the squadron commander for administrative action according to AFI 36-2101 when
substandard performance indicates the individual is unable to perform tasks associated with his
or her skill level. (T-2)
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                        29

                               TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

6.1. Introduction. Documentation of academic and positional training accomplishments
provides a current record of an individual’s training during the past 3 months, the past year, and
during his/her career. This information is vital for an accurate assessment of the individual’s 3-
month lookback, annual TRs, as well as overall experience level.
6.2. Training Records Maintenance. Unit COTs will maintain training records for all assigned
or attached personnel. (T-2) The appropriate training division maintains training records for
MAJCOM personnel. (T-2) If due to CCAF requirements, documentation is kept in the faculty
development folder instead of the training folder, indicate with an MFR. (T-2)
6.3. Forms. This instruction directs the use of AF Form 4141 and AF Form 4142. This
instruction refers to AF Form 8, and AETC Form 281. It prescribes AETC Form 87 which may
be used to document squadron certifications.
   6.3.1. AF Form 4141:
       6.3.1.1. The COT maintains an AF Form 4141 on all personnel entered into training. (T-
       2)
       6.3.1.2. Completed forms are maintained according to paragraph 6.6. (T-2)
   6.3.2. AF Form 4142:
       6.3.2.1. The COT maintains an AF Form 4142 for assigned or attached personnel
       possessing AFSCs 13BXX or 1C5X1. (T-2)
       6.3.2.2. Completed forms are maintained according to paragraph 6.6.2. (T-2)
       6.3.2.3. A separate AF Form 4142 must be maintained for each position that has
       different currency requirements. (T-2)
   6.3.3. AF Form 8. This form will be used during the positional evaluation. (T-2)When
   complete, place the AF Form 8 in section II of the individual’s permanent evaluation folder.
   (T-3) The COT annotates AF Form 4141. (T-3)
   6.3.4. AETC Form 281. This form is used during the academic platform qualification. When
   complete, place the AETC Form 281 in the individual’s training folder (or faculty
   development folder). (T-2) The COT annotates AF Form 4141. (T-3)
   6.3.5. AETC Form 87, AF Form 797, and AF Form 1098. These forms may be used during
   squadron certifications or for certification on software/hardware changes to the control
   system. When complete, place the form in the individual’s training folder. (T-3) The COT
   annotates AF Form 4141. (T-3)
6.4. Permanent Training Record. Units will maintain separate training and evaluation folders.
(T-2) For training records, the COT uses individual six-part folders, and identifies each folder by
typing the individual’s last name, first name, and middle initial in capital letters on a standard
size folder label. (T-3) Affix this label to the folder’s tab. (T-3) The training officer may pencil
in additional information on the label (for example, rank, crew, director designator). Do not file
tests or test answer sheets in this folder. Current AF Form 4141 or AF Form 4142 may be kept
 30                                                             AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014


electronically or in a separate binder for ease of record keeping. Organize the permanent training
record as follows (T-3):
   6.4.1. Data. This section contains the current copy of AF Form 4141 and AF Form 4142.
   COTs place the AF Form 4141 on the left side and AF Form 4142 on the right side of
   Section I. If electronic, a memorandum will identify the location of the data.
   6.4.2. Personal History. This section contains any other supporting records and documents
   pertaining to qualification and certification (other than AF Form 4143, AF Form 8, and
   AETC Form 281) or proficiency, to include waivers.
   6.4.3. Qualification and Medical Waivers. This section includes a current copy of the annual
   AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, for
   AFSCs 13BXD and 1C5X1(D), or GS personnel (as applicable). Also keep an AF Form 1042
   placing a live-qualified individual on DNIC status during the DNIC period. When applicable,
   place AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, behind the current AF Form
   1042. In addition, file medical profiles that affect operational status in this section. Do not
   maintain sensitive medical history or other records of a personal medical nature in this file. If
   medical documentation is sensitive, place a memorandum for record, signed by the squadron
   DO in this section. This memorandum states the individual is removed from training and
   includes dates, if available. After an individual is placed on DNIC status, DOT will keep the
   AF Form 1042 during the DNIC period and file it in the transitory files. (AF FORM 1042 is
   prescribed in AFI 48-123. AF Form 702 is prescribed in AFI 11-403, Aerospace
   Physiological Training Program. Refer to those publications for guidance on filling out the
   forms.)
   6.4.4. Training History. This section includes certificates from AETC courses, MAJCOM
   formal courses, and any formal battle management training. File this material chronologically
   with the latest date on top, and keep as a permanent part of this folder. Locally generated
   training records may be maintained in this section while the individual is in IQT or BMIT.
   This section also contains squadron DO or designated representative justifications for late
   entry into IQT or BMIT. System specific task/task qualification, or the computer-generated
   product, is maintained in this section or in a database. However, upon PCS, translate all
   computerized products into hardcopy if not forwarded electronically to gaining unit.
   6.4.5. Experience. This section contains completed AF Form 4141, AF Form 4142, and
   control experience forms from other commands. COTs file these forms chronologically with
   the latest date on top as a permanent part of the training folder. This section will not include
   previous AF Forms 4143 or AF Forms 8. Maintain these forms in a separate evaluation
   folder.
   6.4.6. AF Forms 4141 and 4142. The information required by AF Form 4141 and AF Form
   4142 may be maintained in an electronic version (instead of hardcopy). If the electronic
   version is used, the COT must ensure a backup method is in place to obtain the data in the
   event the computer fails. NOTE: Referencing electronic products upon PCS: An entry must
   be made stating “Electronic Form - All information is certified to be valid” and must be
   signed by the COT. No record of authentication is required for line entries (Block H) made
   on AF Form 4141 if the electronic version is used. Also, electronic products must have all
   required entries.
AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                     31


6.5. Transfer of Records. Upon reassignment (PCS or PCA only), units will either forward
electronically, or an individual will hand-carry the permanent records to the gaining unit. (T-2)
6.6. Documentation. Training is documented on seven forms (as applicable): AF Form 4141,
AF Form 4142, AF Form 8, AETC Form 281, AETC Form 87, AF Form 797, and AF Form
1098.
   6.6.1. AF Form 4141. Use this form to record significant occurrences during an individual’s
   training. (T-3) The most current AF Form 4141 will be placed on top previous records. (T-3)
   The COT will record the following events (T-3):
       6.6.1.1. The review of a newly arriving individual’s training records.
       6.6.1.2. Completion date and test scores when an individual has completed a transfer of
       training status from another unit.
       6.6.1.3. Removal from unit training for purposes of formal school attendance.

AETCI13-101V1 27 MAY 2014                                                                         41


Mission—Department of Defense definition: The task, together with the purpose, that clearly
indicates the action to be taken and the reason therefore. In common usage, especially when
applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit, a task. For the purpose of
this AFI, a more detailed explanation of this term applies: A mission includes briefing,
controlling, and debriefing. Briefings should include training objectives. Controlling consists of
taking radio and radar control of aircraft and accomplishing one or more types of mission, such
as air-to-air, AR, air-to-surface, and active air defense scrambles. Debriefing should be with the
pilots (and instructor where applicable). The brief and debrief may be accomplished via
telephone or radio; however, face-to-face briefs provide optimum training.
Master Question File (MQF)—A headquarters-designated OPR oversees the development of
this bank of questions. Stan/Eval functions use the MQF in constructing written examinations
required by this instruction.
Nonbasic Mission Capable (N-BMC) (Noncurrent)—Individual is N-BMC upon loss of
currency, for example, did not meet lookback, annual training requirements, or fails initial
written examination during recurring evaluation.
No-notice Evaluation—Give this evaluation at such time preparation beyond that normally
accomplished for the mission is not possible. These evaluations may be complete qualification
evaluations, a written examination only, or a positional evaluation covering only selected areas.
Positional Evaluation—This is the portion of a qualification evaluation that covers on-position
duties, actions, and responsibilities. This includes knowledge of console operations and unit
equipment capabilities and limitations.
Positional Training—Hands-on training resulting from performance of duties in assigned
positions.
Prorating—This is the process of determining the TRs proportionately. This process is used
when personnel are TDY, medically disqualified or DNIC, or on emergency leave for more than
30 days.
Qualification Evaluation—Conduct this written and (or) positional evaluation to check an
individual’s proficiency in performing operations duties or to let an examinee demonstrate to the
SEE his or her academic knowledge and ability to do assigned crewmember functions safely and
effectively. Types of qualification evaluations are INIT QUAL, recurring, RECHECK and spot.
Document qualification evaluations on AF Form 8.
Recurring Qualification Evaluation—This is an academic and positional evaluation required
for an individual to maintain BMC status.
RECHECK—A prior notice qualification evaluation given to an individual who has been
regressed to UQ status.
Reexamination—A reaccomplishment of a required written examination following a failure.
Regression—A regression of an individual from BMC to N-BMC.
Remedial Training—Training for individuals who fail a spot or recurring evaluation or do not
complete CT requirements. Once qualified, all personnel should meet all TRs or otherwise be
downgraded from BMC status to UQ.

Spot Evaluation—An evaluation normally outside the eligibility period to ensure correction of
identified discrepancies or to spot check an individual's proficiency. A spot evaluation is
normally limited in scope. It may be either a positional evaluation and (or) a written
examination. These evaluations may be either no-notice or with prior coordination. An
evaluation begun as a spot evaluation may become (and be documented as) a recurring
evaluation if all recurring evaluation requirements are completed during the spot evaluation. Do
not add on missions to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group or
squadron commander concurs with the aircrew member’s desire to realign the evaluation
expiration date and approves the additional flight time requirements. Note: When the flight
examiner administering a spot evaluation is not qualified in the mission design series and crew
position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited toward a periodic evaluation.
Stan/Eval Examiner (SEE)—A SEE is an operations crewmember who has completed an
objectivity evaluation and is designated to perform evaluation duties as specified by this
instruction. SEEs must be current and qualified in the position they are evaluating.
Stan/Eval Objectivity Evaluation—A HHQ SEE or the OG chief of Stan/Eval (or his or her
designated representative) gives this evaluation to unit SEEs to determine their ability to perform
SEE duties. Document qualification as a SEE on AF Form 8, and designate the individual by
letter upon completion of this evaluation.
Stan/Eval Special Interest Item—This is an operational area of concern designated by
headquarters staff for evaluation during formal Stan/Eval visits.
Time Periods—The following definitions are provided for interpretation of timing requirements
specified in this instruction:
Day—Unless otherwise specified, day means calendar days. When work days are specified, only
count duty days. Do not count scheduled unit down days against this time limit.
Month—The term month means calendar months, not 30-day periods.
Training Period—A specific amount of time to accomplish a prescribed phase of training.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—For the purpose of this instruction, a UTA is considered to be
the two-day period per month that ANG operations personnel spend on duty. The acronym UTA
equals one full ANG drill weekend. When computing due dates, the UTA weekend on which an
event initially takes place does not count. For example, a reference allows two UTAs for
completion of an event. The original decision or event occurs during the drill weekend in March.
The unit or individual would have until the end of the drill weekend in May to complete the
action or response. The use of weekday and evening training periods will not shorten this time
period.
Unit—For the purposes of this instruction, a unit is defined as a squadron required to establish
its own Stan/Eval program.
Unqualified—The status of an individual who: has not entered or completed IQT training
requirements and has not successfully passed an INIT QUAL for BMC status; or has twice failed
the academic portion of an evaluation; or has failed a recurring or spot positional evaluation or
has failed a reexamination; or has failed to meet TRs; or has been downgraded at the direction of
the commander or DO due to failure to complete a recurring qualification evaluation.
