                                        Guidance Changes

The below changes to AFI 36-2501, 16 July 2004, through IC 3, dated 17 August 2009 are
effective immediately.


*(Clarification) 5.5. Removing First Lieutenants through Lieutenant Colonels from a
Promotion List. A commander initiates action to remove an officer’s name from a promotion list
when a preponderance of the evidence shows that the officer has not met the requirement for
exemplary conduct set forth in Title 10, U.S.C. 8583 or is not mentally, physically, morally, or
professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher grade. Even if the officer declines the
promotion, initiate removal action since his or her name remains on the list (declination
procedures are in paragraph 4.1.).

*(Clarification) 5.5.1. A commander initiates action to remove an officer's name from a
promotion list by following the steps detailed in paragraphs 5.6. and 5.7. The Secretary of the
Air Force (SECAF) (or designee), acting for the President, approves all removal actions. SECAF
(or designee) may, in lieu of removal, also approve a delay, terminate the action, or terminate the
action with a date of rank adjustment. If SECAF (or designee) disapproves the removal action,
but determines the officer did not meet standards for promotion during part of the delay period
during which the removal was processed, SECAF (or designee) may adjust the officer's
promotion effective date and date of rank as described in paragraph 5.4.4. Initiation of removal
action automatically delays an officer’s promotion until SECAF makes a decision on the action.

*(Clarification) 5.5.2. When an officer is considered and selected IPZ or APZ, but later
removed from a report of a selection board or a promotion list, the removal is deemed a non-
selection for promotion.

*(Clarification) 5.5.2.1. Promote officers selected by the next board, upon Senate
confirmation, based on his or her seniority on the new promotion list.

*(Clarification) 5.5.2.2. Officers not selected by the next board, or if selected and again
removed from a report of a selection board or the promotion list, are determined to have been
twice non-selected for promotion.

*(Clarification) 5.5.2.3. Officers considered and selected BPZ but subsequently removed do
not incur a non-selection for promotion.

*(Add New) 5.5.3. If an officer on the active-duty list is discharged or dropped from the rolls or
transferred to a retired status after having been recommended for promotion to a higher grade
under Title 10, U.S.C., Chapter 36, but before being promoted, the officer's name shall be
administratively removed from the list of officers recommended for promotion by the office with
primary responsibility for maintaining the applicable promotion list. A memorandum for record
documenting the removal with supporting documentation will be maintained with the original
board file. For the purposes of this paragraph an officer is "discharged" if the officer: is
involuntarily discharged for cause pursuant to AFI 36-3206; or resigns in lieu of a court-martial,
involuntary discharge for cause; or after the initiation of a promotion delay or promotion list (or
report) removal action pursuant to this instruction. (Note: This provision does not apply to an
officer who is removed from the active-duty list and placed on the reserve active-status list in the
same armed force and in the same competitive category under 10 U.S.C. § 14317. Nor does it
apply to an officer who is permanently or temporarily retired for physical disability under Title
10, U.S.C., Chapter 61).

*(Add New) 5.9.1.8. If an officer on the active-duty list is involuntarily discharged after being
found not qualified for promotion (NQP) to first lieutenant or resigns in lieu of a NQP action, the
officer's name shall be administratively removed from the list of officers approved for
appointment to first lieutenant by the office with primary responsibility for maintaining the
applicable file. A memorandum for record documenting the removal with supporting
documentation will be maintained with the appointment file.

*(Replace) 11.4. Removal From a Promotion List (Also applies to Air Force Reserve). In
accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 629, Removal from a List of Officers Recommended
for Promotion and 14310, Removal from a List of Officers Recommended for Promotion, officers
are removed from a promotion list when the preponderance of the evidence shows that they are
not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher
grade.

*(Clarification) 11.4.1. An immediate or higher level commander, or higher authority, may
initiate a recommendation for removal. The individual recommending removal will notify the
officer, in writing, and give him or her an opportunity to review the evidence and to provide
written comments. If the individual recommending removal cannot give initial notice in writing,
he or she may give it orally, but must follow by written notice as soon as practicable. The
individual recommending removal must notify the officer before the effective date of promotion,
unless a delay is in effect--then the notification must be made before the expiration of the delay.

*(Clarification) 11.4.2. Once a removal action is initiated, a promotion is effectively delayed
until the President takes action or action is taken to terminate the removal. The SECAF is the
approval authority for termination of removal actions.

*(Add New) 11.4.3. If an officer on the active-duty list or reserve active-status list is
discharged or dropped from the rolls or transferred to a retired status after having been
recommended for promotion to a higher grade under Title 10, U.S.C., Chapter 36, but before
being promoted, the officer’s name shall be administratively removed from the list of officers
recommended for promotion by the office with primary responsibility for maintaining the
applicable promotion list. A memorandum for record documenting the removal with supporting
documentation will be maintained with the original board file and the officer notified
appropriately.

                                            Chapter 2

                                 CONDUCTING THE BOARD

2.1. Program Objectives. A promotion is not a reward for past service; it is an advancement to
a higher grade based on past performance and future potential. The fundamental purpose of the
officer promotion program is to select officers through a fair and competitive selection process
that advances the best qualified officers to positions of increased responsibility and authority and
provides the necessary career incentive to attract and maintain a quality officer force. Specific
objectives are to:
   2.1.1. Promote officers of the desired quality and quantity through a fair and equitable
   competitive selection system that advances those individuals considered by boards to be best
   qualified.
   2.1.2. Provide opportunity for accelerated promotion BPZ for officers possessing
   exceptional potential.
   2.1.3. Promote officers in sufficient numbers of each grade, as vacancies occur, to maintain
   the strength in each grade for each competitive category.
   2.1.4. Provide reasonably stable, consistent, and visible career opportunities for each
   competitive category.
2.2. Rules Governing All Boards. When the board is in session, it works directly for the
SECAF under the supervision of the board president. No person may:
   2.2.1. Direct a particular individual be selected or not selected by the board.
   2.2.2. Censure, reprimand, or admonish the board or any member of the board for
   recommendations or for exercising any function within the discretion of the board.
   2.2.3. Attempt to coerce or influence, by any unauthorized means, any action of a board or
   any member of a board in formulating the board's recommendations.
2.3. Who Are Selection Board Members. SECAF ensures that board membership consists of
at least five or more officers on the Active Duty List (ADL) who are senior in grade to the
eligible officers, except that no member of a board may be serving in a grade below major.
Rotate board duty between the maximum numbers of eligible officers over time.
   2.3.1. At least one Reserve officer who meets all statutory criteria for board membership
   must serve if the board is considering Reserve officers.
   2.3.2. If there are no officers of the competitive category on the ADL serving in a grade
   higher than the officers being considered, it is permissible to appoint retired officers, Reserve
   officers on active duty but not on the ADL, or members of the Ready Reserve.
   2.3.3. There will be an officer currently serving in a joint duty assignment, designated by the
   CJCS, when considering officers serving in, or having served in, joint duty assignments.
   2.3.4. An officer cannot serve as a member of two successive boards considering officers of
   the same competitive category and grade (except for SSBs when the second board is not
   considering the same officer or officers).
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           13


   2.3.5. Central Selection Board membership will reflect the eligible population in terms of
   minority and women officers and MAJCOM of assignment when practical. Large
   MAJCOMs will not dominate the board membership; ensure reasonable representation of
   smaller commands over time.
       2.3.5.1. Board membership will be structured to reflect career area and aeronautical
       rating for the line competitive category, when practical.
       2.3.5.2. Board membership for the judge advocate, chaplain, and health profession
       competitive categories will be structured to ensure no more than two voting members (or
       not a majority or more for a larger board) are from the same competitive category under
       consideration. The remaining voting members will be line officers, except for boards
       considering health profession competitive categories where the other voting members
       will be officers from a health profession competitive category not under promotion
       consideration on that board, if such officers are available. This does not preclude Line of
       the Air Force (LAF) officers substituting for these other voting members when it is
       deemed impractical for other health profession categories to be present. For boards
       considering competitive categories other than LAF, the competitive category under
       consideration will under no condition form the majority of the board.
       2.3.5.3. Board president and panel chairpersons will be LAF officers to meet board
       composition requirements of Air Force policy.
2.4. Organizing Boards. SECAF ensures, through the board recorder, that boards:
   2.4.1. Consist of a president, panel chairpersons, panel members, recorders, and
   administrative support staff.
   2.4.2. Distribute records to panels by competitive category to ensure as equitable a
   distribution of quality as feasible, (see paragraph 2.15 below).
   2.4.3. Are organized into enough panels to allow the board reasonable time to complete its
   work. Panels are subdivisions of the board and have as broad a representation of MAJCOMs,
   career areas, and aeronautical ratings as possible.
2.5. Board President. A nonvoting, nonscoring member of the board. He or she must be at
least a major general (or select) for colonel and lieutenant colonel boards, and at least a brigadier
general (or select) for major boards. The board president will:
   2.5.1. Perform administrative duties in connection with the board proceedings.
   2.5.2. Administer the oath in Attachment 3 to board recorders and administrative staff
   before the board begins scoring records.
   2.5.3. Not determine any matter that would constrain the board from recommending for
   promotion those officers fully qualified and best qualified to meet the prescribed needs of the
   Air Force established by the SECAF.
   2.5.4. Oversee the conduct of the board, including approving "rescores," monitoring
   discussions, and resolving the "gray" records.
   2.5.5. Conduct a quality review of the records one score category below the second cut line
   on each panel. See paragraph 2.28
 14                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   2.5.6. Ensure the consideration of all eligible officers without prejudice or partiality in a
   consistent, fair, and equitable manner.
2.6. Board Members.
   2.6.1. Will perform their duties based on the best interests of the Air Force.
   2.6.2. Will not represent or sponsor any particular career field, command, or any other
   category of officers.
   2.6.3. Will request relief from SECAF if they cannot, in good conscience, perform the duties
   without prejudice or partiality.
   2.6.4. Will request relief from the SECAF or the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) of their
   obligation not to disclose board proceedings if they believe the integrity of the board's
   proceedings has been affected by improper influence of senior military or civilian authority,
   misconduct by the board president or a member, or any other reason.
   2.6.5. Will report the basis for their belief to the SECAF or the SECDEF after release from
   board duties.
2.7. Board Recorders. The board recorders will manage the flow of records to the board
members, answer administrative questions, review information for presentation to the board, and
advise the board president and members on board processes and other administrative matters.
Primarily, they ensure procedures outlined in this instruction and board proceedings meet all
requirements of law and DoDIs. The board recorder will:
   2.7.1. Complete a course of instruction during the previous 12 months, approved by the
   SECAF, on their duties and responsibilities to ensure compliance with law and DoD policy.
   2.7.2. Ensure at least one board recorder is present during all board deliberations.
   2.7.3. Not serve as a recorder on boards for which they are being considered.
   2.7.4. Not serve as a board member and a recorder for the same board.
   2.7.5. Request relief from the SECAF or the SECDEF as outlined in paragraph 2.6.4, and
   report as outlined in paragraph 2.6.5
   2.7.6. Officers whose primary responsibilities involve career management of the officers
   eligible for consideration by a promotion selection board, or the career management of those
   officers once selected for promotion, may not serve as board recorders for promotion
   selection boards considering these officers for promotion.
2.8. Administrative Support Staff.
   2.8.1. Board Secretariat Administrative Support Staff. The Administrative Support Staff will
   organize records for presentation to the board, account for records that have been rescored,
   answer administrative questions, maintain the order of merit established by the board
   members' scores, and follow standard written procedures governing the administrative
   support for boards.
   2.8.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Administrative Support Staff. These personnel, brought in
   TDY in support of the board, will assist the board secretariat administrative staff with the
   distribution and collection of records as well as other minor administrative tasks.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          15


2.9. Rules Governing Communications With Boards. The board recorder ensures all
communication with the board is in writing, to include guidance from the SECAF (for letters
from eligible officers, see paragraph 2.10). Furnish all written communications to all board
members and record it as part of the board's record. An audio or video recording is an acceptable
means for providing guidance to the board, so long as a written transcript is a part of the board
record.
   2.9.1. No one other than the SECAF may appear in person to address a selection board on
   any matter. Should the SECAF address a board in person, HQ AFPC/DPPB provides a
   verbatim transcript of his or her remarks to every board member and includes it in the record
   of the board. This does not restrict the staff from furnishing administrative information to the
   board. Board members, recorders, and administrative staff may orally communicate routine
   administrative information to the extent necessary to facilitate the board's work.
2.10. Writing Letters to a Board.
   2.10.1. Officers eligible for promotion may write a letter to the board. Eligible officers:
       2.10.1.1. Submit the letter in good faith, and ensure it contains accurate information to
       the best of their knowledge.
       2.10.1.2. Sign and date the letter.
       2.10.1.3. Send the letter to HQ AFPC/DPPPO so it arrives no later than (NLT) 2359
       (Central Standard Time) the day prior to the board convening date. Letters arriving after
       2359 the day prior to the board will not be presented to the board for consideration.
       2.10.1.4. If the letter writer requests return of the letter, he/she must provide a stamped,
       self-addressed envelope.
       2.10.2. Eligible officers may provide relevant attachments to their letters; with the
       following limitations.    HQ AFPC/DPSOO advises officers when letters and/or
       attachments do not meet the above requirements and will not be presented to the board.
           2.10.2.1. Attachments addressed to a board on behalf of other individuals are not
           permitted.
           2.10.2.2. Attachments containing any of the following are not permitted: information

           Officer Selection Records; recommendations for promotion, assignments, and
           specific developmental education schools; and comments about assignments
           contingent on being selected for promotion;
           2.10.2.3. Attachments or documents that can become a permanent part of the
           officer’s record (e.g., PRFs considered by previous boards, draft/proposed PRFs,
           draft/proposed OPRs, and decoration narratives) are not permitted; and
           2.10.2.4. Letters, including attachments, will not exceed 10 pages: 5 two-sided pages
           or 10 one-sided pages.
   2.10.3. Title 10, U.S.C., Section 617, Reports of Selection Boards requires that the board
   shall include in its report the name of any officer the board did not recommend for promotion
   who requested not to be promoted or otherwise caused nonselection through written
   communication to the board.
 16                                                                    AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


       2.10.3.1. Letter writer determination. After gray resolution, the record of each nonselect
       containing a letter from the member is returned to the panel that originally scored it. The
       panel is instructed to rescore each record as if the letter did not exist.
The hypothetical score is compared to the original panel order of merit. If the hypothetical score
would have made the record a clear select, then the officer will be identified as having caused
his/ her nonselection in the board report. If the hypothetical score would have placed the record
into that panel’s gray, the letter is removed and the record competes head to head within the
original panel against the I/APZ select record from the lowest select aggregate gray score
category. If more than one letter writer is hypothetically placed within the panel’s gray, all of the
nonselect letter writers’ records will be rescored (with letters removed) along with lowest select
using a 6-10 scoring scale. Normal rules for split scores will apply. The name of any officer
whose record beats the I/APZ select record will be added to the board report as having caused
his/her nonselection.
       2.10.3.2. An officer who causes his/her non-selection through communication to a
       selection board is not entitled to involuntary separation pay.
2.11. What Information Meets the Board.
   2.11.1. The name and officer selection record (OSR), outlined in AFI 36-2608, Military
   Personnel Records System, of each eligible officer, including the Officer Selection Brief
   (OSB).
   2.11.2. Letters submitted to selection boards by eligible officers (see paragraph 2.10).
   2.11.3. Information not part of the official military personnel record of an officer, but which
   the SECAF or a civilian official, appointed by the President by and with the advice and
   consent of the Senate and designated by the SECAF, determines as substantiated and which
   could reasonably and materially affect board deliberations. The SECAF, or designee, must
   ensure the procedures for identifying and proposing such information for consideration apply
   to all eligible officers IPZ, APZ, or BPZ for the board concerned. In these cases, the SECAF
   ensures the officer:
       2.11.3.1. Is notified and provided a copy of the information.
       2.11.3.2. Is allowed a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments.
       2.11.3.3. Is provided a factual summary of the information, if it is not totally available
       for reasons of national security, or other lawful reasons.

   2.11.5. Information described in paragraph 2.11.3 will not meet a subsequent board unless
   the information is in the official military personnel record of the officer, or the SECAF or
   designee, makes a new determination. When rendering a new determination, the officer will
   have the opportunity to comment upon notification.
2.12. Instructing Boards. The board president will read the SECAF instructions verbatim to
the board on the convening date and provide a written copy to each board member. These
instructions will not contain information on particular officers. Do not modify, withdraw or

   2.12.2. Guidelines to ensure the board considers all eligible officers without prejudice or
   partiality.
   2.12.3. Information or guidelines on the needs of the Air Force for officers with particular
   skills (if necessary), including the need for a minimum or maximum number of officers with
   particular skills in a competitive category. Information or guidelines on officers with
   particular skills must be furnished to the board as part of the written instructions provided to
   the board at the time the board is convened.

   colonel in the Nurse Corps (NC), Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC), Medical Corps (MC),
   and Dental Corps (DC) competitive categories to give consideration to an officer's clinical
   proficiency and skill as a health professional to at least as great an extent as the board gives
   to that officer's administrative and management skills.
   2.12.8. Guidelines to prohibit board members, recorders, and administrative staff or people
   acting on their behalf from receiving, starting, or participating in communications or
   discussions involving information that DoDI 1320.14 or this instruction does not allow.
   2.12.9. Guidelines on actions if a board member or recorder believes someone is exerting, or
   attempting to exert, inappropriate influence over the board or its proceedings.
   2.12.10. The maximum number of officers the board can recommend IPZ or APZ and BPZ
   in each competitive category. Determine this number by using the guidelines in DoDI
   1320.14, enclosure 3. No increase in the number may be made after the selection board
   convenes without the written approval of the SECDEF.
2.13. Board Member Preparation. The Selection Board Secretariat will pre-brief the Board
President (BP) on the board agenda, SECAF Memorandum of Instructions (MOI), BP
responsibilities, and the trial run exercise (practice scoring session). Board recorders will conduct
the first day administrative briefing to the board. The BP will then read the SECAF MOI
verbatim to the board and a copy will be provided to each board member. Each board member
will sign a copy of the MOI to be maintained in the permanent record. Oaths are administered to
board members and to the recorders and administrative staff. A trial run exercise will then be

conducted to familiarize board members with the selection records and situations the board may
encounter during actual scoring.
2.14. Conducting Trial Runs. The board recorder provides board members pre-identified
records to set their scoring standard and to acquaint them with some situations they may
encounter during the actual scoring for the record. The trial run records will not be actual records
of officers being considered by the board.
   2.14.1. After the trial run, the board discusses scoring to ensure all members have a similar
   scoring baseline. There is no requirement for absolute uniformity of scores; the trial run and
   discussion are valuable tools to help resolve differences.
   2.14.2. The board members make the determination if a subsequent trial run is needed.
2.15. Record Distribution Procedures. On multiple panel boards, the following safeguards
will be used to ensure an equal distribution of the quality spectrum of records to each panel. Each
eligible record will be assigned a record number which is based on the reverse of the member's
social security number. All records will then be numerically sequenced using these numbers, and
then distributed evenly, in blocks of 20 records to the extent possible, to make lots equivalent to
the number of panels (i.e., records 1 through 20 to panel lot 1, 21 through 40 to panel lot 2, 41
through 60 to panel lot 3, etc.). Recognizing that after such a distribution each panel may not
have the exact same number of records and/or distribution of PRF ratings (i.e., Definitely
Promote, Promote, Do Not Promote), the number of records and associated PRF ratings will be
compared by panels to determine general parity in quality and numbers across the panel lots. If
imbalances exist, records will be redistributed among the panels using a computer program that
will randomly determine changes to be made in the panel distributions until a reasonably equal
distribution of the spectrum of records by number and PRF ratings is achieved.
2.16. Reviewing Records.
   2.16.1. Panels consider records in the same competitive category.
   2.16.2. Panels receive a pro rata portion of the total board quota that corresponds to the total
   number of records reviewed by the panel.
2.17. Scoring Records. Records are scored on a best-qualified basis unless otherwise directed
by SECAF. Board members will ensure that officers selected for promotion are fully qualified to
assume the next higher grade. In-the-promotion zone (IPZ) and above-the promotion zone (APZ)
records will be scored together. BPZ records will be scored separately from IPZ and APZ
records. Records will be scored separately by competitive category; officers within the same
competitive category compete only among themselves for promotion.
   2.17.1. Scores are based on the following:
       2.17.1.1. The material in each officer's OSR.
       2.17.1.2. Any information the SECAF may provide to that board according to DoDI
       1320.14.
       2.17.1.3. Any information communicated by letter from the officer concerning his or her
       own record.
   2.17.2. Generally, scoring is by secret ballot and without benefit of discussion, unless a
   significant disagreement (a ―split‖) occurs in the scores on a particular record.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                         19


       2.17.2.1. If a board member identifies a record-based matter that causes concern, he/she
       will surface the matter to the Board Recorder who may discuss it with the BP. The BP
       may approve bringing that matter to the attention of the board members.
       2.17.2.2. Board members may discuss their own personal knowledge and evaluation of
       the professional qualifications of eligible officers as long as they discuss only matters
       documented in the OSR or permitted by law, DODI 1320.14, this instruction, or
       Secretarial guidance and instructions.
       2.17.2.3. Board members may not discuss or disclose the opinion of a person not a
       member of the board concerning the officer unless that opinion is in the material
       presented to the board under DODI 1320.14.
2.18. Scoring Scales.
   2.18.1. Boards will use the following scoring scale when the promotion opportunity is less
   than 100%:
       Score            Potential
       10.0             Absolutely superior
       9.5              Outstanding
       9.0              Few could be better
       8.5              Strong
       8.0              Slightly above average
       7.5              Average
       7.0              Slightly below average
       6.5              Well below average
       6.0              Lowest
   2.18.2. Some boards use a "yes" or "no" scoring system. This method is explained in
   following paragraphs, as it applies to various situations.
2.19. Defining "Splits. " A "split" is a significant disagreement between board members about
the score of a record. A "split" is considered a difference in a score of 2 or more points between
any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 8, or 8 and 10). When using a "yes" or "no" scoring system
for promotion decision, a "split" occurs when the vote is not unanimous.
2.20. Resolving "Splits. "All voting panel members must be present and may discuss the
record involved in a "split." Only panel members with split scores may change their scores in the
process of resolving a split. When using a "yes" or "no" scoring system and a "split" cannot be
resolved, the majority vote will rule.
2.21. New Documents. If new information (e.g., decoration citation, officer performance
report, updated officer selection brief) concerning an individual’s record is acquired during panel
scoring, the affected records will be brought back to the same panel for rescoring.
2.22. Identifying "Show Cause" Records. During the scoring process, board members are
required to identify the records of officers who, in their opinion, should "Show Cause" for
retention on active duty. They do this by voting "SC" on the scoring ballot for each record of
this type. Paragraph 2.34 below addresses resolution of Show Cause records.
 20                                                                   AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


2.23. Promotion Quota Computation. The board promotion quota is computed by multiplying
the SECAF-authorized promotion opportunity, expressed as a decimal, by the number of IPZ
officers being considered. Quota calculation for Medical Corps and Dental Corps may apply an
APZ opportunity. In that case, the board promotion quota is calculated as the sum of the IPZ
opportunity multiplied by number of IPZ eligibles added to the APZ opportunity multiplied by
the number of APZ eligibles. If BPZ is applicable on a given board, the quota is then reduced by
the maximum number of SECAF-authorized BPZ quotas. The resulting number of quotas is then
distributed across the panels based on fair share principle, establishing a quota for each panel.
Each panel’s quota is then reduced by multiplying the panel quota by a specified percentage to
be approved for each board by the SECAF, acting on the AF/DP’s recommendation; the result
will be "adjusted panel quotas". (For example, SECAF could approve reduction percentages of
96.5% for Major boards, 97.5% for Lt Col boards, and 99.5% for Colonel boards to be multiplied
[in decimal form] by the panel quotas, to reach the adjusted panel quotas, rounding down). The
adjusted panel quota step is done to ensure approximately 5% of the board quota will be
available for use in the gray/aggregate gray process, discussed in paragraph 2.25
2.24. Establishing "Cut Lines. "
   2.24.1. Establishing the Initial Cut Line. After panel scoring is complete, establish an order
   of merit for each panel. An initial cut line is then drawn on the panel order of merit at the
   bottom of the score category that comes closest to filling the adjusted panel quota without
   exceeding it. A "score category" consists of all records having the same aggregate score (the
   aggregate score is the total of individual scores determined by each panel member for each
   record). Since all scores are determined at half-point increments, a "score category" will
   normally represent a half-point spread in the order of merit. The records above this initial cut
   line will be recommended for promotion unless the objective quality review (see paragraph
   2.26) results in placing them below the cut line. If the cut line is at a point where the number
   of cumulative records equal the adjusted panel quota, this is referred to as a "clean cut".
   2.24.2. Establishing the Second Cut Line. For each panel having a "clean cut", draw a
   second cut line at the bottom of the score category immediately below the initial cut line. For
   all other panels, draw the second cut line at the bottom of the second score category below
   the initial cut line.
2.25. Establishing the "Gray. " The ―gray‖ initially includes all records scored below panel
initial cut lines and above panel second cut lines. For multi-panel boards, each panel’s gray is
then consolidated into an aggregate gray for resolution by the entire board. For I/APZ, if the
number of records in the aggregate gray is fewer than 5% of the eligibles, the next lower score
category from all panels will successively be added to the gray until the number of records in
aggregate gray is equal to, or more than 5% of the eligibles. On single panel boards, the panel's
score categories below the second cut line will be successively added to gray as necessary to
ensure the number of records in gray is equal to or more than 5% of the eligibles.
2.26. Objective Quality Review. This process will be done by the Board Secretariat and results
are briefed to the BP. Panel members will be advised of the reason (see below) the record is
being returned for rescore, but will also be advised that there is no intention to drive any
particular result; a simple validation of their original score may be an appropriate result. For all
records returned for rescoring, the second score will be the score used.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           21


   2.26.1. Identify and return to their original panels for rescoring, all selection records above
   the second cut line which have any of the following characteristics within them: A court-
   martial, an Article 15, a letter of reprimand (LOR), a do not promote (DNP) PRF, a not
   qualified for promotion (NQP) letter, a ―do not promote me‖ letter, current prisoner or
   appellate leave, and referral OPR on top.
   2.26.2. Identify and return to their original panels for rescoring, all selection records below
   the initial cut line which have any of the following characteristics within them: Members
   assigned to developmental education (DE) anytime from Day 150 to the board convening
   date (I/APZ); awarded definitely promote (DP) promotion recommendations (I/APZ);
   awarded promote (P) promotion recommendations for boards with 100% promotion
   opportunity (I/APZ), categorized as prisoners of war (POW), former POWs, missing in
   action (MIA), or formerly MIA (all zones); medal of honor recipients (all zones), and/or
   astronauts (all zones).
2.27. Re-establishing the ―Cut Lines. ‖ If necessary, after completion of the objective quality
review, the cut lines will be redrawn to ensure 5% of the records are in gray. Repeat steps in
2.26.1 if necessary.
2.28. BP Quality Review. The BP conducts a quality review of all records one score category
below the second cut line on each panel. This allows the BP to review records which are about to
be removed from further consideration by the board, but which are generally competitive. The
purpose of this quality review is to determine whether the records of individuals from special
skill or career groups identified in the MOI, such as joint duty officers, acquisition corps officers
and highly specialized officers who have had a comparatively narrow range of duties, have been
scored in a manner consistent with the MOI. The purpose of this review is also to determine
whether the record of every officer in this range has been afforded fair and equitable
consideration in the initial scoring, as directed by the MOI. If the BP determines that there is a
rational basis to conclude, from any such record together with its aggregate score, that the record
may not have been scored in a manner consistent with the MOI, the BP may direct that such
record be added to the "gray" for rescoring by the entire board along with all other records in the
gray. The BP may also add to the aggregate gray any record with a DP PRF, regardless of where
it falls in the order of merit below the second cut line.
2.29. Gray/Aggregate Gray Resolution. After the BP has conducted quality review, any
records he/she adds to the gray, as well as the grays from each panel, will then be aggregated for
the entire board to score. Scoring will be done as described in paragraph 2.18 After scoring, an
order of merit will be established and the remaining quotas applied to it. If records are tied at the
score that would result in promotion, this establishes a new "gray" zone. Continue to resolve any
"gray", without further BP quality review, until all available promotion opportunities are filled.
   2.29.1. Prior to scoring any records in the gray/aggregate gray, the BP will personally
   instruct all members to re-read the SECAF’s MOI. On single panel boards considering
   multiple competitive categories, the BP will only be required to instruct the panel to re-read
   the MOI during the first gray resolution. For subsequent gray resolutions, the recorder will
   instruct the panel to re-read the MOI. Board members will be made aware of this requirement
   during the first day briefing.
   2.29.2. During aggregate gray, records will be moved in stacks, panel to panel, when there
   are multiple panels; resolve splits within panels before moving records to the other panels.
 22                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   2.29.3. After resolving the gray, as necessary, break any ties immediately below the final cut
   line to determine the #1 I/APZ nonselect.
   2.29.4. Tentative I/APZ order of merit is now finalized pending BPZ scoring and BPZ
   displacement.
2.30. Scoring BPZ Records. Determine which of the BPZ records are Exceptionally Well
Qualified (EWQ) by voting "yes" or "no". After completion of EWQ process, score BPZ records
that received a majority "yes" vote from a panel, using the 6 to 10 scoring scale. Upon
completion of BPZ 6 to 10 scoring, establish cut lines, complete an objective quality review,
complete a BP quality review, establish the gray and resolve the gray using the same procedures
outlined in paragraph 2.29 above for the I/APZ records.
2.31. BPZ Displacement. The board will be advised that they are to determine whether the
BPZ quota will be used. The board is provided two records: the #1 I/APZ nonselect, and the
bottom BPZ select. (If necessary, break ties at the bottom of the BPZ select list to determine the
record to be compared to the #1 I/APZ nonselect.) Each board member identifies the name of the
officer that they determine to be best qualified for promotion. The process is by secret ballot,
without discussion, and majority vote decides the issue.
   2.31.1. If the BPZ record is determined to be best qualified the process ends, and the full
   BPZ quota will be used. This is because the board will have determined that the least
   meritorious BPZ selected record is better than the best nonselect I/APZ record, and therefore
   all BPZ selected records are better than all I/APZ nonselects. If the #1 I/APZ record is
   determined to be best qualified, this record becomes a select and the BPZ record is a
   nonselect. Then go to the new #1 nonselect I/APZ record and the new bottom BPZ select and
   repeat the process. Continue as necessary.
   2.31.2. The displacement process ends when a BPZ record is determined to be best qualified
   or the board runs out of BPZ quotas.
2.32. PME Candidacy. Apply PME selection numerical criteria guidance to order of merit(s)
to determine who will be given PME in residence opportunities. Resolve PME gray, if necessary.
2.33. Fully Qualified Select List. The board must confirm that all records selected for
promotion are fully qualified for promotion. To do this, have the entire board vote on whether
the #1 I/APZ nonselect record is fully qualified for promotion. If a majority of the board votes
"yes", the officers above the #1 I/ APZ nonselect and any BPZ selects are now considered "fully
qualified" for promotion. If a majority of the board vote "no", conduct a fully qualified
determination on both the bottom I/APZ select and bottom BPZ select records (when BPZ
applies). Continue voting on the lowest remaining selects until the record receives a majority
"yes" vote. The I/APZ and BPZ records that received a majority "no" vote will not be
recommended for promotion.
2.34. Resolution of Show Cause. After scoring is complete and a select/non-select list is
established, return to the original panel all records that were previously identified for Show
Cause determination. If a record is nominated for Show Cause during aggregate gray/gray
resolution, the record will be returned to the original panel for majority rule vote. Panel members
will discuss all Show Cause nominations and a majority rule vote will determine whether the
officer’s name will be included in the board report to the SECAF recommending he/she be
required to Show Cause for retention. If the panel makes a Show Cause recommendation, the
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          23


panel chairperson completes a Show Cause worksheet outlining the factors for the
recommendation. The BP reviews the results. If the BP determines that there is a rational basis to
conclude that any of these records may not have been voted upon in a manner consistent with the
SECAF MOI, he/she may direct that such records be returned to the original panels for revote.
The second vote will be used. If a record is recommended for promotion, that recommendation
overrides any pending Show Cause action and the record will not be returned to the original
panel.
2.35. Selective Continuation. Selective continuation ballots are generated for records that meet
SECAF eligibility criteria.
   2.35.1. Ensure letters to the promotion board and PRFs are removed from the records for the
   selective continuation board.
   2.35.2. Selective continuation board is briefed on the continuation eligibility criteria, SECAF
   policy, the relevant portions of the SECAF MOI, and applicable paragraphs in DODD
   1320.8.
   2.35.3. When continuation opportunity is 100%, score records using yes/no votes. If voting
   is not unanimous on a record, and a split cannot be resolved, majority vote rules. If the
   continuation opportunity is less than 100%, use a 6 to 10 point scoring scale, resolving any
   splits or gray as described above.
   2.35.4. The BP reviews results. If the BP determines that there is a rational basis to conclude
   that any of these records may not have been voted in a manner consistent with the applicable
   guidance, he/she may direct that such records be returned to the original panels for rescoring.
   The second score will be used.
2.36. Board Report. Board members, recorders, and administrative assistants will sign a board
report that conforms with the law and DoDI 1320.14 and includes lists of those selected, those
identified as causing their own nonselection by communication to the board, and those selected
to Show Cause for retention.
2.37. Additional Reports. After the board has completed and signed the reports, the Air Force
Selection Board Secretariat will prepare, for review by the SECAF and CSAF, a report of
selection rates for the following segments of the eligible population of officers (when
applicable): joint duty officers, acquisition corps officers, and race/ethnic group, gender.
2.38. Outbriefing Board Members. Recorders outbrief the board members (discuss cautions
and collect all notes). It is important that personal observations not jeopardize the credibility of
the board process and that Airmen receive a consistent Air Force message.
   2.38.1. The Selection Board Secretariat staff will inform board members and administrative
   assistants that all involved with the board process are prohibited from ever sharing their
   observations board proceedings (i.e., how many members voted, discussions about members’
   records, lists or statistics of results, who served on which panel).
   2.38.2. Board members and administrative assistants are encouraged to use the briefing
   slides provided by the Board Secretariat Staff to brief the board process and structure (i.e.,
   numbers considered, board organization, steps followed).
2.39. Board Anomalies. Procedural anomalies occurring during a board that may require
variation from established procedures require BP resolution. During the board, the BP may bring
 24                                                                AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


any matter to the attention of the SECAF, or designated representative, if he or she determines
that SECAF-level decision is required. The BP will advise the SECAF of any significant
procedural anomalies during his or her outbrief of the board. These responsibilities of the BP do
not limit in any way the right of a board member or Board Secretariat member to communicate
with the SECAF as provided by other authority. The Board President will make determinations
on availability of a primary board member if an alternate board member is required. The Board
President is the authorizing official for directing that a SECAF-approved alternate replace the
primary board member. The need for an alternate board member being called to replace a
primary board member will be treated as an anomaly and will follow guidelines specified in this
paragraph.
2.40. Lists. Lists will be made of all individuals whose records are within the initial "gray"
established statistically, all individuals who were considered by the BP during the BP Quality
Review, and all individuals who were added to the gray as a result of the BP's Quality Review.
These lists will not reflect specific scores or ranking within each category. These lists will be
filed with the formal record of the Board, but not made part of that record. They will be marked
"For Official Use Only". These records need not be released under Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) or the Privacy Act but could become subject to discovery in litigation.
2.41. Summary. These selection board procedures were developed to give all eligible officers
fair and equitable consideration, not for ease of administration.
2.42. Removing an Officer From a Board Report. If the SECAF or the SECDEF intends to
recommend removing an officer from a board report, under Title 10, U.S.C., Section 618, Action
on Reports of Selection Boards and the recommendation would include information not
presented to the board, make the information available to the officer. The authority to remove an
officer from a board report rests with the President. The officer will have a reasonable
opportunity to submit comments on that information to the officials making and reviewing the
recommendation. If the officer cannot have access to the information for reasons of national
security, or other lawful reason, the officer will, to the maximum extent practical, be provided
with an appropriate summary of the information. Specific procedures for commander initiated
actions are outlined in paragraph 5.13.
2.43. Releasing Board Information. HQ AFPC/DPPB and DPPPO release only the
recommendations of the board. They do not disclose board proceedings, including specific
information on how the board scored each record, to any individual not a member of the board,
except as required for the official processing of board results. They release information on the
number of officers considered and selected, board organization, the general procedures followed
by the board, the number of board members and their names, grades, and service components.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                        25

AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                         27


3.8. Notifying Officers Selected for Promotion.
   3.8.1. First Lieutenant. The commander notifies the officer of the projected promotion
   effective date at least 30 days in advance and advises him or her to assume the grade on the
   effective date, unless otherwise directed.
   3.8.2. When instructed by HQ AFPC/DPPPO (see paragraph 3.5.2.2 above) for promotion to
   captain through colonel, commanders notify officers either verbally or in writing (optional)
   of their selection status.
   3.8.3. After selection announcement:
       3.8.3.1. Captain. The commander advises the officer at least 30 days in advance of the
       date he or she can assume the higher grade.
       3.8.3.2. Major and Above. The commander advises the officer of the promotion after
       announcement of the monthly promotion increments or 30 days prior to the projected
       promotion date for MC and DC officers.
3.9. Notifying Officers Not Selected for Promotion. The commander notifies the officer of
promotion nonselection on the public release date, or as soon afterward as possible. Notify first
and second time nonselected officers to captain, major, or lieutenant colonel in writing and have
them acknowledge receipt within 5 workdays. (See paragraph 3.6.3 for processing instructions
after letter is signed by officer.) Commanders:
   3.9.1. Verbally notify officers not selected three or more times for promotion to major or
   lieutenant colonel, unless HQ AFPC/DPPPO provides other instructions.
   3.9.2. Verbally or in writing (optional) notify officers not selected for promotion to colonel.
   3.9.3. Do not notify officers nonselected for promotion BPZ.
   3.9.4. Ensure the notification memorandum for officers not selected IPZ and those not
   selected their first time APZ are informed of their option to receive nonselect counseling
   from HQ AFPC. HQ AFPC provides sample notification letters prior to each promotion
   release.
3.10. Effects of Nonselection for Promotion. Generally, officers not selected for promotion to
captain through lieutenant colonel for the second time are separated in accordance with AFI 36-
3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, unless they:
   3.10.1. Are retirement eligible or within 2 years of qualifying for retirement (i.e., in the
   sanctuary) as of the mandatory date of separation (DOS) established for officers twice
   nonselected for promotion by that board.
   3.10.2. Are selected for continuation.
   3.10.3. Have an earlier established DOS.
3.11. Publishing Promotion Orders. HQ AFPC/DPPPO publishes orders to announce the

 28                                                                   AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


3.13. Conducting Promotion Ceremonies. Hold pin-on ceremonies on the last duty day before
the effective date of an officer’s promotion. Hold such ceremonies as close to the end of the duty
day as possible. The promotion is not effective until the date specified on the promotion order
and the early ceremony will not affect the officer's pay, seniority, or entitlements. Commanders
may use Attachment 4 and Attachment 5 in planning the ceremony.
3.14. Retirement Restrictions for Promotion. Officers promoted to the grade of lieutenant
colonel or colonel must serve satisfactorily on active duty in that grade for at least 3 years to
retire in the higher grade. Officers promoted to the grade of major must serve satisfactorily on
active duty in that grade for at least 6 months to retire in the higher grade. Waivers are addressed
through channels to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
3.15. Active Duty Service Commitment for Promotions. No Active Duty Service
Commitment will be incurred for officer promotions (see paragraph 3.14 for restrictions on
retirement eligibility).
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                        29

                              SPECIAL PROMOTION ISSUES

4.1. Declining a Promotion. An officer may decline a promotion, in writing, NLT 2400 hours
on the day prior to the effective date of promotion. MPF Career Enhancement Element notifies
HQ AFPC/DPPPO, with information copy to AF/DPO and MAJCOM/A1 (colonel selects only),
when an officer initiates a declination. HQ AFPC/DPPPO will not honor declinations signed on
or after the effective date of promotion. EXCEPTION: An Officer selected for retroactive
promotion by an SSB, AF Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR), or because of
an administrative error, may decline the promotion NLT 2400 hours on the day following
notification of selection.
   4.1.1. Officers must sign two copies of a Declination of Promotion Statement (Attachment
   6).
   4.1.2. Officers who submit a declination statement and later decide to accept the promotion
   may request withdrawal of the declination statement if they have remained continuously on
   the ADL.
       4.1.2.1. Prior to the effective date of the promotion, an officer selected for promotion to
       lieutenant colonel and below, can submit a letter through the unit commander to MPF
       Career Enhancement Element, requesting withdrawal of the declination statement an
       officer who has declined promotion to the rank of colonel must submit a request to
       withdraw his or her declination through the Wing CC or equivalent and AF/DPO, prior to
       gaining MAJCOM approval. If the unit commander and/or MAJCOM commander
       approves, MPF Career Enhancement Element notifies HQ AFPC/ DPPPO to promote the
       officer. If the unit commander and/or MAJCOM commander does not want to promote
       the officer, he or she disapproves the request and initiates promotion propriety action.
       4.1.2.2. After the effective date of promotion, an officer can submit a letter through the
       unit commander and MPF Career Enhancement Element to the MAJCOM commander
       requesting withdrawal of the promotion declination (AF/DPO must coordinate on all
       colonel selects). If the MAJCOM commander approves the request, HQ AFPC/DPPPO
       will promote officers with an effective date and date of rank effective of the approval
       date. If disapproved by the MAJCOM commander, return the case file to the unit
       commander for promotion propriety action.
   4.1.3. Officers who decline a promotion remain on the promotion list for which they were
   selected.
4.2. Frocking (Early Pin-On).
   4.2.1. When to frock.
       4.2.1.1. Air Force policy is to not allow early pinning (commonly referred to as
       frocking), except only in specific circumstances where it is essential to effectively
       perform duties in the higher grade (usually in an international environment).
       4.2.1.2. Send requests for exception to these guidelines to HQ AFPC/DPPPO for
       frocking to major and lieutenant colonel, or to AFSLMO, Support Division, for frocking
30                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


     to colonel and above (see paragraph 12.1). Fully justify requests that do not meet the
     criteria below.
  4.2.2. Who approves Frocking.
     4.2.2.1. The Director, Senior Leadership Management Office                       (AFSLMO),
     approves/disapproves requests for early pinning of colonels and above.
     4.2.2.2. The Commander, Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC/CC)
     approves/disapproves requests for early pinning to major and lieutenant colonel.
  4.2.3. Restrictions for Early Pining. Officers cannot pin on the higher grade before the
  Senate confirms the list that contains the officer’s name. Additionally, officers are not
  authorized early pinning if selected for reassignment (i.e., permanent change of
  station/assignment (PCS/PCA)) and have an assignment selection date (ASD) where the
  projected billet is for the higher grade. Approval of early pinning requests does not normally
  occur if officers are in the position, performing these duties effectively, or are known in the
  lower grade.
     4.2.3.1. Prior to consideration for frocking, it should be determined if the officer was the
     ―best qualified‖ and/or sole volunteer for the higher graded position. In most instances
     frocking requests are only approved when an officer is being assigned to one of the
     following priority assignments:
         4.2.3.1.1. Positions with significant international involvement.
         4.2.3.1.2. Joint-duty positions where the officer is required to supervise more senior
         sister service officers.
         4.2.3.1.3. Group commander or above when the officer supervises higher grade
         officers.
  4.2.4. Do not submit frocking requests for the following circumstances:
     4.2.4.1. Where units knowingly fill grade specific requirements with a lower grade and
     the officer is later selected for promotion.
     4.2.4.2. Those instances where officers are already filling a permanent position or move
     to another position within the same organization.
     4.2.4.3. Frocking for TDY assignment or deployment, except in those cases where
     according to AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, paragraph 5.3.3.2.3, the
     Air Component through line remarks prohibits the officer grade requirements from being
     filled by a person having a grade lower than the required grade.
  4.2.5. Approval of early pin on:
     4.2.5.1. Allows the officer to wear the higher grade and benefit from the protocol of that
     grade.
     4.2.5.2. Does not authorize the officer to receive higher pay or entitlements.
     4.2.5.3. Does not authorize the officer to gain seniority on the active duty list.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                       31


       4.2.5.4. Frocked officers (except for general officers) will not receive performance
       reports or sign performance reports, recommendations, or similar administrative actions
       in the higher grade until actually promoted by sequence number.
       4.2.5.5. Frocked officers are authorized to be issued an identification card in the higher
       grade upon the effective date of early pinning approval. If applicable, family member
       identification cards may only be updated to reflect the same grade as the member’s card
       when reissued upon expiration or loss.
       4.2.5.6. Frocked officers and commanders should consult local staff judge advocate to
       resolve questions concerning other documents.
4.3. Posthumous Promotions. Title 10, U.S.C., section 1521(a) authorizes the posthumous
promotion of officers whose appointment or recommendation for promotion has been approved
by the SECAF, but the member was unable to accept because of death in the line of duty. No
person is entitled to any bonus, gratuity, pay, or allowance because of a posthumous promotion.
   4.3.1. Basic Criteria/Restrictions:
       4.3.1.1. Officer must be approved for promotion by the SECAF.
       4.3.1.2. A promotion propriety action must not be in effect against the officer.
   4.3.2. Only the President of the United States may authorize a posthumous promotion and
   processing may take a few months.
   4.3.3. Commanders send requests through command channels to the MPF Career
   Enhancement Element. The MPF Career Enhancement Element sends a priority message
   (MINIMIZE included) to the officer’s MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, with an information copy to
   HQ AFPC/DPPPO. The message must state the criteria in paragraph 4.3.1 has been met and
   verify family members have been advised no financial entitlements accrue as a result of a
   posthumous promotion. The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU forwards their recommendation to HQ
   AFPC/DPPPO for processing to the President for approval. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU may
   disapprove posthumous requests.
   4.3.4. The effective date for the posthumous promotion is the day the promotion board that
   selected the officer for promotion adjourned.
4.4. Transfering Promotions to an Active Duty Promotion List.
   4.4.1. An officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) who is on a promotion list as a
   result of selection for promotion by a mandatory promotion board or an SSB and, who before
   being promoted is placed on the Active Duty List (ADL) of the same Armed Force and
   placed in the same competitive category, shall be placed on an appropriate promotion list for
   officers on the ADL. The effective date of promotion and date of rank shall be the same as if
   the officer had been selected to the grade concerned by the promotion board for ADL officers
   and sequenced according to paragraph 3.7.1
       4.4.1.1. Promotions by a Position Vacancy (PV) or Federal Recognition Board may not
       be transferred to the ADL unless the officer is ordered to active duty as a member of the
       unit in which the vacancy exists when that unit is ordered to active duty.
   4.4.2. An officer transferred from another Military Service in the same competitive category
   who is on a promotion list to the next higher grade may be placed on an appropriate
32                                                              AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


  promotion list for officers on the Air Force ADL based on the officer’s DOR in his or her
  current grade in the losing Military Service. They will be sequenced according to paragraph
  3.7.1
     4.4.2.1. Officers will provide HQ AFPC/DPPPO documentation from the losing military
     branch verifying their selection for promotion to the higher grade.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          33


                                            Chapter 5

                           PROMOTION PROPRIETY ACTIONS

5.1. When to Question Promotions. Promotion is not a reward for past service. It is
advancement to a position of greater responsibility based on the requirements of the Air Force
and the officer’s future potential. If an officer has not met the requirement for exemplary conduct
set forth in 10 U.S.C. §8583 or is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified to
perform the duties of the next higher grade, it is in the best interest of the Air Force for the
proper authority to initiate action to delay the promotion, to find the officer not qualified for
promotion, or to remove the officer’s name from the promotion list. Early identification of the
officer and proper documentation are essential. Formal rules of evidence do not apply to a
promotion propriety action.
   5.1.1. If cause to believe an officer is not suited for promotion has arisen, do not await
   completion of disciplinary action, trial, or other administrative process to initiate promotion
   propriety action. Such action does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If one can
   fairly conclude from the evidence already at hand that an officer is unsuited for promotion, a
   removal action should be immediately initiated. If, on the other hand, circumstances suggest
   that an officer ―may‖ not be suited for promotion, and time is needed to develop more
   evidence on the question, a promotion delay should be initiated.
   5.1.2. Where removal action is appropriate, even if an officer declines a promotion, initiate
   removal action because the officer’s name otherwise remains on the list. (Declination
   procedures are outlined in AFI 36-2501, paragraph 4.1)
5.2. How to Document Reasons for the Action. A propriety action must clearly state the
reasons for the action and be accompanied by documentation substantiating those reasons. In
stating the reasons, be as specific as possible; do not rely on generalization. Moreover, if an
officer has been the subject of an adverse action, the stated reasons should focus on what it is the
officer did or failed to do for which the adverse action was imposed. Do not merely recount that
the officer was the subject of an adverse action. For example, one should state, ―You posted a
photo of yourself in the nude on the internet, for which you received an Article 15‖ and NOT an
over-generalized ―You engaged in conduct unbecoming,‖ or a reference only to the adverse
action such as, ―You received an Article 15.‖
   5.2.1. To create a sufficient record supporting the action, attach documentation consisting of
   primary source material such as ROI (report of investigation) extracts, witness and member
   statements or memos for records, ROT (record of trial) extracts (like stipulations of fact and
   guilty plea statements), incriminating e-mail correspondence or video recordings, and copies
   of forged/falsified/fraudulent statements or financial documents. Do not merely attach an AF
   Form 3070, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings, or other disciplinary or adverse
   action without also attaching reasonably available evidence of the underlying misconduct or
   substandard duty performance.
SECTION A – Promotion List Removals and Delays
5.3. Initiating Authorities. An officer’s immediate commander normally initiates a promotion
list removal or delay recommendation. (An officer’s higher level Air Force military commanders
have concurrent authority to initiate such actions). Note: A squadron section commander is not
 34                                                                   AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


the officer’s commander for purposes of these actions unless the commander is equal to or senior
in grade to the affected officer.
   5.3.1. The next superior commander serves as the reviewing commander. The ―next superior
   commander‖ is the first military commander in the initiating commander’s Air Force chain of
   command who is at least a wing-level or equivalent commander. Where actions are initiated
   by a wing commander or equivalent or higher commander, the initiating commander is also
   the reviewing commander.
   5.3.2. The 11th Wing Commander serves as the initiating and reviewing commander for all
   officers assigned to: Headquarters U.S. Air Force; Office of the Secretary of the Air Force;
   Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Department of Defense; all Field Operating Agencies and
   Direct Reporting Units identified in Department of the Air Force Special Order GA-014, 12
   Sep 97 (or successor order); and Agencies and activities outside the Air Force where the
   officer is neither assigned nor attached to an Air Force element commanded by an Air Force
   O-6 or higher ranking Air Force officer.
5.4. Delaying a Promotion. Delaying an officer’s promotion is applicable to officers eligible
for promotion to first lieutenant and captain, or selected for promotion by a Central Selection
Board or SSB to the grades of captain through colonel. A commander takes action to delay a
promotion if there is cause to believe that the officer has not met the requirement for exemplary
conduct set forth in Title 10, U.S.C. 8583 or is not mentally, physically, morally, or
professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher grade. Promotions can also be
delayed if: (1) sworn charges against an officer have been received by an officer exercising
general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer and such charges have not been disposed of;
(2) an investigation is being conducted to determine whether disciplinary action of any kind
should be brought against an officer; (3) a board of officers has been convened under Title 10,
U.S.C., Chapter 60, to review the record of an officer; (4) a criminal proceeding in a Federal or
State court is pending against the officer; or (5) substantiated adverse information about the
officer that is material to the decision to appoint the officer is under review by the Secretary of
Defense or the Secretary of the Air Force. A commander takes action to delay the promotion
until it is determined whether an officer should be promoted. The delay of promotion is effective
when the commander notifies the officer of the delay, either verbally or in writing. Accomplish
this notification prior to the effective date of the promotion. Note: When an officer has a
projected date of rank and effective date prior to public release of a board, notification should be
made on the day prior to public release date. A commander initiates action to delay an officer’s
promotion by following the steps detailed in paragraphs 5.6 and 5.7
   5.4.1. Initial Delays: The reviewing commander may approve an initial delay, up to 6
   months from the officer's original effective date of promotion. The officer may make a
   written statement in memorandum format to the SECAF, via the reviewing commander, in
   response to the recommended delay action. Alternatively, the reviewing commander may
   convert the action from a recommended delay to a recommended removal by simply
   recommending removal and processing the file as a removal in accordance with paragraph
   5.7.3 After indorsement, the reviewing commander sends the memorandum electronically to
   AF/A1PPP (afa1ppp.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) for AF/JA and SAF/GC coordination
   and SECAF (or designee) action.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          35


       5.4.2. Extension of Delays: SAF/MRB (or other designee) must approve all extensions
       of the initial delay (even if the initial delay was less than 6 months). SAF/MRB may
       grant extensions (in 6 month increments) up to 18 months (initial delay plus extension)
       from the effective date of the officer's original promotion. Alternatively, SAF/MRB may
       forward the case file to SECAF (or designee) with a recommendation that the proposed
       extension of delay be converted to a removal action.
       5.4.3. Resolving a Promotion Delay. When a reviewing commander initiates a
       promotion delay, it remains in effect until terminated by proper authority. Commanders
       may initiate action to end the delay at any time by using AF Form 4364 and following the
       steps detailed in paragraphs 5.6. and 5.7.
           5.4.3.1. Except as discussed in paragraph 5.4.3.2, only SECAF (or designee) may
           end a promotion delay. Notwithstanding the commander’s recommendation, SECAF
           (or designee) may promote an officer on his or her original effective date; promote an
           officer with a date of rank adjustment; extend the officer’s promotion delay; or
           remove the officer from the promotion list.
           5.4.3.2. A reviewing commander may terminate a delay only when the delay was
           initiated to conduct an investigation or inquiry, and upon completion, there was no
           finding or conclusion that substantiated or partially substantiated any allegations and
           no disciplinary action of any kind (administrative, nonjudicial, or judicial) is taken
           against the officer.
           5.4.3.3. A reviewing commander may disapprove and terminate an action to resolve
           a promotion delay only if the initiating commander’s recommendation is considered
           premature.
   5.4.4. Adjustment of Date of Rank. Upon termination of a delay or removal action, SECAF
   (or designee) may determine the officer did not meet standards for promotion during part of
   any period of delay during which the action was processed. In that event, SECAF (or
   designee) may adjust the officer’s promotion effective date and date of rank to reflect the
   date upon which the officer ultimately did meet standards.
           5.4.4.1. If the commander determines the officer was unqualified for promotion
           during part of the delay period, the commander may recommend an adjustment to the
           officer's date of rank and effective date. The commander initiates the action by using
           AF Form 4364 and following the steps detailed in paragraphs 5.6 and 5.7 prior to the
           end of the promotion delay. Commanders document the reason(s) why, as of the
           recommended adjusted date of rank, the officer meets standards and is qualified for
           promotion.
       5.4.4.2. (DELETED)
5.5. Removing First Lieutenants through Lieutenant Colonels from a Promotion List. A
commander initiates action to remove an officer’s name from a promotion list when a
preponderance of the evidence shows that the officer has not met the requirement for exemplary
conduct set forth in Title 10, U.S.C. 8583 or is not mentally, physically, morally, or
professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher grade. Even if the officer declines the
promotion, initiate removal action since his or her name remains on the list (declination
procedures are in paragraph 4.1).
 36                                                                AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   5.5.1. A commander initiates action to remove an officer's name from a promotion list by
   following the steps detailed in paragraphs 5.6 and 5.7 SECAF (or designee), acting for the
   President, approves all removal actions. SECAF (or designee) may, in lieu of removal, also
   approve a delay, terminate the action, or terminate the action with a date of rank adjustment.
   If SECAF (or designee) disapproves the removal action, but determines the officer did not
   meet standards for promotion during part of the delay period during which the removal was
   processed, SECAF (or designee) may adjust the officer's promotion effective date and date of
   rank as described in paragraph 5.4.4 Initiation of removal action automatically delays an
   officer’s promotion until SECAF makes a decision on the action.
   5.5.2. When an officer is considered and selected IPZ or APZ, but later removed from a
   report of a selection board or a promotion list, the removal is deemed a non-selection for
   promotion.
       5.5.2.1. Promote officers selected by the next board, upon Senate confirmation, based on
       his or her seniority on the new promotion list.
       5.5.2.2. Officers not selected by the next board, or if selected and again removed from a
       report of a selection board or the promotion list, are determined to have been twice non-
       selected for promotion.
       5.5.2.3. Officers considered and selected BPZ but subsequently removed do not incur a
       non-selection for promotion.
5.6. How to Initiate a Promotion List Removal, Delay, or Resolution of Delay Action. The
initiating commander informs the officer of the recommendation using AF Form 4363, Record of
Promotion Propriety Action, (with applicable supporting documentation) for promotion removal
and delays before the effective date of promotion. When the officer is not immediately available,
verbal notification is sufficient, however, written notification (AF Form 4363) must follow as
soon as possible. An action begun as a delay may be converted by higher authority to a removal.
An action begun as a removal may also be converted by higher authority to a delay. Accordingly,
the AF Form 4363 notifies the member that regardless of the initiating commander’s
recommendation, the action may result in a delay or a removal. AF Form 4364 is used to resolve
promotion delays. It is processed in the same manner as the AF Form 4363 under paragraph 5.7.
5.7. How to Process Promotion List Removal or Delay Actions.
   5.7.1. Initiating Commander:
       5.7.1.1. Consults with servicing personnel advisor and staff judge advocate (SJA) prior
       to notifying the officer.
       5.7.1.2. Ensures case file contains all supporting documentation. Reproduced or
       electronically transmitted copies are encouraged, and must be legible.
       5.7.1.3. Notifies the officer, who acknowledges receipt.
       5.7.1.4. Allows the officer 5 working days to respond to the notification. Only the
       initiating commander may grant an extension to the response time. Written delay requests
       and indorsements become part of the case file.
       5.7.1.5. Immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPSOO by sending the AF Form 4363 to
       offromo@randolph.af.mil electronically to prevent erroneous pay in MilPDS. Note: HQ
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                      37


     AFPC/ DPSOO will forward the AF Form 4363 to AF/DPO if the officer is a colonel
     select.
     5.7.1.6. Ensures officer marks his or her response on AF Form 4363 and includes the
     officer’s written response, if any, as part of the case file.
     5.7.1.7. After the officer has responded to the initial notification, either terminates the
     action or forwards to servicing SJA for a legal sufficiency review. If the action is
     terminated, the commander notifies the officer and provides an e-mail update to HQ
     AFPC/DPSOO.
  5.7.2. Staff Judge Advocate: Determines legal sufficiency. Signs AF Form 4363 and
  forwards case file to the reviewing commander for action. (No independent written legal
  review is prepared. If the file is not legally sufficient, the initiating commander is orally
  advised as to necessary corrective actions.)
  5.7.3. Reviewing Commander (Wing Commander or Equivalent):
     5.7.3.1. Gives the officer an opportunity to comment on all derogatory information
     added after the officer first reviews and acknowledges the initial recommendation, unless
     the information originated solely from the officer's personnel record.
         5.7.3.2. Reviews the officer propriety action and renders a final decision (initial
         delay or termination) or forwards a recommendation to AF/A1PP for action by
         SECAF (or designee) (removal, delay extension, termination of delay, or date of rank
         adjustment).
     5.7.3.3. Immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPSOO by sending the AF Form 4363 to
     offpromo@randolph.af.mil electronically.
     5.7.3.4. If the reviewing commander approves an initial delay or terminates the action,
     the case file is returned to the initiating commander who obtains the officer’s
     acknowledgment of the action on the form. For initial delay actions, the initiating
     commander then sends the original hard copy case file with attachments to HQ
     AFPC/DPSOO. For terminations, the initiating commander provides a scanned copy of
     the acknowledged form to HQ AFPC/DPSOO.
     5.7.3.5. If the reviewing commander recommends action by SECAF, the case file, with
     attachments, is forwarded electronically, to AF/A1PPP. Records less than 25 pages
     should normally be scanned and routed electronically.
         5.7.3.5.1. If the case file is forwarded electronically to AF/A1PPP, the original case
         file with attachments is mailed to HQ AFPC/DPSOO.
         5.7.3.5.2. If the entire case file is more than 25 pages or cannot feasibly be scanned
         and sent electronically, then forward the signed AF Form 4363/4364 electronically to
         AF/A1PPP and express mail the entire original case file, with attachments, to
         AF/A1PPP.
  5.7.4. AF/A1PPP: Upon receipt, provides copy to AF/A1P and forwards package to AF/JA
  and SAF/ GC.
  5.7.5. AF/JA & SAF/GC: Review for legal sufficiency, provide comments as necessary, and
  annotate the AF Form 4363.
 38                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   5.7.6. SECAF (or designee): Makes final decision, completes AF Form 4363 and returns
   case file to AF/A1PPP.
   5.7.7. AF/A1PPP: Forwards the completed package to HQ AFPC/DPSOO.
   5.7.8. HQ AFPC/DPSOO: Notifies initiating commander of the SECAF’s (or designee’s)
   decision by sending the commander the completed AF Form 4363. Final MilPDS updates are
   made at this point and a copy of the case file is maintained at AFPC.
   5.7.9. Initiating Commander: Notifies the officer of the SECAF’s (or designee’s) final
   decision by providing a completed copy of the AF Form 4363, obtaining the officer’s
   acknowledgement on the form, and returns the copy of the acknowledged form to HQ
   AFPC/DPSOO.
5.8. Address for sending promotion list removal and delay actions. If mailing these officer
propriety actions use the appropriate addresses indicated below:
– AFPC/DPSOO, 550 C. Street West, Suite 8, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4710. Email:
offpromo@randolph.af.mil
– AF/A1PPP, 1040 AF Pentagon, Room 4D950, Washington DC 20330. Email:
afa1ppp.workflow@pentagon.af.mil.


SECTION B – Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP) Actions
5.9. Recommending a Second Lieutenant NQP. When the preponderance of the evidence
shows an officer has not met the requirement for exemplary conduct set forth in Title 10, U.S.C.
8583 or is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified to perform the duties of
the higher grade, the commander recommends in writing that the SecAF find him or her NQP.
   5.9.1. An officer’s commander initiates a NQP recommendation. See sample notification
   letters at Attachment 9 and Attachment 10. The major commander reviews these actions as
   outlined in Table 5.1
       5.9.1.1. The commander informs the officer of the NQP recommendation, either verbally
       or in writing, before the promotion effective date (see definition, Attachment 1), unless
       the promotion has been effectively delayed according to paragraph 5.4 The notification
       must state if it is necessary for special processing under AFI 31-501, Personnel Security
       Program Management (concerning sensitive compartmented information [SCI] access).
       Once the officer is notified (verbally or in writing) the commander immediately notifies
       HQ AFPC/DPSOO to prevent erroneous pay in MilPDS.
       5.9.1.2. If involuntary separation or court-martial is pending, the NQP action must be
       flagged to permit SECAF to hold decision on the NQP action in abeyance pending
       resolution of the other action. This will avoid automatic discharge of the officer. If the
       other action does not result in separation, the NQP action will be processed to
       completion.
       5.9.1.3. Separate an officer within 18 months of the date first found NQP if he or she is
       NQP. Commanders should give them a reasonable opportunity to overcome the basis for
       their non-qualification before taking separation action. Try to retain on active duty for 6
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          39


       months a second lieutenant found NQP, starting on the date the promotion would have
       occurred, unless retention is inconsistent with good order and discipline.
       5.9.1.4. The commander can request SECAF approval to retain the officer beyond 6
       months for additional observation. Initiate request to arrive at HQ AFPC/DPSOO NLT
       45 days before expiration of the initial 6-month period. SECAF can retain the officer for
       up to 18 months from the date first found NQP.
       5.9.1.5. If the commander determines the officer is NQP by the end of the 6-month
       period, separate him or her according to AFI 36-3207.
       5.9.1.6. If during the retention period, the commander determines the officer is qualified
       for promotion, then promote the officer upon major commander approval. The promotion
       is effective upon meeting time-in-grade requirements or the date the major commander
       determined the officer fully qualified for promotion, whichever is later.
       5.9.1.7. The commander informs the officer when retention is inconsistent with good
       order and discipline. Advise the officer of the rationale supporting the belief, in writing,
       and that he or she is subject to immediate separation, as determined by the SECAF.
5.10. Recommending Captains through Lieutenant Colonels NQP. (For officers meeting a
central selection board). Process the case file in time to arrive at HQ AFPC/DPSOO before the
board convenes. This recommendation is valid for only one selection board.


SECTION C – Other Promotion Proprietary Actions
5.11. Removing an Officer from a Report of a Selection Board. The following guidelines
apply for removing an officer from a report of a selection board after the board has adjourned,
but prior to the board report being approved by the President. It is applicable to officers selected
for promotion to major through colonel.
   5.11.1. When a commander becomes aware of any derogatory information concerning an
   officer who met a selection board, the commander should contact his servicing staff judge
   advocate to determine if the evidence is sufficient to support removal of the officer’s name
   from the selection board report. The evidence should focus on the officer’s conduct and/or
   performance; it should not focus on the fact (or status) of any other disciplinary or
   administrative action that might also be going on.
   5.11.2. If there is sufficient evidence to support the removal of the officer’s name from the
   report of the selection board, the commander must immediately report the information for
   expeditious processing.
       5.11.2.1. Notify the MPF Commander, who will immediately up channel to the
       MAJCOM Director of Personnel (A1). Note: MAJCOMs may develop their own internal
       reporting procedures; however, it is essential the MPF is made aware of the situation.
       5.11.2.2. The MAJCOM A1 will immediately contact HQ AFPC/DPSOO and apprise
       them of the situation. The key point is to ensure the most expeditious notification to HQ
       AFPC.
       5.11.2.3. The information received will be provided to the SECAF for action. If the
       evidence is deemed sufficient to support a removal action, the Secretary will then forward
 40                                                                     AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


          a letter of intent to the commander with a proposed letter of notification from the
          commander to the officer. Any information that was not presented to the board will be
          attached to the notification letter. Afford the officer a reasonable opportunity to submit
          comments on that information to the officials making and reviewing the recommendation.
          If the officer cannot be given access to the information for reasons of national security,
          the officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be provided with an appropriate
          summary of the information.
          5.11.2.4. Once the officer has responded to the letter of intent to remove his name from
          the report of the selection board, the commander will forward the notification letter and
          its attachment(s), along with the officer’s response, through the MAJCOM commander,
          to HQ AFPC/DPSOO. The Secretary will review all the information presented and make
          a recommendation to PDUSD (P&R) who, in turn, will notify the President. The
          President is the approval authority for removing an officer’s name from the reports of
          selection boards. If the recommendation is to remove the officer’s name from the report
          of the selection board, the Secretary will deem whether the adverse information will be
          reported to the Senate.
          5.11.2.5. The officer will be notified through appropriate channels of the final decision.
          5.11.2.6. Refer to paragraph 5.5.2 for what a removal does.
5.12. Promotion Deviation from Sequence Number Order. Officers on a promotion list may
have their nominations or confirmations held up for many reasons. If a situation arises where an
officer is not confirmed and promotions from the list begin, the Air Force may temporarily
bypass the unconfirmed officers. Once confirmation occurs, this bypassed officer’s promotion
effective date will be established, for all purposes, to restore this officer to his or her original
place on the promotion list.

              for the action with supporting
              documents attached; that the officer
              must acknowledge receipt and
              understanding within a reasonable
              period of time (usually 5 workdays);
              that the officer may submit a
              statement in his or her behalf,
              including supporting documents.
3             Notify the officer, in writing (see   X
              note 1), that the officer's promotion
              won't become effective until the
              approval authority makes a decision;
              that the officer may not assume the
              higher grade even if his or her name
              appears on a promotion order.
4             Notify the officer, in writing (see   X
              note 1) not later than the expiration
              of the NQP, if the initiating
              commander determines the officer
              did not meet standards during any
              part of the NQP period. The letter of
              notification shall include that the
              initiating Commander is
              recommending adjustment of the
              officer's effective date of promotion
              and CGDOR (both dates must be the
              same), that the officer may assume
              the higher grade and give a tentative
              effective date of promotion and
              CGDOR equal to the expiration
              NQP, pending adjustment decision
              by the SECAF, confirm the effective
              date of promotion and CGDOR
              through command channels from the
              SECAF.
5             Notify the officer, in writing (see    X
              note 1), that if the recommended
              action is approved, the officer is
              subject to discharge under AFI 36-
              3207.
6             Notify the officer, in writing (see        X
              note 1), that if the major commander
              or delegated authority (see note 4)
              supports the recommended action,
 42                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


                   the selection board will use the
                   correspondence in evaluating the
                   officer's selection folder.

               date of promotion and CGDOR
               (both dates must be the same).
               Notify the officer, in writing, of the
               recommended adjustment not later
               than the expiration of NQP period.

                   is eligible) or comply with other
                   instructions from the SECAF if the
                   recommended action was not
                   approved. Return case file to the
                   major commander
25 HQ AFPC/ Take action according to paragraph X
   DPSOS    5.12. if SECAF approved the action
            to find a second lieutenant not
            qualified.
1. If there is not enough time to prepare a written notification because of the officer's projected
effective date of promotion, the commander may inform the officer verbally that action has been
or will be started. Provide written confirmation as soon as possible (usually within 24 duty
hours). Once the officer is notified (verbally or in writing), the commander immediately notifies
HQ AFPC/DPSOO to prevent erroneous pay in MilPDS (see Table 5.1., rule 7). See processing
guidelines in Table 5.1.
2. The officer must acknowledge receipt and submit any statements on his or her behalf within a
reasonable period of time (usually 5 workdays) after receiving written notification. Officers send
fully justified requests to extend the date required to respond to the propriety action to the
initiating commander, in writing, prior to the date listed on the notification memorandum.
Initiating commanders indorse this request in writing; however, they have the option to
disapprove extensions after consulting with the SJA and/or ADC. Commanders provide MPF
Career Enhancement Element a copy of the extension to monitor the status of the action. The
response delay requests/ approval become part of the case file as it is forwarded through
channels to HQ AFPC.
3. For reassignments, the losing MPF Career Enhancements Element notifies the gaining MPF,
with information to the gaining MAJCOM, that promotion propriety action has been started. The
officer's parent MAJCOM at the time of initiation of the propriety action is the command
channel for processing the action.
4. Unless otherwise directed by SECAF, a commander (down to and including wing or
equivalent commanders) may terminate an action to find an officer NQP, or adjust the CGDOR
and effective date, anytime before the major commander reviews the case.
5. Construct in chronological order a case file before sending it to HQ AFPC/DPSOO. It must
include all necessary documents and they must be easy to read. Include a detailed case synopsis
suitable for review by the approval authority (SECAF) that references pertinent and tabbed docu-
ments, statements, or other significant matters as part of the case file. Prepare all not qualified to
first lieutenant cases to arrive at HQ AFPC/DPSOO in two legible copies (original plus one). For
all other NQPs, forward only the original copy.
6. Commanders considering NQP action on a second lieutenant having access to SCI (to include
an officer debriefed within 3 years), Single Integrated Operations Plan--Extra Sensitive
Information (SIOP-ESI), or other special access programs must comply with AFI 31-501 and
ensure the access granting authority reviews the proposed promotion propriety action as in
paragraph 5.9.1.1. The commander's letter of notification must indicate coordination with the
access granting authority is complete, will be completed, or that such action is not applicable.
 46                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


7. MPFs must state in the message actions taken under AFI 31-501, or state that such action is
not applicable.
8. MPFs must hold the case file in abeyance if coordination with the access granting authority is
required but not yet received. The case file should indicate completed coordination when
forwarded to the next echelon.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                        47



                                           Chapter 6

                          SPECIAL SELECTION BOARDS (SSB)

6.1. Holding SSBs. HQ AFPC/DPPB conducts promotion SSBs to consider officers who were
improperly considered, or not considered, by one or more Central Selection Boards or quarterly
captain selection processes. Use SSBs for active duty, separated, or retired officers if eligible
according to paragraph 6.3 SSBs replicate central selection boards, to include pre- and post-
board procedures and policies as outlined in Chapter 1 through Chapter 5 of this instruction, to
the maximum extent possible.
6.2. SSB Approval Authority.
   6.2.1. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or a federal court
   can direct an officer for consideration by SSB.
   6.2.2. The Chief, Promotion, Evaluation, and Recognition Division (HQ AFPC/DPPP) can
   approve an eligible officer for consideration by SSB.
6.3. Conditions That May Warrant an SSB. Grant SSBs for promotion to the grade of captain
through colonel based on:
   6.3.1. Legal, Administrative, and Material Errors. Acting on behalf of the SECAF, HQ
   AFPC/DPPP and HQ AFPC/DPPPO can direct an SSB for an officer if it is determined:
       6.3.1.1. The action of the board that considered the officer was contrary to law or
       involved material error of fact or material administrative error; or
       6.3.1.2. The board did not consider material information that should have been available
       in compliance with pertinent Air Force directives and policies.
       6.3.1.3. An eligible officer did not meet a board or met the board in an incorrect
       promotion zone or competitive category.
   6.3.2. Pursuant to Formal Appeal. The AFBCMR can grant SSBs when they determine an
   officer's nonselection for promotion resulted because of an error or injustice in the officer's
   record.
   6.3.3. Exercising Reasonable Diligence. Do not have an SSB if, by exercising reasonable
   diligence, the officer should have discovered the error or omission and could have taken
   corrective action before the originally scheduled board convened.
6.4. Submitting Appeals for SSBs. Officers submit applications for SSBs using DD Form 149,
Application for Correction of Military Record, under the provisions of Title 10, U.S.C.,
Section 1552 and AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board For Correction of Military Records; or, AF
IMT 948, Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Report, under the provisions of
AFI 36-2401, Correcting Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports.
6.5. SSB Procedures. SSBs:
   6.5.1. Consist of officers who meet qualifications outlined in paragraph 1.1.1.3 and who are
   a diverse representation of MAJCOMs, career areas, and for the line competitive category,
   aeronautical rating.
 48                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   6.5.2. Consider the records of officers as they would have appeared to the original board had
   the officers been properly considered. Compare the officers' records with benchmark records
   from the original boards (paragraph 3.3.3).
   6.5.3. Use the scoring procedures outlined in paragraphs 2.17 and 2.18
   6.5.4. Select an officer if the SSB finds him or her fully qualified for promotion and if his or
   her record scores higher than all the nonselect records and ties at least one of the selected
   records from the original board.
   6.5.5. Identify any officer considered by the board whose record, in the opinion of the
   majority of the members of the board, indicates the officer should "Show Cause" for his or
   her retention on active duty (AFI 36-3206).
   6.5.6. Provide a report according to paragraph 2.36 A separate board report is written for
   each board being reconstituted.
6.6. Selection by an SSB. Normally, an officer considered by an SSB is selected if the SSB
finds him/her fully qualified for promotion and if his/her record scores higher than all the
nonselect benchmark records and ties, or beats at least one of the select benchmark records.
   6.6.1. When SECAF determines it is necessary, he/she may, prior to the convening of the
   SSB, direct the use of a different selection methodology.
   6.6.2. When the promotion opportunity at the original board was 100% (fully qualified
   method of selection), an officer considered by an SSB is selected if the SSB finds him/her
   fully qualified for promotion.
6.7. Time Limits.
   6.7.1. SECAF will either convene an SSB or deny SSB consideration within six months of
   receipt of a complete and properly executed request for SSB consideration.
   6.7.2. SECAF will take final action on the Report of an SSB, in accordance with Title 10,
   U.S.C, Section 618(a), within six months of convening the board.
   6.7.3. SECAF may extend the time limits in paragraphs 6.7.1 and 6.7.2 in a particular case or
   category of cases, for not more than an additional six months each, when he/she determines
   that a longer period for consideration is warranted. SECAF may not delegate the authority to
   make this determination.
6.8. Writing Letters to SSBs.
   6.8.1. Mail letters to the SSB Program Section (HQ AFPC/PBX) to arrive not later than
   2359 Central Standard Time (CST) the day prior to the board convening date.
   6.8.2. For individuals meeting more than one SSB, prepare and mail separate letters to each
   board.
   6.8.3. Address letters to: CY (insert the appropriate year and grade), HQ AFPC/DPPPO, 550
   C Street West, Suite 8, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4710. (NOTE: To preserve anonymity, do
   not date the letter and do not address the letter to the “Special Selection Board”.)
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          49


   6.8.4. Letters with attachments will not exceed 10 pages total combined: 5 two-sided pages
   or 10 one-sided pages. Letters and attachments exceeding 10 pages total will be returned to
   the officers.
6.9. Commander Actions on SSBs.
   6.9.1. Advise officers of SSB results.
   6.9.2. Determine the propriety of promotion and, if appropriate, initiate action outlined in
   Chapter 5. This applies even if the officer’s date of rank will be effective upon public
   release (promotion to captain) or Senate confirmation (for promotion to major and above).
   This does not apply to those officers who have served or are already serving in the selected
   grade.
6.10. Promoting Officers by SSB. PDUSD (P&R) is the approval authority for all SSBs.
Promote officers upon PDUSD (P&R) approval (to Captain only) or Senate confirmation (if
required). Promote the officer with a date of rank and effective date he or she would have
received if considered and selected by the original board. The member, based on his or her
retroactive promotion by SSB, may be eligible for further consideration by selection boards,
provided he or she meets the eligibility criteria.
   6.10.1. When promotion results in the actual or constructive reinstatement on active duty of
   an officer who had been separated, any entitlement to back active duty pay and allowances
   accruing to the officer will be subject to an appropriate offset for civilian earnings, and other
   offsets authorized by law.
6.11. Disclosing SSB Proceedings. Release of information is the same as central selection
boards (see paragraph 2.43).

   the officer:
       7.9.1.1. Can retire, or is in the retirement sanctuary, as a commissioned officer by the
       mandatory date of separation for the associated promotion board. EXCEPTION: Officers
       possessing a critical skill may be offered continuation beyond their mandatory retirement
       date. Individuals not selected, or those who decline the continuation offer, will revert to
       their previous sanctuary or retirement status.
 52                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


   7.9.2. Commanders, based on mission essential needs, can also request the continuation of
   lieutenant colonels or colonels past mandatory date of separation (see paragraph 7.12).
   Requests must include the officer’s concurrence.
7.10. Selecting an Officer for Continuation. All officers recommended for continuation must
meet a selective continuation board that will ultimately be forwarded to SECAF for final
approval. Normally, the Central Selection Board that nonselected the officer for promotion a
second time also considers the officer for continuation. Depending on Air Force requirements,
stand alone continuation boards may be held to continue officers past their mandatory retirement
date.
   7.10.1. Lieutenant colonels and colonels recommended for continuation by commanders will
   meet the first available selective continuation board after the package is received at HQ
   AFPC/DPPPO in accordance with paragraph 7.12 below.
7.11. Determining Continuation Period.
   7.11.1. The SECAF determines the actual length of the continuation period. The
   continuation period may differ dependent upon the individual’s grade and specialty.
   Captains, who possess critical skills, will not be continued longer than the last day of the
   month in which they complete 20 years total active commissioned service.
   7.11.2. Continue majors until the last day of the month in which he or she is eligible to retire
   as an officer (normally upon completion of 20 years of total active military service). Majors
   who possess critical skills may not be continued any longer than the last day of the month in
   which they complete 24 years of active commissioned service. EXCEPTION: Initially
   continue MC/DC majors for three years. Further continue MC/DC officers for 3-year periods
   until they are within 6 years of retirement. When MC/DC officers are within 6 years of
   retirement, continue them until the last day of the month in which they can retire as an
   officer.
   7.11.3. Normally, the continuation period begins on the 1st day of the 7th month from the
   approval of the board results. For officers being further continued, the continuation period
   begins on the first day following the completion of their initial continuation period. For
   officers who are in the retirement sanctuary or retirement eligible, the continuation period
   normally begins on the first day following the 20-year DOS.
   7.11.4. Twice-deferred officers who are offered selective continuation to normal (20 year)
   retirement and turn it down are not authorized to receive involuntary separation pay.
7.12. Requesting Continuation For Officers In The Grade of Lieutenant Colonel or
Colonel. The SECAF is final approval authority for all continuation recommendations. To be
eligible, an officer must possess a unique skill or knowledge required for a special project whose
loss would have a severe impact on the Air Force.
   7.12.1. Commanders forward the request (with subject officer’s concurrence statement)
   through the chain of command to the MAJCOM commander. NOTE: Any commander in the
   chain of command can disapprove the request.
   7.12.2. If the MAJCOM commander recommends approval, the request is indorsed and sent
   to HQ AFPC/DPPPO for lieutenant colonels or AFSLMO for colonels. HQ AFPC/DPPPO
   will forward requests on lieutenant colonels to HQ AFPC/DPA to validate the justification
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           53


   and obtain their indorsement. AFSLMO will validate the justification on colonels and indorse
   the request to HQ AFPC/ DPPPO. DPPPO will process the request to meet the next
   scheduled selective continuation board.
   7.12.3. The selective continuation board recommends approval                    or   disapproval;
   recommendation is forwarded to the SECAF for final decision.
       7.12.3.1. If approved, the officer remains on active duty for the shortest period needed to
       complete the specific project, but for no longer than a maximum of 5 years beyond
       mandatory retirement. Also, do not extend any officer beyond their 62nd birthday (60th
       birthday for Reserve officers).
7.13. Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) Agreement. There is no ADSC associated
with continuation.
7.14. Status of Continued Officers. Continued officers will remain eligible for subsequent
promotion boards provided they remain otherwise eligible. They also remain eligible for
reassignment, TDY, schools, and training if the officer(s) completes the associated ADSC before
his/her mandatory retirement date or DOS. Do not assign to education or training courses of
more than 30 consecutive days unless they have the retainability to fulfill the ADSC associated
with assignment and education or training according to AFI 36-2110, Assignments. Continued
officers not promoted or continued shall be discharged or retired on the first day of the first
month following the month in which the officer completes their period of continued service.
7.15. Continuation to Retirement Eligibility. For retirement purposes, continuation is to 20
years TAFMS.
7.16. Termination of Continued Status. Terminate continuation when the officer is
discharged; released from active duty, and retired; or the officer is selected for promotion to a
higher grade; or when terminated by the SECAF due to change in ―critical skill needs‖ of the Air
Force.
7.17. Terms For Involuntary Separation of Selectively Continued Officers. Consider
officers for further continuation when continuation ends before an officer enters the retirement
sanctuary or becomes eligible to retire. If an officer is not selected for further continuation, they
will have at least 6 months notice before involuntary separation or discharge. Involuntarily
separate officers who decline further continuation on the expiration of their current contract. If
the officers request an earlier date of separation and receive approval under AFI 36-3207,
Administrative Separation of Commissioned Officers, then the separation is voluntary and the
officer does not receive separation pay. Officers identified for, or serving in a continued status,
are subject to separation under other applicable laws and policies.
7.18. Early Termination of Continuation. The period of continuation on active duty may be
reduced by the SECAF due to subsequent changes in the "critical skill needs" of the Air Force.
7.19. Continuation Propriety Actions. Commanders initiate propriety actions when a
preponderance of the evidence shows an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or
professionally qualified for continued active duty.
7.20. Recommending Captains and Majors Not Qualified For Continuation. Commanders
should recommend officers not qualified for continuation before the officer is recommended by a
selective continuation board for continuation. Final approval authority is MAJCOM commander.

   7.20.1. Commander initiates by notifying the officer, in writing, of the not qualified
   recommendation (Attachment 11). Initiates action sufficiently in advance to process through
   MAJCOM channels and reach HQ AFPC/DPPPO before the central selection or continuation
   board convenes.
   7.20.2. Ensures the officer has opportunity to respond to the recommendation and include
   the officer’s statement, if any, with the recommendation case file.
   7.20.3. Forwards case to MPF who will obtain legal review and forward through channels to
   the MAJCOM commander.
   7.20.4. The MAJCOM commander approves (if appropriate) and forwards to HQ
   AFPC/DPPPO for file in the officer's continuation selection folder. If the MAJCOM
   commander disapproves the recommendation, it is returned to the servicing MPF who
   advises the initiating commander of the decision.
7.21. Initiating Removal From a Continuation List. Commanders can also recommend
removal from a continuation list as long as action is initiated before the officer accepts
continuation, but no later than the 60 day suspense. The SECAF is approval authority for
removal.
   7.21.1. Commander initiates by notifying the officer, in writing, of the removal
   recommendation (Attachment 12). If necessary, verbal notification is permissible but must
   be followed with written notification as soon as possible. In either case, notice must be
   served before the officer accepts continuation.
   7.21.2. Ensures the officer has the opportunity to respond to the recommendation and
   include statements, if any, with the recommendation case file to SECAF. Advises the officer
   not to accept continuation until the SECAF makes a final decision.
   7.21.3. Forwards case file to the MPF who will acquire the legal review and forward through
   channels to MAJCOM commander. MPF must notify HQ AFPC/DPPPO immediately upon
   officer’s notification.
   7.21.4. The MAJCOM commander recommends approval (if appropriate) and forwards to
   HQ AFPC/ DPPPO. If the MAJCOM commander disapproves the recommendation, it is
   returned to the servicing MPF who advises the initiating commander of the decision.
   7.21.5. HQ AFPC/DPPPO will process case file to SECAF for final determination.
   7.21.6. The SECAF approves or disapproves the action. If removal action involves an officer
   in the grade of major, the SECAF must notify and provide rationale to PDUSD (P&R).
   7.21.7. HQ AFPC/DPPPO notifies the commander and HQ AFPC/DPPRS of SECAF
   decision to remove the officer from the continuation list. The officer will be separated not
   later than the last day of the 6th month after approval of board results.

                        statement to the SECAF in response to the action
                        taken. Should the officer desire to make a written
                        statement, he or she should forward the statement
                        through the MAJCOM to HQ AFPC/DPPPO for
                        forwarding through channels to the SECAF for

                        recommended action is appropriate, (see note 5).
                        Consider notifying the initiating commander so he
                        or she can advise the officer concerned that
                        recommendation is being forwarded (see note 5).

        DPPPO           instruction and update MilPDS, as appropriate.
1.    If there is not enough time to prepare a written notification the commander may inform the
     officer verbally that action has been or will be started. Provide written confirmation as soon as
     possible (usually within 24 duty hours). Once the officer is notified (verbally or in writing), the
     commander immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPPO.
2.    The officer must acknowledge receipt and submit any statements on his or her behalf within a
     reasonable period of time (usually 5 workdays) after receiving written notification. Officers send
     fully justified requests to extend the date required to respond to the propriety action to the
     initiating commander, in writing, prior to the date listed on the notification memorandum.
     Initiating commanders indorse this request in writing; however, they have the option to
     disapprove extensions after consulting with the SJA and/or ADC. Commanders provide MPF
     Career Enhancement a copy of the extension to monitor the status of the action. The response
     delay requests/approval become part of the case file as it is forwarded through channels to HQ
     AFPC.
3. For reassignments, the losing MPF Career Enhancements (DPMPE) notifies the gaining MPF,
   with information to the gaining MAJCOM, that continuation propriety action has been started.
   The officer's parent MAJCOM at the time of initiation of the propriety action is the command
   channel for processing the action.
4. Unless otherwise directed by SECAF, a commander (down to and including wing or equivalent
   commanders) may terminate an action to find an officer not qualified for selective continuation,
   and remove an officer from a selective continuation list, any time before the major commander
   reviews the case.
     Logically construct in chronological order a case file before sending it to HQ AFPC/DPPPO. It
     must include all necessary documents and they must be easy to read. Include a detailed case

   synopsis suitable for review by the approval authority (SECAF) that references pertinent and
   tabbed documents, statements, or other significant matters as part of the case file. Prepare all not
   qualified for selective continuation or removal cases to arrive at HQ AFPC/DPPPO in two
   legible copies (original plus one).
5. Refer to HQ AFPC/DPPRS for separation actions if SECAF approves removal. Refer to HQ
   AFPC/DPPPO for continuation consideration as SECAF guidelines require, or to HQ AFPC/
   DPPRS for appropriate separation or retirement actions, respectively if removal constitutes a
   second failure of selection for promotion to the grade of major (excluding MC and DC) or
   lieutenant colonel.

AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          63


                                            Chapter 9

          THE AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL AND BRIGADIER GENERAL
        SELECTION/FEDERAL RECOGNITION PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Program Objectives (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards). The fundamental
purpose of the officer promotion and federal recognition program is to select those officers best
qualified to meet the needs of the Air Force. A promotion is not a reward for past service; it is an
advancement to a higher grade based on future potential as demonstrated by past performance.
The Air Force promotion program fully implements DoDD 1320.12 and DoDI 1320.14 (for
active duty boards) as well as applicable laws, regulations, and instructions. Procedures and
policies for all active and Reserve component boards are established to provide for the careful
consideration, without prejudice or partiality, of all officers eligible for promotion and to ensure
the independence and integrity of boards by precluding unauthorized communications to boards
or board members prior to or during the board. An additional objective is to maintain a relatively
similar promotion opportunity from year to year. In assessing an officer's qualifications for
promotion to general officer, the board should consider duty performance as reflected in
evaluation reports, breadth of experience, command, joint duty, professional military education,
and civilian education. Although the above factors are not all inclusive, they do form the
foundation on which the board considers officers highly qualified for promotion to general
officer.
9.2. Promotion Eligibility. Title 10, U.S.C., Section 619, Eligibility for Consideration for
Promotion: Time in Grade and Other Requirements requires that all officers have at least 1 year
time in grade to be considered for promotion. Air Force policy requires that to be considered for
promotion to brigadier general, an officer must have at least 2 years time in grade as of the board
convening date. Officers who have an approved DOS within 90 days of the date the board
convenes are ineligible for promotion consideration by that board. Guidance for promotion
eligibility for Reserve Components can be found in AFI 36-2504 (for USAFR) and NGR (AF)
36-1, Federal Recognition of General Officer Appointment and Promotion in the Air National
Guard of the United States and as a Reserve of the Air Force (for ANGUS).
9.3. Information Provided to Boards (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards). Boards
convened under this instruction will be provided the information and or documents listed in
paragraphs 9.3.1 through 9.3.7 No other information and or documents may be provided to a

  provided to a selection board. Such information will be passed to the board only through the
  board recorder and administrative support personnel. A selection board may not be provided

      9.3.5.7. Guidelines to prohibit board members, recorders, and administrative support
      personnel (or persons acting in their behalf) from receiving, initiating, or participating in
      communications or discussions involving information that is precluded from presentation
      to the selection board. Board recorders and administrative support personnel may review
      information intended for a selection board to ensure the information is authorized for
      presentation to the board. Board members, the board recorder and administrative support
      personnel will report to the SECAF if they believe someone is exerting or attempting to
      exert inappropriate influence over the board or its proceedings.
      9.3.5.8. Instructions that no person may direct a board to select or nonselect a particular
      officer.
   9.3.6. Guidance or written instructions provided to the board by the SECAF will not include

   14110(b).
   9.3.7. Appropriate laws, regulations, and directives will be available for board members to
   review during the board.
9.4. Communications with Selection Boards (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards).
   9.4.1. The SECAF will issue written instructions directed specifically to General Officer
   boards in the form of a Secretarial Memorandum of Instruction, as described in paragraph
   9.3.5, providing guidance governing selection considerations for the board. A SECAF
   "Procedures" instruction, governing administration of the board, will be made available to the
   Board President, board recorder, and all board support personnel. Further, DoDI 1320.14,
   enclosure 4 will be read to the board (members, recorders, and administrative support
   personnel) at the time the board convenes in accordance with DoDI 1320.14, paragraph 5.3.6.
   9.4.2. No one other than the SECAF may appear in person to address a selection board.
   Should the SECAF address the board in person, a verbatim transcript of the SECAF's
   remarks will be prepared and provided to every board member through the board recorder
   and administrative support personnel, and made a part of the board record. All
   communications with members of a selection board must be in writing, furnished to all board
   members, and made part of the board record. Communications regarding particular officers
   are expressly forbidden, unless unusual circumstances exist that would preclude an officer's
   performance from being documented in the official record (i.e., sensitive classified mission,
   etc.) or unless provided to the board under the provisions of paragraph 9.4.3.3 An audio or
   video recording is an acceptable means of communication with the board, so long as a
   written transcript is made part of the board record.
   9.4.3. The following information may be communicated to a selection board:
66                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


     9.4.3.1. The information provided to boards, in support of their duties, described in
     paragraph 9.3 of this instruction.
     9.4.3.2. Information, including the opinion of third parties, submitted to selection boards
     by eligible officers, as provided for in Title 10, U.S.C., DoDD 1320.12, DoDI 1320.14
     and this paragraph. These communications must be received prior to the convening of the
     board and may be submitted in conjunction with paragraph 9.4.5 of this instruction.
     9.4.3.3. Information that is not part of the Selection Record Group, but which the
     SECAF determines to be substantiated and relevant, and which the SECAF considers
     might reasonably and materially affect the deliberations of the selection board (in
     accordance with paragraph 9.5 of this instruction). If this information is to be presented,
     the eligible officer must be notified that the information will be presented to the board.
     The eligible officer must also be provided a copy of the information that will be provided
     to the selection board, and afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments
     on that information to the selection board. Factual summaries of information that are
     presented to boards under these provisions may be prepared only by personnel designated
     in writing by the SECAF for that specific purpose.
     9.4.3.4. Information that is provided to selection boards under paragraph 9.4.3.3 may not
     be provided to subsequent selection boards convened under this instruction unless the
     information is made a part of the Selection Record Group, or the SECAF makes a new
     determination that the information should again be placed before a selection board and
     the officer is again allowed to comment.
  9.4.4. Once notified of designation as a member of a promotion board and until that
  promotion board adjourns, board members must be particularly careful to ensure that they are
  not prejudiced or influenced about the fitness for promotion of a specific officer by a superior
  military or civilian authority. This does not preclude a board member from performing rating
  or evaluating responsibilities as required by AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation
  Systems. If any board member cannot in good conscience perform board duties without
  prejudice or partiality, he or she is required to request relief by the SECAF from his or her
  obligation as soon as possible. Such a request will be honored. Any board member who
  believes that the integrity of the board's proceedings have been adversely affected by
  improper influence of superior military or civilian authority, misconduct of the board
  president or of a member, or any other reason, has a duty to request relief from the SECAF or
  the SECDEF, and upon receiving it, to report the basis for his or her belief to that authority.
  No official, civilian or military, may direct that a particular individual be selected or not be
  selected by a selection board; censure, reprimand, or admonish the selection board or any
  member of the board with respect to the recommendations of the board or the exercise of any
  function of the board; or attempt to coerce or by unauthorized means influence any action of
  the board in the formulation of the board's recommendations.
     9.4.5. Officers eligible for promotion may send written communications to the board, via
     personal letter. (See paragraph 9.4.2.) Send letters for all general officer boards to HQ
     USAF/DPO or HQ USAF/DPG, as appropriate, to arrive NLT 2359 hours the day prior to
     the board convening date. Address letters to Board President, CY (insert appropriate year
     and grade) Board. See paragraph 2.10. for other administrative guidance. HQ
     USAF/DPO or HQ USAF/DPG, as appropriate, will advise the officer when a letter does
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           67


       not comply with guidance. The officer may then submit changes or a new letter.
       Letter(s) or changes to letters that arrive after 2359 hours the day prior to the board
       convening will be returned or destroyed. For Air Force Reserve Officers, send to
       AF/REG, 1150 Air Force Pentagon, Rm 5D712, Washington, DC 20330-1150. For
       ANGUS officers, send to NGB-GO, 1411 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 11500,
       Arlington, VA 22202-3229. The letter should be brief. Communications sent to the
       board will be filed in the individual's selection record and will be considered by the
       selection board. Immediately after completion of the Selection Board, the letter will be
       removed from the individual’s selection record and placed in the master personnel record
       for historical, legal, and appeal purposes only. Access will be limited to only those who
       have a need to know.
   9.4.6. Communications other than as expressly provided for (as they relate to particular
   officers) in this instruction are prohibited. Access to selection board rooms and
   administrative material associated with the selection process will be limited to selection
   board members, recorders, and administrative support personnel.
   9.4.7. Board members, in their deliberations, may discuss their own personal knowledge and
   evaluation of the professional qualifications of eligible officers to the extent that such matters
   are not precluded by law, DoDD 1320.12, DoDI 1320.14, or this instruction. Board members
   may not discuss or disclose the opinion of anyone not a member of the board concerning an
   officer being considered unless that opinion is contained in material authorized to be placed
   before the board, under the provisions of this instruction.
9.5. Unfavorable Information (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards). For the

       consistent with the requirement of Title 10, U.S.C., DoDI 1320.14, paragraph 6.3. and
       this instruction (appropriate law and regulation for Reserve component boards) or,

  the names and records of the officers eligible for consideration and provide trained
  commissioned officer recorders to the board.
     10.1.3. (Also applies to USAFR Boards.) Line officers may score records of any
     competitive category. Line of the Air Force - Judge Advocates will only score Line of
     the Air Force - Judge Advocate records and Chaplains will only score Chaplain records.
         10.1.3.1. (For Active Duty Boards Only) . Health Professions officers remain in
         their individual competitive categories until becoming eligible for promotion to major
         general. At that time, Health Professions officers from the Medical Corps, Medical
         Service Corps and Biomedical Sciences Corps competitive categories compete for
         promotion together to Major General. Officers from the Dental Corps and Nurse
         Corps remain in their separate competitive categories for promotion to Major
         General. Health Professions officers may only score records within the Health
         Professions competitive categories.
         10.1.3.2. (For USAFR Boards only.) Upon becoming eligible for promotion to
         brigadier general, Health Professions officers compete for promotion together. Board
         members from the Health Professions competitive category may only score records
         within that category.
  10.1.3. Line officers may score records of any competitive category. Judge Advocates will
  only score Judge Advocate records and Chaplains will only score Chaplain records. Upon
  becoming eligible for promotion to brigadier general, officers from the Air Force Medical
  Service become part of the Health Professions competitive category and compete for
  promotion together. Board members from the Health Professions competitive category may
  only score records within that category.
  10.1.4. (Also applies to Reserve Component Boards) While the board is in session, the
  board works directly for the SECAF under the supervision of the board president.
  10.1.5. Selection boards will be comprised of a minimum of five ADL officers. Each officer
  must be serving in a grade higher than the most senior officer under consideration (paragraph
  8.1.3).
  10.1.6. Selection boards will ordinarily include at least one officer from each competitive
  category being considered by the board. A selection board need not include an officer from a
  competitive category when there is no eligible officer of that competitive category on the
  ADL in a grade higher than the grade of the officers to be considered (paragraph 8.1.3).
  10.1.7. (Also applies to Reserve Component Boards) No officer may be a member of two
  successive boards for the consideration of officers of the same competitive category and
  grade (paragraph 8.1.3).
  10.1.8. Selection boards considering officers who have served or who are serving in joint
  duty assignments will include at least one officer currently serving in a joint duty assignment.
  The CJCS will designate an officer or officers currently serving in a joint duty assignment for
  appointment by the SECAF (paragraph 8.4).
 72                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


10.2. Secretarial Guidance Concerning Promotions. In accordance with Title 10, U.S.C.,
Section 615 and 14107, Information Furnished to Selection Boards, the Secretary will provide
the board with guidance and information on the need to promote a minimum or maximum
number of officers having particular skills.
   10.2.1. Based on the needs of the Air Force, the Secretary may designate skills as semi-
   specialists in the Memorandum of Instruction to particular promotion selection boards.
   10.2.2. By Air Force policy, to be considered a semi-specialist, an officer will normally have
   served at least 5 of the last 10 years in duties related to that designated skill.
10.3. Scoring Procedures.
   10.3.1. Major General Selection Boards:
       10.3.1.1. Initial Review. An initial review without scoring is used to familiarize board
       members with the records and the overall quality of the eligible officers. The board
       president and each scoring member will review each record. For Non-Line MG boards
       where 10 or fewer records will be considered, initial review is not required. In this
       instance, all considerees will be included on one ballot. When a DJAG board is convened
       in conjunction with, and immediately following a TJAG board, and is comprised of the
       same board members, initial review is not required for the DJAG board. In this instance,
       SOUIFs placed in selection folders for the TJAG board will remain in the selection folder
       for the DJAG selection board.
       10.3.1.2. Scoring for the Record. After the initial review, if the eligible officer has a
       SOUIF, it will be placed in the selection folder as determined in accordance with
       paragraph 8.2 Then, each scoring member will score each record on a best qualified basis
       using the 6 to 10 point scoring scale described below.
       10.3.1.3. Scoring Scale. Use the following scoring scale when making the final
       promotion determination in the major general selection board.
            Score          Evaluation
            10             Definitely a major general now
            9-9.5          Probably a major general now
            8-8.5          Maybe a major general now
            7-7.5          Probably not a major general now
            6-6.5          Definitely not a major general now
   10.3.2. Brigadier General Selection Boards:
       10.3.2.1. Initial Review. The members of the board will review every record in each
       competitive category. During this review, members of the board will vote on each
       officer's record using the following options: Yes--Officer is exceptionally well qualified
       for promotion; No--Officer is not exceptionally well qualified for promotion. If at least
       half of the board members vote "yes," further consider the officer's record for promotion.
       When the board has finished the initial review, the recorder will compile a list of those
       officers determined to be exceptionally well qualified for promotion. The members of the
       board will certify, by signing the list, that they have reviewed the records and determined
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                        73


     that the officers appearing on it are exceptionally well qualified for promotion to general
     officer.
     10.3.2.2. Scoring for the Record. After the initial review, if an eligible officer whose
     name appears on the list of those determined by the board to be exceptionally well
     qualified has a SOUIF, the recorder will direct the administrative staff to place it in the
     selection folder. Then, each scoring member will score the record of each officer on the
     exceptionally well qualified list on a best qualified basis using the 6 to 10-point scoring
     scale described below.
     10.3.2.3. Scoring Scale. Use the following scoring scale when making the final
     promotion determination in the brigadier general selection board:
          Score          Evaluation
          10             Definitely a brigadier general now
          9-9.5          Probably a brigadier general now
          8-8.5          Maybe a brigadier general now
          7-7.5          Probably not a brigadier general now
          6-6.5          Definitely not a brigadier general now
  10.3.3. Major General and Brigadier General Selection Boards.
     10.3.3.1. Secret Ballot. Board members will score records by secret ballot. Board
     member discussions during deliberations are limited to what is allowed in accordance
     with DoDI 1320.14.
     10.3.3.2. "Split" Scores.
         10.3.3.2.1. A "split" is a significant disagreement between board members about the
         score of a record. A "split" is considered a difference in a score of 2 or more points
         between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 8, or 8 and 10). When using a "yes" or
         "no" scoring system for promotion decision, a "split" occurs when the vote is not
         unanimous.
         10.3.3.2.2. At the completion of scoring, the administrative staff will produce a
         preliminary order of merit listing and review the scores to determine if any significant
         differences exist between the scores on a record.
         10.3.3.2.3. Not all "split" scores must be resolved. At a minimum, the board will
         resolve all records with ―split‖ scores in the top half of the preliminary order of merit
         listing and any other records which, with split resolution, could place in the top half
         of the order of merit listing. All board members may discuss the record, but only
         those involved in the ―split‖ may change their scores to resolve the ―split.‖ Board
         member discussion is constrained as explained in DoDI 1320.14.
         10.3.3.2.4. New Documents. If new information (e.g., decoration citation, officer
         performance report, updated officer selection brief) concerning individual records is
         acquired during board scoring, the affected records will be brought back to the board
         for rescoring. Splits from this process will be resolved.
74                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


       10.3.3.3. Establishing the Final "Cut Line."
           10.3.3.3.1. Following resolution of "split" scores, the recorder will deliver to the
           board an order of merit list based on the total of the individual scores given by each
           scoring board member. The recorder will indicate on the list those officers at and
           above the score where the Secretary's numerical promotion guidance would occur.
           10.3.3.3.2. To ensure Secretarial guidance has been appropriately considered, the
           board president will have the board members review the MOI again. After discussion,
           the board may determine by majority vote if rescore of any record is necessary to give
           full consideration to the Secretarial guidance. Following all necessary rescoring, the
           recorder establishes a preliminary "cut line" based on the Secretary's numerical
           guidance and proceeds to gray zone resolution as necessary.
           10.3.3.3.3. If the preliminary "cut line" falls between two or more officers with the
           same score (called the "gray zone"), the board will rescore the records of all officers
           in the "gray zone" until the "cut line" falls between officers having different scores.
           The recorder establishes a final "cut line" after the board resolves the "gray zone."
           The board recommends officers above the "cut line" to the Secretary for promotion.
           The board authenticates this list of officers for the record which becomes part of the
           final board report.
       10.3.3.4. "Show Cause" Procedures. If any scoring board member believes the record of
       any eligible officer is of a quality which should require the officer to "Show Cause" for
       further retention on active duty under AFI 36-3206, they will indicate so on their voting
       or scoring ballot. If a majority of the scoring board members believe an officer should
       "Show Cause," identify that officer to the Secretary in the board report with reason. If no
       officers need to "Show Cause," the board report will so state.
       10.3.3.5. Fully Qualify Select Lists. For brigadier general boards, the EWQ Board
       Report will certify that those officers identified by the board as exceptionally well
       qualified for promotion to brigadier general are also fully qualified for promotion. For
       major general boards, the procedures in paragraph 2.3.3 will be used to fully qualify the
       list.
       10.3.3.6. Letter Writer Non-Select Determination. To comply with Title 10 §617, the
       records of all officers who were considered and not recommended for promotion and
       wrote a letter to the board will be returned to the board. The board will vote by secret
       ballot to determine the names of any officers who directly caused their nonselection
       through written communication to the board. This will include those records not deemed
       ―exceptionally well qualified‖ during the initial screening for the Brigadier General
       Selection Board.
   10.3.4. USAFR Major General and Brigadier General Vacancy Promotion Boards:
       10.3.4.1. Initial Review (to be done separately for major general and brigadier general
       eligibles). An initial review without scoring is used to familiarize board members with
       the quality of the eligible officers. The members of the board will review every record
       and vote on each record using the following options:
First, Yes - Officer is fully qualified for promotion.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                         75


Second, No - Officer is not fully qualified for promotion.
           10.3.4.1.1. If at least half the board members vote ―yes,‖ further consider the
           officer’s record for promotion. When the board has finished the initial review, the
           recorder will compile a list of those officers determined to be fully qualified for
           promotion. The members of the board will certify, by signing the list, that they have
           reviewed the records and determined that the officers appearing on it are fully
           qualified for promotion. The board president is a nonvoting/ nonscoring member of
           the board.
       10.3.4.2. Scoring Procedures. After the initial review, if the eligible officer has a SOUIF,
       it will be placed in his/her selection folder. Then each board member will score each
       record on a best qualified basis using the 6 to 10 point scoring scale (half point
       increments) as a guide:
            Score          Evaluation
            10             Definitely a major/brigadier general now
            9-9.5          Probably a major/brigadier general now
            8-8.5          Maybe a major/brigadier general now
            7-7.5          Probably not a major/brigadier general now
            6-6.5          Definitely not a major/brigadier general now
       10.3.4.3. Scoring will be by secret ballot. Board members’ discussions during
       deliberations are limited to what is allowed by DoDI 1320.14. Upon evaluation and
       scoring of all the records, the board members will determine if the eligibles fall into one
       of three categories:
First, Best qualified and recommended for promotion.
Second, Fully qualified but not recommended for promotion.
Third, Not fully qualified for promotion (reference AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within the
Reserve Components, paragraph 2.4., for ramifications dictating reassignment out of a general
officer position).
       10.3.4.4. ―Split‖ Scores.
           10.3.4.4.1. A "split" is a significant disagreement between board members about the
           score of a record. A "split" is considered a difference in a score of 2 or more points
           between any two panel members (e.g., 6 and 8, or 8 and 10). When using a "yes" or
           "no" scoring system for promotion decision, a "split" occurs when the vote is not
           unanimous.
           10.3.4.4.2. As board members complete their scoring, the administrative staff will
           review the scores to determine if any significant differences exist between the scores
           on a record.
           10.3.4.4.3. Not all ―split‖ scores must be resolved.
           10.3.4.4.4. When a record with a ―split‖ score is rescored, all board members may
           discuss the record, but only those involved in the ―split‖ may change their scores to
76                                                                AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


        resolve the ―split.‖ Board members’ discussions are constrained as explained in
        DoDD 1320.12 and below.
     10.3.4.5. Establishing the Final ―Cut Line‖ and ―Best Qualified‖ for promotion.
        10.3.4.5.1. Following resolution of ―split‖ scores, the recorder will deliver to the
        board an order of merit list based on the total of the individual scores given by each
        board member. The recorder will indicate on the list those officers at and above the
        score where the Secretary’s numerical promotion guidance would occur.
        10.3.4.5.2. To ensure Secretarial guidance receives appropriate consideration, the
        board will examine the order of merit list and discuss the extent to which this
        guidance has been met. After discussion, the board may rescore the record of any
        officer or officers it determines necessary to give full consideration to the Secretary’s
        guidance. Following all necessary rescoring, the recorder establishes a preliminary
        ―cut line‖ based on the Secretary’s numerical guidance.
        10.3.4.5.3. If the preliminary ―cut line‖ falls between two or more officers with the
        same score (called the ―gray zone‖), the board will rescore until the ―cut line‖ falls
        between officers having different scores. The recorder establishes the final ―cut line‖
        after the board resolves the ―gray zone.‖ The board recommends officers above the
        ―cut line‖ to the Secretary for promotion. The board retains authority to determine the
        break point between best (and fully) qualified for promotion and fully qualified but
        not recommended for promotion. If the board elects not to use the full board quota,
        rationale will be included in the board report.
     10.3.4.6. The board will follow the exact same procedures described above for the
     brigadier general portion of the board.
     10.3.4.7. The board will determine if any officer is ―not fully qualified‖ and so indicate
     any officers found ―not fully qualified‖ on the board report. The board will determine if
     any officer should ―Show Cause‖ for retention in the Reserve and so indicate in the board
     report, with the reason. If no officers need to ―Show Cause,‖ the board report will so
     indicate.
     10.3.4.8. Board Anomalies. Procedural anomalies occurring during a board that may
     require variation from established procedures require BP resolution. During the board,
     the BP may bring any matter to the attention of the SecAF, or designated representative,
     if he or she determines that SecAF-level decision is required. The BP will advise the
     SecAF of any significant procedural anomalies during his or her out brief of the board.
     These responsibilities of the BP do not limit in any way the right of a board member or
     Board Secretariat member to communicate with the SecAF as provided by other
     authority. The BP will make determinations on availability of a primary board member if
     an alternate board member is required. The BP is the authorizing official for directing
     that a SecAF-approved alternate replace the primary board member. The need for an
     alternate board member being called to replace a primary board member will be treated as
     an anomaly and will follow guidelines specified in this paragraph.
  10.3.5. ANGUS Major General and Brigadier General Federal Recognition Boards:
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                          77


       10.3.5.1. Initial Review. An initial review without scoring is used to familiarize board
       members with the records and the overall quality of the eligible officers. The board
       president and board members will review each record.
       10.3.5.2. Voting for the Record. After the initial review, if the eligible officer has a
       SOUIF, it will be placed in the selection folder as determined in accordance with
       paragraph 8.2 Then, each voting member (including the board president) will vote either
       ―Yes‖ or ―No‖ on each record. A ―Yes‖ vote indicates a recommendation for Federal
       recognition. Likewise, a ―No‖ vote indicates a recommendation against Federal
       recognition.
       10.3.5.3. Secret Ballot. Board members will vote records by secret ballots. Board
       member discussions during deliberations are limited to what is allowed in accordance
       with DoDD 1320.12.
       10.3.5.4. As board members complete their voting, the administrative staff will review
       the votes and identify to the board president those records receiving one or more ―No‖
       votes. Each record with a ―No‖ vote from one or more board members will be discussed,
       and a new vote will be called. Once this vote is accomplished, the list of eligibles who
       received a majority ―Yes‖ vote will be reviewed to ensure that Secretarial guidance has
       been met. All those with a majority ―Yes‖ vote will be recommended for Federal
       recognition.
10.4. Special Selection Boards.
   10.4.1. When directed by the AFBCMR, SSBs will convene under the authority of Title 10,
   U.S.C., Section 628 for the purposes of considering those officers whose record:
       10.4.1.1. Should have met a central selection board but did not, due to administrative
       oversight, or
       10.4.1.2. Met a central selection board, was not selected, and the board:
          10.4.1.2.1. Acted contrary to law.
          10.4.1.2.2. Involved material error of fact.
          10.4.1.2.3. Involved material administrative error.
          10.4.1.2.4. Did not have before it for consideration pertinent material information.
   10.4.2. Do not provide quotas for SSBs. Since benchmark records are not identified from the
   central brigadier general board Exceptionally Well Qualified or initial review phase, a SSB to
   brigadier general will assume the consideree is Exceptionally Well Qualified for promotion.
   10.4.3. Normally, SSBs will convene in conjunction with central general officer selection
   boards. Appoint SSB members in accordance with the Memorandum of Instructions for the
   SSB.
   10.4.4. SSB members make selections by comparing the consideree's record with the
   benchmark records from the lowest score category of selectees and the highest score category
   of nonselectees from the original board.
   10.4.5. Administrative support personnel constructs the consideree's record as it would have
   at the time the central board met. Specifically:
 78                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


      10.4.5.1. Documents or references to events occurring after the original board are
      removed from the record.
      10.4.5.2. The condition, if any, in the consideree's record that caused the SSB to convene
      is corrected.
   10.4.6. The consideree may write a letter to the board, and if so, the letter (undated) is
   included in the record.
   10.4.7. To preserve board member objectivity, the consideree, benchmark selectee, and
   benchmark nonselectee records are not identified to the board before scoring.
   10.4.8. The board scores all benchmark records and the consideree's record using the
   appropriate 6-10 point scoring scale above, resolving all "splits," if any.
   10.4.9. After the scoring and "split" resolution is complete, the recorder will identify to the
   board president the consideree, benchmark selectees, and benchmark nonselectees and the
   scores each received from the SSB.
   10.4.10. For the consideree to be selected, he or she must:
      10.4.10.1. Score higher than every benchmark nonselectee.
      10.4.10.2. Score the same (equal to) or greater than at least one benchmark selectee.
   10.4.11. The board president will advise the board of the scoring results. A separate board
   report is written for each SSB.
10.5. Post-Board Administration (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards).
   10.5.1. Board recommendations are PRIVILEGED INFORMATION. Board recorders
   provide a post-board administrative outbrief to thank the board members for their
   participation and to remind them of the prohibited communications regarding the board.
   Before the board report is signed by each board member and recorder, recommendations are
   only disclosed to board members, recorders, and administrative support personnel designated
   in writing by the SECAF. Before any general officer selection board adjourns, the board
   president, board members, and recorders will sign and submit a written report of proceedings
   that conforms to the law and includes lists of those selected for promotion and those selected
   to Show Cause for retention, and the certification statement required by DoDI 1320.14,
   paragraph 6.2.3.4 or F.2.c(4) and enclosure 6. After the report is signed by the president and
   board members, the recommendations of the board may be disclosed to AFSLMO for the
   administrative handling and processing of the report. The board president will brief the
   results of the active duty boards through the CSAF to the SECAF. Except as authorized in
   law, DoDD 1320.12 and DoDI 1320.14, the proceedings of a board are not disclosed to
   anyone not a member of the board. When the members and recorders of the board sign the
   report, the board is adjourned unless the SECAF returns the report to the board for further
   consideration (paragraph 9.8).
   10.5.2. After the board adjourns, the recorder and administrative staff will collect all score
   rosters and internal working papers. Board members will not maintain any documents or
   remove any documents from the board room.
   10.5.3. Following approval by the Deputy Secretary of Defense of the list of officers
   recommended by the board for promotion or Federal recognition, AFSLMO will destroy all
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           79


   score rosters and internal working papers associated with the board that are not a part of the
   board record.
   10.5.4. Information on the number of officers considered and selected, board organization,
   the general procedures followed by the board, the number of board members, and their
   names, grades and service components may be disclosed after everyone selected for
   promotion by the board has been confirmed by the Senate or removed from the promotion
   list.
   10.5.5. After the board has completed and signed the report, the Selection Board secretariat
   will prepare, for review by the SECAF and the Chief of Staff, a statistical report of selection
   rates by race/ethnicity, gender, and special skill requirements.
   10.5.6. Procedural anomalies occurring during a board that may require variation from
   established procedures require resolution by the board president. During the board, the board
   president may bring any matter to the attention of the SECAF, if he or she determines that
   SECAF-level decision is required. The board president will advise the SECAF of any
   significant procedural anomalies during his or her outbrief of the board. These
   responsibilities of the board president do not limit in any way the right of a board member,
   recorder, or board staff to communicate with the SECAF as provided by other authority.
   10.5.7. Lists will be made of all officers (1) whose records, after resolution of splits, score at
   or above the score at which the numerical promotion quota cutline tentatively falls, and (2)
   whose records are in the ―gray zone‖ after completion of all rescores provided for in
   paragraph 10.3.3.3.2 These lists will not reflect specific scores or ranking within each
   category. These lists will be filed with the formal record of the board, but not be made a part
   of that record. They will be marked ―For Official Use Only‖. These records need not be
   released under FOIA or the Privacy Act but may become subject to discovery in litigation.
   10.5.8. Before destroying score rosters, the board recorder or administrative staff identifies
   the five records that scored immediately above and five that scored immediately below the
   final cut-line, including ties, and copy them exactly as they appeared before the board. These
   records will become an official part of the board record. These benchmark records will be
   used for SSB proceedings. For Federal recognition boards: Benchmark records will only be
   kept if one or more officers are not recommended for Federal recognition. In such cases, with
   the records arranged in alphabetical order, copies of the first five, odd-numbered records will
   be kept for benchmark purposes.
10.6. Report to the SECAF. Following adjournment of the board, the board president will
report to the SECAF on how well the board complied with the Secretarial guidance on semi-
specialists, joint experience, and Acquisition Corps as outlined in the board Memorandum of
Instruction.

                                           Chapter 11

              GENERAL OFFICER PROMOTION PROPRIETY ACTIONS

11.1. General Information. Commanders at all levels must ensure that only the best qualified
officers are promoted to general officer. If a commander believes the preponderance of the
evidence shows that an officer is not mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified to
perform the duties of the higher grade, it is in the best interests of the Air Force that immediate
action be taken. All actions taken under this section, time permitting, should be coordinated with
AFSLMO prior to initiation and in all cases should be processed through command channels to
AFSLMO prior to action by the SECAF. AFI 36-2504 or NGR (AF) 36-1 outline promotion
propriety actions for Reserve of the Air Force general officers or colonels serving in general
officer positions. Reserve component promotion propriety actions are staffed by the Reserve
Component and should be coordinated through AFSLMO prior to staffing to SECAF.
11.2. Vacating a Promotion. In accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Section 625, Authority to
Vacate Promotions to Grades of Brigadier General and Rear Admiral Lower Half, ADL officers
promoted to the grade of brigadier general serve an 18-month probationary period during which
time the President of the United States may vacate their promotion at anytime.
   11.2.1. An immediate or higher level commander must initiate vacations of promotion.
   Notification may be oral or in writing, but must be made before the 18-month promotion
   anniversary date. Oral notifications must be followed by written notification as soon
   thereafter as practicable. Action by the President must be completed before the 18-month
   promotion anniversary date.
   11.2.2. The officer must be provided the evidence supporting the reason or reasons for the
   vacation recommendation and be given a reasonable time to respond in writing. If the
   vacation is upheld, the officer will immediately assume the grade of colonel, with the same
   date of rank he or she held prior to selection for brigadier general.
11.3. Delaying Promotions (Also Applies to Reserve Component Boards). In accordance
with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 624 and 14311, Delay of Promotion: Involuntary, promotions can
be delayed after Senate confirmation when there is cause to believe that the officer is not
mentally, physically, morally, or professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher
grade. Promotions can also be delayed if : (1) sworn charges against an officer have been
received by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer and such
charges have not been disposed of; (2) an investigation is being conducted to determine whether
disciplinary action of any kind should be brought against an officer; (3) a board of officers has
been convened under Title 10, U.S.C., Chapter 60, Separation of Regular Officers for
Substandard Performance of Duty or the Certain Other Reasons or 1405, Promotions to review
the record of an officer; or (4) a criminal proceeding in a Federal or State court is pending
against an officer.
   11.3.1. An immediate or higher level commander may initiate recommendations for delay.
   The individual recommending delay will notify the officer, in writing, of the reasons for the
   delay and will give the officer a reasonable amount of time to provide written comments. The
   notification should be given before the effective date of promotion. If the individual
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                            81


   recommending delay cannot give initial notice in writing, he or she may give it orally, but
   must follow by written notice as soon thereafter as practicable.
   11.3.2. The SECAF is the approval authority for initial delays up to 6 months. Requests for
   extensions in excess of 6 months must be processed to arrive in sufficient time for the
   SECAF to act on the extension before the expiration date of the existing delay. When the
   basis for a delay ceases to exist, prompt action should be initiated to terminate it. The SECAF
   is the approval authority for termination of delays.
   11.3.3. (Does not apply to Reserve Components) Where it is determined that the officer
   was NQP for any part of the delay, the SECAF may adjust the officer's date of rank, pay and
   allowances, and position on the ADL.
   11.3.4. If disciplinary action is not taken against the officer, if the charges against the officer
   are withdrawn or dismissed, if the officer is not separated by the SECAF as a result of having
   been required to Show Cause for retention, or if the officer is acquitted of the charges, as the
   case may be, then (unless action to delay the officer’s appointment to a higher grade has been
   for Lack of Qualifications (Title 10, U.S.C., Section 14311[b]) the officer shall be retained
   on the promotion list, list of officers found qualified for Federal recognition, or list of
   officers nominated by the President to the Senate for appointment in a higher Reserve grade
   and shall, upon promotion to the next higher grade, have the same date of rank, the same
   effective date for the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted, and the same
   position on the Reserve active-status list as the officer would have had if no delay had
   intervened, unless the SECAF determines that the officer was unqualified for promotion for
   any part of the delay. If the SECAF makes such a determination, the SECAF may adjust such
   date of rank, effective date of pay and allowances, and position on the Reserve active-status
   list as the SECAF considers appropriate under the circumstances.
11.4. Removal From a Promotion/Federal Recognition Vacancy Selection List (Also
Applies to Reserve Components). In accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 629, Removal
from a List of Officers Recommended for Promotion and 14310, Removal from a List of Officers
Recommended for Promotion, officers are removed from a promotion list when the
preponderance of the evidence shows that they are not mentally, physically, morally, or
professionally qualified to perform the duties of the higher grade.
   11.4.1. An immediate or higher level commander, or higher authority, may initiate a
   recommendation for removal. The individual recommending removal will notify the officer,
   in writing, and give him or her an opportunity to review the evidence and to provide written
   comments. If the individual recommending removal cannot give initial notice in writing, he
   or she may give it orally, but must follow by written notice as soon as practicable. The
   individual recommending removal must notify the officer before the effective date of
   promotion, unless a delay is in effect--then the notification must be made before the
   expiration of the delay.
   11.4.2. Once a removal action is initiated, a promotion is effectively delayed until the
   President takes action or action is taken to terminate the removal. The SECAF is the approval
   authority for termination of removal actions.
 82                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


11.5. Removal From a Report of a Selection/Federal Recognition Board (Also Applies to
Reserve Components). In accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 618(d) and 14310(a), the
name of an officer may be removed from the report of a selection or Federal recognition board
only by the President.
   11.5.1. In all cases where the SECAF makes a recommendation that the name of an officer
   be removed from a report of a board (paragraph 9.5.2 and 9.5.2.1), the information used to
   make that recommendation will be referred to the officer concerned for comment. The officer
   will be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit comments before the recommendation is
   forwarded to the SECDEF.
11.6. Processing Procedures. (Also see Chapter 5, Table 5.1). Upon advising the officer of
promotion propriety action, send AFSLMO a copy of the written notification, to include officer’s
name, SSN, type of action, name/grade/unit of commander initiating action, and date officer
notified. Officer acknowledges receipt of notification (with comments if desired) and returns it to
the initiating commander. The commander obtains JA legal review and forwards to official’s
parent MAJCOM (through intermediate commander as appropriate). The MAJCOM commander
reviews correspondence and obtains MAJCOM JA review for legal sufficiency.
   11.6.1. If the requested action is determined to be inappropriate, the MAJCOM commander
   can disapprove and return all correspondence to the initiating commander, request the
   initiating commander notify the officer in writing, and advise AFSLMO in writing of the
   decision and date action ended.
   11.6.2. If the MAJCOM commander approves the action, he or she sends the original case to
   AFSLMO and requests the initiating commander notify the officer in writing that the action
   has been forwarded to the SECAF.
   11.6.3. AFSLMO processes and tracks package through SECAF, OSD, and to the President
   as appropriate. AFSLMO notifies the MAJCOM commander of final decision with a request
   that the officer be notified in writing (may be delegated to the initiating commander). The
   commander provides AFSLMO a copy of the notification and the officer’s
   acknowledgement.
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                        83


                                          Chapter 12

               SPECIAL GENERAL OFFICER PROMOTION ACTIONS

12.1. Frocking (Early Pin-On) for General Officers.
   12.1.1. The Fiscal Year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act, enacted on January 6,
   2006, established specific restrictions on officers wearing the insignia of a general or flag
   officer before promotion to that grade (termed ―frocking‖).
   12.1.2. The changes to Title 10, United States Code, section 777, require the Secretary of
   Defense to approve all general or flag officer frocking and to notify the Congress of the
   intent to frock each officer a minimum of 30 days in advance of the officer being frocked.
   The Secretary of Defense has delegated the authority to authorize frocking of general and
   flag officers, and to execute the required notification to Congress, to the Under Secretary of
   Defense (Personnel & Readiness) and the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
   (Personnel & Readiness).
   12.1.3. Statutory Requirements.
      12.1.3.1. Authority. An officer who has been selected for promotion to the next higher
      grade may be authorized to wear the insignia of the next higher grade only in accordance
      with law and the regulations and policies of the Department of Defense.
      12.1.3.2. Restrictions.
          12.1.3.2.1. An officer may not wear the insignia unless the Senate has given its
          advice and consent to the appointment of that officer to the next higher grade.
          12.1.3.2.2. The officer must be serving in, or have orders to serve in, a position for
          which that grade is authorized.
      12.1.3.3. Limitation on Number of Officers Frocked to O-7 through O-8.
          12.1.3.3.1. The total number of Air Force O-6s or O-7s on the active duty list
          authorized to be frocked to the grade of O-7 or O-8 may not exceed 27 at any one
          time.
          12.1.3.3.2. All frocking statutory and numeric limitations must be adhered to
          throughout the fiscal year.
      12.1.3.4. The following criteria are established as prerequisites for frocking
      commissioned officers to grades O-7 through O-8:
          12.1.3.4.1. Nomination for appointment by the President.
          12.1.3.4.2. Confirmation of the nomination by the U.S. Senate.
          12.1.3.4.3. The officer being considered for frocking is serving in an authorized billet
          designated for the higher grade, or the officer is being ordered to an authorized billet
          designated for the higher grade, and shall commence serving in that position within
          60 days. Frocking greater than 60 days prior to the commencement of service in the
          billet of the higher grade is permissible if extended enroute delays are expected. In
 84                                                                   AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


           the later case, frocking may occur no earlier than the date of departure from the
           previous duty station.
           12.1.3.4.4. Frocking must be essential to the officer’s maximum effectiveness in the
           assigned billet. Appropriate situations are:
               12.1.3.4.4.1. Assignment to duties in the international environment;
               12.1.3.4.4.2. Assignment to joint duties;
               12.1.3.4.4.3. Assignment to command;
               12.1.3.4.4.4. Other unusual circumstances, as determined by the Secretary of the
               Air Force.
   12.1.4. Where specific numeric limitations on frocking are not provided, frocking shall be
   limited and follow the same standards as provided in statute and in DoD policy.
12.2. Declining a Promotion. A general officer select may decline a promotion, in writing,
NLT 2400 hours on the day prior to the effective date of promotion. Notification will be made
directly to AFSLMO. EXCEPTION: Officers selected for retroactive promotion by an SSB, AF
Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR), or because of an administrative error may
decline promotion NLT 2400 hours on the day following notification of selection.
   12.2.1. Officers declining a promotion must sign two copies of a Declination of Promotion
   Statement (Attachment 6) and forward them to AFSLMO.
   12.2.2. Officers who submit a declination statement and later decide to accept promotion
   may request withdrawal of the declination statement, provided they have remained
   continuously on the ADL.
       12.2.2.1. An officer desiring to withdraw a previous declination statement can submit a
       letter to AFSLMO prior to the effective date of the promotion. If approved by the SECAF
       and CSAF, the promotion will occur on the effective date. An officer may also request
       withdrawal of the declination if the effective date of promotion has passed via letter to
       the AFSLMO. If the SECAF and CSAF approve the request, the officer will be promoted
       when headspace exists in the required general officer rank. In either case, the SECAF and
       CSAF may decline the request and initiate promotion propriety action to remove the
       officer from the list.
12.3. Promotion Deviations From Sequence Number Order. Officers on a promotion list
may have their nominations and confirmations held up for many reasons. If a situation arises
where an officer is not confirmed and promotions from the list begin, the Air Force may
temporarily bypass the unconfirmed officers. Once confirmation occurs, this bypassed officer’s
promotion effective date will be established, for all purposes, to restore this officer to his or her
original place on the promotion list.

Terms
Active Duty List (ADL)—All Air Force officers serving on extended active duty other than
those excluded by 10 U.S.C. 641. Carry officers on the ADL by competitive category and, within
their competitive category, in the order of seniority of the grade in which they are serving. Carry
officers in the same grade on the ADL in the order of their seniority in that grade as determined
according to the sequence criteria in paragraph 3.7
Benchmark Records—Depending on the size of the competitive category, usually 10 officer
selection records representing the quality of five selected officers and five nonselected officers
surrounding the point at which the best-qualified quota was exhausted for a competitive category
by a particular central selection board.
Best-Qualified Method of Selection— Refers to the requirement that boards may only
recommend for promotion those officers considered to be best qualified for promotion within
each competitive category. The best-qualified method of selection is to align the officers in a
relative order of merit listing according to board scores. The board may not recommend an
officer for promotion as best qualified unless it also considers the officer to be fully qualified for
promotion. NOTE: See definition of "fully qualified."
 90                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


Central Selection Board—A board of officers convened under the authority of the SECAF to
consider ADL officers for promotion or selective continuation to the grades of major through
major general.
Competitive Category—A grouping of officers who compete among themselves for promotion.
The established categories are: Line of the Air Force (LAF), Judge Advocate General (JAG),
Medical Corps (MC), Dental Corps (DC), Chaplains (CHAP), Medical Service Corps (MSC),
Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC), and Nurse Corps (NC).
Continuation—The retention of officers on the ADL, subject to involuntary separation or
retirement, who possess a needed skill.
Current Grade Date of Rank (CGDOR)—The date used as the primary means of indicating
relative seniority among officers of the same grade and competitive category to establish
eligibility for consideration for promotion to the next higher grade. (AFI 36-2604, Service Dates
and Dates of Rank explains initial CGDOR computation.)
De Facto Officer—An officer who assumed a higher grade, and acted in that capacity, pursuant
to an apparently valid appointment that was in fact void.
Effective Date of Promotion—Also known as the current grade effective date of promotion, this
is the date on which pay and entitlements are effective. It is normally the date of the order that
announces the promotion, unless an earlier date is specified in the order. Normally this date
cannot be earlier than the officer's extended active duty (EAD) date in that grade, PDUSD (P&R)
approval of the selection board results to the grade of captain, or Senate confirmation to the
grades of major through colonel. For purposes of promotion propriety actions, the effective date
of promotion is the date the promotion is made; i.e., the date of actual promotion pin-on as
authorized by HQ AFPC/DPPPO.
Failed of Selection for Promotion— An officer (other than an officer considered from BPZ)
whom a board considered but did not recommend for promotion. Refer to such officers as
nonselectees. NOTE: An officer actually becomes a selectee or nonselectee at the time the board
adjourns.
Federal Recognition— Acknowledgment by the Federal government that an individual
appointed within the Air National Guard meets the prescribed Federal standards for the grade
and position to which appointed or promoted by the state.
Frocking— Early pin-on authorized according to paragraph 4.2 and 12.1
Fully Qualified— Those officers who meet the minimum qualifications for promotion to the
next higher grade.
Further Continuation— An officer's second or subsequent consideration for continuation.
Junior and Senior Listing— A list identifying the most junior and the most senior officers
within a grade and within each competitive category who are eligible for promotion
consideration IPZ as specified by HQ AFPC/DPPPO through the grade of colonel or AFSLMO
for promotions above the grade of colonel.
Major Commander— As used in this instruction, the term means: the commander or vice
commander, MAJCOM or FOA; the commander, vice commander or superintendent, DRU; an
Air Staff deputy chief of staff or director and comparable officer in the Office of the SECAF for
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                         91


0N command; the commander, 11th Wing for code 2W or 3V; the commander, USAFE for code
3G; and the commander, 1100 National Capital Region Support Group (1100 NCR SPTG).
NOTE:—An officer's MAJCOM identification contained in the PDS determines who is the
major commander.
Officer Preselection Brief (OPB)— A computer printout produced at base level that contains
selected data from the Headquarters Air Force Master Personnel File (HAF MPF). HQ
AFPC/DPPPO generates an output product to create the OPB about 140 days before the board
convenes (see paragraph 8.9.1 for general officer boards). The MPF produces and sends the OPB
to officers for their review and prompt updating as needed. NOTE: Receipt of OPBs by eligible
officers is not a legal prerequisite to convening a selection board or to the proper conduct of a
selection board. Therefore, nonreceipt is not a basis for changing the results of a selection board
or granting an SSB.
Officer Selection Brief (OSB)— An extract of data from the HAF MPF. HQ AFPC/DPPPO
(AFSLMO/ NGB-GO for general officer boards) creates the OSB about 15 days before the board
convenes and files it in the Officer, HQ USAF Selection Record Group (officer selection folder),
for board members to review.
Officer Selection Record (OSR)— The officer selection record is identified as the Officer, HQ
USAF Selection Record Group (AFI 36-2608). It consists of the documents provided to selection
boards.
Overdue Officer— An officer never considered for promotion to the next higher grade, but
whose CGDOR falls within the criteria of APZ eligibility. Consider these officers as first time
eligibles, IPZ, and affect the board quota.
Promotion—An advancement in grade that is not the result of a new original appointment.
Promotion List—An active duty seniority listing of all officers approved for promotion within a
competitive category to the grade of captain and above.
Promotion Opportunity—The approximate percentage of officers in a cohort group selected for
promotion before competing for promotion BPZ, IPZ, and APZ. NOTE: This definition applies
for promotion to major through colonel.
Promotion Phase Point—The average number of years and months of active commissioned
service completed when an officer in a particular competitive category advances to a particular
grade (through the grade of colonel).
Promotion Zones—Officers eligible for promotion fall into one of the three promotion zones
based on their CGDOR as described below:
Below-the-Promotion Zone (BPZ)—Officers eligible for promotion consideration but junior to
officers eligible IPZ and APZ for their competitive category. BPZ promotions provide an
opportunity for accelerated promotion of officers who are exceptionally well qualified as
specified by 10 U.S.C. 616(b). Officers normally have at least two opportunities for
consideration for promotion to the next higher grade as BPZ officers. However, individual
circumstances may result in fewer than two BPZ considerations. There is no BPZ consideration
for promotion to the grades of first lieutenant, captain, or major. Deduct the BPZ selections from
the I/APZ board quota.
 92                                                                 AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


In-the-Promotion Zone (IPZ)—Officers who are senior to the officer specified by the SECAF
as being the junior officer eligible for promotion consideration IPZ for their competitive
category,
and who have neither failed selection to the next higher grade nor been removed from a
promotion list to that grade after selection IPZ.
Above-the-Promotion Zone (APZ)—Officers who are eligible for promotion consideration to
the next higher grade and who have previously been nonselected for promotion, and who are
senior to the senior IPZ officer for their competitive category for that board. NOTE: There are
no promotion zones to general officer grades.
Propriety Actions—Administrative actions taken by a commander or higher authority to either
delay an officer's promotion, find an officer (or recommend an officer be found) NQP, find an
officer not qualified for continuation, remove an officer's name from a promotion list, or remove
an officer's name from a continuation list.
Quota of a Selection Board—The maximum number of officers selected in a competitive
category for promotion by a selection board. The board quota for promotion boards selecting
majors through colonels is computed by multiplying the promotion opportunity by the number of
officers being considered IPZ, to include overdue officers, in each competitive category. The
combined number of officers selected IPZ, BPZ, and APZ cannot exceed the quota for each
competitive category. General officer board quotas are determined based on requirements.
NOTE: The SECAF may authorize alternative methods of computing board quotas in other than
LAF competitive categories to meet specific circumstances and requirements.
Retirement Sanctuary—The 2-year period immediately prior to eligibility for retirement as a
commissioned officer under any provision of law.
Reserve Active Status List—A single list for the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps,
required to be maintained under Section 14002, 10 U.S.C., which contains the names of all
officers of that Armed Force, except warrant officers (including commissioned warrant officers)
who are in an active status in a Reserve component of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine
Corps and are not on the Active Duty List.
Separation—A general term that includes discharge, release from active duty, release from
custody and control of the Armed Forces, or transfer to a Reserve component.
Sequence Number—A number assigned to an officer on each promotion list from major
through major general to establish precedence or relative rank among officers of the same grade
in the same competitive category on extended active duty. Monthly increments determined by
HQ USAF and announced by AFPC/DPPPO or AFSLMO use the sequence numbers to
determine who is promoted on the first day of the following month, unless specified otherwise.
EXCEPTION: Promote MC and DC officers through the grade of colonel on their 6-year
CGDOR anniversary and captain selects on their 2-year CGDOR anniversary dates, unless
otherwise specified in their promotion orders.
Special Selection Boards—Boards convened by the SECAF to consider eligible officers for
promotion to grades of captain through major general who did not meet a board or were
improperly considered by one or more promotion selection boards (see Chapter 6 and paragraph
10.4).
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                           93


Whole Person Concept—A subjective assessment of each officer's relative potential to serve in
the next higher grade that requires careful review of the officer's entire selection folder to assess
such factors as job performance, professional qualities, leadership, job responsibility, depth and
breadth of experience, specific achievements, and academic and professional military education.
 94                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004

                          PROMOTION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

A2.1. Eligibility for Promotion to First Lieutenant. Second lieutenants on the ADL are
eligible for promotion as soon as they have 24-months time-in-grade computed from their
CGDOR as a second lieutenant.
A2.2. Eligibility for Promotion to Captain. Promote IPZ first lieutenants on the ADL selected
for promotion to captain after completing 24-months time-in-grade computed from their
CGDOR as a first lieutenant, or upon the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for
Personnel and Readiness (PDUSD(P&R)) approval of the captain selection board report,
whichever is later. SecAF may authorize DOR/effective date adjustment when there are unusual
circumstances that cause unintended delays in the processing or approval of a selection list (i.e.,
delay of management level decisions, constructive service credit for officers overdue who due to
processing delays, will not be promoted on-time) according to DoDD 1310.1, paragraph 4.9;
however, the new DOR cannot be earlier than the quarterly cycle close-out date (i.e., 31 Mar,
30 Jun, 30 Sep or 31 Dec for each year). Promote officers selected the second time on the first
day of the first month in which promotions begin from the list containing the officer’s name. A
Reserve officer who is not selected the first time considered and who has insufficient
retainability for a second consideration may apply for a specified period of time contract to give
the officer at least 18-months retainability.
   A2.2.1. Effective calendar year 2003, captain selections for all competitive categories are
   made quarterly by the officer’s respective Management Level on a fully qualified basis. IPZ
   officers are considered during the appropriate quarter, a year prior to attaining 24 months
   time-in-grade. For example, a first lieutenant with a CGDOR of 22 Feb 02, without a
   nonselection, is considered for promotion to captain during the A-cycle (see below) in 2003,
   for promotion to captain 22 Feb 04. APZ officers are considered during the appropriate
   quarter, a year after their IPZ quarterly consideration, or the next possible quarter if the APZ
   action occurs after a year from their IPZ consideration (under circumstances whereby an
   officer is removed from a captain selection list according to paragraph 5.10 through 5.13.),
   whichever is sooner. For example, a first lieutenant with a CGDOR of 22 Feb 02 with a
   nonselection is considered for promotion to captain during the A-cycle (see below) in 2004,
   for promotion to captain 1 Jan 04 (see paragraph A2.2 above for promotion timing). The
   quarterly cycles are as follows:
       A2.2.1.1. A cycle begins 1 Jan and closes out 31 Mar, for promotion to captain Jan-Mar
       the following year.
       A2.2.1.2. B cycle begins 1 Apr and closes out 30 Jun, for promotion to captain Apr-Jun
       the following year.
       A2.2.1.3. C cycle begins 1 Jul and closes out 30 Sep, for promotion to captain Jul-Sep
       the following year.
       A2.2.1.4. D cycle begins 1 Oct and closes out 31 Dec, for promotion to captain Oct-Dec
       the following year.
   A2.2.2. The Heads of Management Levels identify promotion recommendation decisions to
   HQ AFPC/DPPPE (Chief, Evaluations Program Branch) no later than five days after the
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                         95


   quarterly cycle close out date. HQ AFPC/DPPPE certifies all eligible officers have a
   promotion recommendation, identifies any unique issues/processing delays/waivers, etc., and
   forwards certification to HQ AFPC/ DPPPO to begin staffing the quarterly results. The
   quarterly results are forwarded to PDUSD(P&R) for approval. Approval is announced by
   message approximately 60 to 90 days from the quarterly close out date. There is no formal
   public release date established for captain selections like there is with promotion releases to
   major and above; rather selects/nonselects are announced four times a year. Nonselects must
   be notified in writing according to the annual (October) memorandum outlining the details of
   the quarterly captain process.
A2.3. Eligibility for Promotion to Major Through Major General. Officers on the ADL are
eligible if they meet the criteria established prior to each board by the SECAF or designated
representative. If selected, officers through the grade of colonel other than MC and DC, on a
recommended list to major through major general will appear on a single promotion list for that
competitive category in order of seniority (see paragraph 3.7). After Senate confirmation,
promote officers by seniority sequence number.
   A2.3.1. Title 10, Section 619 requires officers in the grade of captain, major, and lieutenant
   colonel to complete at least 3 years time-in-grade, as of the board convening date, counting
   from their CGDOR, to be eligible for consideration by the board. The SECAF may waive the
   3 years time-in-grade requirement to permit at least two opportunities for BPZ. Reference
   paragraph 9.2 for promotion eligibility to general officer grades.
   A2.3.2. Unless prohibited by some other provision of law or policy, do not mandatorily
   retire Reserve (Conditional Reserve Status) officers in the grade of captain with prior enlisted
   service for nonselection for promotion without having first been considered and twice failed
   selection for promotion to major (once IPZ and once APZ).
A2.4. Eligibility for Promotion of MC/DC Officers. Promote those selected the first time
considered (IPZ) on the sixth anniversary of the CGDOR, or on Senate confirmation of the
promotion, whichever is later. See DoDD 1320.7.
   A2.4.1. Promote officers selected the second or subsequent time considered (APZ) on the
   first day of the first month in which promotions begin from the list that contains the officer's
   name.
   A2.4.2. Promote officers selected BPZ the day following the last officer promoted IPZ from
   the same promotion list, unless the date of the last IPZ officer falls on the last day of the
   promotion cycle. In that case, promote BPZ officers on the last day of the promotion cycle
   (normally 31 May).
A2.5. Promotion Ineligibility. Officers are not eligible for consideration by a selection board if
they:
   A2.5.1. Are not on the ADL, or service dates have not been verified as of board convening
   date; however, once service dates are verified, the officer may be entitled to SSB.
   A2.5.2. Do not meet the eligibility criteria established by the SECAF.
   A2.5.3. Have not been on extended active duty at least 6 consecutive months immediately
   before the central selection board's convening date or have not been on extended active duty
   at least 12 consecutive months immediately before the central selection board’s convening
96                                                              AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


  date when returning to active duty under the voluntary recall program or any other Reserve
  recall program. Exceptions are officers being considered for promotion when promotion
  opportunity is 100%.
  A2.5.4. Have been determined by the SECAF to be unfit to perform the duties of the office
  or grade because of physical disability.
  A2.5.5. Are on a previous list or previously declined to be promoted but have not been
  removed from the list.
  A2.5.6. Are first lieutenants who failed selection for promotion to captain two or more
  times.
  A2.5.7. Have a DOS or retirement within 90 days following the date a board convenes
  provided the application for separation or retirement was approved prior to the board
  convening date. Individuals whose applications for separation or retirement are approved on
  or after the board convening date regardless of the separation or retirement date remain
  eligible for the board.

                            SPECIAL BOARDS INSTRUCTIONS

This Instruction implements section 1558 of title 10, United States Code. It sets up procedures
and time limits for conducting Special Boards to consider whether to recommend a member,
prospective member, or former member of the Air Force for appointment, enlistment,
reenlistment, assignment, promotion, retention, separation, retirement, or transfer to inactive
status in a reserve component, for which that person was not considered, or was improperly
considered, by a previously convened selection board that should have considered him/her, and
provides for correction of a member’s military record to effect the approved recommendation of
a Special Board. It applies to the active Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National
Guard.
This Instruction authorizes collection and maintenance of information subject to the Privacy Act
of 1974.
A13.1. Authority for Special Boards. Section 1558 of title 10, United States Code, authorizes
SAF to convene Special Boards to consider whether to recommend a member, prospective
member, or former member of the Air Force for appointment, enlistment, reenlistment,
assignment, promotion, retention, separation, retirement, or transfer to inactive status in a reserve
component, for which that person was not considered, or was improperly considered, by a
previously convened selection board that should have considered him/her. EXCEPTION: A
Special Board under this Instruction will not be convened to consider an officer or former officer
for promotion if consideration by a Special Selection Board is authorized under AFI 36-2501,
Chapter 6 or AFI 36-2504, Chapter 9.
A13.2. Holding Special Boards. HQ AFPC/DPPB (active duty) or HQ ARPC/DPB (Reserve
of the Air Force) conducts Special Boards as directed by SAF. To the maximum extent
practicable, a Special Board replicates the original board that should have considered, or that
improperly considered, the person under consideration, to include composition of the board,
procedures, and information furnished to the board.
A13.3. Requesting Special Board Consideration.
   A13.3.1. Members, prospective members, and former members of the Air Force request
   Special Board consideration by a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military
   Records. If the member, former member, or prospective member is incapable of acting on his
   or her own behalf, is missing, or is deceased, application may be made by an heir, legal
   representative, or close relative, by using DD Form 149, Application for Correction of
   Military Records. See AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records,
   paragraph 3.1.
   A13.3.2. When SAF directs, HQ AFPC/DPPP or HQ ARPC/DPB (as appropriate) may
   provide for other methods of application to facilitate the processing of specific categories of
   applications.
A13.4. Granting and Denying Special Board Consideration.
   A13.4.1. HQ AFPC/DPPP or HQ ARPC/DPB (as appropriate) may grant consideration of a
   person by a Special Board when:
AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004                                                                       111


      A13.4.1.1. The person was not considered by a selection board that should have
      considered him/ her for any purpose enumerated in paragraph 1.
      A13.4.1.2. The action of the selection board that considered the person was contrary to
      law or involved material error of fact or material administrative error.
      A13.4.1.3. The selection board that considered the person did not consider material
      information that should have been available in compliance with pertinent Air Force
      directives, instructions and policies.
   A13.4.2. If an application for Special Board consideration is not granted under paragraph
   4.1, it will be forwarded to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
   (AFBCMR) for consideration. The AFBCMR may grant consideration of a person by a
   Special Board when the AFBCMR determines that such consideration is appropriate because
   of an error or injustice in the person’s military record. The AFBCMR may deny, or
   recommend denial of, Special Board consideration, in accordance with AFI 36-2603, Air
   Force Board for Correction of Military Records.
   A13.4.3. SAF may grant or deny consideration of a person by a Special Board in any case.
A13.5. Procedures for Special Boards.
   A13.5.1. SAF convenes and instructs Special Boards, and appoints Special Board members.
   A13.5.2. Special Board membership and internal organization and procedures, including
   number, grade, component and, if applicable, competitive category of board members, and
   information provided to the board, will parallel those of the original board to the extent
   practicable.
   A13.5.3. Special Boards will consider the records of persons under consideration as those
   records would have appeared to the original board if the persons had been properly
   considered. Normally, Special Boards will compare the records of persons under
   consideration with a sampling of records of persons selected, and not selected, by the original
   board. If such a sampling of records is not available, or if SAF determine that, under the
   circumstances of a particular case or category of cases, such a comparison would not result in
   fair and equitable consideration of the persons under consideration, SAF may prescribe a
   different process.
   A13.5.4. Normally, Special Boards will employ the scoring and selection methods used by
   Special Selection Boards. SAF may direct changes in these methods when necessary to
   ensure fair and equitable consideration under the circumstances of a particular case or
   category of cases.
   A13.5.5. Special Boards will provide a report to SAF recommending that the persons under
   consideration be, or not be, selected for the purpose for which they were considered by the
   original board.
A13.6. Action on Reports of Special Boards.
   A13.6.1. SAF will review the report of each Special Board and may:
      A13.6.1.1. Approve it.
 112                                                                  AFI36-2501 16 JULY 2004


       A13.6.1.2. Disapprove it, in whole or in part. If SAF disapproves the report of a Special
       Board, he/she will state in writing his/her reasons for doing so.
       A13.6.1.3. Return it to the Special Board for further proceedings, with a written
       explanation of the reasons for such action, if SAF determines that the Special Board acted
       contrary to law or regulation, or to guidelines furnished to the Special Board by SAF
   A13.6.2. When SAF approves the report of a Special Board that recommends relief for a
   person under consideration, he/she will direct that the military record of that person be
   corrected to the extent necessary to give full effect to the recommendation of the Special
   Board.
       A13.6.2.1. When correction of the person’s military record results in actual or
       constructive reinstatement on active duty, any entitlement to back active duty pay and
       allowances accruing to the person will be subject to an appropriate offset for civilian
       earnings and other offsets authorized by law.
   A13.6.3. When SAF approves the report of a Special Board that recommends denial of relief
   to a person under consideration, or disapproves the report of a Special Board that
   recommends relief for a person under consideration, the action of the SAF with respect to
   that person is effective and final as of the date of approval of the report of the original board.
A13.7. Time Limits.
   A13.7.1. To obtain consideration by a Special Board, a person ordinarily must apply for
   such consideration within three years after he/she discovered, or with due diligence should
   have discovered, the asserted defect in the original board. SAF, or his/her designee under
   paragraph 4, may excuse late application when it is in the interest of justice to do so.
   A13.7.2. SAF, or his her designee under paragraph 4, will either convene a Special Board or
   deny Special Board consideration within six months of receipt of a complete and properly
   executed application for Special Board consideration.
   A13.7.3. SAF will take final action on the Report of a Special Board within six months of
   convening the Board.
   A13.7.4. SAF may extend the time limits in paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3 in a particular case or
   category of cases, for not more than an additional six months each, when he/she determines
   that a longer period for consideration is warranted. SAF may not delegate this authority.
