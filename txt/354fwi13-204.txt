SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised to meet the requirements of AFI 13-204, Vol 3,
Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, Attachment 2, Airfield Operations Instruction
(AOI) Requirements. Major changes include: Eielson’s runway has been re-designated Runway
32 and Runway 14. Attachments have been removed and diagrams have been incorporated into
the text to be more user-friendly. Taxiway Lima (L) is referred to as ―the Loop Taxiway‖ based
on the common reference to the taxiway. All references to the ―Aero Club‖ have been removed
and ―General Aviation‖ has replaced it. Eielson ATC Tower evacuation procedures have been
revised since there is no alternate Tower location.

                                AIRFIELD INFORMATION

2.1. General Airfield Information. Eielson AFB (EIL) is located approximately 17 miles
southeast of Fairbanks, AK at N64O 39.94’ W147O 06.09’. Eielson has a single runway (rwy),
Rwy 32/14. The rwy is 14,530 feet long and is 150 feet wide. Construction is grooved concrete
on the center 75 feet; asphalt makes up the remaining portions of the runway as well as the 75
foot shoulders on both sides of the rwy. The rwy shoulders on the first 3,200 feet of the
approach end of Rwy 32 are not stressed. The remaining 11,300 feet of rwy shoulders are
stressed 150 feet each side of rwy centerline. Field elevation is 547 feet MSL, measured at the
approach end of Rwy 32. Rwy 32 has a -.01% gradient. Rwy 32 is the primary instrument rwy.
Eielson has TACAN and ILS approach capabilities to both Rwy 32 and 14.

Figure 2.1. Airfield Diagram




   2.1.1. Taxiway (twy) /Taxilane Information: Eielson has 11 twys including a high-speed
   entrance twy from the Combat Alert Cell (CAC). Twys A, C, E, and G are 300 feet wide.
   Twys B, L (also known as the Loop Taxiway), and the high-speed twy are 100 feet wide.
   Twy D is 150 feet wide. Taxilanes H and J are 75 feet wide. Taxilane F has numerous aprons
   attached and varies from 100 feet to 300 feet in width. All twys/taxilanes are weight bearing
   for base-assigned aircraft.
   2.1.2. Adjacent Airports:
       2.1.2.1. Fairbanks International Airport (FAI), 268R/22 NM from the EIL TACAN.
 10                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


       2.1.2.2. Fort Wainwright AAF (FBK), 284R/16 NM from the EIL TACAN.
2.2. Runway Selection Procedures. The ATC watch supervisor will use the criteria outlined
below to determine the rwy in use, but he/she may in the interest of safety and/or to maintain an
expeditious and orderly flow of traffic, deviate from this criteria.
   2.2.1. When the tailwind component is 10 knots or less, Rwy 32 will be the rwy in use.
   2.2.2. When the crosswind component exceeds 10 knots, the rwy most nearly aligned with
   the wind will be in use.
   2.2.3. When the ceiling and/or visibility are below published circling minimums, wind
   direction and speed will not be the sole determining factor for choosing the rwy in use. Due
   to snow operations some areas on the rwy may not be cleared, and rwy use may be
   determined by cleared areas on the airfield.
   2.2.4. Tower shall notify Fairbanks Approach (FAI), Airfield Management (AMOPS), Fire
   Department, and the weather observer prior to changing the runway in use and document
   change in the AF Form 3616.
2.3. Controlled Movement Areas (CMA).
   2.3.1. The CMA is defined as the rwy and any twy surface within the rwy hold lines and all
   areas within 150 feet of the rwy. The CMA also includes any instrument critical areas (see
   paragraph 2.21). Cargain Road and Perimeter Road that fall within the Rwy 14 Localizer
   Critical Area and the Rwy 32 Glide Slope Critical Area are part of the CMA.

Figure 2.2. CMA Diagram




   2.3.2. Procedures for operating within the Eielson AFB CMA will be in accordance with 354
   FWI 13-213, Airfield Driving Instruction. All vehicles and pedestrians will hold short of the
   runway hold lines and contact tower, to gain approval, prior to operating in the CMA.
   Vehicle/pedestrians must maintain direct two-way radio contact with the control Tower
   (Ramp Net or 121.8/275.8) while they are in the CMA.NOTE: With Tower approval, power
   production/barrier maintenance personnel may perform necessary duties in the arresting
   system pit areas. Approval from the Tower for this operation does not constitute approval on
   the rwy and barrier maintenance vehicles will remain behind the barrier housings.
   2.3.3. The airfield is uncontrolled when the control tower is closed.
   2.3.4. Uncontrolled Movement Areas: Uncontrolled movement areas are defined as all twys
   and apron areas beyond the rwy hold lines and more than 150 feet from the runway. They do
   not require Tower approval for vehicle/pedestrian movement. NOTE: Aircraft movements
   still require Tower approval between 0700-2300L.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                      11


   2.3.5. Aircraft movement is authorized without Tower approval only on the Loop Twy,
   parking rows A through D (in front of the 8-bay/4-bay), and in between and around the
   Hangars 1227 & 1228.
2.4. Airfield Lighting. Eielson Runway 32/14 has ALSF-1 with sequenced flashing lights,
PAPIs, and HIRLS. Eielson Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) will operate all approach,
runway, and taxiway lights IAW FAAO 7110.65 with the following exceptions: NOTE:
Runway lighting configuration is non-standard. 2000’ of runway edge lights between DELTA
and CHARLIE are located 12’ from the runway edge. The south 3200’ Runway edge lights
width is 75 feet from the runway centerline. The remaining edge lights are 150 feet from the
runway centerline.
   2.4.1. Lighting intensities may be adjusted when requested by a pilot, AMOPS, Snow
   Removal, or Supervisor of Flying (SOF). If the lights are requested to be set lower, they will
   be returned to FAAO 7110.65 criteria after the requesting party’s operation is complete.
   2.4.2. Tower will notify Airfield Lighting and AMOPS anytime the airfield lights become
   inoperative.
   2.4.3. If the Tower must evacuate, the rwy edge lights and approach lights for the rwy in use
   will be set on the step required at the time based on the current weather observation and the
   FAAO 7110.65 criteria or step 1. Twy lights will also be activated. Tower will transfer
   airfield lighting controls over to AMOPS when evacuating and AMOPS will accomplish
   future changes, if necessary.
   2.4.4. In the event AMOPS also evacuates, AMOPS will notify Airfield Lighting to dispatch
   personnel to the lighting vault to change light settings while the AMOPS facility is
   evacuated.
   2.4.5. When airfield is closed, control of all airfield lighting will be given to Airfield
   Lighting who will turn off all airfield lights unless needed for snow removal or any operation
   during periods of reduced visibility. If airfield lighting is needed during periods the control
   Tower is closed, all lighting may be turned on with the exception of the rotating beacon.
   2.4.6. During now removal operations, rwy, twy, and approach lights will be turned on for
   snow equipment operators to see and avoid the lights.
2.5. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. Not applicable at Eielson
2.6. Aircraft Arresting System (AAS)/Barrier Arresting Kit (BAK-12).
   2.6.1. Three BAK-12 arresting systems are installed on Eielson’s rwy. The arresting systems
   are designated the South End, 3/4 Field, and North End. Each system is equipped with an 8-
   point tie down system and systems are not remotely controlled. All of the barriers have a
   cropped runway tape with a maximum pull-out of 950 feet.

                 South End AAS         1,248’ AER 32 / 13282’ AER 14
                 3/4 Field AAS         11,192’ AER 32 / 3338’ AER 14
                 North End             13,426’ AER 32 / 1104’ AER 14
                 NOTE: Distances are measured from the approach end of the
                 runway (AER).
   2.6.2. AMOPS will record and monitor the status of the BAK-12 arresting systems. The
   Control Tower will make notification of an engagement or anticipated engagement over the
   primary crash alarm system (PCAS). Tower will indicate which AAS (North End, 3/4 Field,
   South End) is involved or anticipated and rwy in use. Tower will not make notification over
   the PCAS for planned practice/certification engagements.
   2.6.3. Eielson Tower will use 20 minutes for planning successive engagements; with the
   interval beginning after the first aircraft is released from the cable (more time may be
   required during heavy snow conditions, after duty hours, and low light conditions).
   2.6.4. Arresting Gear Operations:
      2.6.4.1. Rwy 32 operations: both the 3/4 Field and the North End AAS will be
      connected, tied down and in service during 354 FW or other fighter flying operations, and
      the South End AAS will not be connected unless directed otherwise by the 354th
      Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) or Supervisor of Flight (SOF).
      2.6.4.2. Rwy 14 operations: the South End AAS will be connected, tied down and in
      service during 354 FW or other fighter flying operations, and the North End and 3/4 Field
      AAS will not be connected unless directed otherwise by the OG/CC or the SOF.
      2.6.4.3. When the arresting system is out of service, AMOPS will publish a
      corresponding NOTAM.
      2.6.4.4. AMOPS will notify Barrier Maintenance during duty hours or Fire Department,
      after duty hours, to connect/disconnect the cable(s). Barrier Maintenance’s duty hours
      are 0730 to 1600, Monday – Friday, excluding scheduled down days.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                      13


       2.6.4.5. Snow Control Barrier Configuration: During the 354 FW flying window, at the
       start of snowfall, freezing rain or sleet AMOPS will immediately coordinate with the
       SOF and Barrier Maintenance to remove all barriers for snow removal operations. Once
       snow removal has been completed AMOPS will coordinate with the SOF and Barrier
       Maintenance to configure the applicable barrier cables.
       2.6.4.6. AMOPS personnel shall check aircraft arresting systems for obvious conditions
       that could compromise the system’s operation (i.e., noticeably loose cable, doughnut
       spacing, broken rope ties, barrier pad deterioration, etc.). If an unsafe condition exists,
       AMOPS will notify Barrier Maintenance and/or Fire Department (depending on the time
       of day) for correction. AMOPS will also notify Tower of the AAS discrepancy.
       2.6.4.7. When an aircraft engages a BAK-12, Tower shall request aircraft engagement
       speed and gross weight. Tower will pass this information to Barrier Maintenance
       personnel or the senior fire official via the crash net. The Fire Department recovery crew
       will respond to the engaged BAK-12 and initiate reset operations. Barrier Maintenance
       will respond to certify the barrier and assist the Fire Department with connect/disconnect
       and reset operations (normal duty hours only). Expect extended delays outside of duty
       hours.
          2.6.4.7.1. After duty hours, upon notification of a barrier engagement, the Fire
          Department Dispatch will notify the Power Production standby personnel (Barrier
          Maintenance). If Barrier Maintenance has not arrived on scene by the time the Fire
          Department personnel have completed rewind procedures, then the Fire Department
          will remove the cable from the runway to allow airfield operations to resume.
          2.6.4.7.2. After barrier maintenance arrives on scene, the Fire Department will assist
          in the reconnection of the cable, while barrier maintenance will conduct the post
          engagement inspection.          After the inspection has been completed, Barrier
          Maintenance will call the barrier ―back in service‖ to Tower and AMOPS.
       2.6.4.8. AMOPS will inspect the rwy for damage and potential foreign object damage
       (FOD) after each barrier engagement prior to resuming normal operations.
       2.6.4.9. Barrier Maintenance will track maintenance and the 10-year overhaul schedule
       for the AASs.
2.7. Parking Plan/Airfield Restrictions.
   2.7.1. Nose Dock 1 is assigned to Detachment 1, 210 RQS.

Figure 2.4. Arm/De-Arm Locations




   2.13.2. Arm/De-Arming Areas.
      2.13.2.1. Arming.
         2.13.2.1.1. For operating on Rwy 32, 18 AGRS F-16s may arm on Twy E and taxi to
         the runway. For Large Force Exercise (LFE) participants (DISTANT FRONTIER,
         NORTHERN EDGE, RED FLAG-Alaska), the preferred arming area is Twy G with
         aircraft heading of 240 degrees.
         2.13.2.1.2. For operating on Rwy 14, 18AGRS F-16s/transient/LFE participants
         arming will be completed on Twy A with aircraft heading 320 degrees.
      2.13.2.2. De-Arming: all aircraft requiring de-arming will be de-armed at the specified
      location prior to continuing taxi on the airfield.
         2.13.2.2.1. Rwy 32 ops: 18 AGRS F-16s may de-arm on Twy C, heading 320
         degrees. The primary de-arm area for transient/LFE aircrews is Twy A heading 320
         degrees. The alternate de-arm method for transient/LFE aircrews not carrying
         munitions is to exit the rwy at Twy B and de-arm on P or R rows heading southwest
         (unless aircraft are parked on S or Q rows). LFE participants not carrying munitions
         may de-arm in the chocks with 354 MXG/CC approval.
 18                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


          2.13.2.2.2. For Rwy 14 ops, all aircrews will de-arm on Twy E, heading 140
          degrees. LFE participants not carrying munitions may perform de-arm in the chocks
          with 354 MXG/CC approval.
      2.13.2.3. After arming/de-arming, aircraft will contact Ground Control for taxi
      instructions.
   2.13.3. RADAR Warning Receiver (RWR) Checks.
      2.13.3.1. For Rwy 32 ops: LFE participants will use Twy G for RWR checks, prior to
      arming. Alternate location for RWR checks is the south side of P/Q Rows depending on
      number of available parking spaces.
      2.13.3.2. For Rwy 14 ops: RWR checks will be performed on Twy F in front of Nose
      Dock One.
      2.13.3.3. For aircraft dropping live munitions: if taxiing from the South Loop or South
      Ramp, aircraft may do RWR checks on the South Ramp regardless of the runway in use.
      Location of the RWR checkpoint should not hinder local or transient aircrews not directly
      participating in the exercise.
   2.13.4. Drag Chute Jettison Procedures: under normal circumstances, drag chutes will not
   be jettisoned on the runway. If aircrew must jettison a drag chute, they will notify the Tower
   of the chute’s location.      The Tower will forward the information to AMOPS and/or
   Transient Alert for recovery. Visiting units participating in RED FLAG-Alaska, Distant
   Frontier, etc. and using drag chutes will coordinate drag chute jettison procedures through the
   353 CTS.
   2.13.5. Hot Pit Refueling Areas: 18 AGRS C Row, South Ramp, O, P, Q, R, and S Rows are
   certified as hot refueling areas on Eielson AFB.
   2.13.6. Open Fuel Cell Maintenance Areas: Alpha row, South Ramp spot 16, Tanker Row
   spot 22 and Bay 8.
   2.13.7. Hydrazine (H-70) Maintenance Areas: Alpha row spot 1, bay 8, building 1344 fuel
   shop, Trim pad, or Charlie row.
2.14. Aircraft Towing Procedures.
   2.14.1. 354 MXG MOCC, and the 168 ARW will forward all maintenance tow requests
   (outside of the Loop Taxiways) to AMOPS (377-1861). The coordinating agency will pass
   the aircraft type and tail number, parking spot, destination and tow start time. Tow vehicle
   operators will obtain Ground Control approval prior to towing any aircraft. The tow operator
   will maintain two-way radio communications with Ground Control until the tow is complete.
   EXCEPTION: Two-way communication with Eielson Ground Control is NOT required for
   tow operations being conducted on the Loop, A, B, C and D Rows, or between hangars 1227
   & 1228 as visibility from the tower is restricted in these areas. Prior to taxi within these
   areas, tow supervisors will coordinate for taxi with ―MiG Super‖ on the ―MiG Ops‖
   frequency (18 AGRS Operations - UHF 374.2).
   2.14.2. 354 MXG MOCC is required to monitor the location and towing operations of all
   aircraft.
   2.14.3. Tow vehicles will be equipped with distinctive flashing yellow lights.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     19


   2.14.4. Transient aircraft not monitoring the ―MiG Ops‖ frequency will only be allowed to
   enter the North or South Loop Taxiway when led by a Transient Alert vehicle.
   2.14.5. In the event radio contact with aircraft or vehicles within the controlled movement
   area is lost, Tower will use ATCT light gun signals IAW AFVA 11-240 while
   increasing/decreasing (―flashing‖) the runway edge lights, to indicate all aircraft and
   vehicles must exit the movement area.
2.15. Aircraft Taxi Requirements/Routes. Ground Control is responsible for the control of all
aircraft ground operations on the runway and taxiways. Two-way radio communication with
Eielson Ground Control is required for all aircraft taxi operations. EXCEPTION: 354 FW
aircraft may taxi/be towed on North and South Loop Twys, including A/B/C/D Rows, Taxilanes
H and J without instructions/clearance from Eielson Ground Control due to visual blind spots
from the Tower. These areas are controlled by MIG Super on MIG Ops 374.2. However,
aircraft must receive a taxi clearance from Eielson Ground Control prior to leaving Loop Twy.
   2.15.1. Normal taxi flow into and out of the Loop is the shortest distance to/from the parking
   location.
   2.15.2. Minimum Runway Condition Reading (RCR) for locally assigned aircraft (F-16 and
   KC-135) to taxi is 6. If the RCR is less than 6 the pilot must coordinate with the OG/CC or
   designated representative (SOF) prior to taxi. For other aircraft specific minimum RCRs,
   refer to the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS Vol 3. NOTE: For 168 ARW aircraft, the pilot must
   coordinate with the 168 OG/CC or designated representative prior to taxi.
   2.15.3. If hold lines are NOT visible (winter ops, chipping, fading, etc), aircrews shall not
   taxi beyond the rwy designator signage unless previously cleared by Tower.
   2.15.4. Aircraft will be taxied and/or towed in accordance with AFI 11-218            (and/or
   applicable waivers).
   2.15.5. Aircraft with a wingspan greater than 190 feet are prohibited on Taxilane F between
   Twy B and C (Tanker Row) without wing walkers.
   2.15.6. B-52 Taxi Criteria: unless runway edge lights are removed, B-52 aircraft shall not
   use the south 3,200 feet of runway 32/14 due to runway edge light distance. Twy D may not
   be used for B-52 taxi operations to/from the runway due to proximity of twy
   lighting/signage.
   2.15.7. Security Information: See Eielson AFB’s Full-Spectrum Contingency Plan or contact
   354 SFS for all security related information.
2.16. Airfield Maintenance. Airfield maintenance crews (sweepers, mowers, etc.) will
coordinate with AMOPS prior to work on the airfield. Work crews will ensure their operations
do not create a FOD hazard to aircraft operations.
   2.16.1. Airfield Mowing Operations: airfield mowing will be IAW 354 FWI 91-212 and
   AFPAM 91-212 (and/or applicable waivers).
   2.16.2. Airfield Sweeper Operations: the rwy and Twys A, B, C, D, and E will be checked
   daily by AMOPS. Coordination for sweeper requests should be routed through AMOPS.
   Airfield sweeping priorities, by day of the week, are:
       2.16.2.1. Monday – Loop Taxiway, A/B/C/D Rows, and areas connected to the loop.
 20                                                             354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


      2.16.2.2. Tuesday – Hangars 1227 & 1228 to Twy E, to include the CAC.
      2.16.2.3. Wednesday – Areas from the Fire Dept. to hangars 1227 & 1228.
      2.16.2.4. Thursday – Areas from the Thunder Dome to the Fire Dept.
      2.16.2.5. Friday – Nose Dock 1 & 2 to the Thunder Dome.
2.17. Runway Surface Condition (RSC)/Runway Condition Reading (RCR).

                     /P                   Patchy
   2.17.1. When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25 percent or more of the runway
   surface area (whether in isolated areas or not), report the RSC as "wet runway" and no RCR.
   Joint USAF/NASA tests have proven RCR measurements to be invalid where the only form
   of moisture affecting the runway is water.

Table 2.5. RCR to Braking Action Equivalent
                     RCR Number                Braking Action

                     19 – 25                   GOOD
                     NOTE: A RCR will not be taken when the rwy is wet.
   2.17.2. When slush is on the runway and ice or snow is not present, report the RSC as "slush
   on runway‖ and no RCR.
   2.17.3. When water or slush is present on an ice-covered runway, report the predominant
   RSC, and the RCR.
2.18. Airfield Inspections and Checks.
   2.18.1. As a minimum, AMOPS will perform one daily airfield inspection to ensure the
   airfield is free from conditions hazardous to aircraft operations. These inspections should be
   made during hours of daylight and no later than 1200L.
   2.18.2. Airfield checks will be conducted as needed to examine the primary takeoff, landing,
   and taxi surfaces.
   2.18.3. Airfield Lighting will conduct a daily airfield lighting check, excluding weekends
   and holidays. When operating on weekends and holidays AMOPS will conduct the daily
   airfield lighting check. When operating under civil twilight, this check is not required.
   NOTE: Airfield Management will perform daily airfield lighting checks IAW current
   Eielson Airfield Management Operating Instruction.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                         21


   2.18.4. A FOD/Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)/RSC/RCR check will be completed by
   AMOPS a minimum of 1 hours prior to the day’s first takeoff to identify factors hazardous to
   flying operations and allow sufficient time for corrective actions to be taken (i.e., snow
   control operations).
   2.18.5. A check of the snow depth around the ILS glide slopes will be accomplished during
   snow and blowing snow conditions.
2.19. Procedures for Opening/Closing the Runway. Airfield Management is the only agency
that can open or close the runway. AMOPS will close the airfield for any safety condition on the
runway which cannot be corrected quickly during a runway suspension. Closures less than 96
hours will be coordinated through the 354 FW/CC for approval (i.e., weekend holiday closures,
runway repainting, etc), via a closure package which will be routed through base flying agencies.
Closures in excess of 96 hours require MAJCOM/A3 approval.
2.20. Suspending Runway Operations.
   2.20.1. In the event suspension occurs, AMOPS will complete an airfield check and report
   the airfield status/runway condition prior to resuming operations. The SOF may only waive
   a FOD check following an IFE for the immediate recovery of aircraft. In the event the SOF
   waives the suspension, full responsibility of the runway condition is levied upon the SOF and
   documented on the AMOPS AF Form 3616.
   2.20.2. For all emergency landings, Tower will suspend aircraft operations that may interfere
   with emergency vehicle operations to the runway and taxiways/taxilanes. Tower will
   coordinate with Chief 1 or Chief 2 to continue all other taxi ops (except for Loop Twys and
   hangars 1227 & 1228) to ensure that they do not interfere with emergency vehicle operations.
   NOTE: Airfield Management is the only agency authorized to reopen the runway
   after suspensions/closures.
2.21. Engine Run-up Procedures.
   2.21.1. AMOPS (377-1861) is the single point of contact for 354 MXG MOCC, and 168
   ARW MOCC to coordinate for aircraft engine maintenance runs. Requestors will include the
   aircraft type and tail number, the proposed engine run start time and the aircraft parking spot
   when making the request. NOTE: For any engine run, it is the aircrew’s and/or maintenance
   personnel’s responsibility to ensure the area behind the aircraft is clear of aircraft, equipment,
   and personnel.
   2.21.2. Power settings are based on the aircraft flight manual.
   2.21.3. Fighter type aircraft may perform up to 85% power engine runs in any designated
   fighter parking spot.
   2.21.4. Fighter type aircraft may perform 85% or greater at the trim pad or hush house.
   2.21.5. Nose Dock 7: engine runs will NOT be performed in front of the nose dock at any
   time when snow/ice/frost conditions are present. Engine runs up to 80% may be conducted
   during non-snow/ice/frost conditions.
   2.21.6. Heavy aircraft (non-bomber) may accomplish up to 100% (maximum power) engine
   runs on Papa/Quebec, Romeo/Sierra, Tanker Row, and the South Ramp. Heavies may only
   perform idle engine runs on Oscar Row.
 22                                                               354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


   2.21.7. Bomber aircraft requiring engine runs up to 80% may perform them in the parking
   spot. For 100% engine runs, bomber aircraft will be positioned at the intersection of Twy E
   and Twy G, facing south, so their jet blast will not affect other aircraft operations or create a
   FOD hazard.
   2.21.8. During conditions susceptible to ice fog formation, Tower may direct termination of
   engine runs that cause ice fog formation over or near the runway.
   2.21.9. Small aircraft which are prop-driven may perform 100% engine runs at any location.
   2.21.10. Aircrews and/or maintenance personnel will obtain Ground Control approval prior
   to engine runs and maintain two-way radio communications with Ground Control until the
   engine run is complete.
2.22. Noise Abatement/Quiet Hours.
   2.22.1. Aircraft will avoid overflying base housing below 3,500 feet MSL for noise
   abatement and safety reasons. Those air traffic patterns which do overfly the east side of the
   rwy are at or above 3,500 feet MSL.
   2.22.2. The 354 OG/CC or designated representative is the approval authority for the
   implementation of quiet hours and waiver authority for aircraft flying operations during quiet
   hours.
   2.22.3. Quiet hours are in effect for all aircraft operations 2200-0600L, IAW AFI 21-101,
   354 FW Sup. No closed pattern work is to occur during this time, all arrivals will land via
   straight-in approaches. Runway 32 is the preferred runway for arrivals during quiet hours.
   2.22.4. During quiet hours, maintenance personnel will not conduct engine runs, to include
   engine motoring, without MXG/CC approval, with the following exceptions:
      2.22.4.1. Fighter type aircraft may run-up engine(s) to 80% in any maintenance bay(s)
      (the 8-bay/4-bay, the Hangars 1227 & 1228) or the South Loop area.
      2.22.4.2. Fighter type aircraft may run engine(s) up to max power in the hush house.
   2.22.5. Ceremonial quiet hours are granted by the 354 OG/CC for change of command
   ceremonies, parades, etc. Implementation of ceremonial quiet hours may prohibit engine
   runs, aircraft movement operations, or operations of aerospace ground equipment, with the
   exception of emergencies.
      2.22.5.1. All requests for ceremonial quiet hours will be coordinated through Wing
      Scheduling (354 OSS/OSCR), 377-9327, a minimum of four weeks prior to the requested
      date. Requests will include the desired date, time (normally not to exceed one hour),
      location, and reason for the request.
      2.22.5.2. Upon receipt, 354 OSS/OSCR will verify the request, coordinate with 354
      OG/CC or designated representative for approval, notify AOF/CC, and
      annotate/deconflict the restriction on the airspace scheduling flow sheet. AMOPS will
      issue a NOTAM or airfield advisory, as appropriate.
2.23. Protection of Precision Approach Critical Areas.
   2.23.1. The Precision Approach Critical Areas include the Localizer Critical Area, the Glide
   Slope Critical Area, and the Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ).

   2.23.2. Localizer Critical Area: The localizer critical area is defined by FAAO 6750.16D.
   No part of the Localizer Critical Area extends past a VFR hold line. (See Figure 2.).
   2.23.3. Glide Slope Critical Area. Eielson operates a Category 1 ILS. The critical area is
   defined by FAAO 6750.16D. No part of the Glide Slope Critical Area extends past a VFR
   hold line.

Figure 2.5. Precision Approach Critical Areas




   2.23.4. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). The POFZ is defined by FAAO 7110.65. The
   POFZ is considered clear even if the wing of the aircraft holding on a taxiway waiting for
   runway clearance penetrates the POFZ; however, neither the fuselage nor the tail may
   infringe on the POFZ.
   2.23.5. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or visibility is less than 2 miles,
   Tower will restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations on Twy E to the instrument hold line.
   Tower will inform aircraft on an instrument approach of any taxiing aircraft or vehicles
   operating near the POFZ.
2.24. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield. Tanker Row (Spots 11-19), hangars 1227 &
1228, and the 8-bay/4-bay are Eielson’s three permanent restricted areas. A, B, C and D Rows
and a portion of the South Loop becomes restricted when aircraft are parked on them.
Temporary restricted areas may be established by 354 SFS as required.

         10 NM from Runway 32. Runway 14 departures do not pose as much of a hazard as
         they are vectored by Fairbanks Approach (FAI ATCT) prior to the SDZ/VDZ
         penetration of the departure corridor.
         3.2.1.4.6. CATM will cease fire until approved by tower to resume firing. For
         recoveries greater than 15 minutes at a time (i.e., RED FLAG-Alaska, NORTHERN
         EDGE, and Distant Frontier) and based on the ORMA, CATM instructors may
         resume .50 caliber firing if they post a dedicated aircraft monitor/spotter, at the
         highest point at the range, who is responsible for monitoring the area for inbound
         aircraft.
     3.2.1.5. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Range is located 2.8 NM east of Eielson
     runway, 2,200 feet north of the oil pipeline, on top of the small ridge across from Eielson

                                           Chapter 4

                    VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) PROCEDURES

4.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
   4.1.1. Weather minimums are based solely on the official weather observation provided by
   base weather (OSS/OSW). Air Traffic Controllers are not official weather observers and
   cannot open traffic patterns if the official weather observation will not support it.
   4.1.2. Minimum weather conditions for local VFR traffic patterns are as follows:
      4.1.2.1. 3 SM Visibility: Rectangular, Overhead, Straight-ins, and 210th Paradrop
      operations below 10,000 MSL.
      4.1.2.2. 5 SM Visibility: Simulated Flame Out (SFO), Min-Risk departures/arrivals, and
      210th Paradrop operations above 10,000 MSL.
      4.1.2.3. Ceiling: Rectangular, Overhead, Straight-ins, 210th Paradrop operations below
      10,000 MSL, and Min-Risk departures/arrivals - 500 feet above pattern altitude.
      4.1.2.4. Ceiling: SFO patterns – 1000 feet above pattern altitude. NOTE: Tower may
      close the VFR traffic patterns if they are unable to maintain visual contact with aircraft at
      any point in the pattern. It is the Tower Watch Supervisor’s prerogative to close the VFR
      pattern if visual contact cannot be maintained with aircraft at Eielson’s VFR reporting
      points.
   4.1.3. If any military aircraft requests weather information that Approach Control is unable
   to provide, contact Metro on (UHF 344.6) or Pilot to Dispatch (UHF 372.2/VHF 139.3). If
   conditions encountered are different than reported, provide a Pilot Report (PIREP) to Metro
   and Eielson ATCT upon contact.
4.2. VFR Arrivals/Departures.
   4.2.1. VFR Arrivals.
      4.2.1.1. TRSA Arrivals. VFR arrivals should expect TRSA service unless the pilot states
      negative TRSA service‖ or makes a similar statement on initial contact with Fairbanks
      Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). TRSA service will automatically be
      terminated when transferred to Tower frequency.
      4.2.1.2. Pilots will contact Fairbanks TRACON no later than 20 NM from Eielson for
      traffic advisories with call sign, position, Airport Terminal Information Service (ATIS),
      intentions or request. Remain within Fairbanks TRACON until instructed to contact
      Eielson ATCT.
      4.2.1.3. If not in contact with Fairbanks TRACON, contact Eielson Air Traffic Control
      Tower (ATCT) NLT 15 miles from the EIL TACAN with position, VFR entry point
      (ESTER 103/6, SALLY 153/6, or NANCY 273/7), and intentions to include type
      approach and landing. Cross the VFR entry points at 2,500 feet MSL for initial or 1,500
      feet for straight-in.
   4.2.2. VFR Departures.
 30                                                                 354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


       4.2.2.1. TRSA will be IAW Fairbanks/Eielson ATC Tower LOA.
       4.2.2.2. Aircraft will remain at or below 1,500 feet MSL until departure end of the
       runway to protect the overhead pattern unless specifically deleted by Tower.
4.3. VFR Traffic Patterns. The VFR traffic patterns consist of the overhead, the rectangular
pattern, and the straight-in pattern. The direction of traffic will be right turns for Rwy 14 and left
turns for Rwy 32. All aircraft conducting multiple approaches are required to fly to the departure
end of the runway prior to the start of another pattern, unless directed to begin an early turn out
by Tower. Aircraft will squawk 1200 after terminating IFR service with the intent to remain
with Tower. Aircraft making a go-around, low approach, touch-and-go, or on departure will
maintain at or below 1,500 feet MSL until departure end of the runway. Low approaches may be
restricted or denied when it is apparent that ice fog is forming and may obscure the approach
corridor to the runway.
   4.3.1. Rectangular Traffic Pattern: 1,500 feet MSL for non-fighter, fixed wing aircraft.
   4.3.2. Overhead Traffic Pattern: Initial entry into the overhead pattern is via a VFR entry
   point at 2,500 feet MSL and 300 KIAS. Heavy aircraft may fly the overhead at a minimum
   of 230 KIAS. If aircrews have not been sequenced by Fairbanks, they should contact Tower
   and report ―inbound‖ to the entry point NLT 15 NM from the EIL TACAN with intentions
   and ATIS.
       4.3.2.1. Initial: Report initial at 3-5 NM from the rwy, at 2,000 feet MSL. Pilots should
       state intentions (full stop, option, low approach, etc.) with the initial call. Standard point
       for aircraft to break while in the overhead will be the approach end of the runway unless
       otherwise coordinated with Tower.
       4.3.2.2. Aircraft directed to carry through initial will maintain 2,000 feet MSL, turn
       crosswind at departure end, and reenter Sally/Nancy at 2,500 feet MSL unless otherwise
       directed by Tower. Aircraft carrying straight through initial will clear the runway to the
       southwest to keep the takeoff leg in sight, and proceed as directed. If no further
       instructions are given, return to VFR reporting point.
       4.3.2.3. Aircraft wishing to remain in the overhead traffic pattern for multiple
       approaches will request initial. (Example: "Tower, IVAN 01 on the go for initial", "IVAN
       01, report initial".) If approved, aircraft will maintain at or below 1,500 feet MSL until
       the departure end of the runway, turn crosswind at and climb to 2,000 feet MSL
       maintaining a ground track east of the Tanana River, proceed to 3 NM initial.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                    31


Figure 4.1. VFR Patterns




   4.3.3. Closed Traffic: Closed patterns are requested from and approved by Tower. Add
   "type landing" to the request. Once approved, pilots will initiate closed traffic at the
   departure end of the rwy, climb and maintain 2,000 feet MSL for fighter type aircraft. Non-
   fighter aircraft will fly closed traffic at 1,500 feet MSL. If approved for ―present position
   closed,‖ pilots will initiate closed traffic as soon as able, climb and maintain appropriate
   altitude based on type of aircraft.
   4.3.4. Reenter: Aircraft desiring to reenter via the VFR reporting point will request
   "REENTER." If directed to reenter, the aircraft will cross the departure end of the runway,
   proceed southwest of the Tanana River, then proceed to and report the appropriate VFR
   reporting point at 2,500 feet MSL.
   4.3.5. Break Out: If instructed to ―BREAKOUT‖ and report "SALLY" or "NANCY,"
   aircraft will turn crosswind at the departure end of the rwy then climb to 2,500 feet MSL and
 32                                                               354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


   proceed to the VFR entry point. If self-initiated for a conflict, make an advisory call to
   Tower.
   4.3.6. Tactical Initial: Tactical initial is flown at 300-350 KIAS in a line abreast formation,
   4-ship maximum, with the second element no more than 9,000 feet in trail. Element leads
   will fly aligned with the rwy in use (unless otherwise coordinated). Wingman will offset no
   more than 6,000 feet and not over fly base housing. Normal pattern spacing will be
   established in the break. Pilots will inc lude "TAC INITIAL" with request for VFR entry to
   initial.
   4.3.7. VFR Straight-In: Entry to a VFR straight-in is via the VFR reporting point at 1,500
   feet MSL. Once cleared, pilots will proceed to a 3 to 5 mile final. Pilots will request "VFR
   STRAIGHT-IN."
4.4. Special Procedures.
   4.4.1. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Patterns: The Direct West Low Key, Overhead SFO, or
   Glider SFO patterns may be flown by locally assigned F-16 aircraft or TDY aircraft with a
   local area orientation from 354 OGV. SFOs will be approved on a traffic-permitting basis
   and will terminate in a low approach. Strict adherence to these procedures and radio calls is
   mandatory for proper ATC service. Provision of this service by the Tower does not in any
   way absolve the pilot from his/her responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations.
      4.4.1.1. Direct West Low Key. From low approach, pilots may request Direct West Low
      Key. If approved by Tower, pilots will begin a climbing turn to the west to arrive at West
      Low Key no lower than 3,500’ MSL. The maximum low key altitude will be 500 feet
      below the reported ceiling. The remaining portion of the procedure is IAW Overhead
      SFO procedures; however, the Low Key to Base Key pattern will be on the west side of
      the airfield. This allows pilots to simulate engine emergencies on the departure leg
      without having to climb up to High Key.

Table 4.1. Direct West Low Key Reporting Points
 Radio Call                                         Position
 ―Callsign (C/S), request direct West Low Key‖      Low approach <1,500’MSL til departure end
 ―C/S, West Low Key‖                                No lower than 3,500’ MSL
 ―C/S, Base Key, gear down, low approach‖           No later than 2,000’ AGL (2,500’ MSL)
      4.4.1.2. Overhead SFO Pattern: On initial contact or from a low approach, aircraft will
      request "High Key" from Tower. The maximum high key altitude will be 500 feet below
      the reported ceiling. At departure end, aircraft will climb to high key to the west and fly
      a 270-degree descending turn to the east of the field. If instructed, aircraft will orbit high
      key to the east of the runway between 4,000 and 9,500 feet MSL, left turns for Rwy 14,
      and right turns for Rwy 32. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM of the runway. NOTE:
      Pilots are required to report any preceding traffic “in sight” before departing Low Key.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                    33

      4.4.1.3. Glider SFO Pattern: Glider SFOs are initiated from any cardinal direction from
      Eielson or any VFR reporting point, 7 to 10 NM out, in the block 4,000-9,500 feet MSL.
      Pilots should request ―Glider SFO‖ from Fairbanks Approach (or from Tower if already
      in contact). Upon approval for ―Glider SFO,‖ aircraft will report "Glider High" with
      cardinal direction or VFR reporting point. When instructed to report ―Glider Low,‖
      aircraft will proceed to a modified Base Key on either the east or west side of the runway
      and report "Glider Low" 3-5NM from the runway and no lower than 3,500 feet MSL.
      NOTE: Pilots are required to report any preceding traffic in sight before departing
      Glider Low.

      4.4.1.4. When the small arms range is hot, aircraft will not over fly it below 3,500 feet
      MSL. NOTE: If the CATM range is hot for .50 caliber firings, AMOPS will issue a
      NOTAM: EIELSON SMALL ARMS RANGE IS HOT SURFACE TO 6,500 AGL.
      4.4.1.5. Aircraft will normally fly the SFO pattern between 180 and 250 KIAS.
      4.4.1.6. Break Out Instructions: If directed to breakout from any SFO, aircraft will
      remain above 3,500 feet MSL and reenter via ―SALLY/NANCY‖ per VFR traffic
      pattern procedures or request climb back to High Key or Glider High.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     35


   4.4.2. Min Risk Departures/Arrivals: A Min Risk departure/arrival is a VMC tactical
   maneuver designed to minimize the time aircraft are vulnerable to surface threats.
   Climbing/descending "figure-8" patterns above the field will be used to transition to/from the
   medium altitude environment.
      4.4.2.1. Min-Risk Departure: Flights will advise ground control of their intention to fly a
      "Min-Risk Departure." Eielson ATC is the approval authority and must coordinate
      separation from local traffic and Fairbanks before clearing the flight for departure. The
      departure will be flown to the 4,000-9,000 feet MSL block where flights will then
      continue on their assigned clearance.
          4.4.2.1.1. Initiate a climbing "figure 8" pattern to the southwest for both Rwy 32/14
          operations.
          4.4.2.1.2. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM of the TACAN while climbing to 4,000-
          8,000 feet MSL. Fighter-type aircraft will normally only fly the first half of the
          ―figure-8‖ prior to proceeding on course.
          4.4.2.1.3. Formation flights may rejoin to standard formation during the ―figure 8‖
          pattern.

Figure 4.4. Min-Risk Departure and Min-Risk Arrival




      4.4.2.2. Min Risk arrival pilots shall advise Fairbanks Approach on initial contact of
      their intentions to fly a Min-Risk Arrival. Eielson ATC is the approval authority and must
      coordinate separation from local traffic and Fairbanks before clearing the flight to "Min
      Risk" in the 4,000-9,000 feet MSL block. Flights may approach the field in trail or from
      a tactical formation from any cardinal direction. Flights will avoid crossing the departure
      end extended centerline within 5 NM of the field. All aircraft will transition to a normal
      base altitude and airspeed prior to turning base and execute a full stop landing. If Min
36                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


     Risk operations cease during use, aircraft in the Min Risk pattern will execute a low
     approach/breakout at the direction of the Tower and re-enter for a normal initial.
         4.4.2.2.1. Aircraft will report "High Initial" with cardinal direction in the 4,000-9,000
         feet MSL block, 5 NM from the departure end of the field.
         4.4.2.2.2. At the departure end, flights will initiate a "figure 8" pattern to the
         southwest for both Rwy 32/14 operations descending profile to remain within 3 NM
         of runway as depicted (Figure 11).
         4.4.2.2.3. Aircraft will cross midfield at or above 3,000 feet MSL and transition to a
         normal base to final from the northeast.
     4.4.2.3. The Min Risk Departure/Arrival is a VMC maneuver only. Ceiling must be 500
     feet above the planned maximum pattern altitude, visibility 5 NM.
     4.4.2.4. Min Risk Departure operations will not be approved simultaneously with Min
     Risk Arrival operations or when aircraft are in the overhead or SFO patterns. NOTE:
     Tower will not clear a Min Risk departure for takeoff nor approve a Min Risk arrival
     when aircraft are in the overhead pattern or the SFO pattern.
  4.4.3. Helicopter Operations.
     4.4.3.1. Non base assigned Helicopters shall arrive/depart from the runway for flight
     safety. Base assigned Helicopters may arrive/depart Eielson from the runway or the apron
     West of Nose Docks 1&2 (to include the adjacent areas of Twy F). Helicopters will not
     over fly buildings or parked aircraft below 200 feet AGL.
     4.4.3.2. Coordinate alternate taxi means (hover or air taxi) with Tower for specific
     requirements.
     4.4.3.3. Moose Creek Departure: The Moose Creek Departure is a VFR departure.
     Departures shall turn to a heading of 340 once the aircraft is 200 feet AGL to provide
     course divergence from the runway. Maintain VFR until reaching the Alaskan Pipeline.
         4.4.3.3.1. Moose Creek North: Upon reaching the pipeline, turn left heading 320
         degrees. Upon reaching the Flood Control Project continue on course to exit the Class
         Delta Surface Area.
         4.4.3.3.2. Moose Creek South: Upon reaching the pipeline, turn right to follow the
         pipeline until clear of the Loop Taxiway. Prior to the small arms impact area, turn to a
         heading of 220 degrees to exit the Class Delta Surface Area.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                   37


Figure 4.5. Moose Creek Deparature/Arrival




      4.4.3.4. South Departure: helicopters will climb to 1,000 feet MSL (500AGL) and head
      190 degrees until clear of the Class Delta Surface Area.
      4.4.3.5. VFR Arrivals: Helicopters should remain at or above 200 feet AGL until over a
      prepared surface. When landing to a non-controlled movement area (apron West of Nose
      Docks 1&2), avoid over flight of buildings, personnel, and vehicles. Pilots will give way
      to vehicles (snow removal, airfield maintenance, EOR, etc), personnel, aircraft, and
      airfield equipment which may be unaware of the helicopter’s presence.
         4.4.3.5.1. Moose Creek North/South Arrival: helicopters shall request "Moose Creek
         North/South Arrival." Arrival traffic shall follow the opposite ground track of the
         corresponding departures.
         4.4.3.5.2. South/West Arrival: helicopters arriving from the south/west may fly
         directly to the north end of the rwy and land on apron West of Nose Docks 1&2 (Base
         assigned helicopters only). Helicopters may be held for arriving/departing fixed wing
         aircraft.
      4.4.3.6. VFR Pattern Operations: helicopters remaining in the closed pattern to perform
      functional check flights shall operate at or below 1,000 feet MSL unless approved for
      higher by Tower.

  4.4.4. Tanker Tactical Procedures/Special Requests.
     4.4.4.1. Eielson AFB has no tactical procedures for tanker aircraft.
     4.4.4.2. All tactical procedure requests must be routed through the Tower Watch
     Supervisor, prior to departure, for coordination, and will be approved based on existing
     traffic/conditions.
  4.4.5. General Aviation/Civil Air Patrol (CAP).
     4.4.5.1. The flight planning area in the Civil Air Patrol office will contain adequate
     displays depicting current operating areas, traffic patterns, and departure/arrival and taxi
     routes.
     4.4.5.2. General Aviation/CAP aircraft will contact Tower for landing instructions. If
     holding is required, aircraft should be instructed to hold downwind and maintain an
     altitude of 1,500 feet MSL. Upon Tower approval, pilots may proceed directly toward
     Taxiway C with landing light on to enter a midfield downwind.
     4.4.5.3. General Aviation/CAP aircraft will maintain at or below 1,500 feet MSL while
     operating in Eielson Class D airspace, unless directed otherwise by ATC.
     4.4.5.4. General Aviation/CAP will only operate during published airfield operating
     hours.
     4.4.5.5. All General Aviation crews who fly privately owned aircraft in/out of Eielson
     will have current DD Forms 2400 (civil aircraft landing permits), 2401 (proof of
     insurance), and 2402 (hold harmless agreement) on file with the Airfield Manager. The
     DD Form 2400 will list the pilot as the insured.
  4.4.6. 210 Rescue Squadron Parachute Drops at Eielson.
     4.4.6.1. The 210 RQS has a LOA on file (within 354FW Consolidated LOA) allowing
     parachute drops at the small arms range.
     4.4.6.2. The 210 RQS will schedule the small arms range with 354 SPS/SPTC at 377-
     2168 to ensure that no small arms training will be in progress for a period of at least 1-
     hour prior and 1-hour after the jump.
     4.4.6.3. The 210 RQS will request Fairbanks AFSS (474-0788) issue a NOTAM no less
     than 4- and no more than 24-hours in advance of the scheduled jump(s).
     4.4.6.4. The 210 RQS will notify the following agencies at least 4-hours prior to the
     jump:
         4.4.6.4.1. 354 OSS/OSC (377-3005)
         4.4.6.4.2. 354 OSS/OSAM (377-1861)
         4.4.6.4.3. Eielson Range Control (377-3125)
     4.4.6.5. Eielson Tower will not authorize parachute drop activities if existing or
     forecasted traffic will be delayed or adversely affected.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                   39

      4.4.6.6. Drop aircraft will provide a 5-minute to drop notification to Eielson Tower with
      proposed drop time, altitude, type aircraft, and number of parachutists. Eielson Tower
      will coordinate with Fairbanks Approach and passed drop information.
      4.4.6.7. Drop aircraft will notify Eielson Tower when jumpers are away. Upon
      commencement, Eielson Tower will broadcast on local frequencies that parachute drop
      operations are in progress—giving location, altitude, and type of aircraft. Eielson Tower
      will pass any known or expected traffic to drop aircraft.
      4.4.6.8. Drop aircraft will notify Eielson Tower upon drop termination. Eielson Tower
      will broadcast on local frequencies that parachute drop operations have terminated.
      Eielson Tower will notify Fairbanks Approach that parachute drop operations have
      terminated.
4.5. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS).
   4.5.1. The following RSRS standards (i.e., less than FAAO 7110.65 standard separation)
   apply to all PACAF assigned aircraft at PACAF bases where ATC is provided by USAF
   controllers. Non-PACAF aircraft may participate in RSRS if covered under letter of
   agreement (i.e., Joint Letter of Agreement on RSRS at PACAF bases).
   4.5.2. Conditions for application of RSRS standards.
      4.5.2.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the aircraft involved and determine
      distances by reference to suitable landmarks (i.e., distance remaining markers, taxiways)
      during daytime and nighttime operations.
      4.5.2.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may
      be jeopardized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standards published in FAAO
      7110.65.
      4.5.2.3. Revert to nighttime RSRS standards when the RCR is reported to be between 16
      and 12 inclusive, or when the RCR is not available and RSC is reported wet, ice or snow.
 40                                                             354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


      4.5.2.4. For fighter type aircraft only, a low approach following a full stop shall use the
      alternate side of the runway when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Aircraft will not
      overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot.
      4.5.2.5. Pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when maintaining visual
      separation or operating VFR. Controllers must provide appropriate cautionary wake
      turbulence advisories in these cases.
      4.5.2.6. Same fighter type aircraft means the same airframe (i.e., F-15 behind F-15, F-16
      behind F-16, etc.).
      4.5.2.7. Dissimilar fighter type aircraft means not the same airframe (i.e., F-15 behind F-
      16, F-16 behind A-10, etc.).
      4.5.2.8. Non-heavy, non-fighter type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
      4.5.2.9. RSRS between members of a flight (holding hands) are authorized provided all
      aircraft involved are the same type aircraft (e.g., all F-15s, all F-16s, etc.) and must
      request the same type of approach. Separation is measured between the trailing aircraft in
      the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the trailing formation.

       4.5.2.10. RSRS standards do not apply:
            4.5.2.10.1. To any situation involving emergency aircraft.
            4.5.2.10.2. To civil aircraft.
            4.5.2.10.3. To air evacuation aircraft.
            4.5.2.10.4. To touch and go behind full stop.
            4.5.2.10.5. To heavy aircraft (capable of takeoff weights of more than 255,000
            pounds).
            4.5.2.10.6. When RCR is reported less than 12.
   4.5.3. IAW FAAO 7110.65, ATC will control formation flights as a single aircraft and will
   not apply RSRS standards between aircraft within the same formation. Separation between
   aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight lead and pilots of the other
   aircraft in the flight.
   4.5.4. For sequential arrivals the first arrival must have landed and appropriate RSRS must
   exist when the second arrival crosses the landing threshold.
4.6. Intersection Departures. Intersection departures may be initiated by a controller or a
controller may authorize an intersection departure if a pilot requests. The controller will issue the
measured distance from the intersection to the runway end rounded ―down‖ to the nearest 50
feet to any civilian pilot who requests the distance and to all military aircraft, unless use of the
intersection is covered in appropriate directives.

                                       IFR PROCEDURES

5.1. IFR Traffic Patterns. Fairbanks Approach Control is the controlling agency for the radar
traffic pattern. As SFOs can be declared 7-10 miles out, 354 FW aircraft requesting a SFO will
normally be vectored to intercept the final approach course inside the approach gate but no closer
than the final approach fix. All other requests are subject to approval of Fairbanks Approach
Control.
5.2. Local Climb-Out Procedures. Local climb-out instructions for all approaches are:
"Maintain at or below 1,500 until departure end of runway, then climb and maintain 3,000, fly
runway heading." ATC may issue this clearance by instructing locally assigned aircraft to
"Execute Local Climb-out." Local go-around procedures are the same as local climb-out
instructions except aircraft will offset aircraft on the runway, if present, on the southwest side of
the runway. ATC will issue go-around instructions to locally assigned/attached aircraft by
instructing aircraft to ―GO-AROUND, (reason).‖ After go-around instructions have been issued,
closed traffic may be requested.
5.3. Radar Trail Recoveries. Request radar trail recovery with approach control. A maximum
of 4 aircraft are authorized in trail recovery. Advise approach 3-5 minutes prior to initial
approach fix if requesting non-standard formation radar trail recovery.
   5.3.1. Establish trail spacing between flight members (1.5 NM minimum – 2.0 NM
   maximum) NLT the final approach fix. Spacing may be increased to 3.0 NM for poor runway
   conditions (low RCR). If a drag maneuver is used, the lead aircraft will maintain a minimum
   of 300 knots until the trail aircraft is established. Notify each ATC agency if the lead aircraft
   is not the normal element lead (e.g., "Tower, MIG02 is the lead aircraft, followed by
   MIG01"). If proper spacing is not established by the final approach fix (FAF) and under
   IMC, wingmen should execute missed approach/climb-out instructions and obtain a separate
   ATC clearance.
   5.3.2. The flight (2, 3, or 4 ship), under direction of the flight lead, assumes responsibility
   for their own separation on final.
   5.3.3. The last trailing aircraft will squawk, 4000.
   5.3.4. Aircraft shall fly the published missed approach. Military aircrews will deconflict
   within the flight to ensure safe separation for the missed approach portion in the event of lost
   communications with ATC and/or radar contact is lost between flight members.
   5.3.5. If the flight is directed to break out prior to the FAF, all aircraft remain in trail and
   follow ATC instructions. If the lead aircraft is inside the FAF, break out instructions apply
   only to the lead aircraft unless directed otherwise by ATC.
5.4. Multiple Approaches. Pilots desiring multiple approaches will inform Fairbanks
Approach Control of their intentions after making initial radio contact.
5.5. Flight Plans and Clearances.
 44                                                               354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


   5.5.1. Flight plans will be filed IAW AFI 11-202v3, Flight Information Publication (FLIP),
   General Planning Charts, appropriate LOAs, and this regulation. All aircraft departing
   Eielson will file a flight plan or have a flight plan on file (stop over) prior to departure.
   AMOPS requires a minimum of 1-hour prior notification for processing IFR flight plans.
   5.5.2. All flights remaining within the Fairbanks Approach Control area of jurisdiction at or
   below 10,000 feet MSL will be entered "LOCAL IFR" in the remarks section of the DD
   Form 175, Military Flight Plan, in addition to the delay requests required by FLIP.
      5.5.2.1. When requested block altitude is above 9,000 feet MSL, expect initial block
      altitude of block 7,000 through 9,000 feet MSL due to airspace configuration.
      5.5.2.2. If flight plan does not include a standard instrument departure (SID), pilot can
      expect to fly runway heading until given further instructions from Approach.
   5.5.3. IAW AF WEB RIMS, the original flight plan will remain on file at the respective
   squadron, and AMOPS will retain the fax copy for 1 year. Stereo flight plans are coordinated
   annually or as required, and remain on file at 354 OG/OGV. AMOPS will accept flight plans
   via fax/telephone/PEX only from those units with an LOA on file.
5.6. Controlled Takeoffs.
   5.6.1. 168 ARW, 3 WG (JBER), and 354 FW aircraft tasked with higher headquarters
   missions may request a higher priority in handling by declaring their controlled takeoff time.
   NOTE: Aircraft with declared controlled departure times will be given priority over normal
   wing flying operations.
   5.6.2. For controlled takeoffs, 168 ARW will designate controlled takeoff by entering the
   words "CONTROLLED TAKE-OFF" in the remarks section of the DD Form 175. AMOPS
   will notify Tower. The 168 ARW will pass any changes to AMOPS before engine start.
   5.6.3. The pilot of the lead aircraft will notify ground control on initial contact of the
   controlled departure time and will update changes to their departure time as necessary.
5.7. Rapid Response/Priority Strip Launch.
   5.7.1. Aircrews participating in an active air defense or category B or higher mission, may
   respond to their alert aircraft using the term Rapid Response or Priority Strip Launch. Rapid
   Response includes all those actions necessary for flight preparation including engine start and
   taxi, but does not include takeoff. Priority Strip Launch includes all actions including aircraft
   launch as soon as possible.
   5.7.2. The 168 ARW Command Post will announce to AMOPS all Rapid Response/Priority
   Strip Launch missions involving aircraft assigned to, or under operational control (OPCON)
   of the 168 ARW. Announcement will be made to AMOPS as soon as possible.
   5.7.3. Due to timing constraints, engine starts and taxi requests may occur prior to filing a
   flight plan with AMOPS.
   5.7.4. All base agencies will provide maximum assistance to expedite the movement of
   aircraft responding to a Rapid Response or Priority Strip Launch.
   5.7.5. If a clearance is not available by the requested departure time, Tower will clear the
   Priority Strip Launch in accordance with the current Fairbanks ATC/Eielson ATC Tower

                             EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

6.1. Operation of the Primary and Secondary Crash Net.
   6.1.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
      6.1.1.1. Tower activates the PCAS as follows:
         6.1.1.1.1. For any emergency situation, either observed or reported, that will
         necessitate response of emergency vehicles or equipment on the aerodrome. Tower
         may direct termination of departures, engine runs, aircraft tows, or taxis as the
         situation warrants.
         6.1.1.1.2. . As necessary to support Base Disaster Preparedness Exercises and
         OPLANs.
         6.1.1.1.3. Daily tests will be conducted between 0800 and 0830L.
      6.1.1.2. Pilots, MOCC, SOF, and the Fire Department will notify Tower, as soon as
      possible of all known or anticipated emergencies. Tower will activate the PCAS when an
      emergency is declared and for all unplanned barrier engagements. The pilot, SOF, or
      controller on duty may declare emergencies for all airborne or ground operations
      affecting safety of flight. Tower may reactivate the PCAS as additional information is
      obtained.
      6.1.1.3. Agencies on the PCAS.
         6.1.1.3.1. Fire Department
         6.1.1.3.2. AMOPS
         6.1.1.3.3. Medical Clinic
   6.1.2. Secondary Crash Network (SCN).
      6.1.2.1. AMOPS activates the SCN as follows:
         6.1.2.1.1. Pass information given by the Air Traffic Control Tower. If information is
         received from any other source (Wing Operations Center for example), pass it to ATC
         and allow them time to activate the PCAS if required. Then information will be
         passed over the SCN.
         6.1.2.1.2. As new or revised information is received over the PCAS, the SCN will be
         activated without delay.
         6.1.2.1.3. When the emergency has been terminated, AMOPS will notify all agencies
         of the termination time.
      6.1.2.2. Agencies on the SCN:
         6.1.2.2.1. 354 OG/CC

          6.1.2.2.13. 353 CTS/MOCC
          6.1.2.2.14. 354 MXG/MOCC
6.2. In-Flight/Ground Emergency Procedures.
   6.2.1. On-Base Mishap/Emergency—See paragraph 6.1. For on-base mishaps/emergencies,
   the senior fire official (Chief 2) will be the initial on-scene commander and receive clearance
   from Tower before any emergency vehicles or equipment proceeds onto the runway. If the
   Fire Department responds to an emergency on the flightline and the PCAS has not been
   activated, Eielson Fire Dispatch will notify Tower. Tower will then activate the PCAS and
   AMOPS will notify FW agencies via the SCN with the information provided. During hours
   of darkness/reduced visibility, Tower will notify responding fire vehicles of the expected
   route or approximate position of any tows on the main ramp, which may be a potential
   conflict. Chief 2, after ensuring the situation is safe will terminate the emergency.
   6.2.2. Off-Base Mishap/Emergency—In the event an aircraft that is in contact with Eielson
   Tower is involved in an off-base mishap, the control Tower will activate the PCAS and
   provide as much information as needed to assist on and off-base agencies. AMOPS will
   activate the SCN and provide as much information as needed to assist on and off-base
   agencies. Eielson Tower and AMOPS will relay any off-base agency request to the
   appropriate on-base agency(ies).
6.3. Controlled Bailout/Aircraft Abandonment and External Stores Jettison.
   6.3.1. The area for controlled bailout, jettison of external stores, weapons, or cargo is at the
   Eielson TACAN (CH98) 211R/8 DME fix. Bailout or release headed southwest. If possible,
   contact Fairbanks approach and expect vectors to the release point. Release at or above 3,000
   feet MSL as the aircraft passes the southwest bank of the Tanana River.
 48                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


Figure 6.1. Controlled Bailout/External Stores Jettison




   6.3.2. In the event of radar outage, Approach Control will clear the aircraft to the Eielson
   TACAN 211R/8 DME fix.
   6.3.3. In VFR conditions, when TACAN/radar information is not available, maintain
   magnetic heading of 213 degrees from the south end of the runway. Pilots will initiate
   bailout jettison after the aircraft has passed over the southwest bank of the Tanana River.
   6.3.4. The aircraft will fly the pattern for jettison of external stores, weapons, or cargo no
   lower than 3,000 feet MSL or the minimum altitude specified in the appropriate technical
   order.
   6.3.5. If time permits, Tower will transmit a warning on UHF frequencies 243.0 and 352.05,
   and VHF frequencies 121.5 and 127.2, that a controlled ejection, bailout or jettison of
   external stores, weapons or cargo is in progress and will direct all aircraft to remain clear of
   the jettison area.
   6.3.6. On range, attempt to jettison at one of the following points: R-2211 – Nuc Circle
   (Inert Only); R-2202 – Riverbeds in the impact area; R-2205 – Stuart Creek
6.4. Fuel Dumping. Limit fuel dumping to actual emergencies or compelling operational
requirements. Aircraft commanders are authorized to dump fuel when an aircraft emergency
requires reduction of gross weight in the interests of safety.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                       49


   6.4.1. Restrictions. During emergency dumping, make every effort to dump at or above
   FL200, off Federal Airways and in areas where spray will not settle on urban areas,
   agricultural regions or water sources.
   6.4.2. Planned Dumping Area. Conduct all fuel dumping for operational requirements in the
   planned dumping areas or over ocean areas at or above FL250. Conduct emergency dumping
   in the planned dumping areas unless safety considerations compel more immediate action.
   Planned dumping areas are:
       6.4.2.1. North Area. Hold north of the Eielson TACAN between 35 and 41 DME on the
       360 radial, 6 NM legs, left turns.
       6.4.2.2. South Area. Hold south of the Eielson TACAN between 35 and 41 DME on the
       160 radial, 6 NM legs, left turns.
   6.4.3. Reporting. The aircraft commander will ensure the data for the dump report is
   provided to the 354 FW Command Post as soon as possible after landing. Copies of the
   jettison report will be routed to the Base Fuels Management Flight (354 LRS/LGRF) for
   proper accounting. Aircraft commanders of major commands other than PACAF, will make
   the notification required by their command.
6.5. Hot Brakes. Twys A, B, C, D, and E are designated hot brake areas. Aircraft on the rwy
with suspected hot brakes should exit at the nearest hot brake area and stop in the spot. If active
alert aircraft are scheduled at Eielson AFB, when using Twy E, taxi the aircraft past and stop
well clear of the high speed taxiway, with the aircraft facing into the wind. A 300-foot cordon
will be established by the senior fire official who will control access until the emergency is
terminated.
6.6. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Response Procedures. Tower will notify
Anchorage Center and AMOPS upon receipt or termination of an ELT. AMOPS will coordinate
a search of Eielson based and TDY aircraft until the source of the signal is discovered and
terminated. NOTE: Tower personnel will not activate the primary crash phone for ELT
activations unless there is an actual known emergency.
   6.6.1. For UHF 243.0, 354 MOCC and 168 ARW MOCC will locate the source of the ELT.
   6.6.2. For VHF 121.5, the CAP and Fairbanks Flight Service Station will locate the ELT.
6.7. Hung/Unexpended Ordnance.
   6.7.1. Recovery Procedures: Aircraft with hung ordnance will contact the SOF and recover
   via routing shown in Figure 17.      Declaring an emergency is not required for hung
   practice/inert ordnance.
 50                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


Figure 6.2. Hung Ordnance Procedure




   6.7.2. Hung Free-Fall Ordnance is any ordnance that fails to release or jettison due to a
   system malfunction when properly commanded by the pilot. Follow the hung ordnance
   routing depicted. Do not over fly populated areas. NOTE: For munitions sustaining damage
   during flight (e.g., bird strike, hail storm, etc.), apply hung free-fall ordnance criteria.
   6.7.3. Hung/Unsafe Forward-Firing Ordnance is any ordnance that fails to launch, fire, or
   jettison when properly commanded by the pilot. Recovery will be at taxiway Echo. Park
   aircraft in de-arm slot nearest the runway; heading 140 degrees, if available. Avoid pointing
   aircraft at other aircraft, structures, or personnel. If de-arm crew is unsuccessful at staffing
   the forward firing ordnance, the aircraft will be chocked and shut down.
   6.7.4. Hung/Unsafe Gun. The preferred landing runway is Runway 32. Upon landing on
   Runway 32, slow to taxi speed and execute a left 180 degree turn and back taxi to Taxiway
   Echo. If the RCR is less than 12, Runway 14 is the preferred recovery runway. If landing
   Runway 14, exit at Taxiway Echo, park in the de-arm slot nearest the runway heading 140
   degrees. If the gun cannot be safed, expect to taxi to the gun berm (collocated with trim pad).
   If other munitions cannot be safed, expect to execute a normal shutdown at EOR.
6.8. Wind Limitations on Control Tower.
6.8.1. Surface wind velocity is 65 knots sustained or greater.

   6.8.2. Gusting wind velocity is 70 knots or greater.
6.9. Evacuation of ATC and AMOPS Facilities.
   6.9.1. Control Tower Evacuation.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     51


     6.9.1.1. If a threat or potential threat of an unsafe condition exists, Eielson Tower (Bldg
     1216) will evacuate. In the event of high winds, Tower will evacuate to AMOPS (Bldg
     1215). Should a fire emergency or bomb threat take place, Tower will evacuate to
     building 4110 (354th Operations Support Squadron). The Tower’s watch supervisor will
     carry a LMR to communicate with Airfield Lighting and Fire Department, via the Crash
     Net. The decision to evacuate is the responsibility of the Tower chief controller or the on-
     duty watch supervisor/senior controller (WS/SC). No guidance can cover every
     contingency that may arise; for conditions not specifically addressed, controllers shall
     exercise their best judgment bearing in mind that the safety of human resources is of the
     utmost concern. NOTE: Eielson Tower does not have an alternate operating facility.
     6.9.1.2. The following situations will normally require evacuation:
        6.9.1.2.1. Surface wind velocity is 65 knots sustained or greater.
        6.9.1.2.2. Gusting wind velocity is 70 knots or greater.
        6.9.1.2.3. Fire.
        6.9.1.2.4. Total electrical failure (commercial and back-up power).
        6.9.1.2.5. Bomb threat.
        6.9.1.2.6. Unexploded ordnance in the vicinity of building 1215 or 1216.
     6.9.1.3. Evacuation Procedures: The following actions will be completed prior to
     evacuation.
        6.9.1.3.1. Eielson Airfield converts to either a CLOSED or an UNCONTROLLED
        airfield and the Class D airspace reverts to Class E airspace under the control of
        Fairbanks Approach. The intent of being UNCONTROLLED is to land any aircraft at
        Eielson that cannot divert. Once aircraft have landed, the airfield will revert to a
        CLOSED airfield until ATC services can be re-established.
        6.9.1.3.2. VFR aircraft should be instructed to maintain VFR conditions and contact
        Fairbanks Approach for advisories. Handle IFR aircraft on a case-by-case basis.
        Consider their location in the pattern and the nature of the evacuation (i.e., IFR
        aircraft on final may be permitted to land or instructed to break out, depending upon
        the situation). Transmit on all frequencies: ―Eielson Tower is being evacuated
        (reason), contact Fairbanks Approach for advisories (other instructions as required).
        6.9.1.3.3. Activate the PCAS.
        6.9.1.3.4. Notify Fairbanks Approach Control that the Tower is being evacuated.
        Provide a reason if time permits.
        6.9.1.3.5. Transmit on Ramp and Crash Nets: ―Eielson Tower is being evacuated
        (reason), all vehicles on the runway exit and hold short.
        6.9.1.3.6. Adjust the airfield lighting for the current weather conditions in accordance
        with FAAO 7110.65.
     6.9.1.4. Evacuation Procedures: The following actions will be completed during the
     evacuation.
52                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


        6.9.1.4.1. The Tower chief controller or on-duty watch supervisor/senior controller
        shall perform an accountability check immediately following evacuation.
        6.9.1.4.2. The Tower watch supervisor/senior controller may, if required due to
        inbound aircraft, evacuate to the SOF truck or AMOPS truck and drive to the most
        advantageous spot on the airfield to visually scan the airfield to ensure the runway is
        still safe for use. Tower personnel will tune and monitor local’s UHF frequency from
        the vehicle’s radio.
        6.9.1.4.3. Tower personnel will relay runway status to Fairbanks via landline through
        AMOPS. If the airfield is still in a safe condition and aircraft request not to divert,
        Fairbanks Approach can switch the aircraft to the local frequency for airfield
        advisories. NOTE: Neither the SOF truck nor the AMOPS truck are approved Tower
        alternatives. Tower personnel will not issue landing/takeoff clearances from a vehicle.
        Landing will be at the pilot’s risk.
     6.9.1.5. Bomb Threat: The following actions apply to all work centers that receive a
     bomb threat involving the Tower.
        6.9.1.5.1. Use the AF Form 440, AF Bomb Threat Aid, to the extent possible while
        talking to the caller. A copy of the AF Form 440 will be maintained near each
        telephone.
        6.9.1.5.2. If possible, signal someone to call the Security Forces desk on another
        telephone. If possible, keep the line to Security Forces open for further instructions.
        Do not hang up the line the bomb threat was received on until Security Forces
        approves.
        6.9.1.5.3. Instruct a runner to notify all work centers to evacuate all personnel at least
        500 feet from the affected area. The runner must report to the Incident Commander,
        nearest Security Forces, or Fire Protection Flight with the number and names of
        personnel remaining (if any) in the building. Ensure all possible doors are left open to
        assist in the building search.
        6.9.1.5.4. Remind all personnel not to touch any suspicious objects or turn off/on any
        electrical or water fixtures. Do not use the elevator, since these items could be used as
        a triggering device.
     6.9.1.6. Airfield Management will:
        6.9.1.6.1. Activate the SCN and advise all agencies that the Tower has been
        evacuated, stating the reason for the evacuation if known.
        6.9.1.6.2. If required, notify Base Civil Engineers that an airfield lighting technician
        is needed at the lighting vault for adjustments.
        6.9.1.6.3. Issue the following NOTAMs:
            6.9.1.6.3.1. Eielson Airfield is CLOSED or UNCONTROLLED. Contact
            Fairbanks Approach for ATC services. (see paragraph 6.9.1.3.1.)
            6.9.1.6.3.2. Eielson Ground Control frequencies 121.8 and 275.8 are out of
            service (OTS).
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                    53


            6.9.1.6.3.3. Eielson Clearance Delivery frequency 343.7 is OTS.
            6.9.1.6.3.4. Eielson ILS and TACAN are unmonitored.
            6.9.1.6.3.5. Eielson ATIS OTS.
        6.9.1.6.4. Monitor the Tower Net for emergencies and activate SCN when informed
        of an emergency.
        6.9.1.6.5. Notify 354 CS Maintenance Control that the Tower has been evacuated.
     6.9.1.7. The 354 Operations Group’s Responsibilities:
        6.9.1.7.1. If on duty, the SOF will evacuate with Tower personnel.
        6.9.1.7.2. Aircraft should coordinate with Fairbanks Approach to hold until tower
        operations have resumed or amend their flight plan to alternate/divert airfield.
     6.9.1.8. 354 Civil Engineer Squadron’s Responsibilities:
        6.9.1.8.1. Fire Protection Flight Responsibilities: All airfield emergency coordination
        with the Tower will be accomplished via the Crash Net.
        6.9.1.8.2. Airfield Lighting: If required, will be notified by AMOPS to provide an
        airfield lighting technician at the lighting vault to adjust the airfield lighting. This
        individual must have an LMR radio (Tower Net) to communicate with the evacuated
        Tower watch supervisor.
        6.9.1.8.3. If the circumstances requiring evacuation warrant, a 354 CES
        representative will perform a safety inspection of building 1215 – 1216 prior to
        reoccupation.
     6.9.1.9. The 354 Communications Squadron’s Maintenance Control’s Responsibilities:
     The ILS and TACAN may continue to be operated as long as pilot or maintenance reports
     show the NAVAIDs are operating normally.
     6.9.1.10. Reoccupying Tower:
        6.9.1.10.1. The Base Fire Chief, CE Structural Maintenance, or designated
        representative will determine structural stability for safe reoccupation if necessary.
        6.9.1.10.2. Upon receiving approval to reoccupy the building, the watch supervisor
        or senior controller (WS/SC), tower chief controller, or designated representative will
        ensure:
            6.9.1.10.2.1. Qualified controllers return to the Tower to perform all opening
            equipment checks prior to reopening the facility.
            6.9.1.10.2.2. The PCAS is activated to inform applicable agencies that Eielson
            Tower is operational.
            6.9.1.10.2.3. Notify FAI Approach that Eielson Tower is operational.
            6.9.1.10.2.4. Transmit on all frequencies/FM nets (except guard, unless deemed
            necessary by the WS/SC): "Eielson Tower is Operational."
            6.9.1.10.2.5. Notify the AOF/CC.
54                                                             354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


     6.9.1.11. Exercise Procedures:
        6.9.1.11.1. Planned evacuation exercises will be prior coordinated with the 354
        OG/CC, 354 OSS/OSA, or CCTLR if ATC services will be affected. IAW AFI 13-
        204v3, paragraph 11.1, the AOF/CC must be notified at least 48 hours in advance.
        The Tower will conduct training exercises when a sufficient number of controllers are
        available to provide continuous ATC services. Procedures will be practiced in
        accordance with ATC directives.
        6.9.1.11.2. At least two qualified controllers will remain in the Tower to act as safety
        observers and to ensure flight operations are not unnecessarily delayed or disrupted.
        6.9.1.11.3. IAW AFI 13-204v3, either the WS/SC in the Tower or evacuated location
        may temporarily cease the exercise inputs/responses should safety become a factor.
  6.9.2. Airfield Management Operations Evacuation.
     6.9.2.1. If a threat or potential threat of an unsafe condition exists, Eielson AMOPS
     (Bldg 1215) will evacuate to the 354 OSS building (Bldg 4110). The decision to evacuate
     is the responsibility of the shift supervisor on-duty. The following situations will
     normally require evacuation:

354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                     55


              operations are resumed.
6.10. Landing Gear Malfunction. If necessary, stop aircraft with landing gear malfunctions or
hydraulic difficulties affecting landing gear operation on the runway and have the landing gear
pins installed before the aircraft is moved.
   6.10.1. 354 MXG MOCC, and 168 ARW MOCC are responsible for providing a
   maintenance crews to install the down lock pins in base assigned and TDY aircraft. These
   crews will come from the section responsible for the aircraft to assure familiarity. Transient
   Alert will put in the down lock pins for transient aircraft.
   6.10.2. 354 MXG MOCC, and 168 ARW MOCC will notify their respective maintenance
   crews, to meet the fire crew at the intersection of Twy C and Taxilane F, and travel with the
   fire crew to the disabled aircraft. The maintenance crews will assemble on the west side of
   the Thunder Dome (Bldg 1140) and stand by to provide assistance, as necessary. An
   ambulance will standby on the ramp near the Fire Station (Bldg 1206) until termination of
   the emergency or until released by the senior fire official.
       6.10.2.1. Crash Recovery will provide equipment and operators to remove disabled
       aircraft from the runway, if requested by the Airfield Manager. 354th Civil Engineer
       Squadron will assist if requested.

Figure 6.3. Hydrazine Emergency Areas




6.12. Radio Out (NORDO)/Lost Comm Procedures. All 354 FW aircraft and attached TDY
fighter or attack aircraft will comply with the following communications out procedures. These
procedures assume the aircraft is not in formation with an aircraft with operable radios. NORDO
aircraft will squawk IAW the Flight Information Handbook.
   6.12.1. If IFR, and no transmissions are received for 1 minute in the radar pattern, attempt
   contact with Tower on UHF 352.05 or VHF 127.2 and proceed VFR, if able.
   6.12.2. If unable to proceed VFR, maintain the higher of 4,500 feet MSL or last ATC
   assigned altitude, proceed to FALCO or BOGIE and execute the ILS or TACAN approach
   for the last known runway in use. Squawk IAW the Flight Information Handbook.
6.13. Emergency Single Frequency Approach (SFA).
   6.13.1. Purpose. To establish a common frequency between emergency aircraft, Anchorage
   Center, Fairbanks Approach, Eielson Air Traffic Control facilities, the SOF, and the Fire
   Chief to simplify and expedite safe recovery of airborne emergencies.
   6.13.2. Procedures:
       6.13.2.1. Fairbanks Approach will normally assign UHF 259.1 (CH 15) to all parties
       during an emergency where an SFA is desired. Exceptions are:
          6.13.2.1.1. Aircraft in the final stages of Approach Control handling will not be
          given a frequency change.
          6.13.2.1.2. During multiple emergencies only one aircraft       will   be   assigned
          UHF259.1.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                       57


6.13.2.2. Time and situation permitting, Tower shall coordinate the SOF’s request to transmit on
UHF 259.1 with Fairbanks Approach.

       6.13.2.3. The priority transmissions during a SFA emergency will be between the ATC
       controlling agency and the emergency aircraft. The SOF and the Fire Chief will interject
       pertinent information after receiving approval from ATC, unless immediate calls are
       required for safety.
6.14. Aircraft Bomb Threats.
   6.14.1. Tower will:
       6.14.1.1. Activate the PCAS and transmit all available information. Transmit all new
       information over the PCAS as it becomes available.
       6.14.1.2. Notify the pilot of a bomb threat aircraft if the information did not come
       directly from the pilot.
       6.14.1.3. If the bomb threat aircraft is on the ground, direct the aircraft to the departure
       end of the rwy in use avoiding all other aircraft and congested areas, when possible.
       6.14.1.4. If the bomb threat aircraft is still airborne, give emergency landing priority to
       the aircraft. After landing, issue taxi instructions IAW paragraph 6.14.1.3.
       6.14.1.5. Ensure taxiing and airborne aircraft are advised of appropriate emergency
       information and are told to divert or hold as required.
       6.14.1.6. If the aircraft is outside of Tower’s control/airspace, contact the appropriate
       ATC facility and relay all available information.
   6.14.2. AMOPS will:
       6.14.2.1. Activate the SCN and follow procedures outlined in the Quick Reference
       Checklist. Transmit all new information over the SCN as soon as it becomes available.
       6.14.2.2. Relay all new information to the Tower via landline if received from a source
       other than the Tower.
   6.14.3. Once all provisions of paragraphs 6.14.1. and 6.14.2. of this instruction are
   implemented for a bomb threat aircraft on the ground or when airborne bomb threat aircraft
   lands, the airfield will be closed to all unnecessary traffic. AMOPS will issue a NOTAM as
   required.
   6.14.4. Priorities for aircraft movement will be determined by the On-Scene Commander or
   designated representative.
 58                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


                                           Chapter 7

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

7.1. NOTAM Procedures. The Air Traffic Control Tower is designated as the NOTAM
monitoring facility. AMOPS is the NOTAM issuing facility. Normally AMOPS will only issue
NOTAM for Eielson’s Class Delta airspace.
7.2. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Accounts, Procedures for Requesting
Changes. AMOPS is the base FLIP manager and responsible for updating and
maintaining FLIP information. 354 OSS/OSAM (AMOPS), 18 AGRS, 168 ARW, and 353 CTS
each maintain a FLIP account. Each unit’s FLIP account manager is responsible for updating
their account information. AMOPS will keep a small supply of FLIPS for transient aircrews.
Base agencies sponsoring TDY units will coordinate with those unit(s) to ensure adequate FLIPS
are available while TDY to Eielson.
7.3. Permanent/Temporary Airfield Waivers. 354 CES/CEAO maintains continuity of all
airfield permanent and temporary waivers. PACAFI 32-1056 governs required membership and
procedures for reducing the number of airfield waivers.
7.4. Prior Permission Required (PPR) Procedure. A PPR number is required for transient
aircraft to land at Eielson. Confirmation must be received prior to transient aircraft departing
their last station. Transient Alert services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The
purpose of PPR is to control the volume and flow of traffic, not to prohibit it. PPR does not
preclude DoD aircraft the use of an airfield as an alternate for IFR flight.
7.5. Arriving Air Evac Notification and Response Procedures. AMOPS will notify Tower,
Transient Alert, Command Post, Air Terminal Operations Center, Med Group, and Bassett Army
Hospital of all Air Evac operations. AMOPS will relay requests to all concerned agencies, as
applicable.
7.6. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals/Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. Refer to Eielson’s LOA
with Fairbanks Approach (354FW Consolidated LOA) for unscheduled civil diverts. For any
unauthorized engine start and/or aircraft movement, the 354th Fighter Wing will respond to
prevent the theft/hijacking of aircraft at Eielson AFB.
   7.6.1. ATC will:
       7.6.1.1. Notify AMOPS of any aircraft starting engines without coordinating with Tower
       for engine start approval. ATC will pass the type of aircraft, tail number, and the location
       on the airfield.
       7.6.1.2. Activate the PCAS when unauthorized aircraft movement is observed. ATC will
       pass the location, direction of movement, any communications received, tail number and
       type of aircraft.
       7.6.1.3. Suspend runway operations, as necessary.
       7.6.1.4. Direct other aircraft movement away from the suspect aircraft.
       7.6.1.5. Ensure all communications with the suspect aircraft are in the clear.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                      59


       7.6.1.6. Relay the suspect aircraft’s location and direction of movement to Chief 2, when
       able.
   7.6.2. AMOPS will:
       7.6.2.1. Upon ATC notification of an unauthorized engine start contact 354 MXG
       MOCC and 168 MOCC to determine the status of the suspect aircraft (i.e., notification
       not passed to ATC through AMOPS, TDY unit unaware of local procedures, etc.).
       7.6.2.2. If MOCC is unaware of the engine start, AMOPS will activate the SCN for Anti-
       Hijacking/Unauthorized Aircraft Movement. AMOPS will pass type of aircraft, tail
       number, and the location on the airfield.
       7.6.2.3. Upon PCAS activation of unauthorized aircraft movement, AMOPS will activate
       the SCN and pass all information verbatim.
   7.6.3. Fire Department will:
       7.6.3.1. Upon PCAS/SCN activation, respond and place fire trucks in a position to
       prevent suspect aircraft from becoming airborne.
       7.6.3.2. Contact ATC on the Crash net for updates on the aircraft’s position and direction
       of movement.
   7.6.4. 354 SFS will:
       7.6.4.1. Assume duties as the incident commander for anti-hijack/unauthorized aircraft
       movement activities on Eielson.
       7.6.4.2. Maintain a Hostage Rescue Counter Terrorism Team/Special Weapons Assault
       Team (HRCT/SWAT).
       7.6.4.3. Recall a Hostage Negotiation Team, as required.
7.7. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification Procedures. When AMOPS receives DV
notification via a flight plan or PPR request, the Inbound DV checklist will be used to notify the
following parties: Tower, Transient Alert, Command Post, Vehicle Ops, Air Terminal
Operations Center, Snow Barn, and Protocol. Tower will notify AMOPS when the DV aircraft is
within 25 miles from Eielson AFB. AMOPS will notify Protocol. Responsibilities for the
AMOPS DV lounge and DV Marquee greeting are outlined in the Protocol LOA.
7.8. Dangerous/Hazardous Cargo.
   7.8.1. Primary: South Ramp Spots 1-16. Each of these areas are authorized a maximum of
   30,000 lbs Net Explosive Weight (NEW) of HC/D 1.1 munitions with the exception of Spot
   1 which is only authorized 19,600 lbs of NEW. Governing fire symbol is a 1. A maximum of
   30,000 lbs NEW of HC/D 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 munitions are authorized. Governing fire symbol is
   a 2. A maximum of 50,000 lbs NEW of HC/D 1.3 munitions is authorized. Governing fire
   symbol is 3. NOTE: Traffic permitting, the preferred taxi route for hazardous cargo laden
   aircraft landing on Runway 32 is a 180 degree turn on runway, taxi-back to Twy Echo, then
   to the South Ramp. If the RCRs are low, the pilot may exit the runway at Twy A and make
   the turn in the hammerhead area. DO NOT taxi hazardous cargo aircraft on Twy F.
   7.8.2. Secondary: Twy Alpha. Authorized a maximum of 42,875 lbs NEW of HC/D 1.1
   munitions. Governing fire symbol is 1. A maximum of 50,000 lbs NEW of HC/D 1.2.1 and

   HC/D 1.4. Governing fire symbol is 3 or 4, whichever is applicable.
   7.8.4. Waivers. Request waivers from the MXG/CC through FW/SEW.
   7.8.5. Normal advisory of inbound hazardous cargo will be in the flight plan data and
   verified by the pilot on UHF 372.2. AMOPS will notify Command Post, Tower, Transient
   Alert, Munitions Control, Snow Barn (September - May), Law Enforcement Desk, 354
   FW/SE (normal duty hours), Contract Air Terminal Operations, and the Fire Station of the
   inbound hazardous cargo. Additionally, these agencies will be advised of the aircraft parking
   spot, tail number, and type/quantity of munitions.
   7.8.6. Tower will notify AMOPS if notification of hazardous cargo is received from other
   than AMOPS.
7.9. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Eielson does not practice the use of NVD
operations.
7.10. Local Aircraft Priorities.
   7.10.1. With the exception of the aircraft priorities in this paragraph, air traffic service will
   be provided to aircraft on a "first come, first served" basis as circumstances permit.
   7.10.2. Traffic using the runway in use will have priority over opposite direction traffic.
   7.10.3. IFR aircraft shall have priority over Special VFR and VFR aircraft.
   7.10.4. Tower will not delay military aircraft due to General Aviation or Civil Air Patrol
   operations.
   7.10.5. Tower will provide priority in the following order:
       7.10.5.1. Emergency Aircraft
       7.10.5.2. Lifeguard/MED EVAC (when verbally requested)
       7.10.5.3. Search and Rescue Aircraft
       7.10.5.4. Presidential Aircraft
       7.10.5.5. Priority launches/Rapid Response

       7.10.5.7. Open Skies Aircraft
       7.10.5.8. Controlled Takeoff Orders (AMC and MAJCOM controlled departures)
       7.10.5.9. DV Aircraft
       7.10.5.10. RED FLAG – Alaska/NORTHERN EDGE/DISTANT FRONTIER
       7.10.5.11. 354 FW Flying
       7.10.5.12. 168 ARW Flying
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                      61


       7.10.5.13. Non-base Assigned Military Aircraft (Transients)
       7.10.5.14. Civilian aircraft (Civil Air Patrol and private aircraft) NOTE: These
       priorities will not be so stringently applied as to cause a gross mismanagement of traffic.
7.11. In-Flight Communications.
   7.11.1. Due to the location of the TACAN in relation to the runway threshold, Tower
   personnel can be expected to use nautical miles from the threshold, instead of DME from the
   TACAN, when referencing traffic/reporting points on final.
   7.11.2. Formation flights. ATC will consider a formation to be a single aircraft and will
   control it as a single aircraft until the first low approach or touch and go; after which, ATC
   will issue separate control instructions to each aircraft unless they rejoin as a flight or the
   pilot(s) request ATC to continue flight control instructions.
   7.11.3. Check-ride designation. Local aircraft will use the numerical callsign 9X when
   conducting check-rides (example: MIG 91-94). Traffic consideration should be granted to
   these aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
7.12. Opposite Direction Traffic.
   7.12.1. Simultaneous Opposite Direction Cut-Offs:
       7.12.1.1. Arrival versus Arrival: The first aircraft must have landed before the opposite
       direction IFR arrival crosses 10NM from the runway. Under no circumstances will the
       second aircraft be allowed to cross the landing threshold until the runway is clear.
       7.12.1.2. Departure versus Arrival. Known aircraft/flight characteristics may require
       additional separation. The departure must be airborne and turned to avoid conflict prior to
       the aircraft conducting an approach to the opposite runway being allowed closer than the
       cut-off specified below. NOTE: Do not clear an aircraft for takeoff or “line up and
       wait” if an opposite direction arrival is within the cut-off distances.

Table 7.1. Opposite Direction; Departure versus Arrival
 Both Aircraft are IFR                         Cut-Off
 Any type of aircraft involved                 10 NM
 One or Both Aircraft are VFR                  Cut-Off
 Any type of aircraft involved                 7 NM
   7.12.2. Tower will approve opposite direction operations only if they do not affect traffic to
   the runway in use. RVR readings may not be available to aircraft performing opposite
   direction operations.
7.13. Civil Aircraft Use of USAF Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs). Civil aircraft are permitted
to use USAF NAVAIDs to conduct practice low approaches only when they do not interfere with
military operations.
7.14. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. The 17 OWS disseminates all
Eielson forecasted weather warnings/watches/advisories. The 354 OSS/OSW (base weather)
will issue observed weather warnings/advisories and coordinate with 17 OWS on any forecasted
data.
 62                                                            354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


   7.14.1. 354 OSS/OSW will issue the following observed weather warnings:
       7.14.1.1. Lightning within 5 NM
       7.14.1.2. Observed cross winds, 20 knots or greater
   7.14.1.3. Ice FOD conditions for KC-135s and F-16s
   7.14.1.4. Equivalent Chill Temp of -20F to -29F
       7.14.1.5. Equivalent Chill Temp of -30F to -39
   7.14.2. 354 OSS/OSW will notify Command Post, AMOPS and ATCT of any 17 OWS or
   354 OSS/OSW warnings/watches/advisories. When the airfield is closed, the 17 OWS is
   responsible for Command Post notification. Command Post will notify base agencies via the
   ATHOC alert system on the base LAN servers.
   7.14.3. Airfield Management will relay any weather warnings/watches/advisories over the
   SCN.
   7.14.4. Tower personnel will receive the warnings/watches/advisories over the Airfield
   Automated System (AFAS). Tower personnel will notify aircrews via the ATIS.
7.15. Snow Removal Operations. Airfield snow removal operations will be IAW 354 FWI 32-
1003, Snow and Ice Control Plan. When the RCR is less than 12 and/or deteriorating conditions
warrant, snow and ice removal operations will take precedence.
   7.15.1. For wing flying, the SOF will coordinate with the Airfield Manager to determine the
   priority of snow removal operations. Flights will be limited to restricted low approaches at
   or above 1,100 (1,600 MSL may be used for heavy aircraft) feet MSL when snow and ice
   removal operations are in progress on the runway.
   7.15.2. Snow Effects on ILS. ATCALS will advise Tower and/or AMOPS when snow
   accumulation or drifting on the airfield may impact system reliability. Remove the system
   from service when advised by ATCALS Maintenance that accumulation exceeded technical
   limits IAW maintenance T.O.s, or when system anomalies are reported by pilots on final,
   IAW FAAO 7110.65. The 354 OG/CC determines if an operational check and/or special
   flight inspection is required before returning the system to service.
   7.15.3. Snow effects on Aircraft Arresting System. Snow will be removed the width of the
   runway 1,000 feet in both directions from each barrier to allow proper cable operations.
   Snow is to be removed up to the barrier deck sheave.
   7.15.4. Icing: During near-freezing rain conditions, airblast sweepers will be used to reduce
   standing water to a minimum. By monitoring surface temperatures, ice control personnel can
   determine the approximate time when freezing will begin. When ice is over 1/4-inch thick,
   the use of underbody blades and scrapers will be required to reduce the ice to less than 1/4-
   inch thickness prior to application of deicing material.
   7.15.5. Airfield Deicing and Anti-icing Chemicals: The use of all chemicals/materials on
   the airfield must be coordinated through AMOPS. AMOPS will serve as the focal point for
   seeking any necessary approval. AMOPS will seek guidance from Weather and Snow Barn
   prior to requesting approval.
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                       63


       7.15.5.1. Isopropyl Alcohol: If it is determined that isopropyl alcohol must be used, it
       should be coordinated with AMOPS to ensure that sufficient time will be available to
       apply the alcohol and sweep before the snow removal crew is forced off the runway.
       7.15.5.2. Potassium Acetate (E-36): E-36 may be used for ice control, but the following
       guidelines will be followed:
          7.15.5.2.1. All requests for use of E-36 on the airfield shall be routed through
          AMOPS.
          7.15.5.2.2. AMOPS will request approval for each application from 354 OG/CC.
          7.15.5.2.3. After E-36 application, the affected area will be swept and inspected by
          the snow removal supervisor to ensure no puddles exist.
          7.15.5.2.4. AMOPS will notify 354 MXG/CC upon decision to apply E-36. NOTE:
          Potassium Acetate (E-36) can cause severe damage to Electronic Warfare Pods.
          Units shall remove Electronic Warfare Pods as necessary to prevent damage after E-
          36 application.
       7.15.5.3. Sand: Due to extreme weather conditions experienced at Eielson,
       AFCESA/CEO has granted a waiver for routine use of May be used on the airfield if
       essential to increase the RCR to meet operational requirements or provide operational
       support. Sand will be used only upon the direction of the Airfield Manager.
   7.15.6. The rwy must be cleared a minimum of 75 feet on either side of the rwy centerline to
   allow normal operations.
7.16. Bird/Wildlife Control. The United States Department of Agriculture/Fish and Wildlife
Services (USDA/FWS) is the primary bird/wildlife dispersal agency for the airfield. AMOPS
will assist in wildlife dispersal when requested.
7.17. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). Eielson AFB and surrounding local areas experience
intense bird activity during migratory periods. The 354 FW SOF is the single POC who
ultimately determines the active BWC during wing flying. All areas are initially ―BWC Low‖
by default until declared to be at a higher level. If the 354 FW SOF is not on duty, the ATC
Tower Watch Supervisor or the Airfield Management representative on duty will determine the
BWC.
   7.17.1. Pilot Reporting. Report any hazardous bird activity in MOAs, low-level routes, and
   ranges to the SOF and/or Range Control as soon as possible using the following format:. Call
   sign, location, altitude of birds, local time sighted, approximate number of birds, type of bird
   (if known).
   7.17.2. BWC. Pilots will take the following actions during declared BWC IAW 354 FW 91-
   212, BASH Plan.
       7.17.2.1. BWC–Low: Normal bird activity on or above airfield/area with a low
       probability of hazard. No deviation from normal procedures is required.
       7.17.2.2. BWC–Moderate: Increased bird population in locations which represents an
       increased potential for strike. Eielson AFB Pattern: Multiple Patterns require 354
       OG/CC or SOF approval and are limited to the minimum required to fulfill training
       requirements. Planned low approach is restricted to 300 feet AGL. Chase aircraft will
 64                                                              354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


       not descend below 300 feet AGL at any time. Formation takeoffs and landings are
       prohibited.
       7.17.2.3. BWC–Severe: BWC-Severe will be declared when any of the following occur:
       any large concentrations of birds above or in the vicinity of runway (within 100 feet) or
       in arrival/departure routes; flocking birds crossing within 1nm of runway ends; any
       reported bird strike in Class D airspace; large concentrations of birds in the BEZ. Eielson
       AFB Pattern: Takeoffs, patterns and landings require 354 OG/CC approval, except in
       case of emergency. Only full stop landings are authorized. Formation/chased takeoffs
       and landings are prohibited except in case of emergency.
7.18. Supervisor of Flying Operating from the Tower. A SOF will normally operate from the
Eielson Control Tower during 354 FW operations when required by AFI 11-418. The SOF will:
   7.18.1. Utilize a headset and a muted speaker console arrangement to the maximum extent
   possible, and any time requested by the Watch Supervisor.
   7.18.2. Expect to be allowed to transmit critical information to an emergency aircraft over
   ATC frequencies when the nature of the situation may warrant. Coordinate this request
   through the Watch Supervisor, and limit such transmissions to those essential to prevent a
   mishap.
   7.18.3. Not attempt to regulate the flow of air traffic nor perform any air traffic control
   function.
   7.18.4. In the event of Tower evacuation, the SOF will evacuate the Tower to either the 353
   CTS duty desk or the 18 AGRS duty desk to perform the SOF functions IAW AFI 11-418,
   Sup 1.
7.19. Airfield Photography/Videography. All airfield and restricted area photo/video requests
must be coordinated through 354 FW/PA for approval. Public Affairs coordinates photo/video
access by informing AMOPS, Security Forces, and MOCC.                     354 FW/PA will brief
photographers/videographers IAW AFI 35-101 on restricted area/airfield photo/video
procedures. Participating foreign units' personnel require a 354 FW/PA-sanctioned escort at all
times while taking photo/video in restricted areas and on the flightline. Media personnel require
a 354 FW/PA-sanctioned escort at all times while on Eielson AFB.
7.20. Tower Blind Spots. Tower blind spots include the north side of the 168 ARW hangar
(Bldg 1176), the north side of the RED FLAG-Alaska hangar (Bldg 1140), the Southside of the
Hangars 1227 & 1228 (Bldgs 1227, 1228), Oscar Row, and entire area of the Loop Taxiway to
include a large majority of the South Ramp.

7.21. Air Traffic Control Recordings. The AOF/CC is the custodian of all recorded records.
Tower personnel will follow AFI 13-204v3 when transcribing or copying ATC recordings. IAW
AFI13-204v3, with the exception of official safety investigations, do not release recorded or
written records concerning mishaps without authority from the 354 OG/CC.
7.22. Variable Wind Information. Eielson Tower will only issue variable wind information at
request of aircrew.
7.23. Exercises. The AOF/CC must be briefed at least 48 hours in advance of any exercise or
inspection that involves AO personnel. ATC watch supervisor must ensure ATC facility
participation does not degrade services. The watch supervisor may interrupt or discontinue
facility participation if flight safety is in question or it interferes with the recovery of emergency
aircraft.
7.24. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations Procedures. Eielson AFB supports
Global Hawk UAS. Procedures are outlined in the Global Hawk GloPac2009 Emergency
Landing Operations Plan Eielson AFB Memorandum of Understanding.

Terms
Airfield Check— Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to the examine the primary
takeoff, landing and taxi surfaces in response to in-flight or ground emergencies, Runway
Surface Condition or Runway Condition Reading assessments, Foreign Object Damage removal,
and for Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazards and Habitat control.
Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI)— Formerly known as the flight line driving instruction.
Establishes local procedures for driving a vehicle on the airfield.
Airfield Inspection— Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to identify discrepancies
and/or hazards on the airfield (e.g., signs, markings, lighting, pavements, aircraft arresting
system, obstructions, obstacles, construction areas, etc.).
Airfield Operating Hours— AO facilities remain open to support the base flying mission.
MAJCOM/A3 establishes airfield operating hours. The OG/CC may authorize the use of
standby and on-call procedures for AO facilities. The OG/CC may extend operating hours at
bases where facilities are open less than 24 hours per day, as required, to meet short-term
mission requirements.
Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI)— Formerly known as the base flying regulation.
Defines local procedures for Airfield Management and ATC.
Approach End of Runway (AER)— The end of a runway nearest to the direction from which
the final approach is made.
Chase Aircraft— An aircraft flown in close proximity to another aircraft normally to observe its
performance during training or testing.
Closed Airfield— An airfield is "closed" when no flying activity is permitted. Unless
NOTAM’d otherwise, an airfield is considered closed during periods outside of normal
published operating hours when essential services are not available. If the closure is for a
particular type of aircraft or operation, it must be so stated. For example: "Closed to aircraft not
involved in RED FLAG-Alaska exercises."
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)— Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles
and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for access. Controlled Movement
Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as required taxiing of
aircraft. NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot
Controller Glossary.
External Stores— Items mounted on the external portions of an aircraft (e.g., armament, fuel
tanks, baggage pods, etc.) that can be released or jettisoned from an aircraft.
 70                                                               354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013


Flightline— Any area or facility including apron, hardstand and ramps on or in which aircraft
may be parked, stored, serviced or maintained.
Foreign Object Damage Check— Conducted by AM personnel prior to the start of normal
flying activities or in response to FOD reports by SOF, control Tower, aircraft, etc.
Formation Flight— More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots,
operates as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between
aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight lead and the pilots of the other
aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are
maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during join-up
and breakaway.
Holding Hands— Aircraft are joined in formation, implies visual contact by all flight members.
Lighting Check— Conducted by Civil Engineering (electrician) or AM personnel during
periods of darkness (including pre-dawn and dusk) to determine the operability of airfield
lighting systems.
Local Operating Procedures— Supplemental procedures issued as letters of agreement,
operations letters, operating instructions, memorandum of understanding, squadron regulations,
operations plans, or base manual or instructions.
Official Business Only (OBO)— The airfield is closed to all transient military aircraft for the
purpose of obtaining routine services such as fueling, passenger drop off or pickup, practice
approaches, parking, etc. The airfield may be used by aircrews and aircraft if official
government business (including civilian) must be conducted on or near the airfield and Prior
Permission is received from the Airfield Management.
On-Call Time— AO personnel must remain in the local area and be able to be contacted in the
event it becomes necessary to man their respective duty section(s) outside of normal operating
hours. Personnel who are on-call must not consume alcohol or take medications that affect duty
status. Do not consider on-call time as duty time.
Open Airfield— Unless NOTAM’d closed, an airfield is considered open during published
operating hours with all essential services available.
Prior Permission Required (PPR)— The airfield is closed to transient aircraft unless approval
for operation is obtained from the appropriate commander through Airfield Management. PPR
must be requested and approved before the flight departs to that airfield. The purpose of PPR is
to control volume and flow of traffic rather than to prohibit it. Prior permission is required for
all aircraft requiring transient alert service outside the published transient alert duty hours. All
aircraft carrying hazardous materials must obtain prior permission as outlined in AFJI 11-204.
Runway Condition Reading (RCR)— A numerical reading that identifies the surface friction
capability of the runway pavement, obtained using a decelerometer. The aircrew uses this
information to determine runway braking action during takeoffs and landings.
Runway Incursion— Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
354FWI13-204 19 JUNE 2013                                                                      71


1) Operational Error (OE)— A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
2) Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC
instructions, AFIs and/or FARs.
3) Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)— Any entry or movement on the controlled
movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not
been authorized by ATC.
Runway Surface Condition (RSC)— Identifies the condition of the runway surface when
covered with slush, snow, ice or water.
Runway Suspension— A short-term condition that requires temporarily restricting aircraft
arrivals and departures until corrected (e.g., FOD, severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice
removal checks, arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction,
pavement repair, etc.).
Standby Time— Time during published flying hours when AO personnel are immediately
available to return the facility to operations within the time limit the OG/CC specifies. Consider
standby time as duty time.
Supervisor of Flying— A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to monitor and
supervise current flight operations. A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties from the control
Tower.
Unauthorized Landing— A landing at an Air Force airfield by a civil aircraft without prior
authority (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours prior notice).
Uncontrolled Movement Areas— Taxiways and ramp areas not under the control of ATC.
NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of "non-movement area" as defined in the Federal
Aviation Administration Pilot Controller Glossary.
Wet Runway— An RSC where visible water is the only form of moisture on the runway
surface.
