                              EDUCATION PLAN FOR AVIP

3.1. General. Commanders at all levels are responsible for educating their personnel before
vaccination. The educational program will inform personnel:
   3.1.1. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has licensed the anthrax vaccine for
   prevention of anthrax disease in all types of exposure, including inhalation.
   3.1.2. Of the known and potential benefits and risks of anthrax vaccination.
   3.1.3. There is no other product approved by the FDA to counter anthrax before exposure.
   3.1.4. Anthrax vaccinations are mandatory for selected individuals.
   3.1.5. Anthrax vaccinations are voluntary for selected individuals.
   3.1.6. Those individuals who previously began the anthrax vaccine series during the period
   1998 to present and who are now resuming the anthrax series (whether on a mandatory or
   voluntary basis) will resume the series from where they left off per guidelines from the
   Center for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).
   They should not restart the series.
3.2. Key Messages.
   3.2.1. Your health and safety are our #1 concern.
   3.2.2. The vaccine is safe and effective.
   3.2.3. The threat from anthrax is real and deadly.
   3.2.4. Vaccination offers a layer of protection in addition to antibiotics and other measures
   that are needed for certain members of the armed forces.
3.3. Education for Commanders. Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring they
are properly and fully educated on the AVIP. The primary modes of providing this education to
commanders are the AVIP tri-fold brochure, the ―AVIP Briefing for Leaders‖ and the ―AVIP
Briefing for Individuals,‖ all available at http://www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/. Commanders
will review all of these resources and are highly encouraged to also use their Installation AVIP
team as an education resource.
3.4. Education for Individuals. All personnel must receive education on the resumption of
mandatory anthrax vaccinations for designated personnel and the voluntary components of the
AVIP before receiving the anthrax vaccine. This applies to individuals beginning or resuming
the vaccination series.
   3.4.1. The primary mode of providing education to individuals is the AVIP tri-fold brochure
   developed by MILVAX. This brochure is available at the MTF or electronically at
   http://www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/. Prior to receiving the anthrax vaccine, individuals
   must have had the opportunity to review the AVIP tri-fold brochure.
       3.4.1.1. Upon arrival at the MTF to receive the anthrax vaccine, individuals (military
       personnel, government civilian employees, contractors and others) will be offered a copy
       of the AVIP tri-fold. Prior to administering the anthrax vaccine, the immunization

      technician will ask the individual if they have received a copy of the AVIP tri-fold
      brochure. If they have not, they should be offered the opportunity to view the brochure
      prior to receiving the immunization.
   3.4.2. Commanders are responsible for ensuring eligible individuals are educated on the
   mandatory and voluntary components of the AVIP before individuals are subject to
   vaccination. Commanders should supplement the AVIP tri-fold brochure by presenting the
   ―AVIP Briefing for Individuals‖ developed by MILVAX to unit personnel.
3.5. Education for Medical Personnel. For individuals who experience an adverse event
associated with the vaccine, medical personnel will provide the appropriate treatment and
referral, if necessary, for diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions.
   3.5.1. Medical commanders will ensure that healthcare professionals and vaccinators
   involved with the AVIP review and comply with the implementation publication. Additional
   resources are available to support this education activity: The most current version of the tri-
   fold, the AVIP briefing slides (available at http://www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/) and the
   package insert shipped with each vial of the anthrax vaccine.
   3.5.2. Medical personnel involved with the AVIP must understand healthcare-access
   guidance for all personnel affected by the AVIP policy, procedures for reporting in the
   Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and reasons for medical exemption
   from anthrax vaccination.
   3.5.3. Personnel providing anthrax immunizations must acknowledge training on checklist
   items 4-8, and 12 in Attachment 3, AVIP Implementation Checklist.
      3.5.3.1. The Immunization Clinic NCOIC will ensure proper documentation of the
      education provided to enlisted medical personnel. Documentation must be accomplished
      on AF Form 1098 in the enlisted 6-part folder for all SEI 453/454s. Training will be
      documented for all Immunization Back-Up Technicians (IBT’s) and Immunization
      Augmentees (IA’s) who may be used in support of the AVIP.
      3.5.3.2. This training will be re-certified annually and will be reviewed for currency
      upon arrival at a new duty station.
      3.5.3.3. AVIP-required training must be accomplished and documented before personnel
      are authorized to provide anthrax vaccinations without immediate supervision.
   3.5.4. Immunization technicians must be educated on the following requirements of the
   program..
      3.5.4.1. Upon presenting to the Immunization Clinic, the technician will ask all
      personnel if they have received a copy of the AVIP tri-fold brochure prior to immunizing
      them. If they have not, they should be offered a copy of the most current version of the
      brochure.
      3.5.4.2. Immunization technicians will verify that all personnel eligible for voluntary
      vaccination wish to receive the vaccine prior to vaccinating them.
      3.5.4.3. Attachment 5, AVIP Checklist for Vaccinators can be used as a resource for
      personnel providing anthrax vaccinations.      See Section 5.6.1 for guidance on
      management of individual refusal of a mandatory vaccine.

  3.5.5. The AVIP Medical OIC will ensure education on the AVIP is accomplished for:
  Clinical supervisors of vaccinators, preventive medicine and public health staff, relevant
  healthcare providers (e.g., allergy-immunology, primary care, flight medicine) and any other
  provider designated by the Medical Commander. Education must include the components
  listed in 3.5.2 as well as the information provided in the ―AVIP Healthcare Provider’s
  Briefing‖ available at: http://www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/.
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                               13


                                          Chapter 4

                                     MEDICAL ISSUES

4.1. Dosing Schedule.
   4.1.1. The dosage schedule for the anthrax vaccine is day 0, 4 weeks, followed by doses at 6,
   12, and 18 months with an annual booster to sustain immunity. This is the only dosage
   schedule currently licensed by the FDA.
       4.1.1.1. Do not administer the vaccine on a compressed or accelerated schedule. Under
       no circumstance is the vaccine to be given at shorter intervals than approved by the FDA.
       4.1.1.2. Vaccinations should be given on or as soon after recommended dates as
       possible. Whenever a vaccine dose is received after a scheduled date, adjust the
       subsequent doses accordingly to ensure the proper interval of time between doses.
       4.1.1.3. All vaccinations are given intramuscularly and IAW the current scope of
       practice. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid region of the upper arm.
   4.1.2. In cases in which the vaccine series was deferred, whether due to vaccine shortage,
   program interruption or other reasons, individuals are not required or advised to restart the
   vaccine series.
       4.1.2.1. Individuals resuming anthrax vaccinations, under this policy, will resume where
       they left off and continue the vaccine series at the appropriate shot intervals. This is
       consistent with prevailing medical practice and complies with guidance from the CDC,
       ACIP and the Defense Health Board and in consultation with the FDA.
       4.1.2.2. When a dose cannot be provided on the specific date suggested by the schedule,
       provide it as soon as practical thereafter.
   4.1.3. All individuals who begin the anthrax vaccine dosing series shall be informed of the
   recommended dosing schedule and be advised to return to the Immunization Clinic at the
   appropriate times under the schedule, as long as they remain eligible for AVIP.
4.2. Pregnancy. The anthrax vaccine is generally deferred during pregnancy.
   4.2.1. Immunization clinics and providers will display a prominent sign directing women to
   alert the technician or provider if they think they might be pregnant.
   4.2.2. All females of childbearing age will be asked about the possibility of pregnancy prior
   to receiving the vaccine. The following question, recommended by the CDC, will be used on
   any locally approved questionnaire/overprint: ―For women: Are you pregnant or is there a
   chance you could become pregnant during the next month?‖
   4.2.3. Women who are uncertain about their pregnancy status shall be medically evaluated
   for pregnancy prior to immunization. If women have any questions or concerns, they should
   consult with their healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine.
   4.2.4. In unusual circumstances, such as a confirmed exposure to anthrax bacillus in which
   the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk to the fetus, they may be vaccinated IAW the
   CDC ACIP Guidelines.
 14                                                  MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011


4.3. Pre-vaccination Screening. Medically screen patients prior to administering the anthrax
vaccine to ensure there are no contraindications for receiving the vaccine.
4.4. Adverse Reactions.
   4.4.1. General Information. Medical personnel must be prepared to manage perceived or
   actual adverse events after vaccination: How to minimize them, respond to them and report
   them IAW AFI 48-110.
   4.4.2. Immunization Technician’s Role. If a patient returns to the clinic after receiving a
   vaccination and indicates an adverse reaction, the patient should be referred to a provider.
   4.4.3. The MILVAX Clinical Guidelines for Managing Adverse Events after Vaccination,
   available at: http://www.anthrax.mil/education/clinician/clinicians.asp, provide detailed
   guidance for clinicians on adverse events, treatment guidelines, medical exemption criteria
   and the VAERS. They also include advice for managing a large or persistent local reaction
   to previous anthrax vaccinations.
   4.4.4. The DoD Vaccine Healthcare Centers should be utilized by providers as needed.
   Contact     information      can     be     found     at     the      following     website:
   http://www.vhcinfo.org/vhcnet_contact.htm. In addition, providers can contact the DoD
   Vaccine Clinical Call Center at 1-888-210-6469. This call center is available 24 hours a day,
   7 days a week.
   4.4.5. Adverse reactions from DoD directed immunizations are line of duty conditions.
       4.4.5.1. In accordance with AFI 48-110, section 2-10, healthcare providers report
       adverse events related to vaccines to VAERS. Reporting may be done through the
       VAERS website (http://www.vaers.hhs.gov) or by submitting hard copies of the report
       as directed. VAERS forms can be obtained from the VAERS website, ordered by calling
       1-800-822-7967 or from the Air Force Complete Immunization Tracking Application
       (AFCITA).
       4.4.5.2. Healthcare personnel are required to report adverse events resulting in
       hospitalization, a life-threatening event, lost duty time greater than 24 hours, an event
       related to suspected contamination of a vaccine vial and any event warranting permanent
       medical exemption from vaccination.
       4.4.5.3. Healthcare providers are encouraged to report other adverse events that are
       considered unexpected in nature or severity.
       4.4.5.4. Patients and their family members may also submit VAERS reports directly.
       IAW AFI 48-110, healthcare personnel will assist the patient in completing the form,
       regardless of professional judgment about causal association to immunization.
       4.4.5.5. Further guidance on documentation and where to send VAERS reports can be
       found in AFI 48-110, Section 2-10.f.
4.5. Medical Exemptions.
   4.5.1. Individuals who have certain pre-existing conditions that preclude anthrax vaccination
   and some individuals who develop reactions during the vaccination series may warrant
   medical exemptions. These individuals must be identified so their status can be tracked in
   AFCITA and further vaccine administration appropriately managed. Granting medical
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                                15


  exemptions is a medical function that must be performed by a privileged healthcare provider
  IAW AFI 48-110, Section 2-6.
  4.5.2. There are two types of medical exemptions: Temporary and Permanent.
     4.5.2.1. Temporary medical exemptions are indicated in situations where it is clinically
     inappropriate to administer the vaccine to an individual due to a condition that is
     expected to resolve or otherwise end. Examples include immunosuppressive therapy,
     serious acute diseases, post-surgical situations, pregnancy and in some situations where a
     medical condition is being evaluated or treated. This would include significant vaccine-
     associated adverse events that are being evaluated or while awaiting specialist
     consultation.
         4.5.2.1.1. Temporary medical exemptions may be granted by any privileged military
         healthcare provider or based on the examination of a civilian provider. Temporary
         exemptions cannot exceed 365 days and should be limited to the shortest duration
         necessary.
         4.5.2.1.2. When evaluating individuals with possible adverse events following
         receipt of anthrax vaccine, use the Clinical Guidelines and/or advice from the DoD
         Vaccine Healthcare Centers to determine whether a medical exemption from
         subsequent doses of vaccine is indicated.
     4.5.2.2. Permanent medical exemptions are generally warranted if the medical condition
     or adverse reaction is so severe that the risk of continued immunization is not justified.
         4.5.2.2.1. Examples of situations which warrant a permanent medical exemption
         include severe reaction after a previous anthrax vaccination such that additional doses
         would pose an undue risk to the vaccine recipient, HIV infection or other chronic
         immune deficiencies and evidence of immunity based on serologic antibody tests or
         documented previous anthrax infection.
         4.5.2.2.2. If an individual’s clinical case is complex or not readily definable, consult
         an appropriate medical specialist with vaccine safety assessment expertise, before a
         permanent medical exemption is granted. In addition, the original healthcare provider
         may consult with physicians located at the Vaccine Healthcare Center Network.
         4.5.2.2.3. If the situation changes, a permanent medical exemption can be removed
         by a provider experienced in vaccine safety assessment.
     4.5.2.3. Granting of medical exemptions may require a duty status change or deployment
     limitation for the individual. Any change in duty status/deployment eligibility due to a
     medical exemption must be processed IAW AFI 48-123 and/or additional AF guidance as
     released. The AVIP Medical OIC should consult with the Chief of Aerospace Medicine
     and the Chief of the Medical Staff for guidance as needed.
     4.5.2.4. Use of medical exemption codes in AFCITA must be IAW AFI 48-110, Table
     C-1.
     4.5.2.5. If a patient disagrees with an initial medical decision or diagnosis, he or she may
     request a second opinion. If the patient disagrees with the second opinion, he or she may
     be referred directly to the Vaccine Healthcare Center Network.

4.6. Anthrax Vaccine Tracking and Documentation.
   4.6.1. The Public Health Officer will:
      4.6.1.1. Ensure personnel deploying to the USCENTCOM AOR are entered into the
      Deployment Tracking Module of Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical
      Readiness (PIMR) software. Individuals subject to mandatory anthrax vaccination based
      on their deployment location will be reflected as ―red‖ in the AFCITA and PIMR until
      they present to the Immunization Clinic and their the anthrax vaccination status is
      documented in AFCITA.
          4.6.1.1.1. Ensure the Military Personnel Section (MPS) provides a roster of outbound
          personnel with PCS orders to Korea will be forwarded monthly to the Immunization
          Clinic NCOIC or designated personnel.
          4.6.1.1.2. Ensure FHM personnel will not sign off deployment checklists for
          personnel requiring mandatory anthrax vaccinations until/unless they are current for
          anthrax vaccinations in AFCITA and an updated copy of the DD Form 2766C is
          received for placement into the member’s medical clearance folder.
      4.6.1.2. Ensure FHM personnel send all eligible personnel requiring medical clearance
      for PCS to Korea to the Immunization Clinic for anthrax vaccinations as needed.
          4.6.1.2.1. Ensure FHM personnel will not sign off on medical clearance forms for
          personnel PCSing to Korea who are subject to mandatory vaccinations, until/unless
          they are identified as current for anthrax vaccinations in AFCITA.
      4.6.1.3. Send the Medical Status Report indicating personnel due or overdue for
      mandatory anthrax vaccine to unit commanders.
   4.6.2. The Immunization Clinic will record all vaccinations in AFCITA IAW current AF
   guidance. Ensure a copy of DD Form 2766C is forwarded to the individual’s medical record
   (if needed) and inform the individual verbally and in writing, when the next dose is due. The
   AFCITA worksheet printout or the MILVAX ―Next Dose‖ cards (available at this link:
   http://www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/) can be used for written notification.
      4.6.2.1. The Immunization Clinic will assign individuals who are subject to mandatory
      vaccinations in preparation for PCS to Korea to the ―Korea‖ immunization group in
      AFCITA. This will ensure that the mandatory anthrax vaccination requirement can be
      tracked.
      4.6.2.2. Immunization clinic personnel will not sign off on deployment checklists or PCS
      medical clearance forms for individuals subject to mandatory vaccination until/unless
      they are identified as current for anthrax in AFCITA.
   4.6.3. Records regarding individuals subject to mandatory vaccination who are identified as
   ―due‖ for next dose will turn yellow in AFCITA and will be placed on the Unit
   Commander’s Individual Medical Readiness Not Ready Report. If the individual does not
   present to the Immunization Clinic during the ―due‖ grace period, the individual’s record will
   become ―overdue‖ and turn red in AFCITA. This will affect the unit’s PIMR rate.
   4.6.4. Records regarding individuals who volunteer for anthrax vaccinations will not change
   status in AFCITA (will remain coded green) and will not appear on immunization due
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                                17


   rosters. Immunization clinic personnel must ensure that these individuals receive clear
   guidance on when to return for their next scheduled dose. Use of the MILVAX ―Next Dose‖
   card is highly encouraged for these individuals.
4.7. Medical Logistics/Vaccine Distribution. The US Army Medical Materiel Agency
(USAMMA) is responsible for coordinating the distribution of anthrax vaccine within DoD. The
Air Force Medical Operations Agency Procurement Services (AFMOA/SGSLC) is the AF
distribution point of contact for this program. The Air Force POC can be contacted at DSN 343-
4170 or commercial (301) 619-4170.
   4.7.1. Base-level medical logistics personnel can order the anthrax vaccine from USAMMA
   by using the on-line Air Force Anthrax Vaccine Request Form (instructions for ordering can
   be found at http://www.usamma.army.mil/vaccines/anthrax/antxhome.htm).
       4.7.1.1. When USAMMA receives the vaccine order, they will ship AVIP tri-folds to the
       requestor (one for each dose ordered). Tri-folds sent with the vaccine are for
       Immunization Clinic use only. Others needing tri-folds for other uses can print them
       locally from the MILVAX website (www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/).
       4.7.1.2. USAMMA will check the MILVAX listing of registered AVIP Immunization
       Activities to ensure the requestor is registered to administer the anthrax vaccine.
       USAMMA will also verify that the requestor will be available to receive vaccine before
       authorizing shipment of vaccine.
   4.7.2. Anthrax vaccine is heat and cold sensitive. The vaccine will be kept at the appropriate
   storage temperature range throughout the entire vaccination process. It should be removed
   just prior to giving the shot. This vaccine should not be "pre-drawn" for administration. The

                                          Chapter 5

                               ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES

5.1. Emergency-Essential (E-E) Civilians
   5.1.1. Unit commanders must identify US-national E-E civilian employees eligible for
   vaccination and direct them to a military medical unit for education, screening and
   vaccination as appropriate. Unit commanders will provide a list of E-E civilians eligible for
   vaccination to the MTF/immunization clinic. E-E civilians must present proof they are an E-
   E employee (e.g., identification card) and immunization record, if available, to medical
   personnel.
   5.1.2. For E-E civilians that are non-bargaining unit members, vaccinations will begin
   immediately.
   5.1.3. For E-E civilians that are bargaining unit members who have already deployed (or are
   scheduled to arrive within 30 days) or currently reside in USCENTCOM or on the Korean
   Peninsula, vaccinations will begin immediately; post-implementation negotiations will be
   accomplished if immunizations requirements, in general, are not already a contractual
   requirement.
   5.1.4. For E-E civilians that are bargaining unit members who are scheduled to, but have yet
   to deploy to USCENTCOM or the Korean Peninsula, impact and implementation bargaining
   may be required if the employees are not already required to receive immunizations, in
   general. Upon completion, the servicing civilian personnel flight will inform the military
   medical community that bargaining obligations have been completed and commanders will
   provide a list of E-E civilians eligible for vaccination to the MTF/immunization clinic.
5.2. Mission Essential (M-E) Contractors
   5.2.1. Vaccination of US-national M-E contractor personnel will be a requirement of the
   applicable contract.
   5.2.2. If not already done, commanders must, IAW existing SAF/AQC guidance, identify
   their M-E services and inform the contracting office. Contracting officers will modify
   contracts that do not already cover the designated M-E services. Contracting officers should
   take appropriate actions to address: Identification of the M-E services, the contractor’s
   responsibility to identify their employees who will perform the M-E services during a crisis,
   funding, liability, authorization for vaccination and related medical care.
   5.2.3. Once M-E services are contractually covered, contracting officers will direct
   contractors to identify their vaccine eligible M-E employees. Contracting officers will
   provide a list of these employees to the unit commanders and the Immunization Clinic
   NCOIC. Commanders will then direct M-E contractor personnel to a military medical unit
   for education, screening and vaccination as appropriate.
5.3. Exceptions to Policy (ETP). In accordance with References J through O (see Attachment
1), select groups previously granted ETPs will be subject to mandatory vaccinations.
   5.3.1. Requesting ETPs.
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                                    19


      5.3.1.1. ETPs for the AVIP require approval by the ASD-HA. There are two ways to
      request an ETP. The first is to submit an official request for an ETP from the Wing level
      through the MAJCOM to HQ USAF/A3SC for action. The second is to submit the
      request for an ETP through the appropriate COCOM, who will in turn submit it to the
      Director, Joint Staff. Generally, requests for ETPs should only be sent to the COCOM if
      the proposed ETP affects personnel from more than one Service.
      5.3.1.2. To make the strongest case possible to the ASD-HA for an ETP, requests from
      the Wing should have a cover memo from the Wing Commander that contains the request
      and supporting rationale. The memo should have an attached point paper that provides
      key figures on the situation that warrants the request. This includes information on the
      number of personnel to be vaccinated, the mission/role of the personnel and the specific
      reason current policy does not permit vaccination. HQ USAF/A3SC can assist the Wing
      and MAJCOMs in drafting their requests and provide general advice on the likelihood of
      approval.
      5.3.1.3. The Wing Commander should submit the request to the MAJCOM A3 or A5
      (Operations or Plans directorate as appropriate) for endorsement and forwarding to HQ
      USAF/A3SC. HQ USAF/A3SC will staff the request through appropriate HAF offices
      and then forward it to the Director, Joint Staff, who (if they concur with the request) will
      then staff it to the ASD-HA for approval.
   5.3.2. Execution of ETP’s. Upon final approval of an ETP, the MAJCOM SG POC will
   provide guidance to the appropriate installation medical personnel on the proper
   methodology for identifying/recording the personnel impacted by the ETP in AFCITA.
5.4. Waivers and Exemptions.
   5.4.1. Religious Waivers. Guidance for religious waivers can be found in AFI 48-110,
   Immunizations and Chemoprophylaxis, Section 2.6. (b) (3). IAW this AFI, the Air Force
   does not grant permanent immunization exemptions for religious reasons. The MAJCOM
   Commander is the approval and revocation authority for temporary exemptions.
   5.4.2. Administrative and Medical Exemptions. It is desirable that all personnel deploying
   to higher-threat areas receive at least their first three doses prior to deployment. In those rare
   instances when an individual is not able to take or continue the anthrax series due to: (1) an
   administrative exemption, granted by a commander or supervisor; or (2) a medical exemption
   granted by a privileged healthcare provider (e.g. physicians, nurse practitioners and physician
   assistants), the individual is still deployable.
      5.4.2.1. Administrative Exemptions (see Reference D).
          5.4.2.1.1. Administrative exemptions are authorized by AF/A1 for military members,
          E-E civilians and specified contractors who meet specific criteria.
          5.4.2.1.2. Commanders may exempt from the AVIP personnel normally subject to
          mandatory vaccination who are separating within 180 days who meet the following
          conditions: (a) they are not currently assigned or deployed to a designated higher
          threat area, (b) they are not scheduled to perform duty in a designated higher threat
          area (including temporary duty) and (c) the commander has not directed vaccination
 20                                                    MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011


          because of overriding mission requirements. Granting administrative exemptions is a
          personnel function, usually controlled by an individual’s unit.
          5.4.2.1.3. Official documentation (i.e., from the Squadron Commander, MPF)
          including the administrative code and duration (specific date, temporary, indefinite)
          of exemption will be presented to the Immunization Clinic. Validated administrative
          exemptions will then be entered into AFCITA by the Immunization Clinic staff.
       5.4.2.2. Medical Exemptions. Medical exemptions may be temporary or permanent and
       may be based on pre-existing conditions or result from vaccine adverse reactions.
       Detailed information on medical exemptions can be found in Section 4.5 of this plan.
       Commanders should contact the AVIP Medical OIC if they need more information on
       this issue.
5.5. Healthcare Access Guidelines. At the time of immunization, all vaccine recipients will be
provided information on potential adverse events, the 24-hour number for the DoD Vaccine
Clinical Call Center and the toll-free number for the Military Medical Support Office (MMSO).
   5.5.1. Whenever an individual presents to an MTF expressing a belief that the condition for
   which the treatment is sought is related to an immunization received in a DoD clinic, they are
   authorized initial or emergency care to evaluate and treat an actual or perceived adverse
   reaction. Care may also be provided by a civilian medical facility in the following
   circumstances: An individual believes the situation to be an emergency and the civilian
   hospital is the nearest facility or an individual is on leave status, TDY or in a non-duty status
   (ARC personnel) and there are no MTFs within 50 miles. Pre-approval may still be required
   depending on the specific circumstances when not an emergent situation.
       5.5.1.1. ARC Personnel. An adverse reaction from a DoD-directed immunization is a
       line-of-duty condition. Therefore, medical care must be provided for an ARC member
       who believes his/her medical complaint is related to receiving the DoD-directed
       immunization. Evaluation or treatment will not be denied or delayed, pending a line-of-
       duty determination. Once treatment has been rendered or the individual’s emergent
       condition is stabilized, a Line of Duty (LOD) and/or Notice of Eligibility will be
       determined as soon as possible.
          5.5.1.1.1. ARC personnel should notify their Reserve Medical Unit to obtain LOD-
          related forms if it is not an emergent situation. After the emergency is resolved the
          member must notify their RMU to complete the LOD for services rendered. The
          LOD is also required for authorization of care to continue as deemed by medical
          authority. Contact the MMSO at 1-888-MHS MMSO (1-888-647-6676) as soon as
          possible when seeking care from their personal healthcare providers or any non-
          military treatment facility.
          5.5.1.1.2. AFR and ANG may supplement this plan with additional guidance on
          LOD/Eligibility requirements for their personnel as needed.
       5.5.1.2. DoD E-E Civilians. DoD E-E civilians who are required to take the vaccine
       must also be provided with options for receiving medical care in the event they believe
       their medical complaint is related to the DoD administered vaccine. The following steps
       should be taken if they believe they have suffered an adverse reaction to a DoD
       administered vaccine and they would like to seek medical attention.
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                                  21


          5.5.1.2.1. E-E civilians should contact their supervisor or Civilian Personnel Flight
          (CPF) and specify that they believe they have suffered a reaction and would like
          medical attention. Additionally, they should notify the DoD medical facility that
          administered the vaccine in question.
          5.5.1.2.2. The CPF will provide them with a Federal Employees’ Compensation Act
          (FECA) claim form.
          5.5.1.2.3. The installation or agency Injury Compensation Program Administrator
          (ICPA) will explain the options under the FECA and, if requested, arrange for a
          medical examination and/or treatment authorization form (CA-16) to be issued.
          Initially, individuals may select a physician of their choice or request treatment at the
          nearest military MTF, if available.
          5.5.1.2.4. Upon receiving authorization for medical care, E-E civilians should
          proceed to the treating facility without delay. They should request that the treating
          physician provide the CPF and the MTF with a copy of the initial medical report.
          The original medical report should be forwarded to the Department of Labor’s Office
          of Workers’ Compensation Programs.
          5.5.1.2.5. Encourage individuals to maintain contact with their supervisor and the
          CPF throughout the period of treatment regarding their ability to return to duty. The
          ICPA at the installation or agency can assist with return-to-duty efforts, as well as
          subsequent queries regarding FECA benefits.
      5.5.1.3. DoD contractors. DoD contractor employees who are required to take the
      vaccine must also be provided with options for receiving medical care in the event they
      believe their medical complaint is related to the DoD administered vaccine.
          5.5.1.3.1. Contractor employees should contact their supervisor and make the
          situation known. Concurrently, they should notify the DoD medical facility that
          administered the vaccine of the adverse event. If they need to obtain medical care,
          they should request guidance from their employer as to what procedures they need to
          follow and/or which claims forms they need to complete as dictated by the company’s
          compensation carrier. They should request the treating medical facility provide a
          copy of any medical report related to the suspected vaccine adverse event.
5.6. Refusal Management.
   5.6.1. Management of Initial Vaccine Refusal in the Immunization Clinic.
      5.6.1.1. If an individual subject to mandatory vaccination, as identified in paragraph
      2.1.1 of this plan, refuses an anthrax vaccination in the immunizations clinic, the
      technician should notify the Immunization Clinic NCOIC/OIC before that individual
      leaves the clinic. The NCOIC/OIC (or technician if they’re not available) should verify
      again that the individual is subject to mandatory vaccination and that the individual has
      been offered the tri-fold and the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered
      about information in the tri-fold.
      5.6.1.2. If the individual still chooses to refuse the anthrax vaccine, clinic personnel will
      follow the steps outlined in Attachment 6, AVIP MTF Checklist for Cases of Initial
22                                                    MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011


     Vaccine Refusal. Clinic personnel will complete steps 1-4 of Attachment 6 before the
     individual leaves the immunization clinic.
     5.6.1.3. Immunization clinic personnel will ensure documentation is completed as
     required in Attachment 6 and notify the AVIP Medical OIC (or locally designated
     officer) of the refusal in a timely manner.
     5.6.1.4. The AVIP Medical OIC (or locally designated officer) will notify the
     individual’s commander or designee of the refusal as defined in Attachment 6 within 24
     hours. This notification is an accountable notification under the Health Information
     Portability and Accountability Act and must be accounted for using the Protected Health
     Information Management Tool or the MTF’s approved method.
     5.6.1.5. Immunization clinic personnel will not assign an exemption code in AFCITA to
     individuals initially refusing anthrax vaccination.
     5.6.1.6. Cases of initial vaccine refusal should be handled with the appropriate regard to
     the individual’s privacy. There is no requirement for MTFs to track individuals or
     numbers of individuals initially refusing the anthrax vaccine and there should be no
     reporting of these refusals outside the chain of command. Any inquiries concerning
     anthrax refusals should be referred to the installation Freedom of Information Act office
     with a copy to the installation legal office.
  5.6.2. Military Members. Requiring a military member to take the anthrax vaccine
  constitutes a lawful order. However, the member’s commander may exercise his or her
  discretion in handling refusal cases. If an individual indicates he or she is going to refuse the
  anthrax vaccination or has initially refused an anthrax vaccination the following approach
  should be used.
     5.6.2.1. Find out why the individual is reluctant.
     5.6.2.2. Provide the member with appropriate education.
     5.6.2.3. Combinations of concerns may require education by a number of people; for
     example:
         5.6.2.3.1. Concerns with vaccine safety or efficacy should be sent to the supporting
         medical organization (if not previously accomplished). Medical education should be
         tailored to the specific concerns of the individual (efficacy, reproduction, allergic
         reactions, etc.) and should be accomplished by a healthcare provider knowledgeable
         about the anthrax vaccine and who is able to address the specific medical concerns of
         the individual. The medical counseling will be documented in the individual’s
         medical record.
         5.6.2.3.2. Concerns with the threat should be addressed by intelligence personnel
         (either medical or line).
         5.6.2.3.3. If the member is still reluctant after additional education, send the member
         to the Area Defense Counsel for an explanation of the potential consequences of
         his/her refusal.
     5.6.2.4. After the appropriate counseling, commanders should again order the individual
     to take the vaccine.
MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011                                                            23


       5.6.2.5. If the member still refuses, consult with JA for appropriate action.
   5.6.3. E-E Civilian-Specific Actions
       5.6.3.1. E-E civilian employees who do not receive the DoD-directed vaccination and
       therefore cannot perform their E-E duties are subject to provisions in AFI 36-507,
       Mobilization of the Civilian Work Force.
       5.6.3.2. These provisions may include assigning an alternate to the E-E duties,
       reassignment of the employee, or adverse action including termination of employment.
       Such employees should be counseled by their supervisors in consultation with the
       servicing CPF, regarding possible ramifications of refusing the vaccination.
       5.6.3.3. Recommend and provide medical or intelligence education if their concerns are
       in those areas.
   5.6.4. Contractor-Specific Actions. Contract employees who do not receive the DoD-
   directed vaccination are subject to provisions of their contract. Recommend and provide
   medical or intelligence education if their concerns are in those areas. Contact SAF/AQCX
   for further guidance.

                              AVIP REGISTRY AGREEMENT

AVIP Medical Officer-in-Charge (OIC): read, sign, and return to addresses below after Medical
Commander has also signed acknowledgment.
I have read and understand the USAF AVIP Implementation Plan describing the requirements
for anthrax immunization, dated January 2007, at this url:
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/DocMan/DOCDisplay.asp?Filter=00-XP-AF-
31&DocID=1935791
Each of the items on the checklist (AF Implementation Plan, Attachment 3) has been fulfilled for
our unit or activity. I have included a copy of the completed checklist with this request. I
understand the monthly reporting requirements (AF Implementation Plan, Attachment 4). If the
Military Vaccine (MILVAX) Agency does not receive a report on time, they may contact the
people named below to obtain another copy.
For medical units: My staff has informed or reminded every healthcare worker with
responsibilities for administering anthrax immunizations (including immunization backup
technicians) of the importance of confirming which category of the policy (mandatory or
voluntary) a person is in before administering the anthrax vaccine. For personnel for whom the
vaccination is voluntary, the actual staff member administering the vaccine will verbally confirm
this before the actual injection. These steps are intended to prevent medication errors.
Our unit or activity is ready to comply with the DoD policies for anthrax vaccination. I accept
responsibility for AVIP education and monthly reporting.
If I am assigned other duties and am no longer the AVIP Medical OIC, I will notify the
MILVAX Agency before departure. I will instruct my replacement to complete his or her own
Registry Agreement and forward it to the MILVAX Agency.

                          AVIP IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Unit: ___________________ Location:_________________________


AVIP Medical OIC: ____________________ Date Checklist Completed: __________


Ensure these items have been completed before giving anthrax vaccinations (reassess items on
this checklist periodically):
[ ] 1. Collect all previous AVIP tri-folds from Dec 2005 or earlier and discard them. Do not
retain them for future use. Be sure to remove obsolete tri-folds from pamphlet racks in waiting
rooms, on bulletin boards, intranets, etc.
[ ] 2. Obtain sufficient AVIP tri-folds dated 15 Jan 09 or later, enough to give a personal copy to
each person to be vaccinated, one for each dose. Each anthrax vaccine shipment will include
AVIP tri-fold brochures equal to the number of doses ordered. Additional color copies of these
revised tri-folds are available by emailing usammadoc@det.amedd.army.mil or at
www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/.
[ ] 3. Obtain AVIP briefing slides. Available from www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2007 If you need
these slides shipped to you in hard copy or on a CD-ROM, call 877-GET-VACC or send an
email request to AVIPReports@amedd.army.mil, SIPRNET vaccines@hqda-S.army.Smil.mil.
[ ] 4. Coordinate with supporting medical activity or ensure organic medical support has
required AVIP training for vaccinators and healthcare providers. Assure all vaccinators (primary
and back-up), clinical supervisors of vaccinators, preventive medicine and public health staff,
and relevant healthcare providers (e.g., allergy-immunology, ambulatory care, flight medicine,
emergency care) are familiar with the clinical science for anthrax vaccine and DoD requirements.
Use training course available at www.anthrax.mil/education/. Annotate training records
accordingly. Vaccinators acknowledge the content in the following materials:
a. HQ USAF/A3/5 message, ―Implementation of Mandatory Anthrax Vaccine Immunization
Program,‖ January 2007.
b. AVIP healthcare provider briefing slides at www.anthrax.mil/AVIP2008/.
c. BioThrax package insert: available with every vaccine vial or at
www.emergentbiosolutions.com/pdf/emergent_biothrax_us.pdf.
d. AVIP tri-fold brochure dated 15 Jan 09 or later.
e. Reporting procedures for Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) at
www.vaers.hhs.gov .
f. Some medical conditions may require temporary or permanent medical exemptions from
anthrax immunization (e.g. serious allergic reactions to anthrax vaccination, moderate or severe
illness, pregnancy, latex anaphylactic sensitivity, immune-suppressive conditions, Guillian-Barré
syndrome, previous anthrax infection). Medical providers should be familiar with package insert
prescribing information and grant appropriate exemptions. Exemptions must be documented in
 30                                                    MOODYAFB I48-110 11 MARCH 2011


electronic tracking system and all temporary exemptions must have an end date indicated. The
most effective way to identify early pregnancy is to ask discreetly for date of last menstrual
period and whether the last menses was normal and on time. Offer pregnancy testing before any
immunization.
[ ] 5. Assure health care personnel are trained and that the Immunization Clinic NCOIC
documents training for immunization technicians, IBTs and IAs as appropriate in their formal
training record.
[ ] 6. Understand criteria for eligibility for anthrax vaccination (Under Secretary of Defense
(P&R) memo, 6 Dec 06; HQ USAF Plan for Implementing the AVIP, January 2007, available at
.https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/DocMan/DOCDisplay.asp?Filter=00-XP-AF-
31&DocID=1935791 .
[ ] 7. Understand that AVIP includes a mandatory component and a voluntary component,
including (a) who has the right to decline vaccination, (b) the reasons why the military and
civilian leadership of the Armed Forces strongly recommends immunization for military
members under the voluntary program.
[ ] 8. Inform or remind every healthcare worker with responsibilities for administering anthrax
vaccinations (including immunization back-up technicians) of the importance of confirming the
category (mandatory or voluntary) of personnel receiving anthrax vaccination before the actual
injection. This step is intended to prevent medication errors. Healthcare workers will also verify
which dose number the vaccination is in the series (ensuring it is due), inform the recipient when
the next dose will be due, and make sure the vaccination is entered into the immunization
tracking system (AFCITA).
[ ] 9. Assure clinic has sufficient trained personnel with passwords to enter vaccination data into
AFCITA at the time of vaccination or has a plan to train them expeditiously and can assuredly
record immunizations on SF Form 601, DD Form 2766, Deployable Medical Record, PHS Form
731, or similar form.
[ ] 10. Assure AVIP OIC and commander understand reporting requirements. These reports go
to the Military Vaccine Agency, at the direction of the Deputy Secretary of Defense.
[ ] 11. Assure OIC or commander understands the need for officer(s) not directly involved in the
AVIP to perform spot checks of anthrax immunizations operations to assure that tri-folds are
being provided and voluntary vaccine recipients are not receiving anthrax as a mandatory
vaccination.
[ ] 12. Assure clinic and medical logistics personnel have been trained in cold-chain
management procedures, including prompt refrigeration of anthrax vaccines upon receipt. Alarm
systems are used to protect large inventories.
[ ] 13. Assess available inventory of anthrax vaccine (e.g., in medical logistics warehouse).
Arrange for shipment of initial quantity of anthrax vaccine, but clinics may not take physical
possession of the vaccine until Military Vaccine Agency provides email approval of the registry
agreement.
Reassess items on this checklist periodically.
