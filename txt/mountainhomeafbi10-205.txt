This instruction establishes procedures for intra-agency notification and coordination of events
or incidents affecting the 366th Fighter Wing’s (366 FW) assets or personnel. As a minimum,
agencies with 24-hour work centers, or agencies performing tasks directly affecting daily flying
or base support, will develop notification procedures to ensure senior leaders and key agencies
are informed. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in AFMAN 37-123
(to be replaced by AFMAN 33-363) are maintained in accordance with this manual, and are
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required.

     Department (366 CES/CEF); and the 366th Medical Operations Squadron, Emergency
     Services (366 MDOS/SGOME).
        1.1.1. When activated, the following agencies tasked under this instruction, include 366
        FW/SE (Safety), the 366th Operations Support Squadron (366 OSS), the 366th Services
        Squadron (366 SVS), the 366th Aerospace Medical-Dental Squadron, Bioenvironmental
        Engineering Flight (366 ADS/SGGB), 366 CES/CEV (Environmental Flight), and the
        Deployment Control Center.
        1.1.2. Although not specifically mentioned, all base functions and agencies, should be
        aware of the guidance in this instruction and develop notification procedures for unusual
        incidents or events, especially those involving damage to government property or injury
        occurring with in their workplace.
        1.1.3. In addition to incidents/events requiring inter-agency notifications, agencies
        identified in paragraphs 1.1 and 1.1.1 will ensure notification checklists/procedures
        include 366 FW/CP, phone number DSN 728-5800.
     1.2. Agencies identified in paragraph 1.1 will coordinate with 366 FW/CP to review and
     validate checklist notifications. The structure of the review process will consist of either
     electronic mail, a conference of all involved agencies, or both electronic mail and conference.
     POCs from agencies identified in paragraph 1.1 will review all agency checklists and will
     have the authority to make changes to the same. It is the responsibility of the agencies
     identified in paragraph 1.1 to ensure 366 FW/CP has the opportunity to review any and all
     checklists, either annually or when necessitated by procedural changes, that require 366
     FWCP support.
     1.3. Organizations publishing base and wing plans will include 366 FW/CP in their
     distribution (this will be 366 FW/CP’s copy). If Battle Staff requires a copy, coordination
     with a Battle Staff Director will establish their requirement separate from 366 FW/CP.
     1.4. All tasked units must know that 366 FW/CP is the 24-hour agency supporting the 366
     FW/CC (Commander). If an event/incident happens on the base, 366 FW/CP is the tasked
     agency that determines if and when to notify 366 FW/CC.
