Award categories. It establishes responsibilities of the 4 FW/CCEA Special Awards Recognition
Monitor and the 4 FW/CCCE in management and administration of the 4th Fighter Wing
Quarterly and Annual awards recognition program, as well as establishing unit responsibilities
and suspenses for quarterly/annual/functional and special category awards. The publication
modifies the role of the 4th Fighter Wing First Sergeants and realigns responsibilities of those
managing the programs, modifies competition levels, and simplifies nomination process. It also
provides reference to dormitory excellence and room of the quarter awards.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  This revision
incorporates awards which were not included in the last revision and awards which were
transferred to AFPC/DPSIDR. This change also redefines the eligibility for the Air Force
Recognition Ribbon (AFRR) and identifies in Attachment 4 those awards for small team
recognition.

   important and meaningful to the function in which the award will be established.
   Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the individual to ensure the individual
   is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When an award is
   established, the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the
   appropriate commander or vice commander, to                 AFPC/DPSIDR notifying of the
AFI36-2805_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2013                                            11


   establishment of the award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or
   instruction. Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring and maintaining the
   integrity of special trophies and awards programs. All awards named for individuals will be
   established only in accordance with this instruction. The requirements of this instruction are
   mandatory when considering memorial-type awards. List what sources were reviewed to
   perform the background check and that verification has been made that no derogatory
   information was found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their
   honor.

   memorialization are:

   1.4.3. Do not duplicate existing special trophies and awards programs in either name or

   to accompany an award is not considered duplication or dual recognition). Award elements
   will not duplicate elements of existing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601V1,
   Budget Guidance and Procedures, for further guidance regarding funding for award
   elements. Awards must be of nominal value. Awards may not be redeemable for cash,
   merchandise, or services. The cost of awards will be commensurate with the significance of

selected to receive an award, the unit commander attends the presentation ceremony to accept the
award on behalf of the unit.
1.6. Travel for Non-Military Members or Non-Department of the Air Force
Civilians. When individuals who are neither military members nor Department of the Air Force
civilians are selected as recipients of these awards, invitational travel will be authorized so they
may attend the presentation ceremony. Refer to the AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, for
instructions and limitations on travel reimbursements for members and employees and invitation
travel orders for family members and non-Department of the Air Force civilians.
   1.6.1. MAJCOM commanders or vice commanders are authorized to approve spouse travel
   for award recipients assigned to their command. This approval authority may not be further
   delegated. When spouse travel is approved, invitational travel authorization orders will be
   issued and only transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be paid. If there is no
   spouse, the member may elect to invite one family member to attend the award ceremony.

presentation purposes. Do not authorize cash awards.

   (NAF) according to policies regarding the use of NAF.
   1.7.2. Do not use NAFs to supplement awards paid from appropriated funds. When
   appropriated funds are not available or are not authorized, the commander may use NAF to
   buy trophies and awards, if authorized by AFI 34201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds
   (NAFs). Do not use NAFs for awards to civilian personnel who are paid from appropriated
   funds.
   1.7.3. Handle trophies or funds donated to set up a special trophy or award under AFI 51-
   601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force.

awards. Any recipient selected for an eligible award since 12 October 1980, when the AFRR

   1.8.2. A small team is defined as an organized, developed component of members composed
   for a specific purpose (i.e., Tiger Team) or an operation (i.e., bomber crew, security forces
   contingent, etc.) that is not constituted as a USAF organization by a DAF letter. As such, a
   team is not entitled to a lineage and honors history or an emblem. The determining factor in
   eligibility is either individual achievement or achievement of a small team in which each
   team member’s contribution was integral to mission accomplishment, as opposed to
   organizational groups in which the contribution of individuals could vary widely.
   1.8.3. Recipients must be determined by Air Force-wide competition in that functional
   specialty.
   1.8.4. Awards must be earned via a competitive process; winners must be nominated by the
   Air Force in private organization competitions, and won in an Air Force-wide competition.

       trophies or awards.
       1.8.6.2. Members assigned to such cited organizations, units, or activities. Example:
       When a unit or organization is named as the recipient, no one in that cited unit or
       organization is awarded the ribbon.
       1.8.6.3. Nominees and selectees of special trophies and awards programs at MAJCOM,
       FOA, DRU, base, or unit levels.
       1.8.6.4. Nominees or selectees for 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY). The
       appropriate ribbon, the Outstanding Airman of the Year Ribbon, is described in

   4 require approval from AF/A1.
1.9. OPRs of Air Force-level functional special trophies and awards include entitlement
information to the ribbon in instructions pertaining to their functional special trophies and
awards programs. OPRs will send a message each year to their functional counterparts
announcing the recipients of their respective awards. Send a copy of the message to the

   Council for a 12-month period which commences the month of their induction (September)
   as a 12 OAY. For example, the 2009 12 OAY serve from September 2009 through
   September 2010. Therefore, the 2009 MAJCOM and DRU nominees would need
   retainability through 30 September 2010. The annual AFPC/DPSI nomination message
   outlines procedures to follow in obtaining retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU
   nominees who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Skills Management
   Branch, Reenlistments Section (AFPC/DPSOAE), for assistance regarding retainability.
   Failure on the part of the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU to meet retainability requirements on
   their nominee will result in the nominee being withdrawn from the Air Force-level
   competition. If an individual is not selected as a 12 OAY, cancel the extension.

       notification of 12 OAY selection."
