     identify positions being downgraded or deleted, and verification of adjusted effective
     manning percentage as prescribed in Attachment 2.
        1.6.1.1. Unit commanders will forward their recommendation through their servicing
        FSS no earlier than 30 days prior to the requested effective date. This allows sufficient

        1.6.2.1. Promotions are effective the date of the promotion order or AF IMT 2096 and
        will not be retroactively granted. Every caution must be taken to prevent administrative
        errors. If an error/ oversight occurs, the only means available to correct the effective date
        of the promotion is an appeal to the United States Air Force (USAF) Board for
        Correction of Military Records, in accordance with AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board For
        Correction of Military Records.
        1.6.2.2. The date of rank (DOR) of an airman promoted to a grade not previously held is
        the effective date of the promotion.
        1.6.2.3. The DOR of airmen previously demoted as a result of a voluntary change of
        assignment will be adjusted upon promotion to give credit for previous time satisfactorily
        served in that grade. For example, a prior Master Sergeant who voluntarily accepted
ANGI36-2502 17 JUNE 2010                                                                      9


       demotion to Staff Sergeant would have his or her date of rank adjusted to give credit for
       previous time upon promotion again to Technical Sergeant and Master Sergeant.
   1.6.3. Promotion orders authorized by a commander without promotion authority or for a
   member who is later found to be ineligible for the promotion will be revoked only upon
   specific approval by TAG or AAG for Air.
       1.6.3.1. In such cases, determination must be made that the facts clearly and
       unmistakably show the AF IMT 2096 or original promotion order was without basis of
       authority.
       1.6.3.2. The revocation order will be composed as follows:
Paragraph ______, Special Order _____________, this headquarters, dated __________.
Approving the promotion of [(name, Social Security Number (SSN), Unit (of the airman
concerned)] has been determined by the Adjutant General of or AAG for Air (State/Territory) to
be without original basis of authority, is null and void, and is hereby revoked.
1.7. When to Have Promotion Ceremonies.
   1.7.1. Commanders should hold ceremonies appropriate to the grade to which the airman has
   been promoted. Commanders may conduct ceremonies on the last duty day before the
   promotion effective date and inform the member that ceremonies do not affect pay, seniority,
   or entitlements.

                 AIR NATIONAL GUARD PROMOTION PROGRAMS

3.1. Position Vacancy Promotion (PVP).
   3.1.1. For promotions above the grade of SSgt, a position vacancy must exist in the specific
   AFSC in the grade to which promotion is contemplated, and the individual must be the sole
   occupant of that valid manpower position.
   3.1.2. For the purpose of this instruction, a position vacancy is a personnel assignment
   condition in which the total number of valid manpower positions in a unit (by AFSC and
   grade) does not exceed the number of personnel assigned to a unit in the same AFSC and
   grade (to include overgrade assignments in a higher grade in the same AFSC).
3.2. Deserving Airman Promotion Program (DAPP).
   3.2.1. This program was developed to provide a promotion opportunity only for those highly
   qualified and most deserving based on demonstrated potential. This program allows
   members to be promoted to TSgt or MSgt without regard to the UMD authorized grade.
      3.2.1.1. Promotions resulting from this program must be within the manning constraints
      of ANGI 36-2101.
      3.2.1.2. A deserving airman promotion is not a reward for past service, nor is it
      authorized solely due to an airman’s attainment of the minimum eligibility requirements.
      3.2.1.3. The DAPP will not to be used as a substitute for position vacancy promotions.
      As this promotion action will cause an overgrade assignment, commanders must have a
      force management plan in effect to resolve this condition by the member’s ETS or 24
      months, whichever is less.
      3.2.1.4. DAPP promotions must be reserved for a very limited number of truly
      outstanding and deserving members who have demonstrated potential for positions of
      increased responsibility. Due to the limited number of opportunities available under this
      program, this promotion action will require each commander to objectively evaluate and
      rank order all nominees so that only truly deserving airmen are promoted.
   3.2.2. All of the following non-waiverable criteria must be met:
      3.2.2.1. The airman must be the sole occupant of a UMD position with an authorized
      grade identical to their current grade (e.g., a TSgt being considered for deserving airman
      promotion to MSgt must be the sole occupant of the TSgt position, no waivers or
      exceptions). NOTE: The airman must be immediately assigned to the first available
      compatible UMD position (must be equal to or higher to their DAPP grade) that will
      resolve the overgrade status.
      3.2.2.2. The airman must be fully qualified in the Duty Air Force Specialty Code
      (DAFSC) to which assigned.
      3.2.2.3. The promotion must not result in the airman becoming senior in grade to their
      immediate supervisor.

       3.2.2.4. The airman must meet the requirements listed in Table 3.1. in addition to those
       listed in Table 2.1. This also applies to AGR promotions under this program.
       3.2.2.5. Airmen previously involuntarily demoted from the grade of TSgt or MSgt are
       not eligible for promotion under the DAPP.
       3.2.2.6. Airmen previously promoted under this program may not be deserving airmen
       promoted to the same grade.

has a title and a code.
Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).—A combination of numbers and letters used to identify an

Force Management Plan. This plan, at a minimum, must consider such items for each unit
as overall manning, skill level of assigned members versus skill levels required, grade
manning, specialty manning, mandatory separation dates, retirements, good years for
retirement of members, experience of assigned personnel versus that needed, UMD
changes, desired full—time versus drill status mix, desired prior service versus non-prior
service personnel mix, etc. Such analysis must lead to a program for the management of the
personnel force that provides the optimum career progression and promotion opportunity while

component. Satisfactory reserve service is determined by reducing total satisfactory service
on an individual's most recent AF Form 526, by his or her service in the regular
component. (Satisfactory reserve service accrues in 1—year increments only.)

the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia.

A2.2. To determine if the State in this example can promote a member to MSgt, divide the total
number assigned in grades MSgt, SMSgt, and CMSgt by the total authorized in grades MSgt,
SMSgt, and CMSgt. In the above example, 56 divided by 50 equals 112%. Since this is below
the 120% maximum allowable for MSgt, this member may be promoted. To determine if this
State can promote a member to TSgt, we total the authorized and assigned figures for TSgt
through CMSgt and then divide the total assigned (112) by the total authorized (90). The
adjusted effective manning percentage is 124%. Since this is below the 125% maximum
allowable for TSgt, this member may be promoted. These percentages must be recomputed with
each promotion or demotion, each change in assigned strength, and each change in authorized
strength.    Note: IAW ANGI 36-2101, exceeding 100 percent manning in these grades is only
authorized based on a NGB directed unit realignment or reorganization.
