      1.1. Headquarters USAF (AFPTR) letter, Air Force Academy Cadet Awards Program, 16 March
      1960.
      1.2. General Order Number 13, Headquarters USAFA, 15 May 1959.
2. Why USAFA Has a Cadet Awards Program. The USAFA Cadet Awards Program offers
incentives to USAFA cadets for higher achievements in academic, athletic, leadership, military training,
and related activities; it rewards these achievements materially and through public recognition. The
awards foster unit and individual competition and enhance morale.
3. Who Comprises the Cadet Awards Council (CAC) and What It Does:
      3.1. The CAC meets quarterly and consists of the following members appointed by the
      Superintendent, who also designates the Chairperson:
          3.1.1. One voting representative from the Dean of Faculty (HQ USAFA/DF).
          3.1.2. One voting representative from the Commandant of Cadets (HQ USAFA/CW).
          3.1.3. One voting representative from the Directorate of Athletics (HQ USAFA/AD).
          3.1.4. Two voting representatives from the Directorate of Communications (HQ USAFA/CM).

       3.1.5. One representative from the Association of Graduates (AOG).
    3.2. The CAC advises the Superintendent (HQ USAFA/CC) on all aspects of coordination and
    administration of the USAFA Cadet Awards Program. It establishes procedures (subject to the
    Superintendent’s approval) and coordinates guidelines for establishing and administering cadet
    awards. It recommends approval or disapproval on any request for a cadet award to memorialize or
    honor an individual. It designates one member to serve as a voting member of the USAFA
    Memorial Board.
4. How USAFA Establishes Awards:
    4.1. The CAC, through HQ USAFA/CMA, evaluates all proposed cadet awards and forwards to the
    Superintendent a recommendation for approval or disapproval of all organizational or individual
    cadet awards. The CAC evaluates and approves appropriate specialty awards. Activities or
    individuals desiring to establish a cadet award for any purpose must submit a written request to
    HQ USAFA/CMA by 31 December if the presentation is to be made in that academic year.
    4.2. A cadet award may be established to memorialize a deceased person who has made a
    significant contribution to air and space power or, in some other way, contributed to national
    defense. The next-of-kin must concur, and the USAFA Memorial Board must approve all such
    memorializations.
    4.3. A cadet award may also be established to honor or recognize a living person or organization
    who has made a significant contribution or sacrifice to air and space power or, in some other way,
    contributed to national defense.
    4.4. Whenever possible, deceased USAFA graduates receive priority in memorializations to honor
    individuals whose records reflect outstanding accomplishments with special meaning to the Cadet
    Wing.
    4.5. Cadet awards are established through an endowment or for a renewable 1- or 5-year period. All
    awards named in honor of a person or awards memorializing a deceased person are based on 5-year
    renewable terms. USAFA reserves the right to rename awards, as appropriate, after a 5-year period.
    4.6. USAFA makes no cash awards, nor does it give as awards any form of commercial instrument
    such as bonds, shares of stock, drafts, or other similar instruments having present or future monetary
    value.
5. Organizational Awards and Presentation. These awards recognize a cadet squadron or group for
outstanding unit achievement in academics, military training, athletics, extracurricular endeavors, or a
combination thereof. Award winners are announced by the Superintendent each year by the second
Wednesday in May (usually during a noon meal formation). The awards consist of trophies, plaques,
and guidon streamers. Organizational awards are presented during the Organizational Awards Parade or
during the Individual Awards Ceremony during graduation week and remain in USAFA custody for
appropriate display. See Attachment 1 for specific titles and selection criteria.
6. Individual Awards and Presentations. These awards recognize individuals who achieve excellence
in academics, military training, or athletics. The award consists of a bronze casting of the eagle and
fledglings sculpture with a nameplate affixed to the base. In the case of Tapping Ceremonies, a
nameplate is affixed to an honor plaque. A cadet may receive more than one award but will receive only
one sculpture with appropriate identification plates added to its base. Individual awards are presented
during the Individual Awards Ceremony or Tapping Ceremonies during graduation week. See
Attachment 2 for specific categories, titles, and selection criteria.
USAFAI36-2809 1 APRIL 2009                                                                              5


7. Specialty Awards and Presentation. These awards recognize cadets who have distinguished
themselves by outstanding performance and achievement in individual academic disciplines or
specialized areas of interest. Specialty Awards are established for specific purposes and are presented at
various times during the year. These awards are under the general jurisdiction of the CAC with the
responsible departments or activities providing specific administration. Specialty Awards are limited to
a maximum monetary value of $150 each and normally consist of a plaque, reference books, or some
other form of appropriate recognition. See Attachment 3 for titles, selection criteria, and presentation
details.
