       If one of the stickers has come loose or is missing, ensure the remaining sticker is intact
       and that the panel does not appear to have been removed. Additionally, aircrews should
       physically tap on the panel to ensure there is no FOD or loose items inside. If an
       abnormal noise is detected, both stickers are missing, or it appears the panel has been
       removed, abort the aircraft, inform maintenance and annotate the discrepancy in the Form
       781.

                                    SEGUIN OPERATIONS

A15.1. Seguin Pattern Operations. These procedures apply when the RSU (CHARLIE
BROWN) is in control of the Seguin pattern. In addition to the procedures outlined in 12FTWI
13-204, aircrews will adhere to the following:
A15.2. Reduced Runway Separation (RRS) criteria are identical to those at JBSA-Randolph.
A15.3. When departing to Seguin on a RANSEG or a SEGRAN profile, a transponder code will
be assigned by Air Traffic Control. Minimum weather required for Seguin VFR departures is
4000 ’ MSL (2700’ AGL) and 3 miles visibility (not for use in IMC). Aircrews are responsible
for terrain/obstacle avoidance.
A15.4. Restricted pattern operations. Maximum number of aircraft in the pattern is eight. All
aircraft will enter Charlie Brown’s Pattern through Belmont (DHK 085030) via straight-in.
Overhead patterns are authorized once established in the pattern.
     A15.4.1. Runway 31. Due to a conflict with Belmont entries, pattern straight-ins are not
     allowed during restricted pattern operations.
A15.5. If weather at KRND does not support RANSEG/SEGRAN departures, aircrew may file
IFRSEQ38/IFRSEQOB stereos, as applicable, in an attempt to enter the Seguin VFR pattern at
VFR Entry (SEQ unrestricted status) or BELMONT (SEQ restricted status).             If on
IFRSEQ38/IFRSEQOB stereo and unable to obtain VMC by VFR Entry/BELMONT, notify
SAT Approach and make request.
A15.6. Opposite Direction Flow at Seguin. Refer to Figures A15.6 and A15.7 for opposite
direction procedures. The RSU Controller will notify the 560 FTS operations supervisor and
Randolph (East) SOF if opposite direction flow is required at Seguin. The SOF will coordinate
with the San Antonio shift supervisor prior to implementing these procedures.
A15.7. Position Reports. If unable to make required position calls at designated reporting
points, report actual position when able, e.g., “Call Sign, 3-miles, gear down.”
A15.8. Pattern Breakout. Attain breakout altitude before crossing any pattern ground track. Do
not breakout when established in the final turn, or inside 4 NM on a straight-in (go around
instead; offset to the east from the final turn, west from a straight-in).
     A15.8.1. Ground tracks and climb/descent points for breakouts/re-entries are depicted in the
     IFG. When breaking out, report “Call Sign, location, breaking out.” Use caution for other
     breakout traffic, pattern straight-ins, and final turn traffic. When executing a low breakout,
     maneuver to cross the outside downwind groundtrack prior to the straight-in descent point at
     1500’ MSL. Once clear of outside downwind, but prior to reaching VFR entry, climb to
     2000’ MSL. Upon reaching VFR entry, report “Call Sign, VFR ENTRY.”
A15.9. RSU Power/Radio Failure. Aircrews will not descend below 1500’ MSL if not in
contact with the RSU. The RSU Controller will flash a red light gun repeatedly to indicate radio
failure (if power is available). Aircrew will climb to/maintain 2,000’ MSL and depart via
COST/CIBOLO/ZUEHL procedure, or request an IFR pick-up from SAT Approach if unable to
maintain VMC.

A15.10. Aircraft NORDO at Seguin. If NORDO at Seguin rock wings on initial, carry straight
through, and depart to JBSA-Randolph. The Seguin Controller will notify the SOF who will
relay the information to TRACON and Tower.
