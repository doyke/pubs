                                                  Chapter 1

                                       GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. This Air Force Instruction (AFI) provides policy for operating the C-17 aircraft. It is an original
     source document for many areas but, for efficacy, restates information found in aircraft flight manu-
     als, flight information publications (FLIP), and other Air Force directives. This manual is used in con-
     cert with AFTTP 3-3.35A, C-17 Combat Aircraft Fundamentals (U). When guidance in this AFI
     conflicts with another basic/source document, that document takes precedence. For matters where this
     AFI is the source document, waiver authority is in accordance with (IAW) paragraph 1.4. For matters
     where this AFI repeats information in another document, follow waiver authority outlined in the
     basic/source document.
     1.1.2. Unit commanders and agency directors involved with or supporting C-17 operations shall
     make current copies of this AFI available to appropriate personnel. Transportation and Base Opera-
     tions passenger manifesting agencies will maintain a current copy of this AFI.

1.2. Applicability. This AFI applies to aircrew members, support personnel, and managers involved with
employing C-17 aircraft.

1.3. Key Words Explained.
     1.3.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. "Should" indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
     1.3.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. “NOTE” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to emphasize.
     1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in damage to
     equipment if not carefully followed.
     1.3.6. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in personal
     injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.

1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from policies in this AFI except when the situation
demands immediate action to ensure safety. The pilot in command (PIC) is vested with ultimate mission
authority and responsible for each course-of-action they choose to take.
     1.4.1. Deviations. The PIC shall report deviations or exceptions taken without a waiver through com-
     mand channels to their Chief, Major Command (MAJCOM) Stan/Eval who in turn shall notify Chief,
     AMC Stan/Eval (lead command) as appropriate for follow-on action.
     1.4.2. Waivers. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is the
     MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority. PICs can obtain waivers to deviate from provi-
     sions in this AFI via MAJCOM Stan/Eval.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              17


       1.4.2.1. Permanent waivers affect theater unique circumstances and are enduring in nature. List
       MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the MAJCOM supplement (see paragraph
       1.5.)
       1.4.2.2. Long-term waivers affect multiple aircraft/multiple missions but are not permanent in
       nature (expire at a specific date/time). MAJCOM Stan/Eval shall send HQ AMC Stan/Eval (lead
       command) copies of MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved long-term waivers.
       1.4.2.3. Short-notice waivers are for specific missions in execution. PICs shall use the Waiver
       Protocol procedure in Chapter 4 to secure MAJCOM/A3/DO approval for short-notice waivers.
       1.4.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The 60th Operations Group Commander (60 OG/CC) is the waiver
       authority for AFI 11-2C-17V3, Travis AFB Supp 1. Submit changes to this supplement via AF
       Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 60th Operations Group Aircrew Stan-
       dardization/Evaluation Division (60 OG/OGV).
       1.4.2.5. (Added-TRAVIS) It is imperative that crews on operational missions relay all informa-
       tion of unusual occurrences, aircraft damage, or waiver requests though their squadron DO and/or
       Stan/Eval offices. (60 OG) The pilot in command (PIC) shall consult with home station C-17 Stan/
       Eval prior to calling AMC to request a waiver. Exception: no call home is required if AMC has
       stationed a specific waiver authority in theater or at the stage location to expedite operations. 60
       OG/OGV personnel are on call 24/7 and can be contacted through squadron Stan/Eval or Travis
       Command Post. Although the PIC is responsible for requesting any waiver, it is important (and
       requested by AMC) that the crewmember with the most knowledge of the system in question be
       available during the waiver request to pass on pertinent information. Ensure any waiver number is
       documented in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document.

1.5. Supplemental Procedures. This AFI is a basic directive. Each user MAJCOM or operational the-
ater may supplement this AFI according to AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures, and AFI 33-360,
Volume 1, Publications Management Program. Stipulate unique MAJCOM procedures (shall not be less
restrictive than this basic document) and publish MAJCOM A3/DO-approved permanent waivers in the
MAJCOM supplement.
   1.5.1. Combined Command Operations. Plan and conduct all operations that include forces from
   multiple MAJCOMs using provisions in this AFI. Do not assume or expect aircrews to perform MAJ-
   COM theater unique procedures without owning MAJCOM/A3/DO approval and advance training.
   1.5.2. Coordination Process. Forward MAJCOM approved supplements (attach AF IMT 673,
   Request To Issue Publication) to HQ AMC/A37V, 402 Scott Dr., Unit 3A7, Scott AFB IL,
   62225-5302. Chief, AMC Stan/Eval shall facilitate the HQ AMC/A3 and HQ AFFSA/XOF approval
   process.

1.6. Local Supplement Coordination Process. Operations Group commanders (OG/CCs) shall define
local supplements to this Instruction. OG/CCs shall obtain Numbered Air Force (NAF) and MAJCOM/
A3/DO approval prior to releasing their supplement. Send an electronic copy of the approved version to
HQ AMC/A37V, NAF/DO (if applicable) MAJCOM/A3/DO.

                                                Chapter 2

                                     COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. General. The Mobility Air Forces (MAF) command and control (C2) network consists of the fol-
lowing C2 centers: 18th Air Force Tanker Airlift Control Center (18 AF TACC) Global Cell, Pacific Air
Forces (PACAF) or United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Air Mobility Operation Control Centers
(AMOCCs), Air National Guard (ANG) Readiness Center, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Com-
mand Center, theater Air Operations and Space Centers (AOCs), Air Mobility Division (AMD), Joint
Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Unit Command Posts, Air Mobility Control Centers
(AMCCs), Contingency Response Groups (CRG), and Special Tactics Teams (STTs). C2 centers are
action agents for the MAF commander with execution authority (operational control) over mobility mis-
sions/forces.

2.2. Execution Authority. Headquarters commanders with command authority over MAF resources
hold execution authority for directed missions. Commanders with execution authority formulate plans,
allocate assets, and approve missions through a local command post or C2 element. OG/CCs serve as exe-
cution authority for local training missions. The PIC will execute missions operating outside normal com-
munication channels (use last known mission orders or best course of action).
   2.2.1. Off-Station Trainer (OST). Refer to AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for procedures
   and requirements governing OSTs
       2.2.1.1. AFRC Current Operations (AFRC/DOOM) is approval authority for AFRC Unit
       Equipped (UE) OSTs.

2.3. Pilot in Command (PIC) Responsibility and Authority. SQ/CCs shall designate an aircraft com-
mander (AC), instructor pilot (IP), or evaluator pilot (EP) as the PIC for all flights on a flight authoriza-
tion form, IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and applicable supplements. An unqualified or
non-mission ready pilot may not be designated as PIC. PICs are:
   2.3.1. In command of all persons aboard the aircraft.
   2.3.2. Vested with authority to accomplish the assigned mission. The PIC shall only fly events autho-
   rized in the mission tasking unless in the PIC’s judgment an emergency condition demands otherwise.
   Only fly unscheduled training events (for example, air refueling (A/R) or transition training) after
   obtaining approval of the execution authority.
   2.3.3. The final mission authority and will make decisions not assigned to higher authority.
   2.3.4. The final authority for requesting or accepting aircrew or mission waivers.
   2.3.5. Responsible for relaying mission status (at least daily) to C2 agents.
   2.3.6. Responsible for interaction between aircrew members and mission support personnel and will
   establish a point-of-contact (POC) with the appropriate C2 agent prior to entering crew rest. Local C2
   agents are responsible for coordinating mission support requirements on the PIC’s behalf.
   2.3.7. Responsible for the welfare of aircrew members, Mission Essential Ground Personnel
   (MEGP), passengers, and the safe accomplishment of the mission.
20                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


2.4. Mission Clearance Decision. The execution authority and PIC shall make the mission clearance
decision. In all cases, final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC. If a PIC
elects to delay a mission, that mission will not depart until the conditions that generated the decision to
delay improve or are resolved. Further, no execution authority may task another PIC to take the same mis-
sion under the same conditions.
     2.4.1. Only re-route or divert a mission when authorized by the execution authority, to resolve an
     emergency, or if required by en route or terminal weather conditions.
     2.4.2. The agent that directed the re-route or divert shall ensure the aircraft is capable of executing
     departure, en route, and destination arrival procedures.
     2.4.3. The PIC will notify the appropriate C2 agent of any aircraft or aircrew limitation that may pre-
     clude re-route or divert.
     2.4.4. When a C2 agent directs a PIC to fly to an alternate airfield, the agent will ensure existing and
     forecast weather for the alternate, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and airfield information from the
     Global Decision Support System (GDSS)/GDSS2)/Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report
     (ASRR) is suitable. If the alternate becomes unsuitable while en route, the PIC will coordinate with
     the C2 agent for other suitable alternates. The PIC is final authority for accepting a suitable alternate.
     A C2 agent will alert customs and all appropriate ground service agencies to prepare for arrival.

2.5. Operational C2 Reporting.
     2.5.1. Stations With MAF C2 Agency. Local MAF C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival, depar-
     ture, and advisory messages) in the MAF C2 system.
     2.5.2. Stations without MAF C2. Transmit mission data to the controlling C2 agency by any means
     available (i.e., DSN, HF, AERO-I, Airline Operational Control (AOC)). HF Radio is the primary
     method of communication for routine mission information. For critical C2 communications, i.e. air-
     craft waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method.
     2.5.3. En route Reporting.
        2.5.3.1. Make the following en route calls to TACC:
            2.5.3.1.1. Airborne call when departing from a location without an AMC presence.
            2.5.3.1.2. Maintenance call whenever aircraft alpha status changes to code 3.
            2.5.3.1.3. On aeromedical evacuation missions, no later than 1 hour prior to landing, to update
            arrival time.
        2.5.3.2. CONUS. Periodic “ops normal” calls/transmissions are not required; however, the con-
        trolling C2 agency may increase reporting requirements.
        2.5.3.3. OCONUS. MAJCOM C2 agencies will specify increased reporting procedures through a
        communications plan in the OPLAN, OPORD, FRAG, Mission Directive, or FLIP. Aircrews will
        maintain listening watch in accordance with the communications plan within aircraft equipment
        capabilities (e.g. HF-Automatic Link Establishment (HF-ALE), AOC).
     2.5.4. Aircraft Status/Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting. PICs shall report aircraft system malfunc-
     tions that traditionally require extensive trouble shooting as soon as feasible. Contact arrival C2
     agency if available, otherwise contact MAJCOM C2 for relay.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                           21


  2.5.5. Not Used.
  2.5.6. “Thirty Minute” Out Call. Transmit a UHF or VHF arrival advisory to the destination C2
  agency approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. Provide Estimated Time in Blocks (ETB).
  2.5.7. Integrated Flight Management (IFM) Sorties. On IFM sorties the flight managers (FM) will be
  the C2 conduit for aircrews. They will provide aircrews with flight planning, flight following, flight
  support and act as a resource to aircrews as they perform their missions. For critical C2 communica-
  tions, voice communications (HF, DSN, etc.) are the primary method.
     2.5.7.1. Position Reporting on IFM Missions. IFM missions transiting oceanic flight information
     regions (FIRs) need to add the phrase “Pass to Hilda” to ATC position reports. Crews may also
     use the ARINC frequencies listed in the aircrew flimsy for C2 phone patch requirements. Use
     ARINC phone patch only after exhausting normal communication methods. Airline Operational
     Control (AOC) will be the primary means of routine communications between FMs and aircrew,
     on AOC equipped aircraft. While using AOC, crews will not have to request ATC pass position
     reports via "Pass to Hilda" procedures.
  2.5.8. High Frequency (HF) Communications. HF is the primary means of voice access to the world-
  wide C2 network. When SELCAL is primary ATC, use AERO-I and/or AOC to monitor C2, in lieu of
  ALE. Ensure the other HF radio is not in ALE mode to preclude the automatic link (ALE) feature
  from overriding ATC messages.
  2.5.9. Airline Operational Control (AOC). AOC is not secure means of communication. Crews will
  exercise sound information assurance techniques, such as confirming major mission changes directed
  by TACC via AOC. Do not pass classified information via AOC.
  2.5.10. The AERO-I satellite voice system is provided as an alternative means of communication
  between the aircraft and a number of C2 agencies and ATC. The system will be used only for
  non-secure in-flight communications between aircrews and C2 organizations and between aircrews
  and oceanic air traffic controllers. Due to the high cost of using the system, aircrews should attempt
  communications by other means (HF, UHF, ALE, etc.) for C2 communications before using the
  AERO-I system. AERO-I voice is a backup for the Controller Pilot Data Link Communications
  (CPDLC), Airline Operational Control (AOC) and C2 communications. Certain C2 and ATC agen-
  cies have the capability to call the aircraft using the AERO-I. AERO-I is for official use only.
     2.5.10.1. The AERO-I communications software loaded on the aircraft automatically logs onto a
     specific Ground Earth Station (GES), based on aircraft location, and which GES is under contract
     to provide service. Manually selecting a different GES will result in a connection through a
     non-contract carrier, resulting in a much higher cost. Aircrews will only manually select a differ-
     ent GES when all other avenues of communication have failed, and when essential for mission
     completion.
  2.5.11. DV Messages. Airborne unclassified messages originated by DV passengers may be transmit-
  ted at the discretion of the PIC.
  2.5.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Communication with 60 AMW Command Post.
     2.5.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) For each aircraft departure, crews will follow the sequence of events
     published in the 60/349 AMW Wing Operations Plan (WOP). Report “block-out” and “airborne”
     to Command Post as well as any deviations (with explanation) in the launch sequence.

        2.5.12.2. (Added-TRAVIS) At least one crew member should monitor command post while
        within range of Travis AFB. Exception: Command Post frequency may be turned down during
        critical phases of flight. Crews should utilize crewmembers not actively controlling flight controls
        to monitor whenever available.

2.6. Mission Commander (MC).
     2.6.1. Unit commanders shall designate an MC when more than two aircraft are assembled to perform
     missions away from home station. Unit commanders should consider appointing a MC for special,
     high-visibility missions (i.e. CAPSTONE, DV2, etc.). The MC has overall responsibility and is the
     final authority for decisions that impact mission execution. The MC shall properly coordinate mission
     details. For flight-managed sorties, MC shall coordinate any special mission planning requirements
     with the IFM mission allocator not later than 24 hours prior to mission execution.
        2.6.1.1. For MAJCOM-tasked missions, MAJCOM/A3/DO will coordinate and designate a lead
        planning agency when more than one unit is involved in an A/R, airdrop, or tactical airland oper-
        ation. For theater airlift missions with more than one airlift unit involved, the theater AOC shall
        designate a central planning agency responsible for coordinating the entire mission with all
        involved agencies. The OG/CC for the lead planning agency will designate an MC. The MC will
        be a rated (normally field grade) officer qualified in the type mission.
        2.6.1.2. The MC will ensure all collocated aircrew members attend required briefings.
        2.6.1.3. When non-collocated, the MC (in conjunction with the lead planning agency) will ensure
        non-collocated aircrew members receive applicable information, to include rendezvous, forma-
        tion, abort, and recovery procedures. The MC will provide controlling agency and all non-collo-
        cated PICs anticipated delays or mission changes.
        2.6.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) MCs will also be designated when required by Form 59, Operation
        Order (OPORD), or squadron decision. The MC should be designated on the flight crew orders
        when practical.
        2.6.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The PIC of local unilateral training missions will normally be the
        MC. It is the responsibility of the mission commander to determine training priorities.
        2.6.1.6. (Added-TRAVIS) MCs will ensure adequate time is provided for mission planning to
        include route study, threat analysis, weather factors, and mission requirements. The designated
        MC/squadron supervisor will attend all formal briefings.

2.9. Close Watch Missions. Close Watch missions (for example, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR);
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), PHOENIX BANNERs) receive special C2 attention. PICs will promptly
notify appropriate C2 agency of delays, aborts, or other events that affect on-time departure. Provide the
C2 agent the estimated time in commission (ETIC), planned ETD, and estimated time of arrival (ETA)
within 10 minutes of the event or as soon as safety allows.

2.10. Law Enforcement Support. It is the policy of the Department of Defense (DOD) to cooperate
with civilian law enforcement officials to the maximum extent practicable. AFI 10-801, Assistance to
Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies, provides the policies and procedures service members must follow
when supporting federal, state, and local civilian law enforcement agencies. Coordinate all civilian law
enforcement authorities’ requests for assistance through appropriate C2 channels.

2.11. En route Maintenance Support. 18 AF TACC/XOCL will support all mobility aircraft requests
for parts and/or maintenance assistance regardless of type of mission or component. Refer to paragraph
2.8. for 18 AF TACC telephone numbers.
   2.11.1. (Added-TRAVIS) TACC/XOCL has overall responsibility for the recovery of not mission
   capable (NMC) aircraft from the time of notification until the aircraft is Fully Mission Capable (FMC)
   or Partially Mission Capable (PMC). Therefore, aircrews must keep XOCL informed on all matters
   regarding maintenance status, recovery options, and actions. Ensure that XOCL has the opportunity to
   aid in resolving the problem.
   2.11.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Technical Assistance for any issue can be obtained through on-call Stan/
   Eval personnel. Contact Travis Command Post for their assistance.
2.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Flight Authorizations.
   2.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Once the flight authorization is completed and authenticated, any authen-
   ticating official may make changes. The authenticating official authorizing the change must initial all
   changes. Exception: When time and circumstances dictate, the designated PIC may make
   short-notice changes to a flight authorization. (60 OG) For changes on local missions, 60 OG PICs
   will receive verbal approval from the squadron DO or other orders authenticating official. (349 OG)
   The PIC will update the SQ/DO as soon as practical on flight order additions/changes.
   2.12.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The following flight orders procedures will be followed by squadrons and
   departing aircrews:

        2.12.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) For all missions departing Travis, squadrons will provide the 60
        AMW/CP with a copy of their aircrew flight orders. Orders can be faxed to 60 AMW/CP.
2.13. (Added-TRAVIS) Changes or Cancellations.
     2.13.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Changes. Coordinate with Command Post for itinerary changes, early
     departure, and flight time extension for any training flight or mission.
     2.13.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Cancellations.
        2.13.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) (60 OG) Prior to contacting Travis Command Post, PICs should
        contact the SQ/DO to discuss the reasons for cancellation. Once verbal approval is received from
        SQ/DO, the PIC will contact Travis Command Post to obtain OG/CC approval.
        2.13.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) (349 OG) The PIC is the approval authority to cancel a local training
        sortie.
        2.13.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If canceling an off-station training reservation (e.g., McChord AFB
        or Moses Lake block time), specifically request Command Post to relay the information to the
        applicable agencies.
2.14. (Added-TRAVIS) Incident Reporting. In addition to notifying command and control, crews
should report any unusual circumstances to home station leadership (on-call 24 hours a day through
Travis Command Post). Such incidences may include, but are not limited to, flare launches, laser activity,
damage to aircraft or airport, significant crew issues, any reportable incident (e.g., Safety, Intel, police,
etc.), and media exposure. When operating out of a deployed location with deployed leadership, crews
should report MISREP items (e.g., flare launches) to the deployed leadership. When in doubt, keep home
station leadership informed.

                                                Chapter 3

                           AIRCREW COMPLEMENT/MANAGEMENT

3.1. General. This chapter provides guiding principles to form/manage mobility aircrews. Commanders
at all levels shall follow this policy to form aircrews and to develop aircrew-related work/rest schedules
that optimize efficiency of mobility forces engaged in worldwide operations.

3.2. Aircrew Complement. SQ/CCs shall form aircrews based on fragmentation order/mission direc-
tive, Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP) requirements, aircrew member qualifications,
and other constraints to safely accomplish the mission tasking (See Table 3.1. below). SQ/CCs shall base
the aircrew complement for specialized missions on guiding principles in chapters covering those mis-
sions.
   3.2.1. The minimum aircrew member complement for local flights is an aircraft commander, pilot/
   copilot, and loadmaster. When a mission requires more than one aircrew member at a position, the
   SQ/CC will determine whether an instructor and student meet mission requirements.
   3.2.2. SQ/CCs shall form augmented aircrews for missions planned to take longer than a basic FDP.
   Augmenting aircrew members must be current, qualified, and Mission Ready (MR) IAW AFI
   11-2C-17, Vol 1. SQ/CC shall augment an aircrew for the full Flight Duty Period (FDP). The MAJ-
   COM/A3/DO may augment aircrews while the mission is underway.
   3.2.3. NVG Aircrew Compliment. Normally, an NVG crew will consist of an NVG qualified crew-
   member in each of the primary crew positions. However, the pilots may use NVGs even if the load-
   master(s) on the crew is not NVG qualified.

Table 3.1. Aircrew Complement.

                 Aircraft Commander 1 (1,8)        1 (3,8)        *
                 Pilot/Copilot          1          2 (2)          *
                 Loadmaster             1 (4,5,7) 2 (4,6,7)       *


NOTES:
     1. Air refueling and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 14 hours of the flight
        duty period.
       2. One must be first pilot qualified. Pilots who have graduated from the ACIQ course may aug-
          ment the crew in lieu of a first pilot. Pilots who have graduated from the PIQ course, (when
          approved by the Sq/CC) may act as the augmenting crewmember.
       3. All A/R and tactical events will be accomplished within the first 18 hours of the flight duty
          period. Two aircraft commanders are required if A/R is accomplished after 14 hours flight
26                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


            duty period. Intent is to manage rest cycles to have one AC accomplish any A/R prior to the
            14-hour point, and the second AC accomplishes the A/R past the 14 hour point. The second
            aircraft commander fulfills the requirement for an additional pilot/copilot. NOTE: A graduate
            of C-17 ACIQ, ACAL, or PCO, who has not yet been certified as an AC may serve as the aug-
            menting AC, and perform the A/R as long as they are current and qualified.
        4. Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another C-17 qualified crewmember are required if
           more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried. Both crewmembers must remain in the
           cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and landings.
        5. One loadmaster and another qualified crewmember/physiological technician are required in
           the cargo compartment on any mission segment where cabin altitude exceeds 13,000 feet
           MSL.
        6. For augmented airdrop missions, one loadmaster must be airdrop qualified; the other loadmas-
           ter may be airland qualified.
        7. Two loadmasters are required for dual-row airdrop missions. Both loadmasters shall be quali-
           fied in the specific mission.
        8. For formation airdrop, the following lead crew requirements apply.
            a. Single-element formations. When the element consists of three aircraft, a lead crew is
               required in the formation (any position). Two ship elements do not require a lead qualified
               crew.
            b. Multiple-element formations. A lead qualified crew is required in the lead, deputy lead
               and element lead positions. If deputy lead or an element lead abort after station time, any
               crew can assume their position with the concurrence of the mission commander. Any crew
               can fly the last ship of a formation even if it is an element lead position.

3.3. Aircrew Member Qualification. An aircrew member will be qualified or in qualification training to
perform duties as a primary aircrew member.
     3.3.1. Senior leaders who complete a Senior Staff Qualification course (restricted AF IMT 8) or ori-
     entation for a Senior Staff Familiarization flight may occupy a primary crew position when under
     direct instructor supervision.
     3.3.2. Pilots who complete a Senior Staff Course will log “FP” for Flight Authorization Duty Code on
     the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.
     3.3.3. Pilots who complete a Senior Staff Familiarization flight will log “OP” for Flight Authoriza-
     tion Duty Code on the AFTO IMT 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.

3.4. Pilots. An instructor pilot (IP) must supervise non-current or unqualified pilots regaining currency or
qualification (direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight).
     3.4.1. SQ/CCs shall designate an AC as Pilot in Command (PIC) and form aircrews with a sufficient
     number of pilots to accomplish the mission. The PIC shall be qualified to perform duties as a primary
     aircrew member.
     3.4.2. SQ/CCs will designate those additional pilots authorized to perform PIC duties. The PIC shall
     brief the aircrew on the plan to transfer PIC duties.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            27


   3.4.3. Missions With Passengers. Two current and qualified pilots (AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification for position) will occupy pilot seats with passengers on board.
       3.4.3.1. A non-current but qualified pilot may fly with passengers on board if under direct IP
       supervision.

3.5. Not Used.

3.6. Loadmasters. A non-current or unqualified loadmaster may serve as a primary aircrew member on
any mission when supervised by a qualified instructor or flight examiner (direct supervision for critical
phases of flight).

3.7. Aircrew Management. SQ/CCs and en route C2 agents shall ensure work/rest cycles permit an air-
crew adequate time to safely accomplish mission duties and personal time for rest.
   3.7.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). FDP is the period of time starting at mission report time and ending
   immediately after the aircrew completes the final engine shutdown of the day. SQ/CCs shall form air-
   crews based on worst-case FDP in the mission directive. Once en route, the mission directive or C2
   agent will inform the PIC of expected FDP at show time. Reduce FDP when the autopilot fails after
   departure IAW information below. PICs shall work with C2 agents to determine the best course of
   action to minimize mission impact (may require divert for maintenance). In this case, the PIC will
   contact C2 agencies, coordinate intentions, and comply with the FDP limitations.
       3.7.1.1. Basic Crew FDP. The maximum FDP for a basic aircrew is 16+00 hours (12+00 hours
       when the autopilot is inoperative). Once an aircrew begins a basic FDP, only MAJCOM/A3/DO
       may extend to augmented day regardless of aircrew composition (MAJCOM/A3/DO shall aug-
       ment basic crew to extend FDP).
           3.7.1.1.1. When extended en route ground times, non-optimum routing/winds, weather delays
           or other extenuating circumstances will increase a basic to an augmented FDP, a PIC with an
           augmented crew may accept an augmented FDP as long as:
              3.7.1.1.1.1. The C2 agent or PIC discovers the extenuating circumstances before the first
              takeoff of the day.
              3.7.1.1.1.2. The PIC verifies all augmenting aircrew members can get adequate rest en
              route.
           3.7.1.1.2. A PIC with a basic crew may seek MAJCOM/A3/DO (mission execution authority)
           approval to extend the FDP as much as 2 hours to complete a scheduled mission. Only use this
           provision to recover from unscheduled/unplanned en route delays. C2 agents shall not ask a
           PIC to exercise this option.
       3.7.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP. Maximum FDP for an augmented aircrew is 24+00 hours (16+00
       hours when the autopilot is inoperative). SQ/CC need only augment the pilot portion of the air-
       crew when the autopilot is inoperative.
           3.7.1.2.1. SQ/CC will augment an aircrew when FDP exceeds 16+00 hours and the mission
           profile will allow augmenting aircrew members adequate time to rest en route. As a minimum,
           the mission profile must provide the following:
28                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


                3.7.1.2.1.1. No more than 3 intermediate stops are authorized after 14+00 hours of FDP
                (each A/R shall count as an intermediate stop).
                3.7.1.2.1.2. Mission profile shall include at least one 6+00 hour leg or two 4+00 hour legs.
                3.7.1.2.1.3. The PIC shall validate planned leg times based on actual conditions, and the
                PIC may swap an extended ground time (4+00 hours) for a mission leg when conditions
                afford aircrew members a chance for rest.
        3.7.1.3. Maximum FDP for nuclear airlift missions IAW AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations
        (FOUO).
        3.7.1.4. Flight examiners administering evaluations will not exceed an augmented FDP.
        3.7.1.5. Training FDP.
            3.7.1.5.1. Maximum FDP for training, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/
            ATT), Functional Check Flight (FCF) and Acceptance Check Flight (ACFs) missions is
            16+00 hours (12+00 hours when the autopilot is inoperative). Conduct the mission as follows:
            3.7.1.5.2. Complete all mission-related events (i.e., FCF/ACF checks, transition events, A/R
            or tactical events) during the first 12+00 hours of the FDP.
                3.7.1.5.2.1. ANG and AFRC crews may perform mission-related events on local training
                missions provided their time from start of duty does not exceed 16 hours and actual flight
                duty does not exceed 12 hours.
                    3.7.1.5.2.1.1. Crew duty time (CDT) and FDP include both military duty and civilian
                    work. CDT and FDP begin when an individual reports for their first duty period (mili-
                    tary or civilian).
            3.7.1.5.3. Crews may fly/deposition to home station or a deployed staging base following
            training (do not exceed 12+00 hours when the autopilot is inoperative).
     3.7.2. Crew Duty Time (CDT). CDT is that period of time an aircrew may perform combined ground/
     flight duties. Plan the mission so aircrew members may complete post-mission duties within maxi-
     mum CDT. An aircrew member may perform mission-related duties for other missions when
     approved by member’s home station SQ/CC or equivalent. Maximum CDT for a basic aircrew is
     18+00 hours and 24+45 hours for an augmented aircrew.
     3.7.3. Except as outlined below, CDT/FDP begins 1+00 hour after aircrew alert notification. SQ/CC
     or equivalent may task aircrew members to perform other duties before they begin flight-related duties
     or MAJCOM/A3/DO may authorize a C2 agent to alert an aircrew member early: begin CDT/FDP
     when the first aircrew member reports for those duties.
        3.7.3.1. For Self-alerts, the PIC shall coordinate early individual/crew mission report times with
        C2 agents. Begin CDT/FDP when the first aircrew member reports for duty.
        3.7.3.2. CDT/FDP Extensions. See AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules.
     3.7.4. Deadhead Time. MAF aircrew members may deadhead for the purpose of positioning or
     de-positioning to perform a mobility mission or mission support function. Crewmembers may dead-
     head for a maximum of 24 hours. OG/CC or equivalent may approve crewmembers to deadhead in
     excess of 24 hours.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                29


       3.7.4.1. Current/qualified aircrew members may perform primary aircrew duties after flying in
       deadhead status provided they do not exceed a basic FDP (FDP starts at report time for deadhead
       flight).
       3.7.4.2. Aircrew members may deadhead after performing primary crew duties, for a maximum
       of 24 hours from the time the crewmember’s FDP began.
   3.7.5. Aircrew Member Support of Aircraft Generation Activities (Pre-flight, cargo up-/off-load,
   start, and taxi aircraft). Crew rest is required IAW AFI 11-202V3, chapter 9. The duty day begins
   when the aircrew member reports for official duties.

3.8. Scheduling Restrictions. In accordance with chapter 9 of AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules . In
addition, SQ/CCs shall not schedule an aircrew member to fly, nor will an aircrew member perform air-
crew duties in violation of the following. (PICs shall not violate any of the following restrictions with an
early takeoff.)
   3.8.1. When the flight will exceed maximum flying time limitations of AFI 11-202V3.
   3.8.2. Within 12 hours of consuming alcoholic beverages (based on scheduled takeoff, or ALFA
   standby force legal for alert time, or earliest show time from BRAVO alert) or while under the influ-
   ence of alcohol.
   3.8.3. When using nasal sprays to treat symptoms of head congestion existing before flight. An air-
   crew member may use oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays as “get-me-downs” following an
   unexpected ear or sinus block during flight.

3.9. Counter-Fatigue Management Program.
   3.9.1. Aircrew may use medications with prior approval (on a voluntary basis following ground test-
   ing) that enhance natural rest during off-cycle crew rest periods. This section provides AMC/A3 guid-
   ance for the use of no-go pills (prescription medications) that help aircrew initiate and maintain restful
   sleep during off-cycle (desynchronosis) crew rest periods. Fliers shall not use no-go pills in flight.
   3.9.2. It is USAF policy that aircrew shall never use no-go pills as a first choice counter-fatigue man-
   agement tool.
   3.9.3. Responsibility for counter-fatigue management of aircrew medicinal products rests with the
   home station Flight Surgeon (FS), OG/CC (may delegate to but no lower than squadron commander),
   and with each individual aircrew member. During extended deployments, aircrew members will only
   obtain no-go pills from a deployed USAF flight surgeon. The deployed flight surgeon shall consult
   with the home unit medical team prior to dispensing no-go pills to deployed fliers.
   3.9.4. Unit Operational Risk Management (ORM) programs shall include use of no-go medication
   with OG/CC and FS oversight. A basic counter-fatigue ORM model is available for mission planners,
   OG/CC, crew, and FS on the AMC/A37V website.
   3.9.5. Home station or deployed FS trained using the AMC/SG-approved (lead command) counter
   fatigue program is the point of contact for no-go prescription. Upon request, the FS will advise/assist
   the local OG/CC to identify missions that may impair crew rest caused by duty day length, departure
   and arrival times, and other mission timelines.

     3.9.6. Aircrew members on Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status will follow PRP notification
     procedures if prescribed no-go Pills.
     3.9.7. The OG/CC shall establish a system to inform the FS when missions fall into any of the follow-
     ing categories (may cause sleep disruptions and are therefore candidates for no-go medications):
        3.9.7.1. Home station night launch missions greater than four hours duration.
        3.9.7.2. Crew rest facilities lacking an optimal sleeping environment (quiet, cooled, and dark-
        ened).
        3.9.7.3. Off-station missions that are 4 or more time zones from home station.
        3.9.7.4. Rotating schedules (stair-stepped flying schedules) with greater then 6-hour flight time
        duration.
        3.9.7.5. Missions that run consistently near a 14-hour (or greater) duty day.
     3.9.8. SQ/CC will not schedule crewmembers to fly or perform crew duties within 12 hours of con-
     suming no-go Pills (consider DNIF). EXCEPTION: commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline
     after consult with a flight surgeon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect [6 hours
     for ambien (zolpidem) and 4 hours for sonata (zaleplon)]. In no case will crewmembers consume a
     no-go pill on a timeline where they would be under the effect of the medication while they perform
     aircrew duties (use mission report or legal for alert time to determine latest time to take no-go medica-
     tion).
     3.9.9. Aircrew member’s responsibilities:
        3.9.9.1. Aircrew members will complete ground testing for no-go pills and receive flight surgeon
        clearance prior to using no-go pills in the operational environment.
        3.9.9.2. Aircrew members shall not operate equipment within 12-hours after consuming a no-go
        pill. EXCEPTION: Commanders may reduce the 12-hour timeline after consult with a flight sur-
        geon to confirm prescribed no-go pills have short duration effect. In no case will crew members
        consume no-go pills on a timeline where they would be under the effect of the medication while
        they operate equipment.
        3.9.9.3. Aircrew members shall not take no-go-pills within 12 hours of consuming alcohol.
        3.9.9.4. Aircrew will inform the FS of any other medications (including nutritional supplements
        and over the counter medications) they are taking so the FS can evaluate potential interactions.
        3.9.9.5. Limit use of restoril and ambien to a maximum of seven consecutive days and no more
        than 20 days in a 60-day period.
        3.9.9.6. Limit use of sonata to a maximum of 10 consecutive days and no more than 28 days in a
        60-day period.

3.10. Crew Rest/En route Ground Time. OG/CCs shall establish procedures to place crewmembers in
crew rest. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive any portion of the crew rest period or ground time as needed to
meet mission tasking.
     3.10.1. Home-Station Pre-Departure Crew Rest. For missions that will keep aircrew members off sta-
     tion 16+00 or more hours, leaders shall enter primary and deadhead aircrew members into pre-depar-
     ture crew rest 24 hours before the legal for alert time. Aircrew members may perform limited
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            31


  non-flying duties like mission planning during the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. OG/CCs
  may waive any portion of the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest. However, leaders shall not
  manifest deadhead aircrew members as passengers to deny pre-departure crew rest. EXCEPTION:
  AFRC, ANG, and AETC in accordance with AFI 11-202V3 and appropriate supplement.
  3.10.2. Off-station/En route Crew Rest. The minimum en route crew rest period is 12 hours before
  legal for alert or scheduled report time when self-alerting. This provides aircrews at least 8+00 hours
  to sleep plus 4+00 hours to travel, relax, and dine.
     3.10.2.1. Except during emergencies or as authorized by MAJCOM/A3/DO, C2 agents shall not
     disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. When necessary to interrupt aircrew members’ crew rest
     period, re-enter that aircrew in a subsequent minimum 12 hour crew rest period after they com-
     plete official duties.
     3.10.2.2. Do not enter aircrew members into crew rest until they complete official post-flight
     duties. Those duties may include, but are not limited to, refueling, cargo on-/off-load, aircrew
     arming, minor maintenance, or mission debriefing.
  3.10.3. Off-station/En route Ground Time. Mobility planners normally provide aircrews 16+30 hours
  (nuclear airlift missions will be IAW AFI 11-299 (FOUO)) ground time between engine shutdown
  and subsequent takeoff.
     3.10.3.1. Missions planners, PICs, or C2 agents may modify ground time as follows:
         3.10.3.1.1. In the interest of safety.
         3.10.3.1.2. To start (mission reporting time) no earlier than 12 hours from the time the aircrew
         entered crew rest. Before reducing ground time, PICs will consider time to complete mission
         planning, cargo on-/off-load, and non-standard mission related duties. C2 agents will not ask
         PICs to accept less than 16+30 ground times.
     3.10.3.2. Mobility planners should construct mission itineraries with en route ground times longer
     than 16+30 hours to afford aircrew members opportunities to recover from the cumulative affects
     of fatigue caused by flying on several consecutive days or due to transiting several time zones. If
     practical, make the en route ground time 36 hours (maximum) after three consecutive near maxi-
     mum FDPs.
  3.10.4. Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR is not an alternative to a safety-of-flight delay
  but provides PICs a means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and report period outside
  normal duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and are normally used during
  de-positioning legs. Tasking authorities shall approve requests to delay alert time to normalize the
  work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the
  C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for disapproval.
  3.10.5. Post-Mission Crew Rest (PMCR) SQ/CCs shall give aircrew members returning to home base
  sufficient time to recover from cumulative effects of the mission and tend to personal needs. PMCR
  begins upon mission termination. (N/A for AFRC, ANG and AETC).
     3.10.5.1. For missions that kept an aircrew off station 16 or more hours, the SQ/CC shall provide
     1 hour (up to 96+00 hours) PMCR for each 3 hours off-station. Do not enter these aircrew mem-
     bers in pre-departure crew rest until the PMCR period expires.
32                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        3.10.5.2. PMCR is not applicable to continuing missions and MAJCOM/A3/DO may suspend
        PMCR during contingency operations.
        3.10.5.3. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are PMCR waiver authority.
     3.10.6. Flying Crew Chief (FCC) Work/Rest Plan. While on Temporary Duty (TDY), the deployed
     FCC or MEGP maintenance technician shall report to the PIC. In conjunction with en route/transient
     maintenance supervisor, the PIC will determine how long the crew chief can safely perform aircraft
     maintenance duties. The PIC shall ensure the FCC has sufficient time in each 24-hour period to get 8
     hours of uninterrupted rest. See AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Management, for
     detailed guidance.
        3.10.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Include FCCs in the work-rest plan and allow them to use in-flight
        crew rest facilities when necessary. During aircraft debrief, the PIC will coordinate with the FCC
        and maintenance supervision on how long the FCC can safely work. This is especially important
        for augmented duty days or crew-staged operations. Rest periods may only be interrupted for nec-
        essary questions concerning the airplane maintenance history.
        3.10.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If ground time exceeds 16 hours, a work-rest plan (not to exceed a
        12-hour work cycle) will be established by the PIC and local senior maintenance supervisor.
        Ensure adequate rest before departure.
        3.10.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) FCC duties away from home station include:
            3.10.6.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Ensure aircraft is maintenance ready.
            3.10.6.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Inspects, maintains, services, and prepares the aircraft for its
            next departure.
            3.10.6.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Participate in maintenance debriefings with the aircrew.
            3.10.6.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Assist maintenance recovery teams.
            3.10.6.3.5. (Added-TRAVIS) At AMC enroute stations, FCCs will advise the maintenance
            line supervisor when leaving the work area and keep Maintenance Control/AMCC informed
            of location.
        3.10.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft commanders will report FCC performance on 60 AMW
        Form 222, Dedicated Crew Chief Evaluation.
     3.10.7. The lead USAF component will publish MAJCOM/A3/DO-approved crew rest criteria in the
     Exercise or Contingency Operation Order (OPORD), Operation Plan (OPLAN) or Concept of Opera-
     tions (CONOPs).
     3.10.8. The Prime Knight program streamlines the process of getting aircrews from aircraft parking
     ramp into lodging/crew rest. It is only successful when billeting agents receive accurate aircrew/mis-
     sion information in a timely manner.
        3.10.8.1. C2 Agent Responsibilities. A MAJCOM C2 agent will forward information on the
        departing aircrew’s orders to a point of contact (POC) for the next crew rest location’s Prime
        Knight function.
        3.10.8.2. PIC Responsibilities. If departing from a location with a C2 agency, ensure a C2 agent
        has accurate aircrew/mission information to forward to the next Prime Knight POC. If departing
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               33


       from a facility without a C2 agency, the PIC will call the next crew rest location Prime Knight
       POC to pass aircrew/mission information.
       3.10.8.3. SQ/CC or designated authenticating official shall ensure TDY/Flight orders clearly indi-
       cate the unit fund cite so that the PIC may make Prime Knight reservations in advance. Without a
       unit fund cite on the TDY/Flight orders, the PIC must make advance reservations using a govern-
       ment travel card to participate in the Prime Knight program.

3.11. Alerting Procedures. MAJCOM C2 agents shall establish a legal for alert time with the PIC and
when appropriate, the Medical Crew Director (MCD) of Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crews. Whenever
possible, C2 agents will inform PICs and MCDs of aircraft status, expected patient up load time, and other
pertinent mission details that will streamline mission launch.
   3.11.1. Aircrew alert time is normally 3+45 hours (4+15 for airdrop missions) before scheduled take-
   off time (allows 1+00 hour for reporting and 2+45 hours (3+15 for airdrop missions) for mission prep-
   aration). OG/CCs may establish alert procedures for local training missions.
       3.11.1.1. For missions with more than minimum ground time, the PIC may arrange an alert time
       that provides additional preparation time to accomplish the mission. The PIC may also accept
       alerting with reduced preparation time when the mission allows. In all cases, the PIC shall coordi-
       nate changes to standard alerting times with the appropriate C2 agency.
       3.11.1.2. With PIC agreement and when cargo load warrants (i.e. outsized and Technical Order
       (TO) 1C-17A-1- 9 section VI cargo), C2 agents may alert loadmasters up to 2 hours before normal
       alert time. When early alerting is warranted, the PIC and C2 agent must notify the loadmaster
       before he/she enters crew rest. Do not alert the loadmaster early if they will not receive the mini-
       mum amount of crew rest of 12 hours. Do not alert the loadmaster more than 1 hour before begin-
       ning cargo up load. Base the aircrew FDP on the loadmaster’s show time.
       3.11.1.3. C2 agents will not alert an aircrew until the aircraft is in commission or there is reason-
       able assurance that maintenance technicians will complete repairs that allow the aircrew time to
       pre-flight and load the aircraft to meet the target takeoff time.
       3.11.1.4. C2 agents will not alert outbound crews when inbound aircraft is on A-2 or A-3 status
       until maintenance technicians determine required parts are available and the aircraft will be
       repaired within the target ground time.
       3.11.1.5. Self-Alerts. Crews will self-alert at locations without a C2 agency, but must coordinate
       with controlling C2 agency. The PIC may elect to self-alert on operational missions at locations
       with a C2 agency. Coordinate the alert time with local C2 agents to avoid FDP limitations that
       result from unexpected changes in the mission.
   3.11.2. The aircrew release policy is as follows:
       3.11.2.1. On the aircrew’s initial entry or re-entry into crew rest, the controlling C2 agent, or PIC
       during self-alerts, will establish an expected alert time.
       3.11.2.2. For all missions, the latest allowable alert time is 6 hours after the expected alert time.
       The PIC may extend that window to 8 hours when flying as primary crew or 12 hours when dead-
       heading. The controlling C2 agent will not ask the PIC to accept more than the 6 hour window.
       ANG/AFRC aircrew members may extend the window as necessary to deadhead to home station
       to meet the Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT).
34                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        3.11.2.3. When a C2 agent determines circumstances will not allow for aircrew alerting during
        the legal for alert window, at that time but not earlier than the expected alert time, the C2 agent
        will contact the PIC and establish a new expected alert time at least 12+00 hours from the time of
        notification.
        3.11.2.4. At the end of the legal for alert window or if a mission can’t depart within 4+00 hours of
        scheduled takeoff time, the PIC will contact a C2 agent and establish a new expected alert time.
        The PIC may extend takeoff window to 6 hours

3.12. Stage Management.
     3.12.1. Stage Posture. Stages operate on a positive launch principle. C2 agents shall alert aircrews
     using the following priority/hierarchy:
        3.12.1.1. Aircrews that require an emergency return to home station.
        3.12.1.2. De-positioning stage crews will be prioritized by their SRTs.
        3.12.1.3. Aircrews in sequence of arrival time.
        3.12.1.4. If the stage manager returns an aircrew in the stage to crew rest because of a mission
        delay or abort, that aircrew becomes first out when legal for alert.
     3.12.2. Mechanical Stage. A C2 agent may create a mechanical stage when a delayed or aborted mis-
     sion will not resume before that aircrew’s FDP expires. Aircrews in a mechanical stage will be first
     out when a mission in the same direction transits their location while they are legal for alert. A C2
     agent may bump an inbound aircrew with FDP to complete that mission to cycle aircrews in a
     mechanical stage. C2 agents should not normally establish a mechanical stage for ANG and AFRC
     crews flying unit-equipped aircraft.

3.13. Standby Force Duty. MAJCOM C2 Agents shall task units for Standby Force Duty not later than
18 hours prior to legal for alert time. This allows crewmembers 12 hours of pre-standby crew rest and 6
hours for aircraft pre-flight duty. When aircrews are unable to complete all preflight duties within 6 hours
of crew show time, provide an additional 12-hour pre-standby crew rest. If MAJCOM C2 agents are
unable to provide 18 hours prior notification, SQ/CC shall place the pre-standby crew in 12 hour crew rest
and follow aircraft generation procedures in paragraph 3.7.5. to prepare the aircraft for launch. SQ/CC
may keep an aircrew in ALFA/BRAVO status up to 48 hours. MAJCOM/A3/DO may extend this period
for contingencies. After 48 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrew into 12 hour pre-departure crew rest.
OG/CCs may provide additional local procedures for management of Standby Force Duties.
     3.13.1. ALFA Standby Aircraft Preflight Generation and Security. When tasked, SQ/CC shall pos-
     ture an aircraft and aircrew as an ALFA Standby Force able to launch within 1 hour. The following
     procedures apply to primary aircraft as well as spare aircraft generated for ALFA alerts. A mainte-
     nance Dash -6 and aircrew Dash -1 preflight must be completed. Preflight validity will be in accor-
     dance with applicable T.O. After the preflight, the PIC will notify the controlling agency. The aircraft
     will remain in a sealed posture and be referred to as “cocked on alert”. Documentation of when the air-
     craft was cocked on alert must be placed in the forms. The PIC will ensure the aircraft is secure before
     entering crew rest. Secure all hatches and doors to show unauthorized entry. The aircrew preflight
     portion remains valid if performed by one crew, cocked on alert, and launched by another crew.
     Uncocking a generated aircraft is not a standard procedure but may be accomplished on a case by case
     basis. The PIC or a designated aircrew representative must be present if access to the aircraft is
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               35


  required. Ensure command and control and the controlling agency are notified when uncocking and
  recocking generated aircraft. Follow-on pre-flights done during normal waking hours do not interrupt
  crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when C2 agent directs the aircrew to launch from crew rest or while per-
  forming pre-flight (begin CDT/FDP when the aircrew arrived at the aircraft to do the pre-flight).
  3.13.2. BRAVO Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture an aircraft and/or aircrew in
  BRAVO Standby Force to permit launch within 3 hours. Follow-on pre-flights, if required, interrupt
  crew rest. Begin CDT/FDP when aircrew shows for duty, normally one hour after C2 alerts the air-
  crew from crew rest.
  3.13.3. CHARLIE Standby Force. When tasked, SQ/CC shall posture aircrews as a CHARLIE
  Standby Force ready to enter crew rest within 2 hours. Tasked aircrews will be legal for alert 12 hours
  after entering crew rest. SQ/CC may keep aircrews in CHARLIE status up to 72hours. After 72 hours,
  release aircrews from CHARLIE Standby or enter them into 12 hours crew rest for directed mission,
  training mission, or subsequent standby force duty.
  3.13.4. J-Alert (JCS-directed alert force). Alert aircrew will be provided 12 hours crew rest prior to
  alert duty. Alert crew may be considered in crew rest upon termination of a flight, even though
  remaining on alert. If a crew completes a mission within their alert cycle, they are legal for alert again
  after 12 hours of crew rest. The length of a J-Alert tour will be determined by the OG/CC, but will not
  exceed 192 hours/8 days.
     3.13.4.1. J-Alert crews will not be used as preflight crews for aircraft other than their own alert
     aircraft or its replacement.
     3.13.4.2. J-Alert crew members may complete ground currency events and limited office duties at
     their leisure while on alert; however, they will not accomplish those items that result in DNIF sta-
     tus.
     3.13.4.3. Flying during alert is authorized with the following restrictions:
         3.13.4.3.1. At the discretion of the individual, not to exceed a flight duty period of 6 hours.
         3.13.4.3.2. Crew members fly for individual currency or Special Operations/Boat Drop train-
         ing. They are not an instructor/examiner pool.
         3.13.4.3.3. The alert aircraft and crew integrity are not required if recovery and re-launch can
         be accomplished within 1.5 hours of real world alert launch notification. If this timing cannot
         be met, the integral alert crew and aircraft must be used to allow airborne diversion.
         3.13.4.3.4. Special Operations training may be accomplished provided the crew members are
         allowed to adjust their work/rest cycle.
         3.13.4.3.5. Crew duty time (CDT) for real world crisis response will begin when the crew
         shows for the real world mission.
  3.13.5. Wing Standby Force. OG/CC may place aircrews in Wing Standby status. After a 12 hour
  pre-departure crew rest period, aircrews are legal for alert for 12 hours and must be able to launch
  within 3+15 hours. After 12+00 hours, launch, release, or re-enter aircrews in 12 hour crew rest period
  before subsequent 12 hours Wing Standby duty.
36                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        3.13.5.1. Wing Standby Force Crew Management. A Wing Standby aircrew shall only pre-flight
        its own aircraft. Aircrew members in post-mission crew rest are available for Wing Standby only
        after post-mission crew rest period expires.
     3.13.6. Post-Standby Missions. On completion of standby duty, aircrew members may be dispatched
     on a mission. If started, post-standby crew rest must be completed before the start of pre-departure
     crew rest. If an aircrew member is dispatched on a mission, compute the post-mission crew rest time
     on standby time plus mission time.
     3.13.7. Post Standby Crew Rest. Aircrew members not dispatched on a mission following standby
     duty will receive post-mission standby crew rest as follows:
        3.13.7.1. If standby duty is performed away from normal quarters, crew rest time is computed
        from this standby time on the same basis as for mission time.
        3.13.7.2. If standby duty was performed in normal quarters, no crew rest time is authorized

3.14. Orientation Flights and Incentive Flights. Refer to DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation, AFI
11-401, Aviation Management, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.

3.15. Interfly. Interfly is a temporary arrangement between OG/CCs or equivalent to permit the
exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft between mobility units to accomplish flying
missions. Normally, interfly should be limited to specific operations, exercises, or special circumstances.
However, it may be used for events of longer duration such as unit conversion to another model design
series (MDS). Participating aircrews shall use guidelines established by the lead command or as specified
in the OPLAN or CONOPS. EXCEPTION: AE crewmembers are exempt from interfly requirements.
NOTE: ANG/XO has delegated approval authority to Wing Commanders for active duty/AFRC interfly
with ANG. Conduct interfly operations as follows:
     3.15.1. Aircrew members shall be current and qualified in the MDS (aircraft and model), as well as
     unique systems or configuration required to fly the aircraft/mission.
     3.15.2. Aircrew members will follow operational procedures established by the lead command for the
     MDS. The Mission Commander or PIC will brief MAJCOM-specific items.
     3.15.3. Each effected group commander who commits resources (personnel or aircraft) must concur
     with interfly proposal.
     3.15.4. MDS conversion training.
        3.15.4.1. Units may request an interfly agreement for duration of their conversion. OG/CCs will
        forward interfly requests to individual OG/CCs for approval. Requests will include as a minimum
        a list of effected units, duration of the agreement, and purpose.

3.16. Additional Crewmembers (ACM). Crewmembers qualified in mobility aircraft are authorized
ACM status on any mobility aircraft to pre/de-position in support of mobility operations. MAJCOM des-
ignated crewmembers who are assigned or authorized to accompany the normal crew compliment are
allowed ACM status.
     3.16.1. Crewmembers in ACM status are not authorized to:
        3.16.1.1. Displace manifested passengers.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            37


       3.16.1.2. Maintain currency and/or log flying time.
       3.16.1.3. Use for transportation while on leave.
       EXCEPTION: ANG/AFRC Air Technicians may be in a civilian leave status while traveling en
       route to perform in a military duty status.
       3.16.1.4. Travel on Special Air Missions/Command Support Mission (SAM/CSM) aircraft unless
       authorized by HQ AF/CVAM through the PIC.
       3.16.1.5. Travel on Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) when specifically restricted by
       the mission directive (Form 59).
       3.16.1.6. Travel on Operational Support Airlift (OSA) aircraft unless authorized by Joint Opera-
       tional Support Airlift Command (JOSAC) through the PIC.
   3.16.2. All ACMs require valid travel/flight orders or supporting message authorizing ACM status.
   OG/CCs may authorize ACM status for their mobility aircrews.
   3.16.3. Flight evaluators have priority and will not be displaced by any other ACM. The priority for
   evaluators is MAJCOM, NAF, group, then squadron level.
   3.16.4. ACMs normally travel in the crew compartment. If the number of ACMs desiring travel
   exceeds the capacity of the crew compartment, the C2 agency will notify the ATOC, who in turn will
   coordinate with the passenger terminal; seats not previously assigned may be used for ACMs.
   3.16.5. The PIC, or designated representative, will brief ACMs on seat assignment, appropriate mis-
   sion information, emergency procedures including egress, and armed crewmembers. The PIC may
   assign an ACM aircrew-related duties for which the ACM is qualified.
   3.16.6. ACMs will coordinate their travel with the appropriate C2 agency prior to travel. They will
   process through the C2 agency as early as possible but NLT 3 hours prior to planned block time.

3.17. Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP). Procedures and policies regarding MEGP are
contained in AFI 11-401 and AMCI 11-208. PICs will ensure personnel traveling in this status are prop-
erly authorized.

3.18. Mission Mobility Observers (MMO). MAJCOM supplements or additional directives may estab-
lish programs authorizing senior military and civilian personnel to fly for mobility mission familiariza-
tion. For AMC MMO information reference AMCI 11-208.

3.19. Flight Attendants on Distinguished Visitor Missions. Flight Attendants will fly as primary
crewmembers on designated C-17 missions IAW AFI 65-503 Table A36-1 note 32. They will fall under
the authority of the Mission Commander throughout the mission. An egress briefing will be given to the
Flight Attendants prior to the first mission leg.

                                                 Chapter 4

                              AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS

4.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some missions when a compo-
nent/system is degraded. The PIC is the final authority in determining the overall suitability of an aircraft
for the mission. The PIC will ensure a detailed explanation of the discrepancy is entered in the AFTO
Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; include the following maintenance iden-
tifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status:
     4.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem component
     essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion as ME.
     4.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or subsystem component,
     which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as MC. These discrepancies should be
     cleared at the earliest opportunity. If circumstances change or mission safety would be compromised,
     re-designate as ME. Do not delay a mission to clear a MC discrepancy.
     4.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to adversely impact the cur-
     rent mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items are normally cleared at home station.

4.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document that lists the mini-
mum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare a list that would anticipate all
possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent circumstances. Consider equipment/
systems with no listed exceptions as grounding items. A PIC who accepted an aircraft with degraded
equipment/systems is not committed to subsequent operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs
are not committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
     4.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during continued operation with
     inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not intended for continued operation over an indefi-
     nite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
     4.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted by mission require-
     ments/directives.
     4.2.3. Waiver Policy. A PIC prepared to operate with a degraded MEL item shall request a waiver
     through C2 channels. The PIC shall provide the C2 agent: 1) nature of request, 2) individual crew-
     member qualification, 3) mission leg(s) requiring the waiver, and 4) the governing directive of waiver
     request to include volume, chapter, or paragraph. Initiate waiver requests as soon as possible; plan at
     least a 1-hour waiver process time.
     4.2.4. PICs operating with waiver(s) for degraded equipment shall coordinate mission requirements
     (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.) with the controlling
     C2 agency and/or flight manager.
     4.2.5. If beyond C2 communication capability, or when it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft
     from a situation not covered by this chapter and immediate action is required, the PIC may deviate
     according to paragraph 1.4. Report deviations (without waiver) through channels to MAJCOM/A3/
     DO within 48-hours. OG/CCs shall collect background information and submit a follow-up written
     report upon request.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                  39


4.3. Waiver Protocol. Waivers to operate with degraded equipment are granted on a case-by-case basis.
The PIC determines the need for a waiver after coordinating with the lowest practical level of command.
MEL waiver authority is as follows:
   4.3.1. Training Missions. OG/CC or equivalent with mission execution authority.
   4.3.2. MAJCOM Directed Missions. MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority for active
   duty, AFRC, or ANG units flying MAJCOM-directed missions (includes Operational Readiness
   Inspections). Initiate the request with MAJCOM C2 agency. For AMC-directed missions contact HQ
   AMC/A37V through 18 AF TACC.
   4.3.3. Contingency Missions. DIRMOBFOR (or equivalent) for the agency with C2, if not specified
   in the OPORD/Tasking Order.
   4.3.4. ANG or AFRC Directed Missions. ANG or AFRC maintains C2 and waiver authority for ANG
   or AFRC directed mission prior to mobilization.
   4.3.5. Other Than MEL Waivers. Determine governing source document (i.e. AFI, Flight Manual,
   Maintenance T.O., etc.) to ascertain the waiver authority. Use C2 channels to notify the appropriate
   waiver authority. Waivers of this nature may require an extended response time.
   4.3.6. Engineering Dispositions (ED). Dispositions are requested when aircraft are damaged and/or
   established maintenance technical order procedures cannot be followed or do not exist. The on-site
   maintenance authority is responsible for requesting Engineering Dispositions. Most EDs allow main-
   tenance to repair the aircraft and return it to unrestricted status; dispositions of this nature do not con-
   cern aircrews. However, EDs affecting aircrew operations require MEL waiver authority approval.
       4.3.6.1. PICs shall coordinate dispositions containing flight restrictions, prohibitions, additional
       operating limits, or modified/nonstandard operating procedures with the appropriate MEL waiver
       authority (see paragraph 4.3.).
       4.3.6.2. PICs will not accept dispositions appearing incomplete, in error, or unsafe. Prior to reject-
       ing a disposition, the PIC will contact the appropriate MEL waiver authority. The waiver authority
       will attempt to resolve the issue.
NOTE: Deviations from the flight manual requires approval IAW the flight manual.

4.4. Technical Assistance. The PIC may request technical support and additional assistance from their
home unit or MAJCOM C2 agency.

4.5. MEL Table Definitions/Column Identifiers. MEL tables are arranged by aircraft system to pro-
vide the PIC a mechanism to determine minimum system requirements. Components are listed by number
installed and minimum required for flight. Requirements are defined by Home Station Departure/Main
Operating Base (MOB) (Column A) and en route stations (Column B). Local training missions, to include
off-station trainers, fall under Column B. An asterisk (*) in the Required column indicates the number
required is situation dependent; refer to the Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions column for clarification.
AMC and AMC gained aircrews will consider Charleston AFB, McChord AFB, and McGuire AFB as
MOBs. When transiting a MOB on a pre-positioning or an active leg of a mission use Column A. When
transiting a MOB on a de-positioning leg use Column B.
EXAMPLE: A McChord C-17 transiting Charleston en route to Ramstein AB will use Column A. How-
ever, when transiting Charleston en route to McChord (de-positioning) use Column B.

NOTE: Column B requirements will not normally be waived when transiting a MOB on a de-positioning
leg.
     4.5.1. Remarks/Limitations/Exceptions. Some technical information and procedures are contained in
     this column. This is not all-inclusive; crewmembers shall refer to the flight manual and other direc-
     tives for procedures, techniques, limitations, etc.
     4.5.2. One-time Flight Clarification: Normally a Red X discrepancy downgraded for a one-time flight
     without passengers. The MXG/CC who owns the aircraft is the approval authority. Cargo may be car-
     ried as long as safety-of-flight is not compromised. The priority is to move the airplane to a repair
     capable facility; once repaired, the mission can be completed. PICs must coordinate with appropriate
     agencies to ensure repair capability exists at the destination. One-time flights may include en route
     stops only when necessary to recover the airplane. Example: An airplane departs on a gear-down
     flight from Djibouti IAP and requires an en route fuel stop (Cairo) before landing at the nearest repair
     capable facility, Sigonella NAS.
     4.5.3. One-time flight to nearest repair capable facility: Flight is limited to the nearest (shortest en
     route time) repair capable base.
     4.5.4. One-time flight to a repair capable facility: Flight is not restricted to the nearest repair capable
     facility.
     4.5.5. Other Mission and Repair Clarifications:
        4.5.5.1. Shall be repaired at next repair capable facility: Mission may continue as scheduled; item
        shall be repaired upon reaching a repair capable facility. Designate item ME upon reaching repair
        facility. Once maintenance action is initiated, and it is determined repairs are not possible, the PIC
        will discuss possible courses of action with C2 agency to return aircraft to service. En route repair
        capable facilities are deemed so regardless of parts availability. Example: If Yokota AB did not
        have the required part, the aircraft is not cleared to proceed without a waiver.
        4.5.5.2. Repair as soon as practical: Item should be repaired when ground time permits. Do not
        delay the mission even if at a maintenance capable facility.
        4.5.5.3. Mission may continue: Regardless of location, do not delay the mission, continue as
        scheduled. Item is designated MC; repair per paragraph 4.1.2.
        4.5.5.4. Mission dictates requirement: PIC shall consider the entire mission profile, not just the
        next leg. Example: An airplane is departing an en route station with repair capability, after engine
        start it is discovered that the #1 engine anti-ice is inoperative. Icing conditions are not forecasted
        for the next leg. However, because the mission spans several days and repair capability does not
        exist at the scheduled en route stops, the PIC elects to have the item repaired prior to departing.

4.6. C-17 MEL. This MEL applies to all C-17 models and lists the minimum equipment and systems to
launch the aircraft under routine operations. The MEL does not include all equipment or systems essential
to airworthiness. The MEL is not intended to promote continued operation of the aircraft for an indefinite
period with systems/subsystems inoperative. See this chapter for further information including objectives,
policy, and waiver protocol. Additional guidance specific to SOLL operations are listed in Addenda B,
C-17 Special Operations.

4.7. Supplements. Each MAJCOM may supplement the MEL (see Chapter 1).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                  41


4.8. Navigation Systems.
   4.8.1. Equipment listed in FLIP for permitting compliance with MNPS is mandatory. Loss of any
   component before airspace entry requires return to a station with maintenance capability or re-filing
   via routes permitting equipment degradation.

4.9. Gear Down Flight Operations. During peacetime, gear down flight operations will be limited to
those sorties required to move the aircraft to a suitable repair facility. Gear down flight should only be
considered and approved after all avenues to repair the aircraft have been exhausted.
   4.9.1. PICs shall not takeoff until there is reasonable assurance that they will achieve/maintain ade-
   quate obstacle clearance (to include en route stops and alternates). Reference “Climbout Flight Path –
   3 Engines Gear Down” charts in TO 1C-17A-1-1. PICs are reminded to also reference TO
   1C-17A-1-1 for the appropriate drag index.
   4.9.2. Time and communications capability permitting, validate takeoff data with OG/OGV or MAJ-
   COM STAN/EVAL.

4.10. NVG Minimum Operating Equipment. The following equipment is required for NVG opera-
tions.
   4.10.1. NVGs that are HUD compatible (i.e. F4949G or L) mounted on a standard aircrew helmet. If
   available, one spare set of NVGs will be carried per crew. Each crewmember will carry approved
   spare batteries for their own NVGs. All crewmembers will preflight their own NVGs prior to flight,
   and should preflight their NVGs using an eye lane, Hoffman 20-20 box, or equivalent. The spare will
   also be preflighted.
   4.10.2. Each crewmember will carry an NVG-compatible light.

                                                  Chapter 5

                                     OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

5.1. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Momentary hesita-
tions for coordination items, ATC interruptions and deviations specified in the flight manual, etc., are
authorized. Notes amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be added to the checklists. Currency
of notes is a crewmember’s responsibility.
     5.1.1. Checklist Inserts. MAJCOM Stan/Evals shall approve the use of checklist inserts IAW AFI
     11-215, Flight Manual Program (FMP). For AMC and AMC-gained units, AMC/A37V is the check-
     list insert approval authority. The inserts should be placed at the end of the appropriate checklist or in
     an in-flight guide. All checklist inserts must have a POC. OGVs shall approve local in-flight guides
     and inserts not affecting TO guidance and procedures.

5.2. Duty Station. A qualified pilot will be in control of the aircraft at all times during flight. (EXCEP-
TION: Unqualified pilots undergoing qualification training and senior staff members who have com-
pleted a Senior Staff Familiarization Course.) All crewmembers will be at their duty stations during all
critical phases of flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. Due to mission requirements, and at the dis-
cretion of the PIC, loadmasters may occupy a seat on the flight deck or cargo compartment. During other
phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their duty stations, for brief periods, to meet physiological
needs and perform normal crew duties. Only one pilot may be absent from their duty station at a time.
Crewmembers will coordinate with the PF before departing their assigned primary duty stations. With
both pilots in their seats, PICs may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station
during non-critical phases of flight (the other pilot will be awake and alert).

5.3. Flight Station Entry. PICs may authorize passengers and observers access to the flight station dur-
ing all phases of flight. The total number of persons permitted in the flight station is limited to the number
of seats with operable seat belts. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources must be available. Passengers and
observers will not be permitted access to the pilot, copilot, or loadmaster position regardless of its avail-
ability.

5.4. Takeoff and Landing Policy. A current and qualified aircraft commander, or above, will occupy
either the left or the right seat during all takeoffs and landings. The designated PIC (A-code), is not
required to occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission.
     5.4.1. An AC or higher will make all takeoffs and landings during:
        5.4.1.1. Airlift of nuclear weapons.
        5.4.1.2. Aircraft emergencies, unless conditions prevent compliance.
        5.4.1.3. Assault landing operations or landings with substandard airfield operations.
        EXCEPTION: Pilots receiving upgrade training or receiving an evaluation.
        5.4.1.4. Situations when in the opinion of the PIC, marginal conditions exist.
        5.4.1.5. CAT II ILS approaches and landings when weather is below CAT I mins.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               63


   5.4.2. PICs who possess less than 100 Primary Assigned Aircraft (PAA) hours in the C-17 since cer-
   tification will perform all takeoffs and landings.
   EXCEPTION: They may allow current ACs or higher to perform takeoffs and landings when
   required to maintain currency.
   5.4.3. Copilot Takeoff/Landing Policy. Copilots may takeoff or land from the right seat if an AC with
   over 100 PAA hours since certification in the C-17 occupies the left seat. Copilots may takeoff and
   land from the left seat only if an instructor pilot or flight examiner provides direct supervision from
   the right seat.
   5.4.4. First Pilots and graduates of the Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) course may takeoff or land
   from either seat if an AC with over 100 PAA hours since certification in the C-17 occupies the other
   seat.

5.5. Landing Gear and Slat/Flap Operating Policy. The landing gear will be operated by the pilot in
the right seat on command of the pilot flying the aircraft. Before actuation of the landing gear, the other
pilot will verify appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the command by repeating it. The slats/flaps will
be operated by the pilot not flying (PNF) the aircraft on command of the pilot flying (PF) the aircraft.
Before actuation of the slats/flaps, the other pilot will verify appropriate airspeed and acknowledge the
command by repeating it.

5.6. Outside Observer/ACM Duties. Available crewmembers will assist in clearing during taxi opera-
tions, and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.

5.7. Seat Belts.
   5.7.1. All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. Use of seat belts will be as directed
   by the PIC and flight manual.
   5.7.2. Primary crewmembers occupying pilot, copilot, or loadmaster positions will have seat belts
   fastened at all times in-flight, unless crew duties dictate otherwise.
   5.7.3. All crewmembers will be seated with seat belts and shoulder harnesses fastened during taxi,
   takeoff, and landing, unless crew duties dictate otherwise. For A/R, all crewmembers and passengers
   will be seated with seat belts fastened (unless authorized by the PIC to observe tanker A/R or crew
   duties dictate otherwise), and all equipment will be properly secured. Crewmembers performing
   instructor or flight examiner duties are exempt from seat belt requirements if not occupying a primary
   crew position; however, a seat with an operable seat belt will be assigned.
   5.7.4. Litter patients, actual or simulated, may remain secured on litters for takeoff and landing.

5.8. Aircraft Lighting. IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the
Ground, and applicable TOs.
   5.8.1. NVG Lighting.
       5.8.1.1. During combat/contingency operations, the tactical situation may dictate the use of all,
       some, or none of the aircraft exterior lights as determined by the mission commander. Lights-out
       operations during peacetime will be conducted in warning or restricted areas IAW AFI 11-202V3
64                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        unless a letter of agreement exists with the FAA. Use the following guidance for aircraft exterior
        lighting configurations when operating outside of these areas.
        5.8.1.2. Navigation Lights: Steady, bright.
        5.8.1.3. Formation Lights: On, medium (formation operations only).
WARNING: Immediately discontinue use of NVGs, and/or increase spacing from preceding aircraft (if
possible), when exterior lights in a preceding aircraft create excessive distractions or degrade perfor-
mance of NVGs to the point where safe flying operations cannot be maintained.
        5.8.1.4. Anti-Collision Lights: On, lower (upper and lower for single ship operations or for the
        last aircraft in the formation unless it causes distractions).
        5.8.1.5. Landing Lights. IR landing lights will be turned on no later than 400’ AGL on final.
     5.8.2. NVG Aircraft Preparation. The cockpit of the C-17A is specifically designed for NVG opera-
     tions and little preparation is required for flights requiring NVGs. During the exterior walk around
     inspection, a pilot will ensure all wheel well inspection lights are turned off and necessary exterior IR
     lighting is installed.
NOTE: Mini-chemical lights or tape to mark/identify switches and equipment may be used as required.

5.9. Portable Electronic Devices. IAW AFI 11-202V3.
     5.9.1. Do not connect unauthorized equipment (laptop computers, video equipment, food preparation
     equipment, radios/tape players, CD players, etc.) to the aircraft intercom, PA, radio systems, or elec-
     trical system.
     5.9.2. Aircrew members shall not use uncertified Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or per-
     sonal devices with RF transmit/receive capability on AMC aircraft carrying hazard class 1 explosive
     cargo at anytime. Prohibited devices include cellular phones, and laptop computers/PDAs with wire-
     less capability enabled (i.e. Bluetooth). Loadmasters will ensure passengers comply with this restric-
     tion. Aircrew members may use certified GFE such as PFPS laptops and PDAs with infrared
     transmitters.

5.10. Tobacco Use on Air Force Aircraft. Tobacco use of any type is prohibited on Air Force aircraft.

5.11. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals,
approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Table 5.1. through Table
5.4. depicts mandatory calls for nonprecision approaches, precision approaches, climb out and descent
respectively.

NOTES:
  1. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway environment is
     not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position for a normal landing, a go around will be made.
     2. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may not see the runway environment
        at DH; however, the initial portion of the approach lights will be visible. The pilot may continue
        to 100 HAT with reference to the approach lights. The pilot may not descend below 100 feet
        above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating
        bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.
     3. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond intention
        to “Land” if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown and the
        aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.
     4. Both pilots will state the altimeter setting.
     5.11.1. Deviations:
        5.11.1.1. The PNF will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed, or when
        the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made to correct the
        deviation.
        5.11.1.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in airspeed, or a
        potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF. Deviations from pre-
        scribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.

5.12. Communications Policy. The Air Force does not give a promise of confidentiality to aircrews
regarding their recorded aircraft crew communications. Crewmembers are expected to maintain a high
degree of cockpit professionalism and crew coordination at all times.
     5.12.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission
     accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, A/R, approach, landing, and any flight below 10,000 feet MSL.
     5.12.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during critical phases of
     flight. Crewmembers will coordinate with the PF before checking off interphone or operating in ISO-
     LATE. Crewmembers will ensure personnel on headset, or within listening distance, are cleared prior
     to discussing classified information over interphone.
     5.12.3. Command Radios:
        5.12.3.1. The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls.
        5.12.3.2. In terminal areas, all crewmembers (if able) will monitor the primary radio unless
        directed otherwise. A crewmember will be designated to monitor C2 frequencies on the inbound
        and outbound legs.
        5.12.3.3. The pilot operating the radios will notify the crew which radio is primary, and update
        the crew when the primary radio changes.
        5.12.3.4. One pilot should record and will read back all ATC clearances.
        5.12.3.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF and VHF guard emergency frequencies to the maximum
        extent possible.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               67


       EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember is required to monitor guard frequencies during rendezvous
       and A/R.
       5.12.3.6. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits the use of unauthorized fre-
       quencies for interplane, HAVE QUICK, or SECURE VOICE training.
       5.12.3.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Use of UHF Radios. UHF radio frequencies should be used to the
       maximum extent possible when operating at military installations. This does not preclude the use
       of VHF radios when specifically assigned by ATC, nor does it preclude VHF radio use for safety
       reasons, training, etc.
   5.12.4. HF Communications. Confine message traffic to essential operational matters. Perform an HF
   radio ground check before takeoff if the use of HF radio may be required for ATC or C2 communica-
   tions. Establish HF contact before going out of UHF and VHF range. If unable to establish HF contact
   with the controlling HF station, and an alternate means of relay of ATC information in oceanic areas
   is not available, comply with FLIP.
       5.12.4.1. General. Provide ATC position and weather observations when required. If unable to
       contact an ATC agency, attempt relay through the GLOBAL HF stations.
   5.12.5. Use secure and jam resistant communications to the maximum extent possible. In a threat
   environment, limit radio transmissions with the objective area to those required for safety of flight or
   factors affecting force employment.
   5.12.6. Crew Resource Management (CRM) Assertive Statement “Time Out”.
       5.12.6.1. “Time Out” is the common assertive statement for use by all crewmembers. The use of
       “Time Out” will:
           5.12.6.1.1. Provide a clear warning sign of a deviation or loss of situational awareness.
           5.12.6.1.2. Provide an opportunity to break the error chain before a mishap occurs.
           5.12.6.1.3. Notify all crewmembers when someone sees the aircraft or crew departing from
           established guidelines, the briefed scenario, or that someone is simply uncomfortable with the
           developing conditions.
       5.12.6.2. As soon as possible after a “Time Out” has been called, the aircrew will take the follow-
       ing actions:
           5.12.6.2.1. Safety permitting, stabilize the aircraft.
           5.12.6.2.2. The initiating crewmember will voice his or her concerns to the crew.
           5.12.6.2.3. The PIC will provide all other crewmembers with the opportunity to voice inputs
           relative to the stated concerns.
           5.12.6.2.4. After considering all inputs, the PIC will direct the aircrew to continue the current
           course of action or direct a new course of action.

5.13. Transportation of Pets. Transporting pets (dogs and cats) in conjunction with the sponsor’s per-
manent change of station is authorized. Other pets or animals are normally prohibited, but may be moved
according to DoD 4515.13R..

5.14. Alcoholic Beverages. MAJCOM A3/DO may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

5.15. Runway, Taxiway and Airfield Requirements; Wind Restrictions; Runway Condition Read-
ing (RCR) Limitations: A current landing zone (LZ) survey is needed before using other than hard-sur-
faced runways or taxiways, to include Matted runways. MAJCOM/A3/DO may waive runway/taxiway
width requirements.
     5.15.1. Runway and Taxiway Width Requirements. Minimum runway and taxiway widths for normal
     and tactical airland operations are depicted in Table 5.5..

Table 5.5. Runway/Taxiway Width Requirements.
Runway Operations                                       Width
Normal Operations                                       90 Feet/27.5 Meters
Tactical Assault Operations (Includes SPRO)             90 Feet/27.5 Meters
Taxiway
Normal and Tactical Assault Operations                  50 Feet/15.5 Meters
Star Turn                                               90 Feet/27.5 Meters

     5.15.2. Runway Length for Takeoff. Normally, takeoffs will be initiated from the beginning of the
     approved usable portion of the runway. Minimum runway length for take off is critical field length.
        5.15.2.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, the PF will initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the
        approved usable portion of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely
        with the PIC. Ensure the operating environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria,
        weather, etc.) will allow a safe takeoff and departure. Data computations will be based on the
        actual runway remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated.
        5.15.2.2. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff computations
        will be based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of
        45 feet either side of centerline should be cleared. If 45 feet either side of centerline is not cleared,
        then compute data based on the uncleared portion up to 45 feet either side of centerline.
     5.15.3. Runway Length for Landing. Minimum runway for a normal landing (3/4 or full flap) is com-
     puted landing distance with idle reverse.
NOTE: Pilots will consider elevated brake temperatures and Vbo when determining the minimum run-
way required for landing to preclude melting the fuse plugs.
        5.15.3.1. Minimum runway length for an assault landing is computed ground roll, with max
        reverse, plus 500 feet. Touchdown will be within the first 500 feet of the runway and full flaps will
        be used. Weather minimums will be circling minimums, no lower than 600/2. Prior to landing at a
        short field, the PIC will verify takeoff performance to ensure he/she can take off after the planned
        offload/onload.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              69


NOTES:
Max reverse is referenced on the Non-Standard Configuration page of the mission computer. The data
computed with this option selected is based on 2 engines in max reverse, 1 in idle reverse and 1 engine
inoperative.
Pilots will consider elevated brake temperatures and Vbo when determining the minimum runway
required for landing to preclude melting the fuse plugs.
           5.15.3.1.1. Markings required for assault landing zone (ALZ) operations are depicted in AFI
           13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. These markings are desirable for tactical
           airland operations; however, full markings are not mandatory on hard-surfaced runways that
           are permanently marked (or lighted) so as to make the touchdown zone and runway distances
           readily identifiable, or if the tactical situation does not permit full markings. Communication
           and navigation aids provided by special tactics units, are based on operational requirements,
           capability, and the specific threat environment.
       5.15.3.2. Runways less than 3,500 feet require MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver.
       5.15.3.3. Semi-Prepared Runway Operations (SPRO). See TO 1C-17A-1-1 Appendix B. OG/CC
       approval is required for semi-prepared runway operations within the CONUS, Alaska, and
       Hawaii. AMC/A3 approval is required in all other instances. For semi-prepared ALZs other than
       matted surfaces, Mission Commanders will ensure proper engineering evaluations (i.e. Dynamic
       Cone Penetrometer (DCP) or equivalent) are completed by qualified personnel within one week of
       the first landing to verify the LZ meets C-17 requirements.
           5.15.3.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission Planning. Before departure, ensure the aircraft is pre-
           pared for SPRO by maintenance personnel. Ensure turn-around areas at the assigned airfield
           are adequately marked to allow the aircrew to easily identify usable surfaces.
           5.15.3.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Before Landing. Turning the HUD intensity down to the mini-
           mum acceptable level will assist in visually acquiring the Visual Approach Marker Panels
           (VAMP).
           5.15.3.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Taxiing. Use differential braking with caution. Loadmaster
           will monitor the landing gear on the inside of the turn through an open paratroop door and
           notify the pilot if the wheels become locked or begin plowing the soil.
           5.15.3.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft Backing. Only use backing when necessary for mis-
           sion accomplishment. Plan ground operations to avoid star turns. Expect significant surface
           damage if star turns are performed.
           5.15.3.3.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Engine Running Onload/Offload during SPAM operations. If
           reverse idle causes vortex ingestion, terminate ERO procedures and position the throttles to
           forward idle after all ground personnel are clear of the aft area. Based on ground and wind con-
           ditions, engine shutdown may be required.
   5.15.4. Use of Overruns. If approach end overruns are available and stressed or authorized for normal
   operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. Departure end overruns (if
   stressed and authorized) may also be used for landing if needed.
   5.15.5. Arresting Cables (does not include recessed cables).
70                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        5.15.5.1. When conditions permit (aircraft gross weight, runway length, weather, winds, TOLD,
        etc.) and the pilot in command has considered the potential for damaging the aircraft, make take-
        offs and landings beyond raised cable barriers. Use the entire length of runway if necessary. Be
        aware that operations over arresting gear barriers at speeds in excess of taxi speed may result in
        damage to the aircraft.
        5.15.5.2. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not include recessed
        cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have the cable
        inspected.
        5.15.5.3. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as slack, loose,
        or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service (ATIS), or ATC.
     5.15.6. Other Airfield Requirements.
        5.15.6.1. Consult with HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) for suitability guidance.
        Once a mission is executed, the PIC is responsible for determining airfield suitability based upon
        operational need. Airfield certification requirements are detailed in the ASRR.
        5.15.6.2. Aircrews and planning agencies will contact HQ AMC/A36AS for all questions pertain-
        ing to airfield weight bearing capacity and will review the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR before all off-sta-
        tion operations. HQ AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2 Giant
        Report and ASRR for AMC and AMC-gained aircraft, unless specifically delegated in AFI
        11-2MDS Vol 3 or AMCI 11-208. Direct GDSS/GDSS2 Giant Report and ASRR waiver requests
        to HQ AMC/A36AS. HQ AMC/A37V is the OPR for waivers to airfield restrictions. MAJCOM/
        A3/DO is the waiver authority for non-AMC missions. The PIC is responsible for waiver compli-
        ance. Crews that have access to the World Wide Web will review airfield suitability in the airfield
        data base via the HQ AMC Aircrew Portal instead of the printed ASRR book. Consult the ASRR
        for airfield certification requirements.

5.16. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Avoidance.
     5.16.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring clear-
     ance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 feet.
     Follow clearance criteria in Figure 5.1. for small permanent obstructions underneath the wing. During
     reverse taxi operations, do not taxi within 25 feet of an obstruction with or without a marshaller/wing
     walker.
     EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, aircraft may
     taxi without marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been mea-
     sured to ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction. obstruction and the obstruction
     is permanent. Parked aircraft are not considered permanent, and 25 feet of clearance, or a wing
     walker, is required.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               71


Figure 5.1. Taxi Obstruction Diagram.




NOTES:
Permanent obstacles (i.e. fuel hydrants), 3 feet high or shorter, are not considered obstructions as long as
they remain a minimum of 10 feet away from the landing gear doors.
A marshaller or crew member will verify the height and location of 3' and 5' high obstacles to ensure spec-
ified clearances from the wing, engines, and landing gear doors.
   5.16.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are unavail-
   able, deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction clearance and provide marshaling
   using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned crewmembers, or a crewmember on inter-
   phone positioned at the paratroop door(s) or ramp to act as an observer while maneuvering on narrow
   taxiways. During night taxi operations, marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing
   walkers are only required to have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing
   walkers at all times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.16.3. FOD Avoidance. Make every effort to minimize the potential for engine FOD. Crews should:
       5.16.3.1. Carefully review airfield layout paying particular attention to taxi routes, turn require-
       ments, and areas for potential FOD. Pay attention to other aircraft with engines running on parking
       aprons, adjacent taxiways, hammerheads, and arm/de-arm areas.
       5.16.3.2. Minimize power settings during all taxi operations.
       5.16.3.3. Avoid (when possible) 180-degree turns.
       5.16.3.4. Avoid (when possible) taxi operations, which would position an engine over an unpre-
       pared or unswept surface. If it becomes necessary to position an engine over an unprepared or
       unswept surface, the engine should be left in idle (to the maximum extent possible) until the
       engine is back over an improved surface. Consider increasing power on remaining engines.
72                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


     5.16.4. (Added-TRAVIS) At Travis AFB, do not block-in without a marshaller to ensure the aircraft
     is parked in the correct position. Exception: a marshaller is not required for ERCC operations in des-
     ignated ERCC spots.

5.17. Reverse Taxi:
     5.17.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with the loadmaster
     and marshaller (when available).
     5.17.2. Unless briefed otherwise, the following standard terms will be used by the loadmaster when
     conducting reverse taxi operations:
        5.17.2.1. The #1 and #4 engines will be used as turn references, i.e., “More turn towards #1,”
        “Less turn towards #4.” Use the term “roll out” when you want the PF to center the tiller.
        5.17.2.2. When the aircraft nears the desired reverse taxi stopping point, the loadmaster will give
        the following commands: “Loadmaster counting, five, four, three, two, one, stop.”
CAUTION: During the entire reverse taxi operation, if the loadmaster states the word “Stop,” the pilot
will immediately stop the aircraft. Failure to comply may result in damage to aircraft or injury to person-
nel.
     5.17.3. Ensure all passengers are seated with seatbelts fastened and cargo is secure.
     5.17.4. The loadmaster must have enough maneuverability to observe and direct reverse taxi, and
     report any hazards. The loadmaster will provide the pilot with continuous interphone instructions on
     conditions in the maneuvering area. This includes turns, distance remaining (for wingtips, empen-
     nage, and main gear), and stopping point. During aircraft backing, if the pilot and loadmaster lose
     interphone contact the pilot will stop the aircraft.
     5.17.5. When reverse taxiing at night, the pilots and loadmaster will ensure the taxi area is suffi-
     ciently lighted. Use the staging lights, retracted landing lights, or any other source that provides ade-
     quate lighting of the taxi area.
     5.17.6. During reverse taxi operations, stop at least 25 feet from an obstruction with or without a mar-
     shaller/wing walker.
CAUTION: The aircraft tail cannot be seen by the loadmaster from inside the aircraft and could possibly
strike an obstruction well before the main gear tires are near the ramp edge. If any doubt exists as to suf-
ficient clearance, stop the aircraft.

5.18. Fuel Jettison Procedures.
     5.18.1. AMC policy is to burn down fuel versus jettison, unless safety of flight dictates an immediate
     jettison (as determined by the pilot in command). Except in the case of an emergency, before jettison-
     ing fuel, notify the appropriate ATC or flight service facility of intentions, altitude, and location. If
     available, the PIC will use designated jettison areas, except when safety of flight would be compro-
     mised.
        5.18.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Fuel jettison is IAW prescribed technical orders and MAJCOM
        directives, and accomplished clear of populated areas. Aircrew will coordinate with Radar
        Approach Control/Oakland ARTCC for area and altitude in the local area.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               73


   5.18.2. For missions tasked by higher headquarters authority, the tasking C2 agency (18 AF TACC,
   AMOCC, CAOC, etc.) may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational requirement dictates
   immediate recovery/reconstitution of the aircraft and/or aircrew. The tasking C2 agency may provide
   fuel jettison instructions in the OPORD, mission directive, SPINS, etc.
   5.18.3. For training missions, the OG/CC may approve fuel jettison when an urgent operational
   requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and/or aircrew, and all alternatives have been
   exhausted.
   5.18.4. OG/CCs will establish jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel jettison-
   ing. Ideally, establish jettison areas at 20,000 feet MSL, off published airways, avoiding urban areas,
   agricultural regions, and water supply sources. Avoid circling descents. Initiate AF IMT 813, Request
   for Environmental Impact Analysis, and submit it to the base environmental coordinator.
       5.18.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Procedures: Pilots will proceed to the selected fuel jettison area and
       determine if the airspace below is clear of traffic. When jettisoning fuel, aircrews must comply
       with AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3, paragraph 5.18. and ARTCC restrictions.
       5.18.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If time permits, the recommended fuel jettison holding pattern
       instructions within Travis airspace boundaries are Northwest of the SAC R-266/TZZ R-324, 4-
       minute (15 NM) legs.
NOTE: Altitudes 10,000 feet or below will allow aircraft to remain within Travis delegated airspace.
Altitudes above 10,000 feet will require a clearance with Oakland ARTCC.
       5.18.4.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If the PIC decides the emergency does not warrant jettisoning in the
       local traffic pattern, Radar Approach Control will vector the aircraft to W-513, west of Sausalito
       VORTAC. Oakland ARTCC will give clearance to enter. The coordinates for the center of this
       area are N37o 50.0’ W123o 30.0’. This area will keep the aircraft in the immediate vicinity of
       Travis; if the situation deteriorates further, an eastbound turn will place the aircraft on final for
       San Francisco International Airport.
       5.18.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) If circumstances prevent aircraft from utilizing the designated fuel
       dump area, every effort will be made (within safe operation) to dump off federal airways and away
       from urban areas, agricultural regions, or water supply sources.
   5.18.5. All jettisons will be followed up with a detailed report filed by the pilot in command immedi-
   ately after landing (AMC Form 97, AMC In-flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet).
   Submit AMC Form 97 through unit OGV to AMC/A37V. Unit OGVs will retain AMC Form 97 for 6
   months. Document all pertinent information, including the following items:
       5.18.5.1. Scheduled Duration.
       5.18.5.2. Actual Duration.
       5.18.5.3. Landing Gross Weight.
       5.18.5.4. Computed Stopping Distance.
       5.18.5.5. Recovery Field.
       5.18.5.6. Runway Available.
       5.18.5.7. Jettison Altitude/Location.

        5.18.5.12. Approval Authority.

5.19. Aircraft Speed. Comply with requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. In accordance with
applicable tech orders, aircraft may exceed 250 KIAS or in-flight minimum maneuver speed below
10,000 feet to safely accomplish formation departure rejoins. Once rejoined, all formation members may
exceed 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet only to accommodate the minimum maneuver speed of the heaviest
formation member.

5.20. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. BASH programs are centralized unit
efforts that provide information cross-feed, hazard identification, and a consolidated course of action. As
a minimum, units must implement the following procedures:
     5.20.1. Ensure compliance with the following Bird Watch condition restrictions.
        5.20.1.1. Bird Watch Condition Low – No operating restrictions.
        5.20.1.2. Bird Watch Condition Moderate. Initial takeoffs and final landings allowed only when
        departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Local IFR/VFR traffic pattern activity is pro-
        hibited.
        5.20.1.3. Bird Watch Condition Severe. All takeoffs and landings are prohibited. Waiver author-
        ity is local OG/CC or equivalent. Parent MAJCOM/A3/DO waiver is required to operate at air-
        fields not controlled by the MAF.
        5.20.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) At non-AMC locations, the PIC will determine the BWC using the
        guidelines in paragraph 5.20.8. (Added) and comply with the restrictions in Table 5.6. (Added)
        Airfield base operations, tower facilities, National Wildlife Research Center (419-625-0242), and
        the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) provide additional sources of information
        on bird activity periods for both AMC and non-AMC locations.
     5.20.2. Commanders establish Phase II of the BASH program during increased periods of migratory
     bird activity. Schedulers shall make every effort to not schedule takeoffs, landings, and low-levels
     from one hour before to one hour after sunrise and sunset during the Phase II period. Publish signifi-
     cant bird hazards in FLIP Area Planning (AP) and the IFR Supplement along with the associated air-
     field operating hour restrictions and avoidance instructions.
        5.20.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In addition, missions should be scheduled to avoid known peak bird
        activity periods at transited airfields.
     5.20.3. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, PICs have the authority to delay
     takeoffs and arrivals due to bird condition. Coordinate actions through appropriate C2 authority.
        5.20.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Prior to conducting transition work at airfields without a BASH pro-
        gram, planner/aircrews will obtain any available bird activity information prior to and during
        operations at the airfield. Upon arrival at the airfield, aircrews must recheck the condition by any
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                  75


     means possible. Aircrews experiencing high bird activity at these locations will advise the control-
     lers of the bird activity so they can announce this information to other aircrews and update the
     ATIS if necessary. After the mission, aircrews should notify their respective safety office BASH
     representative concerning any high bird activity.
  5.20.4. Consider bird migratory patterns during the en route portion of the mission to help minimize
  the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on HQ AFSC/SEF website
  contains BASH information including regionalized Continental United States (CONUS) bird migra-
  tion patterns, Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS) software overlay, and the latest news. The
  Avian Hazard Advisory system (AHAS) website is another source for real time bird hazard informa-
  tion. Both sites may be accessed through the AMC aircrew mission planning portal. See AFPAM
  91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, for additional information.
     5.20.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) is operational for the
     entire CONUS. AHAS has a dynamic BAM (Bird Avoidance Model), which uses historical data
     to predict bird activity. The AHAS model takes current and forecast weather conditions, as well as
     near-real time NEXRAD radar data, to further refine the bird prediction. Tests show that AHAS
     can predict bird conditions 24 hours in advance (for predictions in excess of 24 hours, the AHAS
     and BAM models are the same). Reference AHAS at: http://www.usahas.com.
     5.20.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Regardless of Phase I or Phase II operations, all low levels will be
     assessed utilizing AHAS. AHAS should be used in mission planning to select a route that will
     allow for safe mission execution. As a minimum, AHAS will be checked prior to mission execu-
     tion. In an effort to reduce the bird strike hazard along low-level routes, crews will observe the fol-
     lowing restrictions on training missions:
         5.20.4.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) AHAS Bird Condition LOW: No restrictions.
         5.20.4.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) AHAS Bird Condition MODERATE: Crews will fly no faster
         than 250 knots on affected route segments.
         5.20.4.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) AHAS Bird Condition SEVERE: Crews will fly no faster than
         250 knots and no lower than 1000 feet AGL (3000 feet AGL at night) on affected route seg-
         ments. Also, the PIC will obtain 60 OG/CC approval prior to commencing any flight on
         affected route segments during Bird Condition SEVERE.
  5.20.5. Following a bird strike, aircrews should land as soon as practicable, to have the aircraft
  inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. Bird strike damage cannot be accurately assessed
  in-flight, and undetected damage may result in a complex airborne emergency; only qualified mainte-
  nance personnel, on the ground, can make reliable damage assessments.
     5.20.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews will land as soon as conditions permit at a location where
     the aircraft can be inspected by qualified maintenance personnel. As a minimum, all engine inlets,
     engine fan blades, cooling air inlets, pitot/static inlets, and flight controls will be inspected for bird
     strike damage, regardless of the location of the known bird strike.
         5.20.5.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) If damage to flight controls is suspected, aircrews should not
         change aircraft configuration until it has been determined safe to do so.
     5.20.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Report all bird strikes (including off-station) to 60 AMW/CP after
     landing.
76                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        5.20.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) PICs will record details of the bird strike on the AF Form 853, Air
        Force Bird Strike Report. Submit the form to Wing Safety within 24 hours via debrief, squadron
        safety, or FAX as appropriate.
NOTE: Fill out AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency/Unusual Occurrence Worksheet in addition
to the AF Form 853 if the bird strike caused known or suspected damage. Be sure to inform maintenance
and enter a write-up in the AFTO Form 781 for appropriate aircraft inspection.
     5.20.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Reference 60 AMW OPLAN 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard
     (BASH) Plan, NOTAMS, and FCIFs for current Travis AFB phase periods and BASH restrictions.
     5.20.7. (Added-TRAVIS) A significant bird hazard exists at Travis AFB. The hazard is a result of
     the close proximity to several wildlife refuges and the presence of landfill facilities 1.5 NM from the
     approach end of Rwy 03L and 4 NM from the approach end of Rwy 21L (N38 18.7 W121 50.3). The
     situation is compounded by the base’s location along the Pacific Flyway and the associated popula-
     tions of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Expect heavy bird activity year-round, with large num-
     bers of geese and ducks during the winter months. Expect higher numbers of migratory flock
     movement around sunrise and sunset. Bird activity will also be higher during overcast and rainy
     weather. Crews will avoid over flying the Potrero Hills Landfills 1.5 NM southeast of Runway 03L (N
     38 12.8 W 121 58.9).
        5.20.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 03: If at all possible, plan circling approaches and VFR pat-
        terns to Rwy 3R. Circles and VFR patterns to Rwy 3L will avoid over flight of the landfill. If
        extending beyond the landfill while circling, use Cat E minima to ensure obstacle clearance.
        5.20.7.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 21: If delaying a VFR closed pattern, extending upwind, or
        circling to Rwy 21L/R from a Rwy 3 approach, do not overfly the landfill.
     5.20.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Definitions. Visual sightings by aircrew,
     tower, base operations or safety personnel can initiate changes to the BWC. Listed below are standard
     BWC definitions and flight restrictions/crew actions that will be used at Travis AFB for all AMC air-
     craft to minimize the bird hazard to flight operations. Due to the transitory nature of BWCs, do not
     delay engine start or taxi for moderate or severe BWCs.
        5.20.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Severe - High wildlife populations (as a guide, more than 15 large
        birds [waterfowl, raptors, gulls, etc.] or 30 small birds [terns, swallows, etc.]) on or immediately
        above the active runway or other specific locations (taxiways, in-field areas, and departure or
        arrival routes) that represents a high potential for a strike. Keep in mind a single bird in a critical
        location may elevate the BWC to SEVERE. (Note: typically a temporary condition.)
        5.20.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Moderate - Increased wildlife population (approximately five (5) to
        fifteen (15) large birds or fifteen (15) to thirty (30) small birds) in locations that represent an
        increased potential strike. (Note: typically a temporary condition.)
        5.20.8.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Low - Sparse wildlife activity within 15 NM of the airport.

   5.20.9. (Added-TRAVIS) In addition to using good judgment, crews will take action according to
   Table 5.6. (Added) based on the BWC.
   5.20.10. (Added-TRAVIS) If an aircrew observes or encounters any significant bird activity which
   could constitute a hazard, the aircrew should contact the control tower, command post, range control,
   or base operations and pass the following:
       5.20.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Call Sign.
       5.20.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Location.
       5.20.10.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Altitude.
       5.20.10.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Time of Sighting.
       5.20.10.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Type and number of birds, if known.
       5.20.10.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Behavior of birds (e.g., soaring, flying, flock movement, etc.).

5.21. Functional Check Flights (FCFs) and Acceptance Check Flights (ACFs). FCFs and ACFs will
be accomplished IAW TO 1C-17A-6, Inspection Requirements Manual, AFI 21-101, Aerospace Equip-
ment Maintenance Management, TO 1-1-300, Functional Check Flights and Maintenance Operational
Checks, and TO 1C-17-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual. Crews
should only perform tasks or functions contained in specific technical order guidance. If requested to per-
form a non-standard function, PICs should contact their OG/CC to see if an FCF applies.
   5.21.1. FCF Restrictions. See T.O. 1-1-300.
78                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        5.21.1.1. The OG/CC, or deployed equivalent, may authorize temporary waivers to FCF proce-
        dures for aircrew qualification when operationally necessary.
        5.21.1.2. The OG/CC is responsible for the wing FCF program. Publish additional guidance in
        local supplement to this instruction. The OG/CC may authorize a partial FCF to check only those
        systems disturbed by maintenance, an inspection or modification.
        5.21.1.3. Conduct check flights within the designated check flight airspace of the base from
        which the flight was launched except when the flight must be conducted under specific conditions,
        not compatible with local conditions and area restrictions.
        5.21.1.4. The decision to approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of the
        MAJCOM/A3/DO.
        5.21.1.5. The OG/CC will only certify highly experienced instructors as FCF crewmembers. The
        OG/CC will determine FCF crew complement after a thorough ORM assessment for that specific
        FCF flight.
        5.21.1.6. Ideally, conduct FCFs in daylight, VMC. OG/CCs may authorize a flight under a com-
        bination of VMC and IMC. Begin the flight in VMC. If the aircraft and all systems are operating
        properly, the crew may proceed IFR through cloud cover to “VFR on Top” for the altitude phase
        of the flight.
        5.21.1.7. If a malfunction occurs during a FCF, the MXG/CC may subsequently release the air-
        craft for flight providing the malfunction is not related to the condition generating the FCF, and
        the original condition operationally checked good.
        5.21.1.8. The OG/CC or deployed MC may authorize temporary waivers to FCF procedures for
        aircrew qualification when operationally necessary. Permanent waivers require MAJCOM/A3/
        DO approval IAW Chapter 1.
     5.21.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis aircrews are not normally qualified or allowed to perform FCFs.
     The procedures below will be followed at Travis AFB when an FCF flight is requested:
        5.21.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews or squadrons will contact 60 OG/OGV if requested to per-
        form an FCF flight by an outside agency. 60 OG/OGV will work with the C-17 Sustainment
        Group at Warner Robbins and the local Travis Boeing Site Manager to schedule a C-17 FCF under
        the Boeing Sustainment contract, if able. Otherwise, see restrictions in 5.21.1.

5.22. Participation in Aerial Events. See AFI 11-209, Air Force Aerial Events, AFI 11-246V6, Air
Force Aircraft Demonstrations, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement. Aerial events must be sanc-
tioned and individually approved by the appropriate military authority, and the Federal Aviation Admin-
istration (FAA). AFI 11-209 and AMC Supp 1 clearly identifies events sanctioned for support, and
specifies the approval authority for each type, AFI 11-209 also stipulates that units participating in aerial
events will ensure activities are coordinated with the FAA through the regional Air Force representative.
     5.22.1. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 or 349 OSS/OSO is the OPR for coordination of airshows/flyovers
     with the user(s) and higher headquarters. Aircrews participating in these events will work closely with
     the mission scheduler. PICs will receive a briefing from Current Operations on event requirements.
     5.22.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Aerial reviews and fly-by’s are not intended to demonstrate the perfor-
     mance limits of the aircraft. Aircraft commanders will operate the aircraft IAW flight manual proce-
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            79


  dures. In no case will an aircraft commander respond to an impromptu request for changes to the
  program which would result in the execution of maneuvers not previously approved by the OG/CC.
  5.22.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Only certified aircrews will fly aerial demonstrations. 60/349 OG crews
  see below for certification guidance. Certified Aircraft Commanders may perform PF, PNF, or Safety
  Observer duties. Certified FPs may only perform PNF or Safety Observer duties.
  5.22.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews will only fly AMC approved demonstration profiles. The aerial
  demonstration profiles are available on the HQ AMC/A3OO web page at https://private.amc.af.mil/
  a3/a33/A33O/Documents/C-17%20Std%20Profile%20(IC%202004-1).pdf.
  5.22.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Additional Aerial Demo Guidance.
     5.22.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Comply with procedures and restrictions published in AFI 11-209,
     AF Participation in Aerial Events and its AMC supplement, as well as AFI 11-246 Vol 6, AF Air-
     craft Demonstrations.
     5.22.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Each team (full crew) must brief OG/CC prior to departing for any
     air show.
  5.22.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Aerial Demo Training and Certification Program.
     5.22.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Due to the large number of requests for C-17 demonstrations, 60 OG
     desire is three demo teams and 349 OG desire is two demo teams (a demo team is not required for
     static displays).
     5.22.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Pilot and copilot aerial demonstration upgrade requires: A simulator
     sortie, practicing the AMC/A3 approved profiles (IP is not required and simulator may be waived
     by the SQ/CC) and one flight with a 60/349 OGV aerial demonstration qualified evaluator pilot. If
     no 60/349 OGV aerial demonstration pilots are available, the OG/CC may approve, on a
     case-by-case basis, another highly qualified aerial demonstration pilot to perform the training/
     checkout.
     5.22.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Pilot and copilot aerial demonstration upgrade requires a Review
     and Certification Board. The candidate’s FEF, AF Form 1381 will be annotated with the follow-
     ing: Aerial Demonstration Pilot or Copilot. Certified pilots may perform pilot or copilot duties.
     5.22.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) PICs will brief required copilot, safety observer and loadmaster
     duties for the aerial demonstration.
     5.22.6.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Pilots and Copilots.
         5.22.6.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Demo pilots will be experienced instructors or evaluators.
         5.22.6.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Demo copilots should be aircraft commanders or above.
         5.22.6.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Pilot and copilot qualification upgrades must be done on a
         local training sortie prior to the day of departure for an air show (no same-day upgrades). Such
         training is normally concurrent with Safety Observer, Narrator, and/or LM upgrade training.
     5.22.6.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Narrators, Loadmasters and Safety Observers.
         5.22.6.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Narrators are normally trained by a previously trained narrator
         or OGV.
         5.22.6.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Safety Observers must be trained by demo-qualified pilots.
80                                           AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


            5.22.6.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Loadmasters must be trained by demo-qualified pilots or pre-
            viously trained loadmasters.
            5.22.6.6.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Under extenuating circumstances, Safety Observers and LMs
            may be trained/upgraded during a practice sortie (day of departure) prior to departing Travis
            for an air show. In such cases, a thorough pre-brief is required (normal launch SOE is inade-
            quate).
        5.22.6.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Demonstration training and practice sorties:
            5.22.6.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Normally, a practice demo (no PF, PNF qualification
            upgrades) is planned prior to departing Travis for an air show. As a minimum, the demo crew
            (pilot, copilot, safety, and loadmaster) will have flown a practice demo together (within 30
            days of the event) prior to actual demo (OG/CC is waiver authority).
            5.22.6.7.2. (Added-TRAVIS) 60/349 AMW/CC is approval authority for all demos (training,
            practice, and aerial performance) in the Travis local pattern. A NOTAM will be issued via
            base operations stating the times and altitude block required for the demo practice.

5.23. Not Used.

5.24. Traffic Alert and Collision System (TCAS). It is imperative to follow resolution advisories
(RAs) to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may increase
the probability of a midair collision.
     5.24.1. Reaction to a traffic advisory (TA) or resolution advisory (RA). PNF will select the TCAS
     PPI display on a convenient MFD.
        5.24.1.1. PF duties during an RA.
            5.24.1.1.1. Press the autopilot disconnect to engage TCAS guidance.
            5.24.1.1.2. Promptly and smoothly maneuver to follow flight director guidance. Crosscheck
            the TCAS PPI display’s vertical speed guidance and maintain the minimum vertical speed in
            the green band.
            5.24.1.1.3. Respond immediately to any “increase” or “reversal” RA maneuver advisories.
NOTE: The flight director is the primary guidance for RA maneuver. The CAWS alert may lag behind
the flight director guidance when multiple messages occur.
            5.24.1.1.4. If in a turn during an RA, continue with the turn while complying with TCAS
            advisories. If an “increase climb” RA is issued, level wings prior to increasing climb rate.
            5.24.1.1.5. When “clear of conflict” advisory announced, promptly and smoothly return the
            aircraft to its previously assigned (or amended) clearance.
NOTE: The CAWS “altitude” warning may disrupt or mask the “clear of conflict” message. An alternate
means to determine when the aircraft is clear of conflict is when the FMAs revert back to basic modes.
        5.24.1.2. PNF duties during an RA.
            5.24.1.2.1. Confirm the action being performed by the PF. Advise the PF of any deviation
            from the vertical path indicated by flight director guidance, the TCAS PPI display, and/or
            other annunciations.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              81


           5.24.1.2.2. Clear airspace into which aircraft will maneuver.
           5.24.1.2.3. Advise ATC as soon as possible if you are deviating from your assigned clearance.
           5.24.1.2.4. When “clear of conflict” advisory is announced, notify ATC you are returning to
           previously assigned clearance or acknowledge any amended clearance.
   5.24.2. Multi-ship formation.
       5.24.2.1. Lead aircraft (or designated alternates) will operate TCAS in the “TA only” mode. Con-
       sideration should be given to having the last aircraft in multi-element formations operating TCAS
       in “TA only” mode.
       5.24.2.2. For formations utilizing SKE and TCAS overlay to verify formation position, all aircraft
       will operate TCAS in accordance with TO 1C-17A-1.
   5.24.3. Low-level operations. This system was not designed for use in the low level environment, but
   could provide valuable awareness of light aircraft or other military aircraft using military airspace.
   Use of “TA only” mode is recommended.
   5.24.4. Air refueling operations. TCAS may be used to help acquire and track the tanker(s) during the
   rendezvous. Use “TA only” mode inside the ARIP and be aware TCAS will be unavailable once the
   IFF is set to STBY.
   5.24.5. Additional information.
       5.24.5.1. If a GPWS or stall warning occurs, terminate the RA maneuver.
       5.24.5.2. Excessive climb and descent rates could lead to inadvertent TA/RA. Pilots should limit
       climb and descent rates when approaching the level off altitude.
       5.24.5.3. Use the above/below/normal settings as appropriate for the phase of flight and mission.
       Consideration should be given to selecting the below setting prior to tactical descents and while at
       high altitude cruise. This setting will help the crew clear for traffic in the event of an emergency
       descent.
   5.24.6. TCAS event documentation. The PIC will document all pertinent information surrounding an
   RA event on the AF IMT 657 HATR, and submit the report to the nearest air force safety office.

5.25. Radar Altimeter. Any crewmember detecting the “TOO LOW” annunciation (PFD/HUD) will
immediately notify the pilot flying. Terrain clearance and aircraft position must be verified.

5.26. Buddy Starts. Buddy starts may be performed when approved by the OG/CC or DIRMOBFOR.
This authority may be delegated to the squadron or mission commander when the unit is deployed. This
authorization will not be construed to allow repeated buddy starts at various scheduled en route stops.

5.27. Not Used.

5.28. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to recover an
aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi; ground crews will accom-
plish aircraft recovery. Unless an emergency dictates otherwise, aircrews may only accomplish recovery
if there is no aircraft damage, the surface will support the aircraft, and the PIC has coordinated with

appropriate MAJCOM headquarters maintenance authorities through 18 AF TACC, or appropriate C2
agency.

5.29. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) / Terrain Alert Warning System (TAWS). T h e
following escape maneuvers and flight crew procedures apply to aircrews flying aircraft equipped with
GPWS/TAWS. Exceptions to these policies are addressed in the ASRR.
     5.29.1. For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in sight, the PF will
     call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear terrain.
     5.29.2. For operations at night or in IMC, if an aural warning is heard, immediately and simulta-
     neously rotate the aircraft to establish a climb (FPV above the horizon line) while rolling wings level,
     and add maximum power until the warning has ceased and adequate terrain clearance is verified.

WARNING
Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning.
Failure to roll wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall margin at heavy air-
craft gross weights.
     5.29.3. Ensure the mode of the GPWS/TAWS is commensurate with the aircraft’s phase of flight.

5.30. Use of Automation. Use appropriate levels of automation as required by the flight conditions. The
first priority is to fly the aircraft. The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and Mission Computer
(MC) are intended to aid in workload management, not complicate it. As the flight situation changes, do
not feel locked into a level of automation.
     5.30.1. Avoid the following common pitfalls associated with over-reliance, misuse, or misunder-
     standing of automation.
        5.30.1.1. Fixating on the automation. One pilot should always remain heads up. Establish clear
        roles for computer related tasks. Announce “pilot heads down” or “copilot heads down” when the
        task requires focusing significant attention on the mission computer in flight.
        5.30.1.2. Misprioritizing programming tasks. Extensive reprogramming during critical phases of
        flight or during periods of high workload should be avoided.
        5.30.1.3. Mode awareness. The pilot flying (PF) should make AFCS panel changes during cou-
        pled operations. During uncoupled flight, the PF should direct the pilot not flying (PNF) to make
        changes to the AFCS panel. Confirm all mode changes by observing the correct flight mode
        annunciator (FMA) indications. Engagement of the autopilot and autothrottles should be
        announced.
        5.30.1.4. Assuming automation is programmed correctly. Pilots will back up each other when
        making AFCS panel settings or programming the MC.
        5.30.1.5. Over-reliance on automation. Practice flight operations at all levels of automation to be
        proficient. If the automation is not performing as expected, take over manually.

5.31. Standard AFCS Terminology. Under certain conditions, complete commands may be required.
This would require an action, the proper axis, then the setting, e.g., “SELECT HEADING 060.”
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               83


   5.31.1. SELECT or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which results in the
   value being placed in the “Engaged” (Top) portion of the FMA. SELECT is normally used with rotary
   knobs labeled “SEL,” however, ENGAGE is acceptable. The FD, TOGA, APPR, ATT, AD, AP, AT
   are normally engaged. For added clarification, selecting an EPR rating means pressing a thrust rating
   button on the SED panel; engaging EPR means pressing the AFCS “EPR” pushbutton.
   5.31.2. ARM directs the selection of a value on the AFCS panel which results in the value being
   placed in the “Armed” (Bottom) portion of an FMA.
   5.31.3. For LNAV and VNAV selections, command the actual value intended, not “ARM LNAV” or
   “ENGAGE VNAV.” For example, “ARM VOR” or “ENGAGE VPROF” are proper commands.
   5.31.4. Standard terminology is very precise, but can unnecessarily congest cockpit communication.
   In-flight context generally allows simplified direction and execution. For example “ARM 10,000” is
   obviously an altitude command and does not require the noun “altitude” to clearly communicate the
   PF’s desires. Airspeeds appended with “PITCH” or “THRUST” are sufficiently clear and do not
   require the use of the noun “speed.” VERT SPDS appended with “UP” or “DN” are sufficiently clear.
   If requested by the PF, ATC vectors (headings) may be automatically selected, and altitudes automat-
   ically armed by the PNF. At any time the PNF is unsure of the command, he/she will ask for clarifica-
   tion. If the PF sees an uncommanded FMA, he/she will clearly restate the command and ensure the
   actual value is made.

5.32. C-17 HUD/MFD Endorsement. The C-17 MFD is certified as a single medium display, and may
be used as a primary flight reference (PFR). Due to the lack of a full-time attitude reference, the heads up
display (HUD) is endorsed as a PFR as long as one primary flight display is present on an MFD. To the
maximum extent possible, keep a primary flight display (PFD) on one of the MFDs at all times. When
mission requirements dictate, the PFD may be replaced with another display for short periods of time.

5.33. C-17 Engine Start Policy. If available, maintenance personnel should act as “ground” during
engine starts. Any C-17 crewmember may also fulfill this requirement. If no maintenance personnel are
available and crew duties limit the availability of a crewmember, the engines may be started without
someone outside the aircraft. If this option is used, ensure all crewmembers are thoroughly briefed.
5.34. (Added-TRAVIS) PFPS computers. PFPS computers are available for check-out to pilots. Kits
include laptop computer, printer, and miscellaneous equipment for autonomous mission planning. Con-
tact 60 OSS/AFMSS at 424-3195 NLT 24 hours prior to mission departure to check out a kit.
5.35. (Added-TRAVIS) Additional Restrictions.
   5.35.1. (Added-TRAVIS) All liquids passed to the pilot or copilot will be passed around their out-
   side shoulder and not over the center console. In addition, to prevent water damage to electronic com-
   ponents, crews will ensure cockpit windows are closed prior to departing aircraft.
5.36. (Added-TRAVIS) Static Displays.
   5.36.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Crewmembers will ensure guests do not tamper with aircraft components,
   smoke on or near the aircraft, and will perform a thorough FOD check both inside/outside the aircraft
   following the static display.
   5.36.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If side emergency escape hatches and/or troop doors are removed for
   lighting and ventilation, install the nylon safety straps at each open exit.

     5.36.3. (Added-TRAVIS) If unable to comply with the above requirements or AFI 11-209, restrict
     access to the cargo compartment to 10 feet away from the aircraft.
     5.36.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews should prepare aircraft IAW TO 00-80G-27, Make Safe for
     Static Display C-17A. A copy of this technical order is maintained in the FCIF library.
5.37. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis AFB Ramp/Taxi Restrictions.
     5.37.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft shall not be taxied, nor shall engines be started or run up within
     50 feet of any fuel servicing operations or 50 feet of any spill until the spill has been removed and the
     area rendered safe by the Fire Department.
5.38. (Added-TRAVIS) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC).
     5.38.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Changes to the scheduled takeoff time are authorized and will be coordi-
     nated through Travis Command Post (TCP) (or 60 OSS/OSO if one or more days prior) as soon as
     possible based on the amount of training time required.
     5.38.2. (Added-TRAVIS) First Half ERCC Crew. Immediately notify TCP of any discrepancy that
     might prevent the airplane from being operated by the second half crew. Plan to terminate no earlier
     than 30 minutes prior to the scheduled ERCC time. Early termination must be coordinated through
     TCP to ensure the second half crew is ready. Call TCP 30 minutes prior to landing with ETA, mainte-
     nance status and estimated landing fuel. Accomplish the Operational Stop Checklist. Stop at the
     ERCC spot designated in TRAVISAFBI 13-101, Aerodrome Procedures and Air Traffic Control,
     paragraph 1.14.5. (the intersection of taxiways G and N on the diagonal corner with the nose pointed
     towards the runway) or as directed by ground control.
     5.38.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Second Half ERCC Crew. The new PIC assumes command after the crew
     has been briefed on aircraft status, one of the pilots is monitoring the brakes, and the exceptional
     release, if required, has been signed.

   6.3.12. Obtain terrain charts for unfamiliar destinations if available.
       6.3.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Use of Terrain Charts. Pilots will use terrain charts on operational
       missions and off-station trainers for all unfamiliar airfields or comparable airfield information in
       issued Tactics binders. A properly “CHUMED” terrain chart will be used for all departures which
       require a terrain chart review. The type of chart to be used depends on what is available for that
       part of the world. Any chart showing prominent details is acceptable, such as TPCs, sectionals,
       and JOGs. GNCs and JNCs are not acceptable.

     6.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) A current list of required publications for each crew specialty is listed in the
     FCBs.
     6.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews are required to carry a Publications Kit on board the aircraft for all
     missions. The Pubs Kit contains all of the required paper publications as well as a government laptop
     with current E-Pubs disk for other publications. Crewmembers are still required to maintain and carry
     individual crew member checklists and inserts. Pilots are required to carry the Travis AFB C-17
     Inflight Guide on local training missions only.

6.5. Airfield Review. Aircrews will consult the web-based airfield database maintained by HQ AMC/
A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch) and comply with the GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR for updates to airfield
operability and weight bearing capacity.

6.6. Aircrew Intelligence Briefing. Before leaving home station on missions departing the United
States, crews will receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly polit-
ical and military development in the area in which they will be flying. Crews must also receive an intelli-
gence brief prior to entering specific area of operations (AOR). In theater, aircrews should receive
intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location (FOL), or en route stop, and thereaf-
ter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelligence value to the local
intelligence officers as soon as possible to ensure timely dissemination of mission reports (MISREPs) at
the completion of each mission.

   6.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Schedule pre-mission briefings at least 24 hours prior to launch by calling
   4-5572 (349 OG call 4-5040). Intel hours of operation are 0730-1630, Monday thru Friday. Intel pro-
   vides the 60 AMW/CP an after hours on-call list.
   6.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew members are required to have an ISOPREP on file and need to
   review it every 6 months or upon entry into the CENTCOM AOR and on each potential combat mis-
   sion. Please contact 4-5572 (349 OG call 4-5040) for assistance in the matter between 0800-1600,
   Monday thru Friday.

Section 6B—Predeparture

6.7. Integrated Management Tool (IMT) Account. Pilots will obtain an IMT account prior to operat-
ing on IFM-planned sorties. Download aircrew departure papers using the IMT account, at locations with-
out an AMC C2 presence. For operational missions, ensure IMT account passwords are active prior to
departing home station.
   6.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) When unable to download departure papers via IMT, Travis Command
   Post can provide the aircrew with a winded flight plan (ACFP .rte file) from TACC. The latest flight
   plan is posted 6 hrs before planned mission takeoff time. The file should be available at the weather
   desk. A laptop is provided in Base Operations in the mission planning room to convert the flight plan
   using A/W/E to a format suitable for upload in the jet.

6.8. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF).
   6.8.1. Crewmembers will review FCIF, Volume 1, before all missions or ground aircrew duties, and
   update the FCIF currency record with the latest FCIF item number, date, and crewmember’s initials.
   6.8.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF review or joining a mission en route will receive an FCIF
   update from a primary aircrew member counterpart on the mission.
   6.8.3. Crewmembers not assigned or attached to the unit operating a mission will certify FCIF review
   by entering the last FCIF number and their initials behind their name on the file copy of the flight
   authorization or file copy of their crew orders.

6.9. Flight Crew Bulletins (FCB). Items in the FCB may include local procedures and policies concern-
ing equipment and personnel generally not found in any other publications

     6.11.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Base Operations maintains local and global navigation kits. Kits may be
     picked up beside the Base Operations desk. Return navigation kits in the same condition that they
     were received.
     6.11.5. (Added-TRAVIS) World-Wide Navigation Database (WWNDB) CDs are available for
     sign-out at the Base Operations desk. Crews will sign-out a disk and store it in the navigation kit prior
     to home-station departure. The disk will remain with the navigation kit if the crew changes aircraft.
     Upon return to home-station, turn in the WWNDB CD to the Base Operations desk.

6.12. Briefing Requirements.
     6.12.1. Pre-Departure Briefing Items. The PIC will contact the local C2 agency to confirm mission
     requirements. The PIC and controlling agency jointly share responsibility to identify special briefing
     requirements. Briefings may include buffer zone, electronic warfare activities, SAFE PASSAGE,
     Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), diplomatic clearance, hazardous cargo, anti-hijacking proce-
     dures, operations and safety supplements to flight manuals, and OPORD procedure.
     6.12.2. Pilot in Command Briefing. Cover all applicable items of the operations briefing, including
     MAJCOM, NAF, unit Special Interest Items (SIIs), and ORM level. Brief crewmembers on the spe-
     cific mission details if not previously accomplished. Use MAJCOM approved briefing guides. For
     tactical missions, additional briefings may be required. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A chapter 2 for addi-
     tional briefing information.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              93


     6.12.2.1. In the en route system, the PIC will ensure that an aircrew briefing is conducted prior to
     the first sortie of the day. As a minimum, brief crewmembers on specific mission details for that
     day's sortie(s) and the ORM level for the mission. Complete this briefing prior to engine start.
     6.12.2.2. NVG Briefing Requirements. For missions conducting NVG operations crews will
     review and coordinate NVG failure procedures for all phases of the mission. Any crewmember
     who experiences NVG problems will inform the rest of the crew. If unable to regain the use of
     NVGs, the PIC will consider crew experience, mission priority, and Intel, tactics and threat brief-
     ings in determining if the mission can be completed safely. During cargo compartment emergen-
     cies, return to normal lighting until the emergency is resolved. Discuss actions for Smoke and
     Fumes in the aircraft.
  6.12.3. Specialized Briefing. Use specialized briefings to detail operating procedures or SIIs peculiar
  to various crew positions, and to answer questions relating to those specialties. Use a MAJCOM
  approved specialized briefing guide.
  6.12.4. Weather Briefings. The PIC will obtain a briefing on current weather, trends, and forecast for
  the proposed route, destination, and alternates. The PIC will brief primary crewmembers on appropri-
  ate weather conditions before departure.
     6.12.4.1. Aircrews flying flight-managed sorties will use the weather briefing provided with the
     IFM aircrew departure papers. Local weather flights/agencies may update local takeoff weather
     data, but aircrews, working through their flight manager/dispatcher, will use 18 AF TACC
     weather operations (or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) supporting the theater
     AMOCC) as the final arbiter for weather-related issues and further updates.
     6.12.4.2. On sorties not planned by a flight manager, crews should obtain weather information
     from their local weather flight or the OWS responsible for weather support at their location.
     6.12.4.3. If adequate services are not available, and the crew cannot contact their home weather
     flight, OWS, or 18 AF TACC weather operations, obtain weather through any means available
     prior to mission accomplishment.
     6.12.4.4. Weather information is permitted from US Military weather services, any
     FAA-approved weather source, or any host nation civil or military weather source.
     6.12.4.5. Verbal weather briefings are authorized for local flights. Face-to-face briefings are not
     required.
  6.12.5. Buffer Zone. Prior to operating an aircraft within or adjacent to an established buffer zone, the
  PIC will ensure primary crewmembers are briefed on current buffer zone procedures outlined in
  appropriate directives.
     6.12.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Anytime the airplane is flown near a buffer zone, all available navi-
     gation aids, including radar, if operational, will be used to monitor navigation accuracy.
  6.12.6. Peacetime and Wartime SAFE PASSAGE Procedures. Pilots must be familiar with peacetime
  and wartime safe passage of friendly military aircraft (if applicable).
  6.12.7. IFM Briefing. PICs will thoroughly review the aircrew departure papers provided for IFM
  sorties. When time and circumstances permit, the PIC, or designated representative, will contact the
  flight manager before signing the flight plan.
94                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        6.12.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) IFM products do not contain secure information from the ATO or
        SPINS. Tactical routings and threats must be reviewed prior to departure. Crews will contact Intel/
        Tactics prior to departure as required.

6.13. Call Signs.
     6.13.1. Training Missions. Aircraft will use the unit static call sign prefix followed by a 2-digit suffix
     assigned by the parent unit.
        6.13.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis AFB unit static call sign prefixes are as identified in the Wing
        Operations Policy Summary.
     6.13.2. Operational Missions. Use call signs assigned by OPORD, FRAG, or diplomatic clearance. If
     no call sign has been assigned, use unit static call signs. When flying AMC missions, and no other call
     sign had been assigned, use the “REACH” call sign followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft
     was built and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number (or as required by diplomatic clearance). To
     complete flight plans, put the letters "RCH" followed by the last digit of the year the aircraft was built
     and the last 3 digits of the aircraft tail number.
     EXCEPTION: For aircraft 97000041 through 97000045 use RCH 9741 through 9745.
     6.13.3. The Reach 01 and 18 call signs are reserved for the AMC/CC and 18 AF/CC.
     6.13.4. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). For actual AE missions, use the call sign “Evac" followed by
     the five-digit aircraft number (example, Evac 12345) or mission designator. Refer to FLIP GP Chap-
     ter 4. When the AE portion of the mission is completed, normal call signs will be used. This does not
     alleviate the responsibility to use diplomatically cleared call signs when required.

6.14. Not Used.

6.15. Flight Plan/Data Verification. All waypoint data retrieved from a database should be verified by
latitude/longitude from current FLIP, or by verifying bearing/distance from the mission computer matches
the computer flight plan, or similar document, for each waypoint entered. Reference paragraph 11.2. for
additional procedures

6.16. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, Instrument Flight Procedures, this
chapter, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplements. Regardless of the type of departure flown (IFR/
VFR), review the following (as appropriate): IFR Departure Procedure, instrument approach plate, NOT-
AMS, GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR Giant Report, and suitable terrain charts.
     6.16.1. VFR Departures.
NOTE: VFR departures will not be flown in lieu of obstacle clearance planning.
        6.16.1.1. VFR departures are authorized when there is no authorized IFR departure method for
        the airport, when the aircraft cannot depart using one of the IFR departure methods contained in
        AFI 11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1, when operational requirements dictate (i.e. tactical neces-
        sity), or when most of the mission is planned as a VFR flight for training. VFR departures require
        detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain are avoided.
        6.16.1.2. The minimum climb performance for VFR departures is determined by ensuring all the
        following conditions are met:
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              95


           6.16.1.2.1. All-engine climb capability ensures obstacle avoidance along the departure route.
           6.16.1.2.2. One Engine Inoperative (OEI) climb capability shall ensure departure or emer-
           gency return route provides obstacle avoidance.
NOTE: If unable to comply with any of the above conditions, download cargo/fuel or delay until condi-
tions that are more favorable exist.
       6.16.1.3. Refer to FLIP for host nation VFR requirements before flying VFR outside of CONUS.
       6.16.1.4. When departing VFR, maintain VFR cloud clearances until obtaining an IFR clearance
       or reaching the IFR MEA.
   6.16.2. IFR Departures: Aircrews must use an approved IFR departure method as outlined in AFI
   11-202V3 and AFMAN 11-217V1.
       6.16.2.1. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, depart VFR IAW para-
       graph 6.16.1. An IFR departure is not authorized at airfields without an instrument approach.
       6.16.2.2. IFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain are
       avoided. Adhere to screen height/departure end of runway (DER) requirements for IFR departure
       planning (AFMAN 11-217V1).
NOTE: Screen height requirements for departures depend on the agency that wrote the departure and/or
the airfield where the departure is being flown. There is no standard or easy way for crews to determine
screen height requirements. Therefore, when using departures other than those listed below, or when any
doubt exists about which screen height to use, plan to cross the DER at 35 feet (minimum) unless you can
ascertain a different screen height requirement from an appropriate authority.
           6.16.2.2.1. Special Departure Procedure: Published on SDP.
           6.16.2.2.2. USAF/USN produced SID or USAF/USN/USMC airfield: Zero feet.
           6.16.2.2.3. US Army, FAA SID, and Joint Use Airfield within the US: 35 feet unless pub-
           lished.
           6.16.2.2.4. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Military Airports: 35 feet.
           6.16.2.2.5. NATO Countries (except US and Canada) Civil Airports: 16 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.6. Other ICAO nations: 16 feet or as published.
           6.16.2.2.7. All others: 35 feet unless published.
       6.16.2.3. Aircraft must meet the published climb gradient for the departure runway with all
       engines operating. If no minimum climb gradient is published, 200 ft/nm will be used.
NOTE: In the event the aircraft is unable to meet the published ALL ENGINE climb gradient, download
cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable conditions exist.
       6.16.2.4. Use one of the following methods to ensure the aircraft can vertically clear all obstacles
       along the planned departure route with OEI:
           6.16.2.4.1. Special Departure Procedure (SDP). SDPs are MDS-specific OEI escape proce-
           dures intended only for emergency use. They are applicable after the loss of an engine and,
           where available, will be used for engine-out departure planning. Retrieve current SDPs from
           the Jeppesen AF Opsdata website. ‘Ad hoc’ requests for fields not currently listed may be
96                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


             requested through OGV. OGV will forward requests to HQ AMC/A37V NLT 48 hrs prior to
             scheduled departure. HQ AMC/A37V authorizes the use of Ad Hoc SDPs for a maximum of
             30 days after the analysis date. The SDP analysis date is located in the upper left-hand corner
             of the takeoff performance sheet.
             6.16.2.4.2. Minimum climb gradient. The TERPS standard minimum climb gradient is 200 ft/
             nm, which is based on the standard obstacle clearance surface (OCS) of 152 ft/nm plus the
             required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 ft/nm. If an SDP is not available, the crew must
             ensure compliance with any obstacle-based minimum climb gradients for the selected depar-
             ture, with one-engine inoperative. Minimum climb gradients may be published as a ‘Trouble
             T’ restriction in the IFR Take-off Minimums section of FLIP or on a SID. When required for
             mission accomplishment, crews may subtract 48’/nm from published climb gradients before
             computing engine-out takeoff data. Minimum climb gradients do not take into account low,
             close in obstacles (obstacles or terrain 200’ AGL and below) which should normally be pub-
             lished as a NOTE on the SID or IFR departure procedure (Trouble T). Crews must also ensure
             the aircraft can clear these close in obstacles.
NOTE: If the requirements of 6.16.2.4. cannot be met, download cargo/fuel or delay until more favorable
conditions exist.

6.17. Weather Minimums for Takeoff. Departures with weather below landing minimums is autho-
rized IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3, Ch 8. When weather is below approach and landing minimums (ceiling and
visibility) a departure alternate is required (see paragraph 6.19.). For operational missions, touchdown
RVR must be at least 1200 and roll out RVR must be at least 1000, for all others it is 1600, see Table 6.3.
for additional guidance.

Table 6.3. Weather Minimums for Takeoff.
Mission          Visibility     Remarks
Operational      RVR            When RVR is less than 1600, but equal to or greater than RVR 1000,
                 1200/1000      the crew may take off if mission priority dictates, provided the
                                runway has dual RVR readouts and displays a minimum of RVR
                                1200 on the touchdown end and RVR 1000 on the rollout end and
                                runway centerline lighting is operational. For any takeoff below
                                RVR 1600, the crew must be fully qualified.
All Others       RVR 1600       Touchdown RVR will be used to determine visibility requirements

     6.17.1. If no RVR readout is available for the departure runway, visibility must be reported to be 1/2
     mile (800 meters).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                97

6.18. Alternate Planning. Select alternate airports meeting the requirements of AFI 11-202V3. Choose
alternates that best meet mission requirements and conserve fuel; they should not be within the same ter-
minal area, if terminal forecasts are marginal. Select alternates that are not restricted by FLIP, FCG, or
diplomatic clearances, and are compatible with the mission load and performance characteristics of the
aircraft. The PIC retains final authority in the choice of alternates; however, selection by support agencies
normally should be used if they meet the above criteria and the aircraft has already been serviced.

6.19. Departure Alternates.
   6.19.1. A departure alternate is required if ceiling or visibility is below landing minimums for an
   available approach (at departure aerodrome). Do not use Category II ILS minimums to determine if a
   departure alternate is required.
   6.19.2. Suitability of Departure Alternates. When a departure alternate is required, the aircraft must
   be capable of maintaining the MEA or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever
   is higher, to the alternate using OEI performance criteria. To qualify as a departure alternate, the air-
   field must meet one of the following conditions:
       6.19.2.1. Existing weather at an alternate within 30 minutes flying time must be equal to or better
       than the published approach minimums and forecast to remain so until 1 hour after takeoff, but in
       no case forecast to be lower than 200-1/2 (RVR 2400), or;
       6.19.2.2. The existing weather at an alternate within 2 hours flying time must be at least 500-1
       above the lowest compatible published approach minimums, but not less than 600-2 for a preci-
       sion approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after
       ETA at the alternate.

6.20. Destination Requirements (for filing purposes). The forecast destination weather will be accord-
ing to AFI 11-202V3 and the following:
   6.20.1. File two alternates when:
98                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


        6.20.1.1. The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for an available
        DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach.
        6.20.1.2. The forecast ceiling OR visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for
        all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (for example Jeppesen
        approaches), the minimum required ceiling shall be computed by taking the published HAA or
        HAT and rounding it up to the nearest one hundred feet (or as determined by MAJCOM TERPs
        review). For example, a Jeppesen VOR approach with a published HAA of 642 feet would require
        a forecasted ceiling of 700 feet.
        6.20.1.3. The forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR.
     6.20.2. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the departure or destination aerodrome
     is outside the CONUS. (EXCEPTION: Intra-theater flights outside CONUS that do not exceed
     3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3.)
     6.20.3. A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome, which due to its unique geo-
     graphic location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. The forecast
     weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
        6.20.3.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at ETA and
        forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
        6.20.3.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published mini-
        mums for an available non-precision approach, for ETA plus 2 hours. However, if a precision
        approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be intermittently below non-precision approach
        minimums (excluding ASR), but not below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
NOTE: Use 1+15 holding fuel when filing to an island or remote destination. This includes the normal
45 minutes of reserve/holding fuel, and 30 additional minutes in lieu of an alternate
     6.20.4. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at latitudes greater than
     59° North, use 1+15 holding fuel.

6.21. Adverse Weather.
     6.21.1. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence is prohibited.
        6.21.1.1. Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what type
        of aircraft reported the encounter, to gain a more accurate picture for their route of flight. The
        C-17 is a category 3 aircraft for turbulence.
        6.21.1.2. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all passengers are seated, with seat belts fastened,
        when areas of moderate or greater turbulence are encountered or anticipated. WARNING: Seri-
        ous injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters
        moderate or severe turbulence.
     6.21.2. Flight into areas of forecast or reported severe icing is prohibited. Prolonged operation, such
     as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided. NOTE: Air Force Weather
     Agency technical note AFWA/TN 98/002, Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is
     equivalent to moderate icing and freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               99


      6.21.2.1. Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain. Do not takeoff under conditions of
      freezing drizzle except when the aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced IAW flight manual
      procedures.
      6.21.2.2. Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0°C, may cause ice or
      frost to accumulate on aircraft surfaces. When an aircraft requires de-icing/anti-icing prior to take-
      off, refer to the following:
          6.21.2.2.1. Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective flight
          manual. Aircrews will be familiar with, and follow all restrictions in their associated flight
          manual with respect to anti-ice/de-ice procedures and holdover times.
          6.21.2.2.2. MIL-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any anti-icing ben-
          efit, and therefore do not have holdover times. As a guide, for approved anti-icing fluids,
          crews may use published anti-icing holdover times IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing Pro-
          cedures, and AFFSA holdover tables located at the HQ AFFSA website. The holdover time
          begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature, and dilu-
          tion of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-apply fluid if required.
          6.21.2.2.3. In all cases, PICs will ensure a visual inspection of the aircraft is completed within
          5 minutes of departure.
   6.21.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds. If
   unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet, avoid them by
   at least:
      6.21.3.1. 20NMs at or above flight level FL230.
      6.21.3.2. 10NMs below FL230.
      6.21.3.3. 5NMs for tactical low-level operations provided the outside air temperature is at or
      above 0°C at flight altitude.. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunder-
      storm.
CAUTION: Aircraft damage may occur 20NMs or more from any thunderstorms. Aircrews must famil-
iarize themselves with information on thunderstorm development and hazard.
   6.21.4. The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used to
   assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather. It should never be consid-
   ered a normal avoidance procedure. When relying exclusively on ground-based radar for weather
   avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain
   VMC by:
      6.21.4.1. Changing routing.
      6.21.4.2. Diverting to alternate.
      6.21.4.3. Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance.
   6.21.5. Aircrews should avoid flying in areas of recently dissipated thunderstorms and advected
   clouds(horizontal movement of clouds caused by wind) downwind of thunderstorms.
   6.21.6. In order to minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or departing an air-
   port in an area where thunderstorms are occurring or are forecast:
100                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         6.21.6.1. Attempt to maintain VMC.
         6.21.6.2. Maintain at least 5NMs separation from heavy rain showers.
         6.21.6.3. Avoid areas of high lightning potential, i.e., clouds within plus or minus 5,000 feet of
         the freezing level or plus or minus 8°C of the freezing level.
NOTE: Approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms are within 10NMs. The
thunderstorms must not be producing any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds,
gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to
be moving in the direction of the route of flight (to include the planned missed approach corridor, if appli-
cable).
      6.21.7. When performing approaches and landings at locations where temperatures are 0°C or below,
      refer to the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) Section D, Temperature Correction Chart, to correct
      MDA, DH, and other altitudes inside the FAF.
      6.21.8. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave turbulence.
      6.21.9. Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET). National Weather Service in-flight
      weather advisories are not limiting to Air Force aircraft. Contact the nearest military weather facility
      or flight service station for details, if applicable.
      6.21.10. Volcanic Dust Precautions. Aircraft flight operations in areas of forecast or known volcanic
      activity or dust is prohibited. Plan all missions to avoid volcanic activity by at least 20 NMs.
      6.21.11. Lightning Avoidance. The following conditions are most favorable for lightning strikes and
      prolonged flight in them should be avoided:
         6.21.11.1. Within 8°C of freezing.
         6.21.11.2. In clouds or in any intensity of precipitation or turbulence associated with thunder-
         storms.

6.22. Operational Risk Management (ORM). ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to mak-
ing calculated decisions on human, material, and environmental factors before, during, and after all oper-
ations. USAF policy on ORM is contained in Air Force Policy Directive 90-9, Operational Risk
Management. PICs will accomplish ORM worksheets IAW MAJCOM and local guidance as part of pre-
flight activities. (see paragraph 6.3.15.)

Section 6C—Preflight

6.23. AFTO Forms 781, Series.
      6.23.1. Review AFTO Forms 781 series before applying power to the aircraft or operating aircraft
      systems. The exceptional release must be signed before flight. A maintenance officer, maintenance
      superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the exceptional release. If one of these individu-
      als is not available, the PIC may sign the exceptional release. Ensure that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel
      Identaplate, and AIR card is aboard the aircraft.
         6.23.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In addition to reviewing the AFTO Forms 781, the crew will deter-
         mine if the aircraft is configured properly in regards to aircraft configuration, fuel, oxygen, and
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            101


      fleet requirements. Crews will promptly notify Command Post of any problems that require assis-
      tance to preclude a delay in the launch sequence.
   6.23.2. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
   might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to another sta-
   tion. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies,
   and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. AFRC crews also see AFI 11-202V3/
   AFRCSUP1. After the maintenance release is obtained, coordinate mission requirements with the
   controlling agency. The PIC’s concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.
   6.23.3. For Red X clearing procedures at stations without maintenance support refer to paragraph
   12.3.

6.24. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. Reference paragraph 12.4.

6.25. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base. Reference paragraph 12.6.

6.26. Life Support Requirements.
   6.26.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight
   from the equal time point (ETP) to a suitable recovery base, should oxygen be required. Calculate
   crew requirements using the 100 percent Oxygen Duration Chart in the flight manual. Calculate crew
   and passenger requirements based on flight at FL 250 from the ETP to the nearest suitable recovery
   base.
      6.26.1.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected and
      readily available for use from before engine start until engine shutdown.
      6.26.1.2. Normally, unpressurized flight will not be planned above 18,000 feet cabin altitude
      (except HALO). Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000 will prebreathe
      100 percent oxygen in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.35A. Reference TO 1C-17A-1-4 for addi-
      tional high altitude prebreathing restrictions.
   6.26.2. Rafts. On over water flights do not carry more passengers and crewmembers than life rafts
   will accommodate.
   6.26.3. Life preserver units (LPUs). The loadmaster will ensure an LPU is within easy reach of each
   seated passenger and aircrew member prior to takeoff on over water flights (outside gliding distance
   to land). Ensure the appropriate number and type of life preservers are aboard for over water missions
   carrying children and infants.
   6.26.4. Parachutes and Survival Kits:
      6.26.4.1. Aircraft will be configured with parachutes and ML-4 survival kits for contingency and
      airdrop missions.
          6.26.4.1.1. Operations Group Commanders retain the option of requiring parachutes and sur-
          vival kits to remain onboard for other missions.
      6.26.4.2. Personnel performing duties near an open (or suspected open) door/hatch/ramp in-flight
      will be restrained by a safety harness, or be wearing a parachute. If a troop door and/or the door/
      ramp is open and the aircraft is below 800 feet AGL or above 14,000 feet MSL, loadmaster(s) will
102                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         wear a restraint harness. The restraint harness will be hooked up no further aft than fuselage sta-
         tion 1188.
         6.26.4.3. Either wear, or pre-fit and pre-position parachutes and helmets during specified combat
         conditions or exercises.
      6.26.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Helmets and oxygen masks.
         6.26.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The equipment inspection date should be checked to ensure the
         equipment will not expire prior to mission completion. Helmet/Mask pre-fight is required prior to
         each flight to identify any component malfunctions. Helmet/mask will be returned to the Aircrew
         Life Support (ALS) shop at the end of each mission to be post flighted and report any component
         malfunctions. ALS will store helmet/mask in individual storage lockers.
         6.26.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Helmet bags will be used to transport helmets and oxygen masks.
         These items in addition to a headset are the only items authorized to be stored inside helmet bags.
         The outside pockets may be used to store flight gloves and personal items. NVG’s will be trans-
         ported in the assigned hard case to/from aircraft to protect against damage.
         6.26.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Only trained personnel may sign out NVG devices. NVGs will be
         preflighted prior to use by means of an ANV-20/20 tester, eye lane, or other available means.
         6.26.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS). The EPOS units
         will remain stored in the pouches under the sidewall seats until needed. EPOS for the centerline
         seats will be kept in the storage locker until needed. EPOS or life preserver bags should not be
         stored on the main floor because they can be mistaken for passenger bags. (35,000’ is the maxi-
         mum cruise altitude if EPOS is used as a primary emergency oxygen source.)

6.27. Fleet Service. Ensure required fleet service items are aboard the aircraft early enough to permit
inventory prior to engine start.

6.28. Cargo Documentation. Proper cargo or mail documentation will accompany each load.
      6.28.1. Load Data Information (Applicable to AFRC/ANG completing 18 AF TACC-directed mis-
      sion). At stations where there is no mobility air transportation function, the aircrew will collect the
      required load information on each leg, and submit it to the first station, which has such a function. The
      report will be submitted on AF IMT 4075, Aircraft Load Data Worksheet.

6.29. Procedures for Airlifting Hazardous Cargo.
NOTE: Installed flares do not constitute hazardous cargo. However, any additional loads of flares are not
considered aircraft equipment and shall be properly packaged and prepared IAW AFMAN 24-204.
      6.29.1. The term "hazardous cargo" as used in conjunction with airlift operations, applies to the fol-
      lowing classes and types of materials covered by AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials
      for Military Air Shipment, and contains detailed instructions on packaging, marking, labeling, and cer-
      tification requirements associated with the airlift of hazardous materials. Hazardous materials/cargo
      not properly packaged and documented in accordance with AFMAN 24-204 will be rejected for air
      shipment.
      6.29.2. Briefing Requirements. As a minimum, the PIC and/or designated crewmember must be
      briefed at the base of departure concerning onboard hazardous materials, including the following
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                           103

     utes prior to landing
     6.29.2.14. Placard requirements.
     6.29.2.15. Other special handling requirements.
  6.29.3. Cargo documentation and loading procedures.
     6.29.3.1. The loadmaster will ensure proper documentation, certification and identification of
     cargo is furnished. AFMAN 24-204 contains detailed instructions on packaging, marking, label-
     ing, and certification requirements associated with the airlift of hazardous materials.
     6.29.3.2. Hazardous materials/cargo falls into many categories and the utmost precautions must
     be observed when handling or transporting these items. Load all hazardous material to permit easy
     access in-flight without moving other cargo. Load jettisonable hazardous material to facilitate jet-
     tisoning. Adhere to the following appropriate safety precautions when loading hazardous cargo as
     appropriate:

             weight exceeds 1,000 pounds (454 kgs).
         6.29.4.2. Border Clearance and Diplomatic (DIP) Clearances. Aircrews are required to check the
         Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) for DIP Clearance requirements prior to departure on interna-
         tional flights transporting Hazardous Materials. If DIP Clearance is required the crew will verify
         that clearance has been granted prior to departure.
      6.29.5. Departure/Arrival Notifications.
         6.29.5.1. Prepare a departure message at stations when a C2 center is not available. The remarks
         section of the departure message will include: Class of hazardous material, DoD class or division
         for explosives, net explosive weight (NEW), and gross weight. If required, request special han-
         dling (e.g., isolated parking, security, technical escort teams, etc.).
         6.29.5.2. If estimated time en route (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances preclude
         timely message receipt at destination, notify the next destination of the ETA and information
         listed in paragraph 6.29.5.1. If available, C2 will relay required information to next destination.
         6.29.5.3. At least 30 minutes prior to ETA, check with destination to verify that hazardous mate-
         rial notification information, if required, was received.
         6.29.5.4. If not, unless specifically prohibited by the theater commander, FLIP, or FCG, contact
         the agency specified in FLIP/FCG, base operations dispatcher, control tower or approach control.

          6.29.5.4.6. Special handling requirements.
   6.29.6. Aircraft Parking.
      6.29.6.1. Parking of aircraft carrying hazardous materials is the responsibility of the host airfield.
      6.29.6.2. The following is provided for information only:
          6.29.6.2.1. Aircraft transporting Division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives, nuclear weapons, and Haz-
          ardous Materials requiring a SAAM, i.e., Toxic Chemical Ammunition, are normally parked at
          remote (Hot) spots.
          6.29.6.2.2. Divisions 1.3/1.4 explosives may or may not require "HOT" spot parking depend-
          ing on quantity of explosives.
          6.29.6.2.3. Transit aircraft with explosives, when cargo is not handled, may be parked at iso-
          lated locations other than "HOT" spots.
          6.29.6.2.4. Other hazardous materials normally do not require remote or isolated parking.
          6.29.6.2.5. Military installations are responsible for proper placarding of aircraft. If non-DOD
          airfields are used, it may be necessary for the aircrew to placard aircraft. Placards resemble
          hazard labels.
   6.29.7. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency. Transmit unclassified information to the
   appropriate ATC facility as follows:
      6.29.7.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      6.29.7.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      6.29.7.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      6.29.7.4. Fuel on board.
      6.29.7.5. Hazardous materials aboard, location of the cargo, and information listed in paragraph
      6.29.5.6.
   6.29.8. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the appropriate C2 center by telephone, HF radio, or
   message, giving arrival notice, hazardous materials information, and other pertinent information, as
   required.

6.30. Handling of Classified Cargo, Registered Mail, Mission Capable (MICAP) Parts, Very, Very
Important Part (VVIP), Forward Supply System (FSS) Shipments, and Courier Material.
   6.30.1. MICAP, VVIP, sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within the nor-
   mal airlift system are receipted at the on and offload stations using the air cargo manifest. For unit
   moves operated in accordance with Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part III, Mobility,
   classified or sensitive cargo movement is normally manifested utilizing the DD Form 2130-2, or sim-
   ilar automated product, and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier. However, if classified/
   sensitive unit cargo is offered without an accompanying courier, the DD1907, Signature and Tally
   Record, must be used.
      6.30.1.1. Defense Courier Service (DCS) couriers coordinating with the PIC are authorized to
      designate officer or enlisted, (E-5 and above) crewmembers on military aircraft as couriers to
      escort and safeguard courier material when other qualified personnel are not available. Qualified

         passengers, if carried, are designated before designating crewmembers. The following restrictions
         apply:
             6.30.1.1.1. Primary crewmembers will not be designated couriers without the consent of the
             PIC.
             6.30.1.1.2. Crewmembers on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at a loca-
             tion where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as couriers.
      6.30.2. During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are required to
      meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.
         6.30.2.1. During unscheduled en route stops crewmembers may place courier material in tempo-
         rary custody of the following agencies in descending order of priority.
             6.30.2.1.1. DCS courier.
             6.30.2.1.2. TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces.
             6.30.2.1.3. US Department of State Diplomatic Courier.
             6.30.2.1.4. US Department of State activity.
             6.30.2.1.5. US military guards.
             6.30.2.1.6. US DOD civilian guards.
      6.30.3. If unable to follow the itinerary to the destination of the courier material, or material is lost,
      stolen or otherwise compromised, report circumstances to the nearest Defense Courier Station and
      notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.
      6.30.4. Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of such
      urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. Shipments will be manifested sepa-
      rately and the manifest annotated with the words LIFE OR DEATH URGENCY. All shipments will
      be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the air cargo manifest or the DD1907, for unit
      moves. The PIC, or designated representative, will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be
      made the custodian during flight.

Section 6D—Departure

6.31. On Time Takeoffs. Mission departures are on time if the aircraft is airborne within -20/+14 min-
utes of scheduled takeoff time or as specified in a MAJCOM supplement.
      6.31.1. Scheduled takeoff time may be adjusted to make good a time over target (TOT) or time of
      arrival (TOA). PICs shall notify C2 agency before takeoff to adjust the scheduled takeoff time.
      6.31.2. Early Departures. Early departures are authorized to prevent a delay due to weather, ATC
      restrictions, airfield or aircraft operational limitations, to adjust mission flow during a large-scale
      operation, or if approved through C2 channels provided the impact on local and downrange facilities
      and crew duty is evaluated.
      6.31.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Controlled Takeoff Times. Aircrews will coordinate with TCP for con-
      trolled takeoff times. Missions falling behind the pre-launch sequence of events will coordinate take-
      off priority with ground and tower control through TCP in an effort to obtain an on-time departure.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            107


6.32. NVG Departures.
   6.32.1. NVG Departure Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG departures for crewmem-
   bers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews may fly
   NVG departures weather down to 600/2 (OG/CC or equivalent may approve down to 300/1). Crews
   must give careful consideration to potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other weather
   limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations which can
   further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather conditions, moon illumi-
   nation and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable effects
   when planning NVG operations.
   6.32.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Departure.
       6.32.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 15 knots.
       6.32.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 20 knots.
       EXCEPTION: with OG/CC (or equivalent) approval, up to 30 knots crosswind component is
       authorized.
   6.32.3. NVG Malfunctions During Takeoff. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF experiences NVG fail-
   ure, the takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the PIC; otherwise an abort will be initiated.
   Consider using the overt nose lights to continue the takeoff. If NVG malfunctions occur after Vgo,
   takeoff will be continued with the PF transitioning to IMC takeoff, transfer control of the aircraft as
   necessary. If either pilot’s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climb out and follow the appropriate
   procedures for loss of NVGs. The PNF will be ready to immediately assume aircraft control if the PF
   experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. Pilots must exercise sound and conserva-
   tive judgment to continue NVG operations with aircraft malfunctions.

Section 6E—En route

6.33. Flight Progress.
   6.33.1. Data entered into the MC will be verified by another pilot. Check both the coordinate infor-
   mation and the distances between waypoints against the flight plan.
   6.33.2. Crews will use the Master Document (Computer Flight Plan) and an appropriate plotting chart
   to plot all oceanic waypoints from entry to exit. As a minimum, annotate the chart with the mission
   number, PIC's name, and date. If practical, the chart may be reused. Retain the chart and master doc-
   ument in unit Stan/Eval for 120 days following mission completion.
   6.33.3. In-Flight, use all available navigational aids to monitor MC performance. Immediately report
   malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability which degrades centerline accuracy to the control-
   ling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for flight progress:
       6.33.3.1. When possible, perform a gross error MC check using available NAVAIDs prior to, or
       immediately upon entering the Category I Route/over water segment.
       6.33.3.2. On a Category I route, when approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates for the
       next waypoint.
       6.33.3.3. Approximately 10 minutes after each waypoint, plot aircraft position, and compare plot-
       ted position to expected track. Annotate latitude/longitude and time of plot.
108                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         6.33.3.4. If revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight on the chart.
      6.33.4. Operations in International/Territorial Airspace. (See FLIP, FCG, and AP, for further guid-
      ance). US military aircraft and DoD personnel entering another nation to conduct US government
      business must have the approval of the foreign government concerned to enter their airspace. Foreign
      clearances for US international air operations are obtained through US officials known as Defense
      Attaché Officers (DAOs).
         6.33.4.1. There are essentially two types of airspace: international airspace and territorial air-
         space. International airspace includes all airspace seaward of coastal states' territorial seas. Mili-
         tary aircraft operate in such areas free of interference or control by the coastal state. Territorial
         airspace includes airspace above territorial seas, archipelagic waters, inland waters, and land terri-
         tory, and is sovereign airspace. Over flight may be conducted in such areas only with the consent
         of the sovereign country.
         6.33.4.2. Consistent with international law, the US recognizes sea claims up to 12NMs. Diplo-
         matic constraints and/or a lack of diplomatic clearances usually result in missions operating in
         international airspace. Therefore, it is imperative sufficient information be provided far enough in
         advance to allow compliance with FCG requirements established by the countries concerned. The
         US does not normally recognize territorial claims beyond 12NMs; however, specific guidance
         from certain US authorities may establish limits, which differ from the standard.
         6.33.4.3. Flight Information Region (FIR). An FIR is an area of airspace within which flight
         information and related services are provided. An FIR does not reflect international borders or
         sovereign airspace. Aircraft may operate within an established FIR without approval of the adja-
         cent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace.
         6.33.4.4. Aircrews on a flight plan route, which takes them from international airspace into terri-
         torial airspace, for which approved aircraft clearances were obtained, should not amend entry
         point(s).
         6.33.4.5. Violations of foreign sovereignty result from unauthorized or improper entry or depar-
         ture of aircraft. Aircrews should not enter into territorial airspace for which a clearance has not
         been duly requested and granted through diplomatic channels.
         6.33.4.6. ATC agencies are not vested with authority to grant diplomatic clearances for penetra-
         tion of sovereign airspace where prior clearance is required from the respective country. Aircraft
         clearances are obtained through diplomatic channels only.
         6.33.4.7. In the event ATC agency challenges the validity of a flight routing or attempts to negate
         existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response will be to attempt
         to advise the ATC agency that the aircraft will continue to planned destination, as cleared in inter-
         national airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in
         determining mission continuation. Under no circumstances should aircrews construe a clearance,
         which routes their mission over sovereign airspace, which was not approved through diplomatic
         channels before mission departure, as being valid authorization.
         6.33.4.8. Aircrews operating missions requiring unique or specially developed routing will nor-
         mally be briefed at home station, onload station, and/or by the last C2 facility transited before per-
         forming the critical portion of the mission.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               109


       6.33.4.9. Aircrews (except on weather reconnaissance missions) normally are not tasked to and
       should not fly "due regard" routings unless coordinated with the appropriate MAJCOM C2 and
       specifically directed in the mission FRAG. The "due regard" or "operational" option obligates the
       military AC to be their own ATC agency to separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If oper-
       ational requirements dictate, ACs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft.
       Aircraft will return to normal air traffic services as soon as practical.

6.34. Navigational Aid Capability. The following airspace categories are each defined in FLIP, and are
considered special qualification airspace: MNPS, RVSM, RNP, and BRNAV.
   6.34.1. Should any required equipment fail before entering such airspace, request a new clearance to
   avoid this airspace.
   6.34.2. Should any required equipment fail after entry into such airspace, immediately notify ATC
   and coordinate a plan of action.
   6.34.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of required equipment, including
   the failure of this equipment to meet tolerances.
   6.34.4. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. C-17 aircraft equipped with integrated
   GPS navigation systems are approved in RNP airspace without time limitations.
       6.34.4.1. RNP-10. If all updating capability is lost, C-17 aircraft are certified to operate for 6.2
       hours (after entering NAV mode) in RNP-10 airspace. If any in-flight update is accomplished
       (GPS or Radio Nav), the aircraft may continue in RNP-10 airspace until the figure of merit
       exceeds “8” (approximately 6 hours after last update).
          6.34.4.1.1. Preflight Procedures. Review maintenance logs to ascertain status of RNP-10
          equipment.
          6.34.4.1.2. En route. Before entering Oceanic Airspace, the aircraft position should be
          checked as accurately as possible by using external navigation aids (coast-out fix). Periodic
          crosschecks will be accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent devia-
          tion from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of navigation equip-
          ment below navigation performance requirements and coordinate appropriate actions.
          6.34.4.1.3. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of RNP required equip-
          ment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
   6.34.5. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. BRNAV navigation accuracy criteria is RNP-5.
   C-17 aircraft with GPS UPDATE selected are approved for BRNAV operations with no restrictions.
   If GPS UPDATE is unavailable, select RADIO UPDATE and ensure the FOM remains 7 or better.
   6.34.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where RVSM is applied
   is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft type must be
   approved for operations in these areas. Pilots will refer to FLIP AP/2 and the following for RVSM
   requirements:
       6.34.6.1. Both primary altimeters, at least one autopilot, the altitude advisory system, and the
       transponder, must be fully operational. The AC will request a new clearance to avoid this airspace
       should any of this equipment fail.
       6.34.6.2. Engage the autopilot during level cruise.
110                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         6.34.6.3. Crosscheck the altimeters before or immediately upon coast out. Record readings of
         both altimeters.
         6.34.6.4. Continuously crosscheck the primary altimeters to ensure they agree ± 200 feet.
         6.34.6.5. Limit climb and descent rates to 1,000 feet per minute when operating near other aircraft
         to reduce potential TCAS advisories.
         6.34.6.6. Immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails after entry into RVSM
         airspace and coordinate a plan of action.
         6.34.6.7. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions or failures of RVSM required equipment.

6.35. CIRVIS and Other Reports. Report all vital intelligence sightings from aircraft as indicated in
FLIP planning or FLIP En route Supplement.
      6.35.1. In-flight harassment or hostile action against C-17 aircraft. Aircraft subjected to harassment
      or hostile action by foreign aircraft will immediately contact the nearest USAF air and ground voice
      facility and report the encounter. Include aircraft nationality, type, insignia, or any other identifying
      features; note position, heading, time, speed when harassed, and the type of harassment. Request relay
      of the report to the nearest C2 agency. Also, attempt to contact the nearest command post when in
      UHF and VHF range.

6.36. In-flight Meals. Pilots should not eat meals at the same time, and their meals should consist of dif-
ferent menu items.

6.37. Communications. See paragraph 5.12.

6.38. In-flight Emergency Procedures. The PIC shall report deviations from directives that may occur
as a result of an emergency according to AFI 11-202V3. Time and conditions permitting, inform passen-
gers of the situation and intentions as appropriate.
      6.38.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. When practical after completing the aircraft emergency
      action checklists and associated actions, crews should furnish the controlling agency and appropriate
      C2 agencies with a description of the difficulty, assistance required, intentions, and any other perti-
      nent information.
      6.38.2. The PIC may initiate a CONFERENCE HOTEL/SKYHOOK when additional expertise is
      necessary. Communications procedures are as follow:
         6.38.2.1. Local Area. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate fre-
         quencies.
         6.38.2.2. En route. When out of UHF range, use HF/AERO-I to establish a phone patch with the
         nearest or controlling C2 center as appropriate.
         6.38.2.3. Provide the following information when time permits.
             6.38.2.3.1. Narrative description of the situation to include actions taken by the crew and the
             intentions of the PIC.
             6.38.2.3.2. What assistance is being requested.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                111


           6.38.2.3.3. Fuel on board and hours of endurance.
           6.38.2.3.4. Position.
           6.38.2.3.5. Altitude and flight conditions.
           6.38.2.3.6. Type cargo, number of personnel and distinguished visitors (DV) on board.
           6.38.2.3.7. Qualification of PIC.
           6.38.2.3.8. Planned landing base.
           6.38.2.3.9. ETA at landing base.
   6.38.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew Considerations Following an Emergency. The following tech-
   niques are provided for your consideration in establishing your plan of action following any air-
   plane-oriented emergency. Establish an escape route. Maintain positive control of surviving aircrew/
   passengers. Upon landing, 60 OG/OGV suggests clearing the aircraft a minimum of 600 feet. Perform
   a head count. Establish a priority for treating the injured. Report location of fire or emergency, state of
   evacuation (possible survivors on board), and hazardous material carried and location to the Fire
   Chief as soon as practical. At night, use flashlights to aid in assembling the crew and passengers in
   one location. Know your procedures for evacuation and plan ahead.

6.39. Need for Medical Assistance. When a person aboard the aircraft requires medical care, the PIC
will notify the station of intended landing in sufficient time so the aircraft may be met by medical person-
nel. Notification will include the patient’s sex, approximate age, and major complaint.

6.40. Weather Forecasts. It is the pilot’s responsibility to obtain destination weather prior to descent.
The primary sources are 18 AF TACC weather operations, OWSs, and USAF weather flights via
pilot-to-meteorologist service (PMSV) or through a USAF aeronautical station. For aircraft flying in
EUCOM AOR (ENAME operations) contact USAFE/OWS at Sembach AB GE. SOUTHCOM AOR
contact 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ. The ATC system can provide weather information to en
route aircraft.

Section 6F—Arrival

6.41. Descent. Before descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts ((Operational Navigation
Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic
(JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmem-
bers will not be involved in duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and
required checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.
   6.41.1. Night and Marginal Weather Operations. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night or
   during marginal weather. If a precision approach is not available, fly any available approved instru-
   ment approach.
       6.41.1.1. A visual approach may be flown during night VFR conditions if an approved instrument
       approach to the landing runway is not available or operational missions require a tactical
       approach.
112                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         6.41.1.2. On training/evaluation flights, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or VFR traffic
         patterns to accomplish required training and evaluations. The pilot not flying will monitor a preci-
         sion approach when practical to enhance safety.
         6.41.1.3. For recovery at home station, pilots may elect to fly a visual or non-precision approach,
         if weather minimums permit.

6.42. Instrument Approach Procedures.
      6.42.1. Instrument approach RVR/visibility and, if required, ceiling minimums will be as published
      for a category "D" aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 165 knots, the minimums for category "E" will
      be used.
      6.42.2. Prior to starting an instrument approach, pilots will confirm their aircraft can comply with the
      missed approach climb gradient requirements established in AFI 11-202V3. If unable to meet required
      climb gradients, pilots must coordinate alternate missed approach procedures with ATC, which will
      ensure terrain clearance, prior to commencing the approach. If this is not possible, do not attempt the
      approach.
      6.42.3. Weather minimums. Before starting an instrument approach, or beginning an en route
      descent, pilots will confirm the existing weather is reported to be:
         6.42.3.1. At or above required visibility for straight-in or sidestep approaches.
             6.42.3.1.1. For PAR approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 2400 (730 meters) or 1/
             2 mile visibility (800 meters) with no RVR readout available.
         6.42.3.2. At or above required ceiling and visibility for circling approaches.
             6.42.3.2.1. For circling approaches with no published ceiling requirement, the required ceil-
             ing shall be computed by taking the published HAA plus 100 feet rounded up to the next one
             hundred foot value. (For example, if the HAA is 747 feet, add 100 feet to get 847 feet and then
             round up to the next one hundred foot value which would be 900 feet. Your ceiling for the
             approach must be at or above 900 feet.) When circling minimums are published, but not by
             category, circling approach minimums will be as published, but in no case lower than 600 feet
             and 2 miles visibility.
         6.42.3.3. Increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument approach by ½ SM or as
         noted in NOTAMs, on ATIS, or on the approach plate, when the runway approach lighting system
         (ALS) is inoperative. (This applies only to the ALS itself, not to VASIs, PAPIs, and other lights
         that are not a component of the ALS.)
         6.42.3.4. If ceiling is below the value depicted for published DoD or NACA precision approach,
         but visibility is at or above authorized minimums, the pilot will comply with fuel requirements of
         Chapter 14, prior to initiating en route descent, penetration, or approach.
      6.42.4. Flight Instrumentation Requirements.
         6.42.4.1. Aircraft are limited to a DH/MDA based on a HAT of 300-feet and RVR 40, or ¾-mile
         visibility (1220-meters) with no RVR if full flight instrumentation is not available and operational.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                         113


NOTES:
         1. Full flight instrument for Category I ILS and precision approach radar (PAR) includes the
            flight director, a HUD or PFD and NAV display at each station, and no shared ADC or
            IRU.
         2. Full flight instrumentation for a CAT II ILS includes the flight director, a HUD or PFD
            and NAV display at each station, and no “No CAT II” warning message. A HUD will be
            used by the PF position, if available.
  6.42.5. Category I ILS Procedures. Decision height for precision approaches will be as published, but
  no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown (HAT).
     6.42.5.1. ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to
     conduct an ILS PRM approach. Comply with the following operational procedures:
         6.42.5.1.1. Two operational VHF communication radios are required.
         6.42.5.1.2. The approach must be briefed as an ILS/PRM approach.
         6.42.5.1.3. If unable to accept an ILS PRM approach clearance, contact the FAA ATCSCC at
         1-800-333-4286 prior to departure time to obtain a pre-coordinated arrival time. Pilots who
         arrive at a PRM airport unable to accept PRM approach clearance, who did not contact ATC
         prior to departure, should expect an ATC directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
         6.42.5.1.4. All breakouts from the approach shall be hand flown. Autopilots shall be disen-
         gaged when a breakout is directed.
         6.42.5.1.5. Should a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) be received, the pilot shall immedi-
         ately respond to the RA. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC clearance, the
         pilot shall advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA, comply with the turn por-
         tion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines safety to be a factor.
  6.42.6. Category II ILS Procedures. DH is based on radar altitude. Minimum HAT is 100 feet. Mini-
  mum RVR is 1200. Maximum crosswind limitation is 10 knots.
     6.42.6.1. Aircrews will not execute an actual Category II ILS to minimums unless both pilots are
     qualified and current in Category II ILS. The AC must have logged at least 100 hours in command
     since AC qualification.
  6.42.7. NDB Procedures. NDB approaches may be flown during day, night, or IMC conditions after
  compliance with any airfield restrictions in GDSS/GDSS2/ASRR. Back up each approach with avail-
  able navaids/GPS to include loading the NDB coordinates in the Mission Computer (MC).
  6.42.8. Established on a Segment of the Approach. When cleared for, or established, on a segment of
  the approach, and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PF has the
  option of continuing the approach to the missed approach point (MAP)/DH. If the approach is aban-
  doned, level off (or descend if a lower altitude is required for the missed approach procedure). Com-
  ply with the last assigned clearance until a new or amended clearance is received. Do not continue a
  CAT II ILS if the weather is reported to be below CAT II minima.
     6.42.8.1. Do not continue the approach below minimums unless the runway environment is in
     sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing.
114                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         6.42.8.2. If the approach is continued, sufficient fuel must be available to complete the approach
         and missed approach, and proceed to a suitable alternate with normal fuel reserve.
         6.42.8.3. The PIC has final responsibility for determining when the destination is below desig-
         nated minimums, and for initiating proper clearance request.
      6.42.9. Holding. An aircraft may hold at a destination that is below landing minimums, but forecast
      to improve to or above minimums provided:
         6.42.9.1. The aircraft has more fuel remaining than that required to fly to the alternate and hold
         for the appropriate holding time, and the weather at the alternate is forecast to remain at or above
         alternate filing minimums for the period, including the holding time.
         6.42.9.2. Destination weather is forecast to be at or above minimums before excess fuel will be
         consumed.

6.43. NVG Approach and Landing.
      6.43.1. NVG Approach Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for NVG visual approaches and for
      crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG aircrews
      may fly IFR instrument approaches which transition to NVG landings with weather down to 600/2
      (OG/CC or equivalent may approve down to 300/1) or approach minimums (whichever is higher).
      Crews must give careful consideration to potential hazards during the critical phase of flight. Other
      weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have inherent limitations
      which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider weather conditions,
      moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting, and weapon/expendable
      effects when planning NVG operations.
      6.43.2. NVG Crosswind Limits for Approach.
         6.43.2.1. Runways 90-120 feet wide. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 15 knots.
         6.43.2.2. Runways wider than 120. Maximum allowable crosswind component is 20 knots.
         EXCEPTION: with OG/CC (or equivalent) approval, up to 30 knots crosswind component is
         authorized.
      6.43.3. NVG Failures During Approach and Landing. If the pilot or copilot experience NVG failure
      or other malfunctions at or below 300 feet AGL, perform a go-around. If the PF’s NVGs fail after
      touchdown, transfer aircraft control to the PNF for the landing rollout. Consider using the overt nose
      lights.

6.44. Unscheduled Landings. When an unscheduled landing or crew rest occurs at a base without a pas-
senger facility, the AC should immediately advise the appropriate C2 agency and request assistance in
arranging substitute airlift for passengers on board. The following procedures apply when obtaining sup-
port for service members, in a group travel status, who are transported on AMC organic aircraft flying a
Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) mission, which incur an unscheduled delay due to weather
or maintenance problems, forcing the members to be lodged at that location until the aircraft can continue
its mission.
      6.44.1. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities and AMC TWCF funds are available, pay-
      ment for lodging (contract or on-base) will be made by the local accounting liaison/OPLOC citing
      TWCF funds. The appropriate TWCF fund cite may be obtained from the local financial analysis and/
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               115


   or accounting liaison office. Normally, a BPA contract or AF IMT 616 is already established at these
   locations to charge the routine lodging costs for transient or TDY individuals who are on TWCF
   funded travel orders.
   6.44.2. If the delay is at a location where DoD facilities are available and AMC TWCF funds are not
   available, utilize AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice authority to acquire the appropriate
   lodging accommodations. Upon return to home station, the PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the local
   accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group travel orders, along with any other
   pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts). When the
   AF IMT 15 has been validated, it will be forwarded for payment, citing the funds of the unit whose
   aircraft was delayed.
   6.44.3. If the delay is at a location where both DoD facilities and TWCF funds are unavailable, the
   PIC will utilize AF IMT 15 authority to acquire the appropriate meals, quarters, and transportation to
   support the service members. Upon return to home station, the PIC will send the AF IMT 15 to the
   local accounting liaison office. A copy of the service members' group travel orders, along with any
   other pertinent supporting data, must accompany the form (e.g., lodging invoice and/or receipts).
   When the AF IMT 15 has been validated, it will be forwarded for payment, citing the funds of the unit
   whose aircraft was delayed.
NOTE: This policy does not apply to those passengers on delayed TWCF organic aircraft who are in a
per diem or space available status, except for those duty passengers on TWCF funded travel orders
delayed at locations where TWCF funds are available.

6.45. Maintenance Debrief. Complete the AFTO IMT 781 after each flight. After landing, crewmem-
bers debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, airdrop systems, avionics
equipment, and all installed special equipment as required. At stations without maintenance support,
when a maintenance requirement exists the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the C2
agency. On AMC missions, notify 18 AF TACC Logistics Control (TACC/XOCL).
   6.45.1. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, "Aircraft Subjected to Salt Spray" (state lowest alti-
   tude and duration) anytime the aircraft is flown under 1000 feet above sea except for takeoffs and
   landings.
   6.45.2. An entry will be placed in AFTO 781A, “Aircraft Operated on Semi-Prepared Runway” (state
   number of landings and takeoffs accomplished on the semi-prepared runway).
   6.45.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Debrief Process. The following is a coordinated 60 and 349 OG/MXG
   process to help eliminate problems with documentation of flying hours for both aircrews and air-
   frames. Aircrews will report to the respective Maintenance Debrief. Debrief will collect the original,
   completed AFTO Form(s) 781 and the crew may make copies if desired. (60 OG) Crews will make
   copies and turn them in to the squadron. Any copies must be labeled “COPY.” Maintenance personnel
   will forward the original AFTO Form(s) 781 to the squadron for record keeping and/or disposition.
NOTE: When the crew flies an airplane assigned to any other wing than 60 AMW (typically, stage oper-
ations), leave the original AFTO Form(s) 781 in the aircraft forms. The PIC shall ensure that an extract
(identical copy) has been created, and that the form left with the airplane is labeled “All Times Extracted”.
The additional copy of the AFTO Form(s) 781 shall be labeled “Certified Extract” and signed by the AC
for turn-in at the home squadron ARMS.
116                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      6.45.4. (Added-TRAVIS) The PIC will designate which crewmember(s) need to attend the mainte-
      nance aircrew debriefing upon return of 60 AMW assigned aircraft to Travis.

6.46. Customs and Border Clearance.
      6.46.1. Normal operations.
         6.46.1.1. The unit dispatching the mission is normally responsible for the border clearance of its
         aircraft.
         6.46.1.2. Where designated personnel are not assigned, border clearance is the responsibility of
         the PIC. Duties may be assigned to ground personnel or to the loadmaster, but the PIC retains ulti-
         mate responsibility. When a C-17 aircraft is onloaded at a base without an air traffic function, the
         PIC is responsible for ensuring the following:
             6.46.1.2.1. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers possess current passports and valid visas,
             when required.
             6.46.1.2.2. Crewmembers, troops, and passengers have current certificates of immunization
             (shot record).
             6.46.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
             6.46.1.2.4. Departing or entering the United States through a location where border clearance
             can be obtained.
             6.46.1.2.5. Obtaining border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if
             required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area.
             6.46.1.2.6. Spraying the aircraft (see the FCG and paragraph 6.47.).
      6.46.2. Procedures for US Entry.
         6.46.2.1. En route, the loadmaster will distribute personal customs declarations (when not accom-
         plished by passenger services) to all passengers, troops, and crewmembers. The loadmaster will
         also brief passengers and crewmembers on customs regulations, and prepare and compile neces-
         sary border clearance forms for the PIC's signature.
         6.46.2.2. En route, notify the C2 agency at the base of intended landing of any change in ETA to
         ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
         6.46.2.3. Obtain a permit to proceed when military necessities require that an aircraft, which has
         landed in the United States for customs clearance, to proceed to another base in the US to obtain
         border clearance. The permit to proceed delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and crew
         until arrival at the offload station, and saves intermediate offloading and reloading normally
         required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing
         where the border clearance must be completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs
         official. Do not make intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and des-
         tination of manifested cargo unless required by an emergency or directed by the controlling C2
         center.
         6.46.2.4. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative nor-
         mally will meet the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not enplane/deplane passengers,
         troops, or crewmembers unless necessary for safety or the preservation of life and property (load-
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              117


     master excepted). Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their des-
     ignated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all landings
     required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew, passengers, and cargo complete
     final border clearance.
  6.46.3. Inspections of US aircraft by foreign officials.
     6.46.3.1. Follow US Air Force policy on status of military aircraft as stated in the FCG, General
     Information (Chapter 3). In substance, this policy holds that US military aircraft are immune from
     searches, seizures, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials.
     In addition, PICs must be aware of and adhere to any specific FCG provisions for individual coun-
     tries.
     6.46.3.2. If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should use the fol-
     lowing procedures.
         6.46.3.2.1. In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement of the PIC to
         the foreign official that the aircraft is a sovereign instrumentality not subject to search without
         consent of USAF headquarters or the US Department of State officials in the country con-
         cerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign author-
         ities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.46.3.2.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC should make every
         effort to delay the search until he or she can contact USAF headquarters (through MAJCOM
         C2) or the appropriate embassy officials. The PIC should then notify these agencies of foreign
         request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions.
         6.46.3.2.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, pending notification to
         USAF headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the PIC should indicate that he or she would
         prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying time, and mechanical considerations
         permit a safe flight) and request permission to do so.
         6.46.3.2.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on
         board an aircraft, the PIC should state that he protests the course of action being pursued and
         that he intends to notify both USAF headquarters and the appropriate American embassy of
         the foreign action. The PIC should not attempt physical resistance, and should thereafter report
         the incident to USAF headquarters and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. The PIC
         should escort foreign authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided.
     6.46.3.3. Other procedures may apply when carrying sensitive cargo or equipment. Follow these
     procedures and applicable portions of classified FCG supplements.
  6.46.4. Exercises and Contingency Operations.
     6.46.4.1. General. Certain airlift missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
     require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health, immunization, and
     agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding, between these agencies and
     MAJCOM establishes certain procedures and waivers.
     6.46.4.2. Implementation. Implementation of the agreement is not automatic. Traffic and border
     clearing agencies implement all or part of the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspec-
118                                          AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      tion and clearance may be accomplished at the US onload or offload base, or at the foreign onload
      or offload base.
      6.46.4.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.46.4.3.1. Outbound: No requirement. Filing of Customs Form 7507, General Declaration
         (Outward/Inward), is not required unless directed.

                 senger, to include observers, support personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crew-
                 members.
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a customs representative will
                 meet the aircraft. Troop commander will turn individual declaration to custom repre-
                 sentatives
                 6.46.4.3.2.3.4. Troops will debark under the observation of the customs representative
                 with only a spot check of articles and baggage. The customs officer may elect to make
                 a more extensive inspection.
             6.46.4.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140-days, or more:
                 6.46.4.3.2.4.1. One copy of the Customs Form 6059B US Customs Baggage Declara-
                 tion Form for each passenger. This includes observers, support personnel, civilians,
                 news media personnel, and crewmembers.
                 6.46.4.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS offload base, a Customs representative will
                 meet the aircraft and collect all declarations. Troops will debark under the observation
                 of the customs representative who may make discretionary examination of the bag-
                 gage.
      6.46.4.4. Public Health Procedures.
         6.46.4.4.1. When operating from a base without a traffic officer, the PIC will ensure all crew-
         members and passengers are properly immunized.
         6.46.4.4.2. Spray the aircraft if required.
      6.46.4.5. Immigration Procedures.
         6.46.4.5.1. Outbound: No requirements.
         6.46.4.5.2. Inbound: Submit the following to the immigration inspector if carrying civilian
         passengers.
             6.46.4.5.2.1. One copy of Customs Form 7507 (found at http://www.customs.gov).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             119


              6.46.4.5.2.2. One copy of Immigration Form I-92, Aircraft/Vessel Report.
              6.46.4.5.2.3. One copy/set of Immigration Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, for
              each foreign national.
       6.46.4.6. Agriculture Procedures:
           6.46.4.6.1. Outbound: No requirement.
           6.46.4.6.2. Inbound: Consult AMC Border Clearance Guide.
              6.46.4.6.2.1. The command being airlifted will instruct troops that no fresh fruit, milk,
              milk products, vegetables, plants, plant pests, soil samples, animals, meat, and animal
              products can be brought into the United States. All items of troop personal gear/cargo are
              to be thoroughly cleaned of mud, dirt, sand, and other foreign material before being
              brought aboard the aircraft. Personal gear and equipment must be examined for snails and
              other plant pests to prevent their accidental entry into the U.S.
              6.46.4.6.2.2. Before loading, the command responsible for cargo being airlifted will clear
              vehicles and cargo of snails or other plant pests and of all mud and soil.
              6.46.4.6.2.3. When required by agricultural quarantine regulations, the FCG, or higher
              headquarters, the aircraft will receive an aerosol treatment 30 minutes before landing.
              6.46.4.6.2.4. On arrival, agricultural inspectors will inspect the aircraft after troops have
              disembarked. Crewmembers will assemble remains of in-flight lunches for prompt
              removal by fleet service personnel.
              6.46.4.6.2.5. Inspectors examine baggage, equipment, vehicles, and cargo as offloaded.
              Any items, vehicles, or cargo found to be contaminated will be held for such treatment as
              the inspector may direct (washing, steam cleaning, physical cleaning, or fumigation).
   6.46.5. Military Customs Pre-Clearance Inspection Program. All crew members will ensure compli-
   ance with Military Customs Pre-clearance requirements.

6.47. Insect and Pest Control.
   6.47.1. Responsibility. PICs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to AFJI 48-104,
   Quarantine Regulations of the Armed Forces, Department of Defense FCG, or as directed by higher
   headquarters. Certify the spraying on Customs Form 7507, or on forms provided by the country tran-
   sited. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only exception is when man-
   dated by the FCG.
CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray before boarding crew or pas-
sengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10-minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before
allowing anyone on board.
       6.47.1.1. When spraying is required, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent, National
       Stock Number (NSN) 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent), to spray the aircraft. Wear leather or
       Nomex gloves while spraying.
           6.47.1.1.1. Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.
120                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


             6.47.1.1.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
             baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other sim-
             ilar spaces.
             6.47.1.1.3. Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after
             the crew is aboard and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.
         6.47.1.2. Spray for 3 minutes 20 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
         transited.
NOTE: Keep used aerosol cans separate from other trash so they may be disposed of safely.
      6.47.2. Responsibility of PIC In-flight. When seeing any insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft
      in-flight, notify the destination C2 center, airfield management operations, or airport manager of the
      situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
      6.47.3. Procedure at Aerial Port of Disembarkation (APOD). On arrival at an APOD, do not open
      cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to inspect the aircraft for insect or rodent
      infestation. Do not onload or offload cargo or passengers until the inspection is satisfactorily com-
      pleted. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or local requirements, as arranged by the base
      air terminal manager or the local C2 organization.

Section 6G—Miscellaneous

6.48. Dropped Objects. If an externally dropped object is discovered, the flight crew will:
      6.48.1. Notify the appropriate C2 agency as soon as practical; include details of routing, altitude,
      weather, etc.
      6.48.2. Notify maintenance at the first military station transited.

6.49. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). If involved in a mishap or incident, after landing and terminating
the emergency, pull the CVR power circuit breaker.

6.50. Life Support and Dash 21 Equipment Documentation. The PIC or designated representative
will:
      6.50.1. Before departing home station or en route stations, ensure appropriate serviceable protective
      clothing, life support, survival, and dash 21 equipment for the entire or remainder of the mission are
      aboard the aircraft.
      6.50.2. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review AF Form 4076,
      Aircraft Dash 21 Equipment Inventory, to ensure all required dash 21 equipment has been certified
      as installed by maintenance, the initial check has been signed by maintenance, and configuration doc-
      uments match mission requirements.
      6.50.3. Before departing home station and following en route crew changes, review, sign, and date
      the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, to ensure all required protective cloth-
      ing and life support and survival equipment have been certified as installed by aircrew life support and
      that configuration documents match mission requirements. Ensure appropriate number and type of life
      preservers are aboard for over-water missions carrying children and infants.

   6.50.4. Missing Equipment. Aircrew members discovering equipment missing will accomplish the
   following:
       6.50.4.1. Make an AFTO Form 781A entry for missing equipment. Additionally, ensure equip-
       ment removed from the aircraft at an en route station is documented in the AFTO Form 781A.
       6.50.4.2. Annotate AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 in the next vacant column indicating the
       quantity remaining for the item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check
       number of that column. Leave AF Form 4076 and AFTO Form 46 on board the aircraft in the
       event of an en route crew change.
       6.50.4.3. Advise the PIC and determine whether the missing equipment should be recovered or
       replaced before mission continuation.
       6.50.4.4. Assist, as required, in preparing reports of survey for missing equipment.
       6.50.4.5. When possible, advise HQ AMC/A37TL (or MAJCOM life support office) and appro-
       priate C2 agency (or airport management) before mission continuation.
   6.50.5. Additional Equipment. If more equipment is discovered during the preflight than is annotated
   on the AF Form 4076 or AFTO Form 46, annotate the total quantity in the next vacant column for the
   item. Ensure the ICAO location designator is entered above the check number of that column.

6.51. Not Used.

6.52. Airfield Data Reports. Aircrews transiting unfamiliar airfields or airfields where conditions may
adversely affect subsequent flight will:
   6.52.1. Report airfield characteristics that produce illusions, such as runway length, width, slope, and
   lighting, as compared to standard runways, sloping approach terrain, runway contrast against sur-
   rounding terrain, haze, glare, etc., and previously unknown obstacles, airfield markings, or other
   safety critical items to HQ AMC/A36AS (Airfield Suitability Branch).
   6.52.2. Debrief the next C2 center transited.

6.53. Impoundment of Aircraft. If an aircraft is involved in a serious in-flight incident, the PIC should
contact the controlling C2 agency immediately after landing for further instructions. Impoundment may
be required.

6.54. Cockpit Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.54.1. Store only the minimum amount of professional gear required to accomplish the mission on
   the flight deck. Additional items, to include personal pubs bags, will be secured in the crew rest area
   or cargo compartment. All items will be secured before passing the combat entry point through the
   combat exit point.

6.55. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Comply with wake turbulence avoidance criteria. Acceptance of
traffic information, instructions to follow an aircraft, or a visual approach clearance is acknowledgment
that the PIC will ensure takeoff and landing intervals and accepts responsibility of providing wake turbu-
lence separation. Refer to FLIP General Planning (GP) section 5-37 for more information concerning
wake turbulence separation
122                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


6.56. Over Flying En Route Stops. The C2 agency may approve a request to over fly a scheduled en
route stop (ANG/DOD for ANG-directed missions, AFRC command center for AFRC-directed mis-
sions).

6.57. Hung Flare Procedures. Conduct the following procedures after the live firing of flares, if dis-
played flare quantities have decreased since block-out, or if the crew suspects aircraft battle damage:
      6.57.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to check for hung ord-
      nance.
         6.57.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Do not place the aircraft in a congested area. If possible, maintain a
         600-foot separation from buildings and other aircraft.
      6.57.2. The loadmaster or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft and check all flare
      dispensers for hung ordnance or damage.
NOTE: ALE-40/47 flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung ordnance.
         6.57.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) When inspecting for hung flares, avoid the path at which a dispensed
         flare will travel.
NOTE: A DUD flare is one that failed to function and shows no signs of ignition. These are no more dan-
gerous than loaded flares. A HUNG flare is one that failed to function properly and the ejection end shows
evidence of flare material and a damaged/missing weather seal.
      6.57.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected flare cartridge, the
      aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the air-
      craft. The aircraft must remain in the designated safe area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ord-
      nance.
         6.57.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) If there is evidence of a HUNG flare, notify the fire department and
         call for explosive ordinance disposal (EOD). Shut down the engines using normal checklists, and
         deplane the passengers/crew using exits away from the HUNG flare.
      6.57.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking location.
         6.57.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) If there is no evidence of a HUNG flare, re-plane the scanner and
         taxi to parking. Document DUD flares in the AFTO Form 781A. Note: A missing weather seal
         from a flare is not considered HUNG unless a jettison signal was generated. However, the flare
         with a missing weather seal must be removed/replaced prior to next flight from a location with
         repair capability.
      6.57.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Oncoming crews will ensure an extremely thorough walk around is com-
      pleted on aircraft from which flares have been released. Scanners shall pay particular attention to
      potential damage on the underside of the aircraft and in the wheel well and engine/pylon areas. Crew-
      members will annotate in the AFTO Form 781A any damage/burn marks noted. Any damage noted
      warrants further inspection by maintenance and possible repairs prior to flight.

6.58. Classified Equipment and Material. Comply with the following or as directed in MAJCOM sup-
plement.
      6.58.1. Equipment. When classified equipment is onboard, ensure the C2 Center or base operations
      office is aware of the requirement for aircraft security according to Chapter 7 of this AFI. At bases
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             123


  not under jurisdiction of the Air Force, ensure the aircraft and equipment are protected. AFI 31-401,
  Information Security Program Management, provides specific guidance concerning the security of
  various levels of classified equipment aboard aircraft. For classified aircraft components which cannot
  be removed and stored, seal the aircraft. If available, use Ravens to guard the aircraft; otherwise, use
  guards employed by the host country for flightline/airport area control. Do not leave unguarded clas-
  sified information stored in navigation or radio equipment.
  6.58.2. Material. Ensure Communications Security (COMSEC) and other classified materials are
  turned in at destination and receipts are obtained for COMSEC and classified material. The on-site C2
  center will provide temporary storage for COMSEC and other classified materials during en route,
  turnaround, and crew rest stops. If a storage facility is not available, the aircraft gun storage box may
  be used for material classified up to and including SECRET. Encrypted COMSEC will only be trans-
  ferred to authorized DoD personnel.
     6.58.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) For real-world missions, coordinate with Crew Comm 24 hours in
     advance; for weekend and Monday departures call NLT Friday 1200L. In the real-world kits,
     crews will receive an SKL (Simple Key Loader), cable, the red book, and any other books the mis-
     sion requires, along with the necessary disposition documentation.
     6.58.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Crewmembers picking up COMSEC from Crew Comm or Base Ops
     will have their ID card and flight orders available at pickup to help expedite clearance verification.
     6.58.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Missions planned to operate in the CONUS only do not require
     COMSEC documents unless required for mission accomplishment or if an overseas tasking
     appears likely.
     6.58.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews will be issued COMSEC documents shown in Crew Commu-
     nications Issued COMSEC Documents as a standard package from Crew Communications. COM-
     SEC kits are prepared in advance of crew show time. If additional items are specified in an
     OPORD, ATO, SPINS, or ROE, crews will coordinate with Crew Communications for those addi-
     tional requirements. The Crew Communications office is located in the Base Operations building,
     Room 122 and normal duty hours are from 0600-1800, Monday through Friday. During these
     hours, crews will pickup their COMSEC directly from the Crew Communications office. Outside
     these duty hours, the COMSEC kits will be available at the Base Operations counter.

      6.58.3. Aircrews will ensure that they have an operable Mode IV when required for mission accom-
      plishment. Aircrews will conduct an operational ground test of the Mode IV (ground test assets per-
      mitting) before deployment overseas, or as specified in the OPORD or contingency/exercise tasking.
      6.58.4. Attempt to fix an inoperable Mode IV before takeoff. Do not delay takeoff nor cancel a mis-
      sion for an inoperable Mode IV, except when the aircraft will transit an area where safe passage pro-
      cedures are implemented.
      6.58.5. Conduct an in-flight check of the Mode IV on all missions departing the CONUS for overseas
      locations. Aircrews can request the Mode 4 interrogation check through NORAD on UHF frequency
      364.2.
      6.58.6. Aircraft with inoperable Mode IV will continue to their intended destinations. Repairs will be
      accomplished at the first destination where equipment, parts, and maintenance technicians are avail-
      able. In theaters where safe passage is implemented, aircraft will follow procedures for inoperable
      Mode IV as directed in the applicable airspace control order or Air Tasking Order (ATO).
      6.58.7. Ground and in-flight checks of the Mode IV, when conducted, are mandatory maintenance
      debrief items. Crews will annotate successful and unsuccessful interrogation of the Mode IV on all
      aircraft forms (AFTO IMT 781A).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              125


   6.58.8. Aircrews will carry COMSEC equipment and documents required to operate the Mode IV on
   missions when required for mission accomplishment. Before departing for any destination without
   COMSEC storage facilities, crews will contact their local COMSEC managers for guidance.
6.59. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew Data Transfer Device (ADTD).
   6.59.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Do not make changes to any of the operating properties of the ADTD.
   Many of the features of the ADTD are directly linked to the properties set at the factory on the com-
   puter. Personnel are not authorized to add any programs (i.e., games, pictures, wallpaper, etc.) to the
   ADTD. Do not store mission histories, travel vouchers, etc. on the ADTD hard drive. Making changes
   to computer properties or adding software can result in malfunctions or invalidate the flight test con-
   figuration of the ADTD.
   6.59.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The floppy disk drive (A:) of the ADTD is damaged when dust covers on
   floppy disks get lodged inside. Do not insert/force any sharp object into the floppy drive. If you cannot
   retrieve a disk, write-up the ADTD in the aircraft forms.
   6.59.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Contact the SSR at DSN 837-3195, if you have any questions regarding
   ADTD operations.
   6.59.4. (Added-TRAVIS) When multiple databases are used for a particular block of aircraft, ensure
   the correct database is loaded for the intended route of flight.
   6.59.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Crewmembers will not use personal or government thumb drives in
   ADTD’s unless specifically authorized or approved.
6.60. (Added-TRAVIS) Crew Resource Management (CRM).
   6.60.1. (Added-TRAVIS) During the mission pre-brief, 60/349 AMW aircraft commanders will
   appoint an individual crewmember to assess CRM during the sortie/mission. Crews are encouraged to
   use the AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form, as a guide to enhance their
   CRM skills.
   6.60.2. (Added-TRAVIS) PICs will conduct a formal debriefing following the completion of each
   mission leg or local training sortie. Each crewmember should discuss and critique crew coordination
   and the process used to make decisions.
6.61. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission Records. The mission records in Table 6.6. (Added) disposition will
be in accordance with AFRIMS found at http://afrims.amc.af.mil. Annotate each document with the

                                                   Chapter 7

                                                  SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance on aircraft security and preventing and resisting aircraft
piracy (hijacking) of the C-17 aircraft. AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking)
(FOUO), AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program (FOUO), and specific MAJCOM
security publications contain additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning
hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public.

7.2. Security. The C-17 is a “Protection Level 3” resource. Aircraft security at non-United States mili-
tary installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency.

7.3. Air Force Installation Security Program. The following security procedures will implement AFI
31-101 (FOUO), The Air Force Installation Security Program, requirements for C-17 aircraft:
      7.3.1. The aircraft will be parked in an established restricted area and afforded protection via a
      two-person Internal Security Response Team (ISRT),with immediate response not to exceed 3 min-
      utes, and a two-person External Security Response Team, (ESRT) with response capability within 5
      minutes.
      7.3.2. When no permanent or established restricted area parking is available, establish a temporary
      restricted area consisting of a raised rope barrier, and post with restricted area signs. Provide ESRT
      5-minute response and the ISRT from existing areas can respond to this area if able to maintain
      3-minute response within their primary area. Portable security lighting will be provided during the
      hours of darkness if sufficient permanent lighting is not available.
      7.3.3. At non-United States military installations, the PIC determines the adequacy of local security
      capabilities to provide aircraft security commensurate with this chapter. If the PIC determines security
      to be inadequate, the aircraft will depart to a station where adequate security is available.
      7.3.4. The security force must be made aware of all visits to the aircraft. The security force POC must
      be identified to the PIC.
      7.3.5. Security force support terminates only after the aircraft doors are closed and the aircraft taxies.
      7.3.6. Sealing. Seal the aircraft during all RONs on non-secure ramps.

7.4. Standby Aircraft Security. The PIC shall ensure aircraft hatches and doors are secure to show
unauthorized entry; seal the crew entrance door and aft exterior maintenance tunnel hatch with a boxcar
seal. The PIC shall notify the C2 agency the aircraft is sealed and provide them a means to access the air-
craft in an emergency. Annotate the forms with the time the aircraft was sealed. The C2 Senior Controller
may grant access to a sealed aircraft, shall document time of entry and ensure it remains launch capable.
The PIC or designated representative must be present if access to the aircraft is required and will ensure
the aircraft is resealed. The aircrew pre-flight portion will remain valid if performed by one aircrew,
sealed, and flown by another aircrew.
NOTE: WG/CCs should develop local procedures for documentation and management IAW TO 00-20-1
and MAJCOM Supplement.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                 127


7.5. En Route Security. The planning agency must coordinate with the execution agency to ensure ade-
quate en route security is available. PIC will receive a threat assessment and en route security capability
evaluation briefing for areas of intended operation prior to home station departure and should request
updates from en route C2 as required. If required, a PHOENIX RAVEN team will be assigned to the mis-
sion.
   7.5.1. The PHOENIX RAVEN team will consist of US Air Force security force members. The team
   travels in MEGP status and is responsible to the PIC at all times. In turn, the PIC is responsible for
   their welfare (transportation, lodging, etc.). Ensure security team members receive a mission briefing,
   aircraft egress/passenger briefing (as appropriate).
   7.5.2. Arrival. On arrival, the PIC will assess the local situation and take the following actions as
   required:
       7.5.2.1. Area patrol. Request area security patrols from local security forces. If local authorities
       request payment for this service, use AF IMT 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.5.2.2. Aircrew surveillance. During short ground times, direct armed crewmembers to remain
       with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances and activities in the aircraft vicin-
       ity.
       7.5.2.3. Inadequate Security. If in the PIC opinion, airfield security is inadequate and the PIC
       determines the safety of the aircraft is in question, the PIC may waive the flight duty period limits
       and crew rest requirements and depart as soon as possible for a base considered reliable. Report
       movement and intentions to the controlling agency as soon as practical. If departure is not possi-
       ble, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of their ability. In no case, will the entire crew
       leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when
       the airframe may be at risk. The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for
       both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is available. Request security assistance from the
       nearest DoD installation, US Embassy, local military or law enforcement agencies as appropriate.
   7.5.3. Entry Control Procedures. Unescorted entry is granted to crewmembers and support personnel
   assigned to the mission who possess their home station AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry Control
   Card, supported by an Entry Access List (EAL) or aircrew orders. Crewmembers and assigned crew
   chiefs are authorized escort authority.
       7.5.3.1. Normally, non-United States nationals, such as cargo handlers, can perform their duties
       under escort and should not be placed on the EAL.
       7.5.3.2. Personnel not on the entry control list or aircrew orders must be escorted within the area.
   7.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Under floor Hatch Security. The following procedures are to be used when
   inspecting/securing the under floor maintenance area. Crewmembers will not pin the aft hatch from
   inside the aircraft. Prior to all home station departures, crewmembers will ensure both the forward and
   aft under floor maintenance tunnel access hatches are sealed. If the aft hatch is not sealed, open the aft
   hatch and visually inspect the under floor area from the aft hatch. Close and seal the aft hatch (boxcar
   seal or suitable alternate) and ensure the forward hatch is secured. The use of tape is not recommended
   since water, de-ice fluid, etc. will deteriorate the tape and not adequately seal the hatch. If tape is used,
   enter the date, time and initials of the individual accomplishing these procedures on the tape. Annotate
   the aircraft forms with the method sealed, the seal number if applicable, date and time. Prior to each
   off station flight, the loadmaster will check the forward hatch seal and the pilot will inspect aft hatch
128                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      seal during the exterior inspection. Verify the tape/seal on the aft hatch is intact and agrees with the
      write up in the aircraft forms. If the seal/tape has been removed/tampered with, notify security person-
      nel immediately. Prior to entering crew rest, check the condition of the seal/tape and reapply if neces-
      sary. Local missions: no inspection/seal is required for either hatch. When sealing the aft hatch, the
      boxcar seal should be wrapped around the handle once to shorten the seal length. Otherwise, it is pos-
      sible to open the hatch without breaking the seal.

7.6. Detecting Unauthorized Entry.
      7.6.1. When parking on a secure ramp, the aircraft will normally be left unlocked/unsealed to allow
      ground personnel immediate access. If, in the PIC's judgment, the aircraft needs to be sealed in order
      to detect unauthorized entry, then:
         7.6.1.1. Use available box car seals.
         7.6.1.2. Secure the doors in a manner that will indicate unauthorized entry (e.g., tape inside of
         doors to airframe so that entry pulls tape loose).
         7.6.1.3. Close and seal the crew entrance door (box car seal). Confirm the condition of the aft
         hatch seal. (See paragraph 7.6.3.)
         7.6.1.4. Wipe the immediate area around lock and latches clean to aid in investigation of a forced
         entry.
         7.6.1.5. Report any unauthorized entry or tampering to the OSI, security forces or local authori-
         ties, and the C2 agency. Have aircraft thoroughly inspected prior to flight.
      7.6.2. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must always
      remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations. During
      pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel wells, air condi-
      tioning compartments, and cargo compartment under floor area (IAW 7.6.3.) for unauthorized pack-
      ages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
      Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
      7.6.3. Under floor Hatch Security. The following procedures are to be used when inspecting/securing
      the under floor maintenance area. Crewmembers will not enter the under floor area unless specifically
      required for the mission. Crewmembers will not pin the aft hatch from inside the aircraft. Prior to all
      home station departures, crewmembers will ensure both the forward and aft under floor maintenance
      tunnel access hatches are sealed. If the aft hatch is not sealed, open the aft hatch and visually inspect
      the under floor area from the aft hatch. Close and seal the aft hatch (tape, boxcar seal, or suitable alter-
      nate) and ensure the forward hatch is secured with a boxcar seal. Enter the date, time and initials of the
      individual accomplishing these procedures on the tape (if used). Annotate the aircraft forms with the
      method sealed, (tape or seal), the seal number if applicable, date and time. Prior to each off station
      flight, the loadmaster will check the forward hatch seal and the pilot will inspect aft hatch seal during
      the exterior inspection. Verify the tape/seal on the aft hatch is intact and agrees with the write up in the
      aircraft forms. If the seal/tape has been removed/tampered with, notify security personnel immedi-
      ately. Prior to entering crew rest, check the condition of the seal/tape and reapply if necessary. Local
      missions: no inspection/seal is required for either hatch.

7.7. Preventing and Resisting Hijacking.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                129


   7.7.1. In taking action during an aircraft hijacking situation, military forces will act under military
   command within the scope of their duties.
   7.7.2. In the event an aircraft involved in an aircraft hijacking situation is carrying documents, equip-
   ment, or material that DoD has determined to be highly sensitive, or weapons of mass destruction,
   DoD will provide FAA, and where appropriate, the FBI, with all pertinent information. Where possi-
   ble, the FAA will consult and cooperate with DoD prior to directing any law enforcement activity.
   7.7.3. An aircraft is most vulnerable to hijacking when the aircrew is aboard and the aircraft is opera-
   tionally ready for flight.
   7.7.4. A concerted effort must be made to prevent the hijacking of military or military contract air-
   craft by detecting potential hijackers before they board the aircraft.
   7.7.5. Should preventive efforts fail, any actual attempt to hijack a military aircraft must be resisted in
   a manner appropriate to the situation.
   7.7.6. Since air piracy may be committed by political terrorists or by individuals to whom the threat
   of death is not a deterrent but a stimulus, ordinary law enforcement procedures may be ineffective.
   Thus, successful conclusion of a hijacking situation and apprehension of the hijackers may require use
   of specialized law enforcement techniques and procedures.
   7.7.7. Delaying actions have been most successful in overcoming hijackings without loss of life or
   property.
   7.7.8. In the case of an aircraft carrying passengers, the primary concern is the safety of the passen-
   gers.
   7.7.9. Assistance to hijacked civil or military contract aircraft will be rendered as requested by the
   pilot in command of the aircraft and the authority exercising operational control of the anti-hijacking
   effort.

7.8. Preventive Measures. Commanders at all levels must ensure preventive measures are taken to min-
imize access to the aircraft by potential hijackers. When a C-17 is operating away from home station, the
PIC will ensure provisions of this chapter and AFI 13-207 (FOUO), as supplemented, are complied with.
   7.8.1. Preventive measures include the following: The host station passenger processing or manifest-
   ing facility should conduct anti-hijacking inspections. Do not board passengers until the PIC is fully
   satisfied with inspection results. In the absence of qualified passenger service representatives, the PIC
   will ensure the anti-hijacking inspection of passengers and baggage is accomplished.
   7.8.2. Medical facility commanders are responsible for anti-hijacking inspection of patients. When
   patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections
   prior to loading.
   7.8.3. During exercises or contingencies in support of combat operations involving the movement of
   large groups of personnel, the unit being supported should manifest passengers and perform
   anti-hijacking inspections.
   7.8.4. Passengers will not carry weapons or ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage
   aboard an aircraft. EXCEPTION: Special agents, guards of the Secret Service or State Department,
   RAVEN Team Members, and other individuals specifically authorized to carry weapons.
130                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         7.8.4.1. Troops or deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft.
         They will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. Troops may carry unloaded weapons and
         ammunition aboard the aircraft during combat operations. When the tactical situation dictates (in
         coordination with the aircrew), weapons may be loaded at the order of the troop commander or
         team leader.
         7.8.4.2. Dummy clips that can be easily identified may be loaded for training at the order of the
         team leader in coordination with the aircrew.
         7.8.4.3. RAVENs will only be armed in-flight on specifically designated missions identified on
         the mission “frag” as “RAVEN in-flight arming required”.
      7.8.5. If weapons must be loaded/cleared, the individual/s will:
         7.8.5.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or personnel
         before un-holstering or un-slinging their weapons.
         7.8.5.2. Clear weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.

7.9. Initial Response. When an act of air piracy involves an Air Force installation or aircraft within the
United States, response will be according to the following guidelines until such time as FAA assumes
active direction of anti-hijacking efforts. Resist all attempts to hijack a military aircraft. Resistance may
vary from simple dissuasion, through deception and subterfuge, to direct physical confrontation, includ-
ing the prudent use of weapons.
      7.9.1. The following guidelines should be used to counter a hijacking, actual or threatened, while the
      aircraft is on the ground:
         7.9.1.1. Delay movement of the aircraft to provide time for ground personnel and the aircrew to
         establish communication and execute coordinated resistance actions.
         7.9.1.2. The authority for determining when ground resistance will be discontinued is vested in
         the highest available level of command. When adequate communication cannot be established, or
         when time does not permit, this authority is delegated in the following order:
             7.9.1.2.1. MAJCOM commander exercising operational control of the aircraft.
             7.9.1.2.2. MAJCOM commanders in whose Area Of Responsibility (AOR) the airfield lies.
             7.9.1.2.3. Senior operational commander on scene.
             7.9.1.2.4. PIC in compliance with MAJCOM directives.
      7.9.2. A hijacked aircraft carrying weapons of mass destruction will not be allowed to takeoff. Refer
      to DoD 5210.41M, chapter 7, for additional guidance.

7.10. In-Flight Resistance. After airborne, success in thwarting a hijacking depends on the resourceful-
ness of the aircrew. Many variables of a hijacking preclude use of any specific counter-hijacking proce-
dure. Some key factors should be evaluated before deciding a course of action to be taken, including the
nature of the threat, danger to life or crippling damage to the aircraft in-flight, destination indicated by the
hijacker, and the presence of sensitive material onboard. Some counter-hijacking actions the aircrew may
consider are:
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              131


   7.10.1. Engage the hijacker/s in conversation in an attempt to calm them and to evaluate what course
   of action might be effective.
   7.10.2. Dissuade the hijacker.
   7.10.3. Use facts or subterfuge to convince the hijacker intermediate stops are necessary.
   7.10.4. Propose more favorable alternatives, such as landing in a neutral, rather than a hostile, coun-
   try.
   7.10.5. Exploit any reasonable opportunity to incapacitate or overcome the hijacker physically,
   including the prudent use of firearms.

7.11. Communications Between Aircrew and Ground Agencies. Crews facing a hijacking threat will
notify ground agencies by any means available as soon as practical and follow-up with situation reports as
circumstances permit.
   7.11.1. If possible, transmit an in-the-clear notification of hijacking to ATC. Controllers will assign
   IFF code 7500 (does not preclude subsequent selection of code 7700).
   7.11.2. If in-the-clear transmissions are not possible, report "am being hijacked" by setting transpon-
   der to code 7500. If unable to change transponder code, or when not under radar control, transmit a
   radio message to include the phrase "(call sign) transponder seven five zero zero."
   7.11.3. Controllers will acknowledge receipt and understanding of transponder code 7500 by trans-
   mitting "(call sign) (facility name) verify squawking 7500." An affirmative reply or lack of reply from
   the pilot indicates confirmation and proper authorities are notified.
   7.11.4. To report "situation appears desperate; want armed intervention," after code 7500 is used,
   change to code 7700. If unable to change transponder code to 7700, or when not under radar control,
   transmit "(aircraft call sign) transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.1. When changing from code 7500 to code 7700, remain on 7500 for at least 3 minutes or
       until a confirmation of code 7500 is received from ATC, whichever is sooner, before changing to
       code 7700. ATC acknowledges code 7700 by transmitting "(call sign) (facility name) now reading
       you on transponder seven seven zero zero."
       7.11.4.2. Aircraft squawking 7700, after squawking 7500, which are not in radio contact with
       ATC, are considered by ATC to have an in-flight emergency (in addition to hijacking), and the
       appropriate emergency procedures are followed. Notification of authorities in this case includes
       information that the aircraft displayed the hijack code as well as the emergency code.
   7.11.5. To report "situation still desperate, want armed intervention and aircraft immobilized," leave
   flaps full down after landing, or select landing flaps while on the ground. To facilitate message distri-
   bution, transmit "(aircraft call sign) flaps are full down."
   7.11.6. To report "leave alone, do not intervene," retract the flaps after landing. Pilots who retract
   flaps after squawking 7700 should return to code 7500 and remain on code 7500 for the next leg of the
   hijacked flight unless the situation changes. Transmit "(call sign) back on seven five zero zero" to
   emphasize the fact intervention is no longer desired.

7.12. Forced Penetration of Unfriendly Airspace. Refer to FIH for international signals for air inter-
cept.
132                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


7.13. Arming of Crewmembers. When crews are directed to carry weapons (IAW mission directive,
Form 59, OPORD, etc.) a minimum of one pilot and one loadmaster will be armed. All crewmembers
should know who is armed. The following procedures apply when arming is directed:
      7.13.1. Weapons Issue. Before departing home station, obtain weapons, ammunition, box, lock and
      key. Crewmembers will be armed according to AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force
      Personnel and MAJCOM publications. If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, trans-
      fer the weapon to another authorized crew member using AF IMT 1297.
      7.13.2. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to prevent identifying
      armed crewmembers. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight, on-load or off-load
      duties and until completion of all post-flight duties. Do not wear weapons off the flight line except to
      and from the C2, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities. In general, at over-
      seas locations, weapons are not to be brought off the aircraft. In countries where FCG/SOFA autho-
      rizes such action, every effort should be made to keep all firearms onboard the Sovereign US vessel
      unless appropriately responding to a hostile event or being moved to/from storage at an armory.
      RAVEN weapons are not to be brought off the aircraft unless responding to hostile action or being
      moved to/from storage at an armory.
         7.13.2.1. AMC Passenger Terminal Procedures. Armed crewmembers must discreetly identify
         themselves to AMC passenger service personnel upon arrival at security checkpoints. One crew-
         member will present a valid set of crew orders, military identification card, and AF Form 523,
         USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, authorizing the carrying of concealed weapons. Once
         terminal personnel verify this, they will allow the crewmember to vouch for the remaining crew-
         members. The entire crew will then proceed through the magnetometer without removing objects
         from their pockets. This will prevent passengers from determining which crewmembers are
         armed.
      7.13.3. Weapons Storage In-Flight. When no passengers are aboard, weapons may be stored in the
      aircraft gun box in-flight after a satisfactory stowaway check. Crewmembers will rearm before land-
      ing. Weapons will not be unloaded before placing them in the aircraft gun box.
      7.13.4. Weapons Storage on the Ground.
         7.13.4.1. Aircrews, including stage crews, will store weapons and ammunition in the most secure
         facility available, normally the base armory.
         7.13.4.2. Non-stage aircrews may store weapons and ammunition in the aircraft gun box.
      7.13.5. When storing weapons in the gun box:
         7.13.5.1. Weapons should normally not be unloaded.
         7.13.5.2. Inform C2 which crew member has the gun box key/combination.
      7.13.6. Crew members will ensure they are reissued the same weapon until mission termination at
      home station.
      7.13.7. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing barrels if
      available. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer of loaded weapons to another crew member; place the
      weapon on a flat surface.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            133


   7.13.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew Arming/Security. When mission itineraries require the aircrews
   be armed, the arming requirement will be dictated by Form 59 or deployed operations. To allow air-
   crew preflight to start earlier in the launch sequence, 60/349 OG and security forces armory personnel
   have instituted the following aircrew arming procedures:
       7.13.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Use the AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt to document
       receipt and transfer of weapons.
       7.13.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Two crewmembers will go to the armory; one must present his/her
       AF Form 523 USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms, crew orders and ID card to the official. The
       AF Form 523 must have an expiration date that coincides with the expiration date on the individ-
       ual’s AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data. An “INDEF” date will not be
       accepted. If the AF Form 523 is not available, then the AF Form 522 must be produced. The weap-
       ons and ammunition will be transported to the aircraft in the gun box unless worn by an authorized
       crewmember. Aircrews have priority for weapons issue and may move to the front of the line.
       First come, first served will apply for weapons turn-in. These procedures may be used for any mis-
       sion requiring arming.
       7.13.8.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Weapons transported in the gun boxes will be loaded (magazine
       inserted with a round in the chamber) with the safety lever on safe (9MM) and placed in the gun
       box. Armed crewmembers will ensure weapons are carried with the safety off.
       7.13.8.4. (Added-TRAVIS) If the aircrew is required to load a weapon, use a clearing barrel if
       available. If a clearing barrel is unavailable and the aircrew is required to load and chamber a
       weapon at the aircraft, move a safe distance away from the aircraft (at least 50 feet) and ensure
       weapons are pointed away from personnel, vehicles, and the aircraft before loading and chamber-
       ing a round.

7.14. Force Protection. Crews must be alert to possibility of terrorist activities at all times. Reference
AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, Joint Service Guide 5260, Service Member's Personal Protection
Guide: Combat Terrorism While Overseas, and AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism Standards, for
Force Protection measures.
   7.14.1. Personal conduct. Crews must realize their conduct can make them a target for individuals
   dissatisfied with US foreign involvement in their national affairs. Local foreign nationals may or may
   not condone a military presence - crew conduct will be watched and judged. Therefore, utilize the fol-
   lowing:

7.15. Protecting Classified Material. The Aircraft Commander is responsible for protection of classi-
fied materials aboard their aircraft. As a minimum, insure the IFF equipment is set to zero and classified
information in the mission computer is cleared before leaving the aircraft.
   7.15.1. Hand receipt classified material to properly cleared personnel. If in question, these people
   should be able to produce a clearance authorization document from the U.S. State Department or sim-
   ilar office. If necessary, properly cleared individuals may also safeguard classified aircraft compo-
   nents to ensure constant oversight during ground operation.
   7.15.2. If transferring materials to properly cleared personnel is not feasible, steps will be taken to
   secure classified materials on the aircraft. Place materials in a pouch, then lock and seal the pouch.
   The pouch should be issued with the COMSEC/classified material. As it is a controlled item, it must
134                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      be returned to the issuing agency upon mission completion. Store the locked and sealed pouch in the
      installed aircraft gun box/locker. Secure the gun box with a GSA approved lock then seal the aircraft.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              135

                              OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS

8.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for worksheets, reports, and forms associated with AMC
operational activities. Consult governing instruction or contact wing, unit, or local flight safety officers
for assistance with safety forms.

8.2. AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report. The AF IMT 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and com-
manders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous weather, com-
plete the front side of an AF IMT 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety office. If addressing a
computer flight plan deficiency, attach a copy of the AF IMT 72, Air Report (AIREP). Send your report
so the parent unit receives it within 5 days of the event. For more information, see AFI 91-202, The US Air
Force Mishap Prevention Program.

8.3. AF IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). The AF IMT 651 is a tool to report near
midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. See AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and
Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports for more information concern-
ing the HATR program.
   8.3.1. AFI 91-204 and AFMAN 91-223 list HATR reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. The PIC shall report the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency (e.g. center, Flight
   Service Station (FSS), control tower, or aeronautical radio station) as quickly as safety allows. Include
   the following information in the radio call (as appropriate)
       8.3.2.1. Aircraft identification or call sign.
       8.3.2.2. Time and place (radial/DME of NAVAID, position relative to the airfield, incident, etc).
       8.3.2.3. Altitude or flight level.
       8.3.2.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
       8.3.2.5. Advise controlling ATC agency that the PIC will file a HATR upon landing.
   8.3.3. Deadline to file a HATR is 24 hours after event via any communication mode available. If
   landing airport has a USAF airfield management function, submit completed AF IMT 651 to the air-
   field management officer for forwarding to wing safety office. If landing airport does not have an air-
   field management office, notify the safety office of the Air Force base nearest to location where the
   condition occurred, PIC’s home base safety office, or as prescribed by overseas MAJCOM. In that
   case, provide contact sufficient information to prepare AF IMT 651.
   8.3.4. Grant individuals who submit a HATR immunity from disciplinary action provided:
       8.3.4.1. If they were the offending party, their violation was not deliberate.
       8.3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
       8.3.4.3. Their actions did not result in a mishap.
       8.3.4.4. They properly reported the incident using procedures above.
136                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


8.4. AMC IMT 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. T h e A M C
IMT 97 is a tool to notify appropriate authorities of any mishap involving crewmembers or aircraft. PICs
shall complete all appropriate areas of the form in as much detail as possible. When notified, AMC C2
agents will inform their supervisor/commander to start investigation and reporting activities IAW AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and Operation Report 3 (OPREP-3) procedures. In addition,
PICs will preserve all mission and flight related documents, e.g. flight plans, weather briefings, NOT-
AMS, Weight and Balance form, etc. for collection by appropriate safety officials
      8.4.1. PICs will report crewmember or passenger injury, aircraft damage, or injury/damage to another
      organization’s people or equipment caused by PIC’s aircraft/crewmember. At a minimum, report the
      following:
         8.4.1.1. Any physiological episode (physiological reaction, near accident, or hazard in-flight due
         to medical or physiological reasons).
NOTE: Crewmembers and passengers involved in a physiological episode will see a flight surgeon to be
evaluated and to ensure the incident is reported in the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) as
soon as practical.
         8.4.1.2. A human factor related situation, e.g. misinterpretation of instruments; information over-
         load (i.e. tactile, aural, and visual input too fast to permit reasonable analysis/decision); aircrew
         task saturation (i.e. too many responses/actions required in a short period of time); or confused
         switchology (i.e. adjacent switches where actuation of wrong switch creates dangerous situation).
         Anonymous reports are acceptable.
         8.4.1.3. A condition that required engine shutdown, in-flight flameout, engine failure, suspected
         engine power loss, or loss of thrust that required descent below MEA. Engine failures include, but
         are not limited to, shrapnel from a failed internal engine component penetrating the engine case,
         engine case rupture/burn-through, engine nacelle fire, substantial fuel leak, or unselected thrust
         reversal. Consistent with safety, immediately report incidents that involve multiple engines (may
         report single-engine incidents upon landing). NOTE: Exclude intentional shutdowns for training
         and/or FCF unless the engine fails to restart.
         8.4.1.4. A flight control malfunction (including the autopilot and trim systems) that results in an
         unexpected or hazardous change of flight attitude, altitude, or heading. Enter the flag words,
         “Reportable Flight Control Malfunction” in the AFTO 781A.
         8.4.1.5. A landing gear malfunction aggravated by failed emergency system or procedures.
         8.4.1.6. An in-flight loss of all pitot-static or gyro-stabilized attitude/directional instrument indi-
         cations.
         8.4.1.7. Any spillage/leakage of radioactive, toxic, corrosive, or flammable material from aircraft
         stores or cargo.
         8.4.1.8. Conditions that required pilot to depart takeoff or landing surface.
         8.4.1.9. All in-flight fires regardless of damage.
         8.4.1.10. All bird/wildlife strikes regardless of damage.
         8.4.1.11. Incidents that, in the PIC’s judgment, are in the interest of flight safety.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                          137


   8.4.2. Always provide your home station safety officer a copy of relevant information. Make every
   effort to preserve all mission and flight related documents, such as flight plans, weather briefings,
   NOTAMS, Weight and Balance form, etc., for collection by appropriate safety officials. PICs shall
   use the following precedence to report mishaps (as soon as feasible after event):
       8.4.2.1. MAJCOM flight safety officer (FSO).
       8.4.2.2. Any FSO.
       8.4.2.3. The nearest USAF C2 center.
       8.4.2.4. Any USAF Airfield Management Operations.
   8.4.3. (Added-TRAVIS) AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, paragraph 8.4., provides specific criteria on when
   to complete an AMC Form 97. The form is a tool used by commanders and safety personnel to report,
   investigate, and ultimately prevent mishaps. Although command and control agencies may use basic
   factual details for operational reporting, the AMC Form 97 is a limited use document and command
   posts and commanders must protect information contained in the form (it may not be used for adverse
   action against a crew). IAW these regulations, report mishaps as soon as possible using the following
   guidance.

Table 8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Mishap Reporting Procedures.
1. At airfields with an AMC flying safety officer (FSO), notify the FSO.
2. At stations without an AMC FSO, notify the command post duty officer or AMC liaison
officer.
3. At an Air Force base with no AMC function, contact base operations or the host base safety
office.
4. At other stations, relay necessary information to the nearest Air Force command post.
5. In all cases, retain a copy of all relevant information and turn it in to the 60/349 AMW/SE.

   8.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 AMW and 349 AMW crews will adhere to the following guidelines:
       8.4.4.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Fax a copy to 60 AMW/SE and 60 AMW/CP as soon as possible.
       8.4.4.2. (Added-TRAVIS) 349 AMW crews will fax a copy to 349 AMW Wing Operations Cen-
       ter and 349 AMW/SE.
       8.4.4.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Notify TACC and your squadron commander or operations officer
       ASAP.
       8.4.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) If unable to fax from the location of the incident, promptly fax at the
       first opportunity.
   8.4.5. (Added-TRAVIS) All reporting requirements resulting from the incident have shifted to the
   wing command post and other applicable agencies. The wing is now responsible for reports affecting
   Travis assigned airplanes and aircrews even if flying another wing’s airplane. Therefore any time a
   Travis crew is flying another wing’s airplane and an AMC Form 97 is required, use the notification
   guidelines in paragraph 8.4.4. (Added) and fax a copy of the same information to the command post
   of the airplane’s assigned wing.
138                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      8.4.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Compliance with the above procedures provides timely mishap reporting to
      commanders, enables 60 AMW/CP and 60 AMW/SE to accomplish necessary operational reporting,
      and initiates safety channel investigation and reporting to prevent mishaps.

8.5. Report Violations, Unusual Events, or Circumstances. PICs shall document events that require
them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3 (unless waived by competent authority) or alleged navigation errors
(include over-water position errors over 24NMs, border, or ATC violations). Do not release names or per-
sonal aircrew information to non-USAF agencies.
      8.5.1. Describe deviation(s) using the following report format:
         8.5.1.1. Facts. Report pertinent details of the event.
         8.5.1.2. Investigation and analysis. Report circumstances which required/drove deviation(s).
         8.5.1.3. Findings and conclusions.
         8.5.1.4. Recommendations to prevent recurrence.
         8.5.1.5. Corrective actions taken.
      8.5.2. Include the following attachments with the report:
         8.5.2.1. Formal notification of incident.
         8.5.2.2. Approved crew orders.
         8.5.2.3. Crewmembers’ official statements (if applicable).
         8.5.2.4. Other pertinent documents submitted in evidence (logs, charts, etc.).
      8.5.3. In addition to above (when aircraft is equipped), PIC shall download original flight plan to a
      floppy disk and turn it in to the C2 center or parent standardization and evaluation office.
      8.5.4. OG/CC shall send the original investigation report to the appropriate MAJCOM within 45 days
      of the event/notification. ANG/AFRC OG/CCs shall send original investigation report through chan-
      nels to HQ AFRC/IGI within 35 days of the event/notification. HQ AFRC/IGI will send the investiga-
      tion report to MAJCOM within 45 days of event/notification.
      8.5.5. Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, for nav-
      igation errors over 24 NMs.
         8.5.5.1. When notified of a navigation position error, the PIC (or agency that receives initial noti-
         fication) shall document the circumstances surrounding the incident (using report format below)
         and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3.
         8.5.5.2. Include the following information in the report:
         8.5.5.3. The name and location of agency/unit submitting report.
         8.5.5.4. Effected mission identification number.
         8.5.5.5. Reference OPREPs-3 to determine type of event (i.e., state "navigation position error.").
         8.5.5.6. The date, time (Zulu), and location (e.g., ARTCC area) of alleged infraction.
         8.5.5.7. Describe facts and circumstances. Include aircraft type and tail number, unit (aircrew’s
         wing or squadron), home base, route of flight, point of alleged deviation, and miles off course.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             139


  8.5.6. PICs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission to
  appropriate MAJCOM agencies. Reportable events include, but are not limited to, spectrum interfer-
  ence, interception, fuel dumping, multiple engine failure, hostile fire, injury to passenger or aircrew
  member, etc. This list is not all exhaustive. Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports
  to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” of the incident
  to a C2 agency.
     8.5.6.1. The Spectrum Interference Resolution Program, covered in AFI 10-707, Spectrum Inter-
     ference Resolution Program, establishes procedures to combat the effect of meaconing, intrusion,
     jamming, and interference. PICs who encounter electromagnetic interference (EMI) will report
     the event to the nearest C2 agency as soon as practical.
         8.5.6.1.1. Address EMI reports to: HQ AMC SCOTT AFB IL//A63// and addressees listed in
         AFI 10-707. Send reports via electronic message format with the following information in
         plain text:
             8.5.6.1.1.1. Frequency selected when EMI occurred.
             8.5.6.1.1.2. Equipment affected by EMI. Location of the system. The system function,
             name, nomenclature, manufacturer with model number or other system description. The
             operating mode of the system, if applicable (frequency agile, pulse doppler, search, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.3. Description of EMI (noise, pulsed, continuous, intermittent, on so forth).
             8.5.6.1.1.4. Effect EMI had on system performance (reduced range, false targets, reduced
             intelligibility, data errors, etc.).
             8.5.6.1.1.5. Date(s) and time(s) of EMI.
             8.5.6.1.1.6. Location where EMI occurred (coordinates or line of bearing, if known, other-
             wise state as unknown.)
             8.5.6.1.1.7. Source of the EMI if known.
             8.5.6.1.1.8. List other units that received interference (if known) and their location or dis-
             tance and bearing from your location.
             8.5.6.1.1.9. A clear, concise narrative summary on what you know about the EMI, with
             any actions taken to resolve the problem.
             8.5.6.1.1.10. Whether or not PIC wants expert/technical assistance (include level of secu-
             rity clearance expert requires).
             8.5.6.1.1.11. Specify impact the EMI had on your mission.
             8.5.6.1.1.12. Provide a POC (Name, Rank, DSN/Commercial Phone Number, and Duty
             hours).
         8.5.6.1.2. C2 agents must prepare an OPREP-3 if EMI is suspected meaconing, intrusion, or
         jamming, interference sufficient to cause a hazard, or if, in the PIC’s judgment, the situation
         warrants such a report.
         8.5.6.1.3. PICs shall serve as classification authority for EMI reports. Evaluate an adversar-
         ies’ ability to exploit certain systems using EMI and protect information accordingly. PICs on
         a non-sensitive mission or who judge the EMI to be interference from a non-hostile source
140                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


             need not classify EMI reports unless that report would reveal system vulnerability. Classify
             interference report(s) at stations located in combat areas or during sensitive military missions.

8.6. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) - Aviation Fuels Documentation. This section prescribes
aviation POL (AVPOL) procedures that ensure correct documentation, form and invoice processing, and
program supervision. Reference AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum Products and Other Supplies and Ser-
vices Off-Station. Use the Multi Service Corporation (MSC) air card for the purchase of aviation fuel and
ancillary ground services at commercial airports (and some military installations) worldwide. The air card
is authorized for use by all U.S. government aircraft, state, and local law enforcement aircraft, and some
foreign government aircraft. All PICs should plan to use the “platinum” MSC card. In most cases, there
will be no changes when refueling at non-Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) contract locations. The
MSC card is accepted at approximately 4,800 locations worldwide. A list of all MSC-accepting mer-
chants can be found at https://www.airseacard.com. It replaces the Standard Form (SF) 44, Purchase
Order-Invoice-Voucher, at locations that accept the MSC card.
      8.6.1. Responsibilities. Aircrew and maintenance personnel will be familiar with AVPOL procedures
      and documentation requirements of this chapter. Improper use of the MSC card could create financial
      liability for the purchaser.
         8.6.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The PIC will ensure that the Air Card is on the aircraft (including
         locals) prior to takeoff. If the card is not present at home station, notify the maintenance supervi-
         sor. He or she will then either provide you with a new card or, as a minimum, the credit card num-
         ber assigned to that aircraft.
         8.6.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If the card is lost en route, make a “note” entry in the AFTO Form
         781A. Include all relevant details (e.g., “BP vendor at EGPK [Mr. Driver] misplaced card. Ensu-
         ing search failed to recover card.”). If the card is missing from an aircraft, inform maintenance and
         document the missing card in the AFTO Form 781A, stating that it was missing upon your arrival
         at the aircraft. If the Air Card is lost, misplaced or destroyed, contact the Wing Refueling Docu-
         ment Control Officer (WRDCO) immediately so the old card can be locked out of the system. In
         addition, call the Air Card merchant (Multi-Service) at (866) 308-3811 (US/Canada) or (913)
         217-9303 (Other Areas) and a technician will give you a card number to use for the remainder of
         the mission. Ensure a new card is ordered through the WRDCO upon mission return. Use the Stan-
         dard Form 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, only as required at subsequent stops.
             8.6.1.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) If you cannot obtain a card or a card number and the fuel vendor
             will accept nothing else, call the Travis WRDCO during duty hours (DSN 837-3354) or call
             TACC and inform them of your situation.
      8.6.2. Refuel/defuel USAF aircraft at DoD locations whenever possible. If DoD service is not avail-
      able, purchase fuel from other source(s) in the following priority:
         8.6.2.1. Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) or Canadian into-plane contracts.
         8.6.2.2. Foreign government air forces.
NOTE: DoD FLIP en route supplements identify locations with into-plane contracts.
      8.6.3. AVPOL Forms Documentation and Procedures.
         8.6.3.1. The DD1898, Fuel Sale Slip, is the fuel transaction receipt used for purchases at other
         DoD locations, including DFSC into-plane contract locations. Log and place the DD1898 inside
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                        141


     the AF IMT 644. The PIC or designated representative shall complete this form. NOTE: If the
     contractor insists on a unique invoice along with the DD1898, annotate the vendor’s invoice with
     “DUPLICATE DD1898 ACCOMPLISHED.”
     8.6.3.2. The AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenting Log, is a tool to log and store all
     AVPOL transaction forms. Record all off-station transactions on the front of the form and insert
     the original form inside the envelope. Turn in the AF IMT 664, with supporting forms, to mainte-
     nance debriefing or as directed by local procedures. The PIC or designated representative shall
     complete this form when appropriate.
        8.6.3.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log. Place receipts
        from the Air Card vendors, and all other fuel and ground service documents inside the AF IMT
        664 and return to the Squadron Refueling Document Control Officer (SRDCO) for your
        respective unit. Ensure the front of AF Form 664 is filled out completely and properly with
        heading information and one line entry per receipt. Number receipts to coincide with AF IMT
        664 line entry. Reference the Loadmaster Guide for further information.
     8.6.3.3. The SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher, may be used to purchase fuel, ground
     services and/or other authorized products when no MSC card contract is in place.
        8.6.3.3.1. SF 44 fuel purchases where FBO agrees to invoice DESC for payment.
            8.6.3.3.1.1. The aircrew shall present the SF 44 as the purchase invoice when an FBO
            refuses to accept the MSC card. The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and attach it to the
            FBO vendor ticket/invoice when the FBO also declines use of the SF 44 and uses its own
            invoice/receipt. Fuel purchases shall be documented on a separate SF 44 from ground ser-
            vices and other authorized products since the FBO must invoice DESC for the fuel and the
            customer for non-fuel product and services.
            8.6.3.3.1.2. Copies 1 and 2 of the SF 44 shall be provided to the FBO. Copy 1 of the SF 44
            and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applicable, shall be forwarded to the fol-
            lowing address by the FBO to bill/invoice DESC: DESC-RRF, Building 1621-K, 2261
            Hughes Avenue, Suite 128, Lackland AFB, Texas 78236.
            8.6.3.3.1.3. Copy 3 of the SF 44 and one copy of the FBO commercial invoice, if applica-
            ble, shall be provided to the aircrew. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664. Air-
            crews shall present all fuel purchase receipts to the designated aviation squadron
            Certifying Official and/or Accountable Official upon return to home station to enable
            timely validation and financial obligation processing into the Fuels Automated System
            (FAS).
        8.6.3.3.2. SF 44 fuel purchases where the FBO requires cash payment.
            8.6.3.3.2.1. Cash fuel purchases are only authorized when either the DOD 4500.54G,
            DoD Foreign Clearance Guide, requires cash payment, or when FBO locations outside the
            United States and U. S. Territories refuse MSC card and/or SF 44 invoicing processes. Air-
            crews required to pay cash for aviation fuel purchases shall employ the following proce-
            dures (NOTE: these procedures do not apply to non-fuel products or services):
                8.6.3.3.2.1.1. The aircrew shall obtain cash from a local DoD Finance source that is
                charged to an approved Treasury suspense account prior to home station departure.
142                                         AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


                 8.6.3.3.2.1.2. Aircrews shall complete the SF 44 and obtain the FBO fuel vendor
                 annotation in block 11 of the SF 44 to confirm total cash amount and also sign and date
                 the SF 44 blocks 20 and 21. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664. Aircrew
                 shall return unused cash to their local DoD Finance source upon return to home station.
                 Present the completed SF 44 (for non-fuel charges only) to the appropriate home sta-
                 tion administrative personnel for processing (e.g., Wing Refueling Document Control
                 Officer, Finance Office, etc.)
         8.6.3.3.3. SF 44 purchases of ground services and other approved products (not fuel).
             8.6.3.3.3.1. Complete a separate SF 44 for non-fuel purchases. Provide the FBO copies 1
             and 2 of the SF 44. The FBO shall use copy 1 and one copy of the FBO commercial
             invoice, if applicable, to directly bill/invoice the purchasing organization. Block 9 of the
             SF 44 shall reflect the organization name and address of the finance office responsible for
             payment to the FBO. The purchasing organization shall make payment to the FBO upon
             receipt of the invoice from the FBO. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
         8.6.3.3.4. If the vendor presents their own form for signature and accepts the SF 44, write the
         statement "SF 44 Executed" on the vendor’s form.
         8.6.3.3.5. Turn in two copies of the SF 44 to the operations officer at home station.
         8.6.3.3.6. Present the aircraft identaplate for purchases at SITCO Agreement locations. Make
         certain the invoice includes date of transaction, grade of product, quantity issued/defueled,
         unit of measure, and signature of Air Force member who accepted product. If vendor also
         requires completed SF 44 write statement, "AF FORMS EXECUTED” on vendor’s invoice.
         Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
      8.6.3.4. Purchasing Aviation Fuel in Canada. The DoD and Canadian Department of National
      Defense have signed a memorandum of understanding allowing DoD aircraft to use the DD1896,
      Jet Fuel Identaplate, when refueling at Canadian airfields with a Canadian National Defense
      Contract (CNDC). Use the AIR for fuel purchases at Canadian airports without a CNDC, and for
      ground handling services at all Canadian airports.
      8.6.3.5. Host Nation Forms. Use host country forms to effect purchases at foreign military air-
      fields, including “replacement-in-kind” locations. Hand scribe information from aircraft identa-
      plate on the local form. Log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664.
      8.6.3.6. AF Form 1994, Fuel Issue/Defuel Document, records fuel purchases at USAF bases
      using a valid DD Form, 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate. The PIC or designated representative shall
      complete the form then log and place a copy inside the AF IMT 664, Aircraft Fuels Documenta-
      tion Log.
      8.6.3.7. AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document,
      records POL actions for particular airframe IAW applicable directives. The PIC or designated rep-
      resentative shall complete the form and turn it in to maintenance debrief following the mission.
      8.6.3.8. DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, is the aircraft fuel and oil charge card.
      8.6.3.9. For off-station missions, the PIC will complete or verify accuracy of the AF IMTs 15,
      315, 664, AFTO Form 781H, DD Form 1898, and associated fuels receipts then place them in the
      AF IMT 664 (use eight digits for all USAF aircraft tail number entries). The PIC will transmit all
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              143


       AF IMT 664 information via phone, fax, or message if mission causes him/her to be off-station
       past the last day of the month.
       8.6.3.10. C-17 Loadmasters will accurately record, and Aircraft Commanders will verify, fueling
       actions on the AFTO Form 781H, and AF IMT 664. When available, record tanker refueling infor-
       mation (i.e., tail number, unit of assignment, and home station).
           8.6.3.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Note: Vendor delivery receipts alone are insufficient for pay-
           ment. They must have an AIR Card, DD Form 1898, Fuel Sale Slip, receipt or an SF 44 to
           accompany them.
       8.6.3.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Unique Refueling Transactions.
           8.6.3.11.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Free refuel. Log on the AF Form 664 and include the docu-
           ment. (This will include landing anywhere within Kuwait regardless of mission. Include the
           vendor document in the AF Form 664 and mark the appropriate block on the front free fuel).
           8.6.3.11.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Defuel. Enter the transaction on the AF IMT 664 in red.
           8.6.3.11.3. (Added-TRAVIS) In flight refueling. Include tanker’s Wing ICAO identifier in
           the “Airfield Name” block, include IN-FLIGHT in the “Type Document” block.

8.7. Not used.

8.8. AMC Form 54, Aircraft Commander’s Report on Services/Facilities. The AMC Form 54 is a
tool to report level of excellence for services encountered during mobility operations. Be quick to identify
outstanding performers and attempt to resolve problems at lowest level practical. PICs should advise
affected agency on their intent to submit an AMC Form 54. Provide a copy of the completed form to local
station AMC C2 agency. Upon return to home station, PICs will coordinate form with SQ/CC and OG/
CC. For Forms 54 that require AMC coordination, OG/CCs shall review and submit AMC Form 54 to
18AF/CC.

8.9. AMC Form 196, Aircraft Commander’s Report on Crew Member. The AMC Form 196 is a
tool to document an aircrew member or mission essential ground personnel’s outstanding, below average,
or unsatisfactory performance during a mobility mission. Be quick to identify outstanding performers and

   and this instruction.
   9.1.2. Mission qualification, upgrade training, evaluations, off station trainers, and JA/ATTs may
   carry passengers only if the individual in training is qualified (completed aircraft check ride with a
   valid AF IMT 8). Air refueling is authorized if the pilot flying is A/R qualified.
   9.1.3. If passengers are onboard, touch-and-go landings, Night Vision Goggle (NVG) training and
   airdrops are prohibited, and all doors will remain closed. (This does not apply to MEGP.)
   9.1.4. Multiple practice approaches will not be accomplished with passengers.
   EXCEPTION: When approved by the MAJCOM, maintenance and civilian employees, under direct
   contract to the DoD and engaged in official direct mission support activities, considered “mission
   essential” may be onboard when touch-and-go or stop-and-go landings are performed providing the
   mission is a designated training flight and an IP or EP is in command.

9.2. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations.
   9.2.1. Three quarter flap touch-and-go landings will only be accomplished under the direct supervi-
   sion of an IP or AC certified by the unit commander to perform touch-and-go landings. AC
   touch-and-go certification will be in accordance with AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 1, C-17 Training.

         9.3.1.3. Pre-mission coordination requirements. As part of pre-mission planning, PICs will con-
         tact parent wing current operations and obtain training mission number(s) for use at each en route
         location(s) where training events are planned. In addition, PICs will coordinate with and receive
         approval from the airfield(s) where training is to be accomplished. They will then coordinate with
         the 18 AF TACC to ensure adequate ground time is available at planned training locations to allow
         for planned training events, clearing customs, required crew rest, etc. Once complete, wing current
         operations will coordinate with 18 AF TACC to re-cut the mission and add the training mission
         number(s) in GDSS/C2IPS or GDSS2.
         9.3.1.4. Upon initial arrival at the training location, close out the current line on the AFTO IMT
         781 and log the training time on the next line using the appropriate training mission symbol and
         number.
      9.3.2. Crews may accomplish aerial refueling training provided the following requirements are met:
         9.3.2.1. A qualified AC (or higher) must onload all mission required fuel prior to commencing
         any training.

         9.6.1.3.6. Runway should be lit with an authorized covert lighting pattern.
  9.6.2. Airdrop Training.
     9.6.2.1. Restrictions.
         9.6.2.1.1. Pilots are authorized to fly single ship or formation and perform airdrop operations
         while wearing NVGs at standard night NVG en route and drop altitudes as defined in Chapter
         16 and in AFTTP 3-3.35A. Drop zones will be lit IAW AFI 13-217 Lighting Patterns (Covert
         or Overt).
         9.6.2.1.2. Loadmasters are authorized to perform heavy equipment and container delivery
         system airdrops with minimum lighting while wearing NVGs as necessary to assist with oper-
         ations. Lights will be kept to a minimum during all NVG operations. Blacked out (no-light)
         operations in the cargo compartment are not authorized. Use of NVGs during static line per-
         sonnel operations are not authorized. (Restriction applies to the cargo compartment only.)
  9.6.3. (Added-TRAVIS) NVG Operations.
     9.6.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) NVG operations are designed for a basic C-17 aircrew (two pilots and
     one loadmaster who have completed the NVG training program). However, as in all cases, if spe-
     cific mission requirements or risk mitigation plans dictate, group or squadron commanders may
     add additional crewmembers they deem necessary to safely accomplish the mission. When adding
     an aircrew member to perform NVG safety observer duties, that person should be NVG qualified.
     9.6.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) C-17 aircraft commanders who complete the current AMC-approved
     NVG Airland training program are authorized to takeoff or land on runways 90 feet and wider pro-
     vided weather and runway conditions permit a normal landing while using NVGs. PICs will deter-
     mine in premission planning which syllabus the pilots flying on the sortie completed to ensure that
     tasks accomplished are authorized.
     9.6.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Prior to descent, the approach shall be thoroughly briefed to all crew-
     members. The brief should also include the following items: specific duties during the approach,
     aircraft weight, pressure altitude, and the effect of winds on the approach and landing phase. Com-
     plete all checklists before descending below 500 feet AGL.
     9.6.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) All crewmembers in primary crew positions and NVG safety observ-
     ers (if used) must be NVG certified to conduct NVG operations. C-17 NVG operations will be
     conducted to runways marked IAW 13-217. Prior to initial departure, PICs shall determine what
     lighting scheme they can expect at planned destination. Maintenance must configure aircraft with
     IR-filtered lights for missions that include NVG operations as required. While blacked-out ground
     operations are authorized, do not perform blacked-out takeoffs/landings.

         9.6.3.5. (Added-TRAVIS) For NVG training sorties at Travis AFB, include a statement in the
         Remarks section indicating NVG training will be accomplished at Travis AFB and the applicable
         times.
         9.6.3.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis AFB crews should not plan to fly past 0200L to accommodate
         TAFB control tower staffing requirements.
         9.6.3.7. (Added-TRAVIS) There will be no more than four participating aircraft at any time
         within Travis’ Class D airspace. The tower watch supervisor may reduce NVG/LZ operations to
         less than four if he/she deems it necessary in the interest of flying safety.
         9.6.3.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews will monitor tower and guard frequencies at all times. Utilize
         Tower UHF frequency as primary radio and broadcast position reports as if operating in a Unicom
         environment. It is imperative to keep TAFB tower informed of which maneuvers crews are per-
         forming/requesting at all times.

9.7. Prohibited In-Flight Maneuvers. Stalls and approach to stalls, abnormal configuration approaches,
and unusual attitudes will not be practiced or demonstrated in-flight.

9.8. Evaluator/Instructor Pilot Briefing. Before all training/evaluation missions, aircraft commanders
or instructors/flight examiners should brief their crew on the following additional items:
      9.8.1. Training/Evaluation requirements. Instructors/evaluators (for each crew position) will outline
      requirements and objectives for each student or examinee. Brief the training objectives IAW AMC
      C-17 Aircrew Training System syllabus.
      9.8.2. Planned training area and seat changes.

9.9. Debriefing. Review and evaluate overall training performed. Each student or aircrew member
should understand thoroughly what training has been accomplished. Ensure all training is documented.

9.10. Simulated Instrument Flight. Artificial vision restricting devices are not authorized for any phase
of flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use of a vision-restricting
device.

9.11. Planned Go Around After Touchdown (GOAT). A GOAT is a planned training maneuver,
accomplished in conjunction with a full flap approach to an Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) or simulated
ALZ, used to train pilots to accomplish spot landings. The approach and landing for the GOAT are
accomplished IAW the approach and assault landing sections of TO 1C-17A-1. Upon main gear touch-
down, a go-around will be initiated IAW TO 1C-17A-1.
      9.11.1. An instructor pilot must occupy a primary pilot position during the maneuver.
      9.11.2. The following parameters must be met:
         9.11.2.1. Landing data must support a full stop.
         9.11.2.2. TO 1C-17A-1 requirements for landing gear cooling periods following consecutive
         landings apply.
         9.11.2.3. Sink rate reduction and FPV movement associated with the landing phase must be
         accomplished in addition to the power advance for the go-around.

NOTE: These restrictions do not apply to operational missions.
9.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Combat Offload Training and Star Turns at Travis AFB.
   9.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Combat Offload training will normally be accomplished at Travis AFB.
   Ensure the area behind the combat offload area is clear of personnel and equipment.
   9.12.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Taxiway N (between south entrance of the 900 ramp and taxiway M) is
   designated as the primary combat offload location at Travis AFB. For all combat offloads at Travis
   AFB aircrews will accomplish the following:
       9.12.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Coordinate planned drop time and location with APS during combat
       pallet upload. If drop time changes during local execution, coordinate with Command Post to
       relay information to ATOC.
       9.12.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Obtain taxi clearance to the selected Combat Offload location from
       Ground Control.

         9.12.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) 30 minutes prior to the event, make a radio transmission to Com-
         mand Post advising of planned offload operations.
         9.12.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Request approval for taxi from Travis Ground Control and report to
         Command Post when commencing and completing combat offloads.
      9.12.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Off-station Combat Offloads will follow locally published guidance for
      the location where the training is conducted. PICs must thoroughly study the procedures and coordi-
      nate requirements at the off-station location.
      9.12.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Star turns. A star turn is a turning maneuver in which the aircraft performs
      a 180 degree turn within a limited amount of space. The intersection of taxiway M and N is designated
      as the primary star turn area. The designated secondary star turn area is intersection of taxiway N and
      the south entrance into the 900 ramp. When using the secondary combat offload area, crews will posi-
      tion their main gear on the most westward white painted line (line furthest away from runway) depict-
      ing the simulated 90-foot runway as opposed to the line closest to the taxiway edge in order to
      minimize stress on the taxiway edge.
9.13. (Added-TRAVIS) Transition Training.
      9.13.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Familiar Airfields. The following airfields are available for transition
      training (i.e.; approaches, VFR patterns, etc.). Paragraph 9.13.5. (Added) further defines which fields
      are available for tactics training. The PIC will review NOTAMs, IFR Supplement, AP/1, and the Air-
      field Suitability Report and Restrictions (ASRR) for the transition field. PIC’s will consider training
      requirements, weather, and sortie duration when selecting an alternate training field. Request any
      extension to scheduled sortie duration from TCP. Advise TCP of intentions prior to departing the
      Travis pattern.
         9.13.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Travis AFB. There is a priority system during periods of limited air-
         craft in the pattern (see Table 9.2. (Added) and Table 9.3. (Added)). If there is a conflict concern-
         ing the number of aircraft in the pattern, ATC will send one aircraft into holding, and inform TCP
         of the situation. TCP will contact aircraft in the pattern to determine priority and inform ATC of
         the lowest priority aircraft. The aircraft with the lowest priority will make intentions known to
         ATC and TCP (full stop, depart area, hold, or full stop to taxi-back). If departing Travis due to pat-
         tern saturation, advise TCP of intentions.

      or departing aircraft in the local area or established on an instrument approach.
      9.13.1.2.12. (Added-TRAVIS) The PIC shall:
         9.13.1.2.12.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Cancel their IFR flight plan with Seattle ARTCC prior
         to conducting training at KMWH.
         9.13.1.2.12.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Monitor CTAF frequency (118.25) at all times.
         9.13.1.2.12.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Maintain VFR at all times while conducting training.
         9.13.1.2.12.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Expect to depart KMWH VFR and pick up an IFR
         clearance with Seattle Center enroute.
         9.13.1.2.12.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Yield to any civil aircraft wishing to arrive or depart
         KMWH.
      9.13.1.2.13. (Added-TRAVIS) Limit overflight of populated areas surrounding Grant
      County Airport, to the maximum extent possible.
      9.13.1.2.14. (Added-TRAVIS) Coordinate all training activities with “IRONCROSS” while
      in flight. Use CTAF frequency 118.25. During preflight, crews will ensure that their appropri-
      ate Moses Lake block time is entered into AMT and will update IRONCROSS with any
      changes. Prior to flight, contact Travis Command Post and have them pass appropriate infor-
      mation to McChord Command Post.
      9.13.1.2.15. (Added-TRAVIS) Extended Runway Operations: These procedures may only
      be used during the non-operational hours of Grant County Control Tower.
         9.13.1.2.15.1. (Added-TRAVIS) The field will be considered uncontrolled and pilots
         will adhere to “Uncontrolled Field Procedures” contained in AFI 11-202V3, General
         Flight Rules and recommended practices in the Airman’s Information Manual (AIM)
         (http://www.faa.gov/atpubs/AIM/chap4toc.htm). All pilots and “Iron Cross” will con-
         duct primary communications on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) pub-
         lished in the IFR Supplement. Pilots will make advisory radio calls according to AIM
         paragraphs 4-1-9b., c. and h. Preface all CTAF radio calls with “Grant County Traffic,
         Callsign xx…”
         9.13.1.2.15.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Weather. Pilots will conduct flight operations under
         VFR only. The minimum weather for extended operations is 4000-3 for ETA plus one
         hour after planned departure.
         9.13.1.2.15.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Landing Zone Safety Officer (LZSO) call sign “IRON-
         CROSS” (frequency UHF 342.3/ VHF 138.1) will set up the NVG covert runway lighting
         and adjust airfield lighting to accommodate Air Force training needs and those of any civil
         aircraft arriving and departing while the Air Force is conducting training.
         9.13.1.2.15.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Display all exterior lighting at the request of “IRON-
         CROSS”.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                         153


          9.13.1.2.15.5. (Added-TRAVIS) C-17 Operations. During extended hours operations, a
          maximum of two (2) C-17s may be in the traffic pattern simultaneously for multiple run-
          way operations. “Iron Cross” must be in place prior to commencing C-17 operations
          (crews will not operate at MWH without either Iron Cross or Tower personnel available).
          Pilots will cancel IFR with Seattle Center or Grant County Approach prior to contacting
          Iron Cross on CTAF, currently 118.25. Crews will also monitor the normal Iron Cross fre-
          quency (342.3) during all uncontrolled operations at MWH. Pilots will set transponders to
          12xx (xx = the numerical portion of the call sign) upon cancellation of IFR and display
          lights as requested by Iron Cross. If another plane is in the pattern with the same numerical
          call sign as the arriving aircraft, the arriving aircraft will assume a new call sign for MWH
          operations equal to their previous call sign plus one. Example: Callsign 25 arrives to
          MWH and finds Sonic 25 already in the pattern. Callsign 25 will assume Callsign 26 as
          new callsign and will squawk 1226 appropriately. The primary runways for extended oper-
          ations will be 14L/09. Aircraft commanders will coordinate a runway change with Iron
          Cross when tailwinds exceed 10 knots or runway available is insufficient for current con-
          ditions. Pilots will conduct NVG training on runways 14L/32R. Pilots will yield to civil
          traffic. Traffic pattern operations will be flown as follows:
             9.13.1.2.15.5.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 14L. Patterns will be left traffic at 3,000’
             MSL. Conditions permitting, pilots will turn crosswind or closed pattern with safe alti-
             tude/airspeed prior to 1.5 NM (2.5 DME) from the departure end of runway. On depar-
             ture leg make crosswind turn NLT Bear Creek located at approximately 2.5 DME.
             9.13.1.2.15.5.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 09. Patterns will be right traffic at 3,500’
             MSL. Conditions permitting, pilots will turn crosswind or closed pattern with safe alti-
             tude/airspeed no lower than 1,000’ AGL but prior to 1.5 NM (2 DME) from the depar-
             ture end of runway. On departure leg make crosswind turn NLT Bear Creek located at
             approximately 2 DME.
             9.13.1.2.15.5.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 32R. Patterns will be right traffic at
             3,000’ MSL. Conditions permitting, pilots should start base turn to roll out no more
             than 2.5 mile final.
             9.13.1.2.15.5.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 27. Patterns will be left traffic at 3,500’
             MSL. Conditions permitting, pilots should roll out on a final not more than 2.5 miles
             from approach end.
             9.13.1.2.15.5.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 22. Departure (for use when landing on
             Rwy 9). Pilots will make right turns for departure or enter downwind right downwind
             for Rwy 09. Otherwise maneuver west/northwest to reenter the pattern for Rwy 32R/
             14L or 27.
             9.13.1.2.15.5.6. (Added-TRAVIS) When RWY 14L/32R is closed. Crews may use
             RWY 04/22 for training (full stops, low approaches, or go-around after touchdown
             only). Primary runway will be RWY 22, if winds allow. Iron Cross will provide the
             covert lighting. Crews fly right closed patterns for RWY 22 and left closed patterns for
             RWY 04. Pattern altitude is 3000 MSL. Conditions permitting (safe altitude/airspeed),
             pilots will not delay the crosswind turn or closed pattern.

            9.13.1.2.15.5.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Departures. Pilots will depart VFR, climb to
            3,500’ MSL and contact Seattle Center (126.1/291.6) for an IFR clearance.
            9.13.1.2.15.5.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Noise Abatement. During extended operations,
            pilots will avoid over flight of any portion of the City of Moses Lake and the housing
            area adjacent to Moses Lake, coordinates N4710.3 W11919.4 or noise sensitive area
            N4710.1 W11915.4 (do not fly within 1,500’ AGL and 1 NM of the center point).
            9.13.1.2.15.5.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Tactical Arrivals and Departures. The maximum
            altitude for random shallow approaches is 1,000 AGL. Random Shallow approaches
            will only be flown to runways 32R/14L and 09. Pilots may fly teardrop and 90/270
            approaches to Rwy 09 with planned maneuvering south over the aerodrome to land on
            Rwy 27. Random shallow approaches (other than downwind/overhead to runway 32R/
            14L) must be entered from the west or northwest quadrants and planned to avoid over
            flight of noise sensitive areas. Random Steep approaches may be flown to any runway
            provided the base turn and final coincide with ground tracks stated previously. Spiral
            up/down is allowed provided they are coordinated/deconflicted with other aircraft and
            remains within confines of the runway.
            9.13.1.2.15.5.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Iron Cross will provide updated altimeter set-
            tings, winds, and runway condition at initial entry into the pattern and upon request.
      9.13.1.2.16. (Added-TRAVIS) MWH CAUTIONS:
         9.13.1.2.16.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Bird hazard exists, especially during the months of
         November through March.
         9.13.1.2.16.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Use caution for aircraft operating out of Moses Lake
         Municipal Airport 5 miles SE of KMWH.
         9.13.1.2.16.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Use caution for numerous aircraft (Big Bend School of
         Flying) conducting training in the vicinity of Moses Lake, YOYOS intersection and Lar-
         son Drop Zone.
         9.13.1.2.16.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Use caution for "Jumbo" sized aircraft in the pattern.
         9.13.1.2.16.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The parking ramp in front of the military hangar at
         Grant County Airport is suitable for parking. Do not use the area west of the military han-
         gar.
      9.13.1.2.17. (Added-TRAVIS) Coulee LZ (Moses Lake, WA).
         9.13.1.2.17.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Grant County Tower must be open (or have an LZSO
         on duty) to land on the ALZ.
         9.13.1.2.17.2. (Added-TRAVIS) In all communications with Air Traffic Control (ATC)
         at Grant County, reference the intended runway as “Runway 27” or “Runway 09”.
         9.13.1.2.17.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft entering the pattern for Coulee LZ, runway 27
         or 09, will normally enter via the VFR entry point ROCCI (pronounced “ROCKY”),
         defined as the MWH 088/008. ROCCI is a VFR entry point only, and cannot be used in an
         IFR flight plan. Different tactical arrivals may be coordinated with tower during periods of
         reduced traffic activity (i.e. night, weekends).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                       155


          9.13.1.2.17.4. (Added-TRAVIS) After crossing ROCCI, proceed inbound for runway 27
          (overhead or straight-in) or enter a left downwind for runway 09.
          9.13.1.2.17.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Pattern altitude for runway 09/27 is 3,500 ft MSL.
          9.13.1.2.17.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 27 will be used to the maximum extent possi-
          ble (exception: runway 09 will be the primary runway for “extended ops”). For overhead
          patterns, expect a right break over the approach end of the runway. In the event of a
          go-around, missed approach, or takeoff, initiate an immediate right turn to avoid crossing
          the east edge of runway 32R/14L. In no case, other than in-flight emergencies, should you
          cross the east edge of runway 32R/14L without clearance from the tower.
          9.13.1.2.17.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 09 should only be utilized if winds do not
          allow for runway 27 use (exception: runway 09 will be the primary runway for “extended
          ops”). Use of runway 09 requires extensive coordination with the tower and the request for
          runway 09 should be made as far in advance as possible. Expect left-hand traffic patterns.
          Crews should remain extremely vigilant for light aircraft traffic utilizing runway 32L/14R
          and runway 36/18.
          9.13.1.2.17.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Runway 9/27 at Moses Lake is defined in FLIP and the
          WWNDB as 4500’ in length. That value is based on the straight-line distance from corner
          to corner as depicted on the FLIP airfield diagram. The Assault Zone Survey defines run-
          way length as 3500’, which is based on the location of the ALZ marker panels and some
          structural improvements to the runway. Crews will use the runway length published in the
          ALZ Survey.
          9.13.1.2.17.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews are not authorized to utilize the depicted 300’
          overrun at the approach end of RWY 27 for any takeoff or landing calculations on RWY 9
          or RWY 27. However, the 320’ overrun at the departure end of RWY 27 may be added to
          Runway Available for landing operations on RWY 27 and takeoff operations on RWY 9
          and 27. If the runway is wet, crews may select Max Reverse to improve landing perfor-
          mance, but runway penalties published in T.O. 1C-17A-1-CL-1 must be applied when
          applicable. Example: Landing RWY 27, RCR 12. Published distance is 3500’ + 320’
          overrun = 3820’. Subtract 400’ penalty when Max Reverse selected for a Mission Com-
          puter Runway Available value of 3420’. Crews should normally use the ALZ Survey pub-
          lished runway length of 3500’, and only use the overrun distance when required for TOLD
          calculations.
          9.13.1.2.17.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Coulee LZ Heavy Weight Training.
             9.13.1.2.17.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) 60 OG and 349 OG aircrews may conduct heavy
             weight training at Grant County. Standard ramp fuel weight for these training lines will
             be 165K, and cargo/pallets will be put on the aircraft by aerial port to increase the
             weight of the aircraft to allow assault landings on RWY 27/09 at 445,000 lbs.
             9.13.1.2.17.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The maximum landing weight for runway 09/27
             is 445,000 lbs.
             9.13.1.2.17.10.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Based on the experience level, and proficiency
             of the aircrew flying and landing heavy weight assaults, the aircrew should initially
             consider flying low approaches to runway 14L/32R, or 09/27, to evaluate the flight
156                                         AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


                characteristics of the aircraft at that weight, and the throttle response required to arrest
                the sink rate.
                9.13.1.2.17.10.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews should plan their sortie as to arrive at
                Grant County as soon as possible after initial takeoff to allow for the maximum amount
                of training at heavier weights.
                9.13.1.2.17.10.5. (Added-TRAVIS) In the event of a “Hard Landing” message, crews
                are reminded to follow the T.O. guidance for that message (Block 10 versus Block 12
                and higher). Crews should also pay particular attention to the VVI on approach to help
                determine if an excessive sink rate is developing.
                9.13.1.2.17.10.6. (Added-TRAVIS) These “Heavy Weight” training lines will be
                identified in the WOP so crews will be able to plan accordingly.
                9.13.1.2.17.10.7. (Added-TRAVIS) If the RCR for runway 09/27 is such that assault
                landings are not possible at these higher training weights, then the aircrew should plan
                to practice “spot landings” on runway 14L/32R.
      9.13.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) McChord AFB:
         9.13.1.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Hours of training: M-F 0600-2300L and Sat, Sun, and Holi-
         days 0800L-2300L. Departures and full stop landings are authorized outside of these hours,
         but transition work will not be accomplished without prior OG/CC approval.
         9.13.1.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Whenever possible, pilots should avoid VFR overflight of the
         Brown’s Point and Downtown Tacoma areas (N47 18.2 W122 26.4, N47 15.0 W122 26.9).
         Non-precision approaches to Runway 16 should be planned to avoid prolonged use of
         high-power settings at MDA. Avoid overflying Pacific Lutheran University (N47 08.7 W122
         27.0). Avoid Eatonville and Swanson Field by 3 NM and 3,000’(N46 52.3 W122 15.2).
         9.13.1.3.3. (Added-TRAVIS) During VFR conditions, do not exceed 1800’ MSL on missed
         approach until departure end of runway.
         9.13.1.3.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Use caution for civilian traffic operating at Spanaway Airport
         (TCM 128/004).
         9.13.1.3.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Circling. Circling to runway 16 from runway 34 is not autho-
         rized. Circling to runway 34 from runway 16 is only authorized to the west of the airfield for a
         left base. When circling to runway 34 from runway 16, keep aircraft ground track east of I-5
         and do not initiate circle until south of Highway 512. If the active runway is 34 and a circle is
         required for training, an approach may be made to runway 34 with a left 360 degree circling
         maneuver to land on runway 34.
         9.13.1.3.6. (Added-TRAVIS) VFR Traffic Pattern. Unless otherwise cleared by Tower, VFR
         traffic patterns are to the east of McChord, flown at 1,800 feet MSL.
         9.13.1.3.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Overhead Pattern. The overhead pattern altitude is 2,300’
         MSL with breaks to the east. When cleared for the overhead from a closed pattern, crews will
         not delay climb to 2,300’ MSL (however, comply with 1,800 MSL restriction until departure
         end of runway).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             157


        9.13.1.3.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Per FAA regulations, max airspeed below Class B (SEA) air-
        space is 200KIAS. With ATC approval, crews may fly VFR overhead pattern at 230 KIAS.
        This speed restriction does not apply to departures.
        9.13.1.3.9. (Added-TRAVIS) 180° turns on the runway may only be accomplished on the
        concrete portion located on the southern 800 feet of the runway.
        9.13.1.3.10. (Added-TRAVIS) The designated Hot Brakes areas are the hammerheads at
        each end of the runway.
        9.13.1.3.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Star turns may be performed in the hammerhead at the end of
        each runway.
        9.13.1.3.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Kapowsin Airport Jump Activities. Extensive parachute
        activities occur at Kapowsin Airport (TCM 110/013). Jump activities can be expected on any
        VFR day from the surface to 12,500’. The jump aircraft work with Seattle Approach Control
        (VHF 126.5). It is important to clear while on the arc from OOHOP (TACAN RWY 34)
        inbound or when VFR in the vicinity of Kapowsin Airport. Depending upon wind conditions,
        the jump aircraft may offset several miles from Kapowsin.
     9.13.1.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Beale AFB. Transition training is permitted on a case-by-case basis.
     The PAR is not normally available on weekends and after 2200L during the week. Do not over fly
     the Pave Paws radar site east of the field. Coordinate with Beale Command Post.
     9.13.1.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Sacramento International Airport (SMF). Available between 0700L
     and 1900L, Monday through Friday only. Only one heavy aircraft at SMF at a time. Approach
     work is limited to one hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. Do not overfly the
     tower and passenger terminal areas. Circling maneuvers for training are not authorized. Plan
     instrument approaches to 16L/34R when available. If non-precision approaches are flown, plan
     your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings. When executing
     climb out from an IFR or VFR approach (Runway 16R), start your turn immediately after crossing
     the I-5 freeway to cross the river south of the I-5 bridge. Coordinate with TRACON to fly a flight
     path west of the homes located along the river. Call Sacramento TRACON (916) 366-4045 prior
     to departing Travis to determine SMF arrival/departure workload limitations. Aircrews are limited
     to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pattern and must avoid overflying residences along the river
     to the west. Pilots are responsible for monitoring time spent in the SMF traffic pattern and for
     departing the airfield within the one-hour time constraint. ATC controllers may be willing to clear
     you for more than the allotted time. Do not construe this as approval to disregard 60/349 OG guid-
     ance.
     9.13.1.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Stockton Airport. Pre-coordination with the Stockton Airfield Man-
     ager must be accomplished. Unannounced arrivals will be directed elsewhere. Plan for only 1 to 1
     1/2 hours of transition training at Stockton. Only one C-5, C-17, or KC-10 is allowed in the Stock-
     ton radar pattern at a time. Expedite climb for noise abatement. Remain at or above 1,500 feet
     within 15 NM of Sharpe AAF (4 1/2 miles south of the airport). Do not over fly San Joaquin Gen-
     eral Hospital (1 1/2 miles northwest of the airport) or the city of Manteca (2 miles south of the air-
     port). Transition is authorized only on Runway 29R.

      9.13.1.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Lemoore NAS, CA (Contact Lemoore Approach Control).
      9.13.1.10. (Added-TRAVIS) Fallon NAS, NV (Contact Fallon Approach Control). If planning a
      tactics sortie, aircrews will review procedures for NASF prior to arriving at the airfield. The pro-
      cedures are available in the NASF Tactical Approach and Departure awareness folder (available at
      Travis Base Operations after duty hours). Aircrews shall carry this folder if planning to depart
      Travis AFB for NAS Fallon local area. Another source of information is the Fallon NAS letter of
      agreement (LOA), available at: https://w3.travis.af.mil/60oss/squadron/Mission_Planning/
      Web_Briefings_Guides/Briefings/KNFL%20LOA%20Final.htm
      9.13.1.11. (Added-TRAVIS) Palmdale (AF Plant 42, PMD). Runway 25 is approved for IMC
      and nighttime operations provided the ILS is operational and flown. Runways 4, 7 and 22 are
      restricted to Day/VMC operations.
      9.13.1.12. (Added-TRAVIS) Sacramento Mather Airport (MHR). Available between 0700L and
      1900L, Monday through Friday only. No more than one heavy aircraft at MHR at a time.
      Approach work is limited to one hour total in the radar and/or VFR pattern maximum. No more
      than two touch and go landings per aircraft due to deteriorating runway pavement. Do not overfly
      the tower. Delay configuration on instrument approaches (but maintain within safe parameters at
      all times). Circling maneuvers for training are not authorized. If non-precision approaches are
      flown, plan your arrival at MDA to avoid prolonged low altitude flight at high power settings.
      When intercepting final for the ILS/visual Runway 22L approach, plan your turn to intercept final
      at or south of US 50. Avoid overflying residential areas north of US 50. Call Sacramento TRA-
      CON (916) 366-4045 prior to departing Travis to determine MHR arrival/departure workload lim-
      itations. Aircrews are limited to a MAXIMUM of one hour in the pattern and must avoid
      overflying noise sensitive areas to the north and northeast of 22L final approach course. Pilots are
      responsible for monitoring time spent in the MHR traffic pattern and for departing the airfield
      within the one-hour time constraint. ATC controllers may be willing to clear you for more than the
      one-hour time constraint. Do not construe this as approval to disregard 60/349 OG guidance.

   9.13.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Transition Training At Other Than Above Locations: 60 OG/CC (349
   OG/CC AFRC) or designated representative must approve transition training at other airfields than
   those listed in 9.13.1. (Added)
   9.13.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Unauthorized Transition Airfields. Transition training is not authorized
   within San Francisco Class B Airspace, to include the following: Metropolitan Oakland International,
   Moffett Field, and San Francisco International.
   9.13.4. (Added-TRAVIS) PEN/QEN 305/309 MISSIONS. The primary purpose of 305/309 mis-
   sions is enroute training and familiarization. PEN/QEN missions will be planned IAW the Travis AFB
   6 Month WOP. TACC may not monitor PEN/QEN missions; therefore crews must contact TCP with
   take-off/landing information.
   9.13.5. (Added-TRAVIS) The following fields are currently available for tactics training:
   Travis, Moses Lake, and Fallon NAS. Follow guidance contained in applicable 9.13.1. (Added)
   chapters regarding operations.
9.14. (Added-TRAVIS) Local Training Procedures.
   9.14.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Local Mission Cancellation/Termination. PICs must coordinate with
   squadron leadership (operations officer for active duty; not applicable for Reserves) and TCP to can-
   cel local training flights. All options must be verified and exhausted prior to cancellation; consider-
   ation should be given to such things as maintenance spares, weather, training requirements, and
   currency. Coordinate early termination through TCP. Sorties may be terminated prior to scheduled
   duration if training is complete. PICs will obtain approval from TCP if they wish to continue flying
   beyond the specified block time.
   9.14.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Monitoring Travis Command Post Radios in the Local Pattern. Crews will
   monitor TCP’s UHF frequency (349.4) in-flight. TCP also has VHF communication available on fre-
   quency 141.9 if needed. Phone patch capability is also available on this frequency. Any calls initiated
   by the crew, such as block times, MX status, checking on tanker status, etc., will be made on UHF.
   9.14.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Use of Secure Voice with Travis Command Post.
      9.14.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) HAVE QUICK (P260) and Secure Voice (P270) training is best
      accomplished on scheduled local training missions, preferable with another Travis aircraft. Unau-
      thorized UHF frequencies will not be used to conduct HAVE QUICK and/or Secure Voice train-
      ing (e.g., 300.0 or 300.025) IAW Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations. Travis
      has the frequencies 311.0 and 321.0 available for this training. Requests to use other frequencies
      will be submitted through the proper channels.
      9.14.3.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Crews on locals should load secure voice to complete currency
      requirements as well as gain competency. Attempt secure voice contact with other aircraft. If
      unable attempt contact with TCP using procedures in Table 9.4. (Added) during a non-critical
      phase of flight. This could be your departure call or your 30 minutes prior to landing call.

Table 9.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Secure Voice Check with Travis Command Post.
1. Crewmember will call TCP with the statement, “Command Post, call sign, go Green,” on
349.4.
2. Command Post, “Call sign, Command Post going Green.” At this time, switch to Secure
mode on frequency 311.0. Expect a slight delay as the Command Post controller walks to the
secure radio in back room.
3. Command Post (on Secure Radio freq 311.0), “Call sign, go ahead with your message.”
4. Pass message (Secure 311.0).
5. Command Post (Secure 311.0), “Call sign, copy your message, Terminate Green.”
6. Switch back to non-secure mode on the radio and back to 349.4.

             9.14.3.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) This will terminate the secure portion of the departure mes-
             sage. Subsequent calls between aircraft and TCP will normally be in non-secure mode.
             9.14.3.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) The intent is to get both aircrews and controllers familiar with
             radio operation in secure mode without making additional calls.
      9.14.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Traffic Advisory Procedures for Travis TACAN A and B Approaches. All
      aircrews flying the Travis TACAN A or B approaches (or otherwise operating in the vicinity of Rio
      Vista Airport) will make every effort to self-announce their aircraft position and/or intentions on the
      UNICOM frequency. Example: (called in-the-blind on 122.8 approaching lead radial to final
      approach course on TACAN-A) "Rio Vista traffic, Callsign 52, heavy C-17, two miles south of Rio
      Vista airport, 3,000 feet, descending to 1,800 feet, turning west bound to Travis AFB, for Rio Vista
      traffic." Try to use generic VFR terminology to relay your position relative to Rio Vista Airport. Any
      negative impact or distraction from performing normal crew duties by making this advisory call
      should be held to a minimum. The use of an additional crewmember may be the most appropriate
      means to accomplish this.
      9.14.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Mid-Air Collision Potential. The heavy congestion of the Travis traffic
      pattern requires extreme vigilance from every crewmember. High volume VFR traffic to and from air-
      ports in the area and along I-80 requires dedicated clearing. Sailplane flights along the Vaca Hills up
      to 6,000 feet MSL are common. Activity increases on weekends.
      9.14.6. (Added-TRAVIS) Radio Terminology.
         9.14.6.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Standard Departures. ATC will use the term “Standard Two Depar-
         ture” or “Standard Four Departure” for inter- and intra-facility coordination and as a departure
         clearance, alternate missed approach or climb-out instructions.
             9.14.6.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Standard Two Departure. Climb and maintain 2,000 feet, fly
             runway heading, departure frequency local channel six.
             9.14.6.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Standard Four Departure. Climb and maintain 4,000 feet, fly
             runway heading, departure frequency local channel six.
         9.14.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) “To Follow” and “Traffic Is” is terminology used frequently by
         Travis Approach Control/Tower to convey your position in traffic sequencing. You will always be
         turning behind the traffic, regardless of runway, unless specifically cleared otherwise (e.g., termi-
         nology such as “traffic is…turn inside that traffic”). The following clarifies the two phrases:
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               161


           9.14.6.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) “To Follow” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is mak-
           ing an approach to the same runway. Example: “Callsign 42, number two to follow a heavy
           C-5, four mile final, runway 21L. Report base behind that traffic.” This means that you are
           number two behind a C-5 to the same runway, 21L.
           9.14.6.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) “Traffic Is” - Informs a pilot to follow an aircraft that is mak-
           ing an approach to a different runway. Example: “Callsign 33, you are number one, 21L, traf-
           fic is a KC-10, five mile final 21R. Report base 21L behind that traffic.” You are the first
           airplane to 21L but will turn behind the KC-10 going to 21R.
   9.14.7. (Added-TRAVIS) Thunderstorm and Lightning at Travis AFB.
       9.14.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) In accordance with TRAVISAFBI 15-101, Weather Support, and
       AFOSH Standard 127-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities, the Travis
       Base Weather Station will issue the following thunderstorm and lighting activity weather informa-
       tion through TCP, tower and RAPCON (ATC will update ATIS accordingly):
           9.14.7.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Weather Watch for Lightning will be issued 30 minutes prior
           to thunderstorm activity within a 5 NM radius of Travis AFB.
           9.14.7.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Weather Warning for Lightning will be issued when lightning
           is observed within 5 NM of Travis AFB.
       9.14.7.2. (Added-TRAVIS) During a Weather Warning for Lightning, personnel in affected
       locations will cease all outside activities and seek shelter. Enclosed aircraft, buses and other vehi-
       cles with metal tops and bodies are considered suitable shelter during thunderstorm activity.
       Wheel wells are extremely hazardous during thunderstorms and should be avoided.
       9.14.7.3. (Added-TRAVIS) When lightning is within 5 NM, maintenance will stop all flightline
       operations and will evacuate the flightline until termination of the lightning hazard. Furthermore,
       POL will cease all fueling operations. Crew chiefs that are on the aircraft may stay onboard the
       aircraft and remain inside until termination of the lightning threat.
       9.14.7.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews that have not arrived at the aircraft will remain indoors or
       in the crew bus until the lightning threat passes. Crews will be notified of the lightning threat by
       the most expeditious means (e.g.; maintenance truck, crew chiefs, command post). If already at
       the aircraft, the crew will remain in the aircraft with all doors closed and at least one door armed
       for emergency evacuation. The crew may continue interior preflight duties (up to engine start)
       while awaiting lightning hazard passage. In the event an aircraft lands during lightning threat peri-
       ods, the tower will direct taxi operations. The crew can expect parking delays upon clearing the
       runway.
       9.14.7.5. (Added-TRAVIS) When operating at other airfields, aircrews will comply with the
       more restrictive of these procedures or local operating procedures.
9.15. (Added-TRAVIS) Logging Currency Events. Currency events accomplished on local training
missions will be logged in SARM to reflect the appropriate Zulu date. PICs will verify that their respec-
tive crewmembers’ Mission Accomplishment Report, AFTO Form 781, AFORMS Aircrew/Mission
Flight Data Document, and TAFB Form 73 are filled out correctly and cross-referenced for accuracy.

  AIRCREW OPERATIONS IN CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR,
            AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVE THREAT ENVIRONMENT

10.1. Overview. The proliferation of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and the means to deliver them present serious security threats to the global
operations of air mobility forces. This chapter describes the CBRNE threat, passive defense measures to
mitigate that threat, and guidance for ground and flight operations in a contaminated environment.

10.2. Understanding the CBRNE Threat.
   10.2.1. Chemical Weapons. Militarily significant chemical weapons include nerve, blister, choking,
   and blood agents. A key point for aircrew members to remember is that time is on your side. The
   ultra-violet (UV) rays of the sun, high temperatures, and high absorption rates of chemicals all
   decrease their lethality. Most chemical agents will either evaporate or absorb into surfaces. For decon-
   tamination, cleaning with hot soap and water and/or a 5 percent bleach solution currently appears to
   be the best and most practical method of removing chemical agents that may remain as a contact haz-
   ard on glass, and unpainted metal. Currently, the only decontaminate authorized for use on aircraft is
   soap and water. NOTE: Recent tests indicate that as a decontaminated aircraft dries, the absorbed
   chemical warfare agent (CWA) may resurface from painted surfaces causing contact and vapor haz-
   ards.
   10.2.2. Biological Weapons. Biological warfare agents (BWA) are normally divided into three areas:
   bacteria (i.e., Anthrax) that live outside the cell, reproduce, and are normally susceptible to antibiot-
   ics; toxins (i.e., Ricin), that are poisons produced by living organisms or plants; and viruses (i.e.,
   Smallpox) that normally require the host of a living cell to survive and reproduce. Viruses and toxins
   do not respond to antibiotics. It is probable that the medical community would be the first to recognize
   that an upsurge in “flu-like symptoms” is actually a bio attack. Although BWA are degraded by UV
   rays, humidity and high/low temperatures, some BWA (i.e., Anthrax spores) may have a long life,
   lasting decades under the right conditions. Current immunizations and good personal hygiene help
   prevent infection.
   10.2.3. Radiological Weapons. The radiation dispersal device (RDD), or so-called “dirty bomb,” is
   the typical radiological weapon. RDD is any device that disseminates radioactive material without
   using a nuclear detonation. Key points to remember are that shielding and distance are the best
   defenses against radiation exposure.
   10.2.4. Nuclear Weapons. The threat from a nuclear device is from the initial blast, heat, radiation,
   and residual fallout. In addition, the Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) from a nuclear detonation can dam-
   age electronic equipment. The best protection is a combination of shielding, distance from the blast,
   and limited time of exposure.
   10.2.5. High-Yield Explosives. High-yield explosives are conventional weapons or devices that are
   capable of a high order of destruction or disruption. Passive defense measures include hardening of
   facilities and establishing stand-off distances for personnel and key assets.

10.3. CBRNE Passive Defense Measures. Passive defense measures are those activities conducted to
negate, contain, and manage the effects of CBRNE attack. Passive defense measures include pre, trans,
164                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


and post-attack actions designed to mitigate the CBRNE threat through contamination avoidance, protec-
tion, and contamination control.
      10.3.1. Contamination Avoidance. Contamination avoidance is the most important passive defense
      measure. Techniques for contamination avoidance include: inflight diversion, survival launch, and
      minimizing exposure to contaminated cargo, aerospace ground equipment (AGE), and material han-
      dling equipment (MHE).
         10.3.1.1. Inflight Diversion. When advised that a destination airfield is under CBRNE attack or
         has been contaminated, the aircrew will divert to an uncontaminated airfield, if at all possible.
         Authority to land at a contaminated airfield will be specified in the controlling OPORD.
         10.3.1.2. Survival Launch. If caught on the ground during attack warning, every reasonable effort
         will be made to launch to avoid the attack. Upon proper clearances, aircrew may launch to survive
         if they have sufficient fuel and unrestricted, safe access to the runway. In practice, this option may
         only be practical for aircraft that have just landed or aircraft at or near the end of the runway. If
         launch is not possible, shut down engines and avoid running environmental control systems. Close
         aircraft doors/hatches/ramps, don Individual Protective Equipment (IPE), and seek personal pro-
         tective cover on the base. If time does not permit using base facilities, remain in the sealed aircraft
         for a minimum of one-hour after the attack and/or follow host-base guidance.
         10.3.1.3. Avoiding Cross Contamination from AGE, MHE, and Cargo. All formerly contami-
         nated equipment and cargo must be marked to facilitate contamination avoidance and the use of
         protective measures. Additionally, the air shipment of formerly contaminated cargo requires spe-
         cial precautions and must be specifically authorized by the senior transportation commander.
      10.3.2. Protection. When exposure to chemical and/or biological agents cannot be avoided, protec-
      tion provides the force with the ability to survive and operate in a CBRNE environment. Protection is
      afforded by individual protective equipment, collective protection, and hardening of facilities.
         10.3.2.1. Individual Protective Equipment. The current in-flight protective gear for aircrew mem-
         bers is the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE). The ACDE includes the newer Aircrew
         Eye-Respiratory Protection System (AERPS) above the shoulders and the CWU-66/P or
         CWU-77/P Integrated Aircrew Chemical Coverall (IACC). The Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE)
         consists of the protective mask, C2 series canister (or filter element for MCU-2A/P protective
         mask), and over garment, boots, and gloves. The ACDE and GCE provide protection against
         chemical and biological agents. They do not provide blast or radiation protection from an RDD or
         nuclear detonation. The ACDE requires care during donning using "buddy dressing" procedures
         and Aircrew Life Support (ALS) expertise during processing through the Aircrew Contamination
         Control Area (ACCA). NOTE: AECMs will utilize the MCU-2A series mask.
             10.3.2.1.1. ACDE/GCE Issue. Aircrews will be issued sized ACDE and GCE at home station.
             Aircrews will ensure their ACDE and GCE are available at all times while in a CBRNE threat
             area. Aircrew members will confirm the mobility bag contents and correct sizes.
             10.3.2.1.2. ACDE Wear During Ground Operations. Because aircraft contamination is
             unlikely to occur during flight, ground operations represent the highest threat to aircrew
             safety. Protection from enemy attacks and exposure to liquid chemical agents is paramount.
             Aircrew should limit activities to essential duties only, and separate ground duties from air
             duties.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               165


      10.3.2.2. Collective Protection. Collective protection provides a temperature-controlled, contam-
      ination-free environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of IPE such as the
      ACDE. The basic concept for most facility collective protective solutions is to employ overpres-
      sure, filtration, and controlled entry/exit. The intent is to provide rest and relief accommodations,
      as well as provide medical treatment in contamination free zone. All pressurization systems
      should be shut down and doors sealed if the crew finds itself in need of immediate protection.
      Crewmembers should avail themselves of facilities, if provided, on the airfield.
      10.3.2.3. Hardening. Permanent and expedient hardening measures are used to strengthen build-
      ings and utility systems or provide barriers to resist blast effects. To reduce the potential of vapor
      exposure in facilities without collective protection seal windows and doors, turn off HVAC sys-
      tems and use rooms above the first floor whenever possible.
   10.3.3. Contamination Control. In the post-attack environment, contamination control measures limit
   the spread of chemical, biological, and radiological contamination through disease prevention mea-
   sures, decontamination, and use of Exchange Zone (EZ) operations. Effective contamination control
   helps sustain air mobility operations by minimizing performance degradation, casualties, or loss of
   material.
      10.3.3.1. Disease Prevention. Up-to-date immunizations, standard personal hygiene practices,
      and the use of chemoprophylaxis are effective biological warfare defensive measures.
      10.3.3.2. Decontamination.
          10.3.3.2.1. Inflight Decontamination. Air washing is a useful inflight decontamination tech-
          nique for removing most of the liquid agent from aircraft metal surfaces. However, vapor haz-
          ards may remain in areas where the airflow characteristics prevent complete off-gassing (i.e.,
          wheel wells, flap wells, rivet and screw heads, joints, etc.). Flights of at least 2 to 4 hours are
          recommended, and lower altitudes are more effective than higher altitudes. Fly with the air-
          craft configured (gear, flaps, and slats extended) as long as possible to maximize the airflow in
          and around as many places as possible. Be advised that exterior contamination may seep into
          the aircraft interior creating a vapor hazard for aircrews. Use of ACDE is recommended.
          10.3.3.2.2. Limits of Decontamination. Complete decontamination of aircraft and equipment
          may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. Formerly contaminated assets will be restricted
          to DOD-controlled airfields and not released from US government control.
      10.3.3.3. Exchange Zone (EZ) Operations. The AMC Concept for Air Mobility Operations in a
      Chemical and Biological Environment (CB CONOPS) describes a method for continuing the vital
      flow of personnel into a contaminated airfield while limiting the number of air mobility aircraft
      and personnel exposed to the contaminated environment. The purpose of the EZ is to minimize the
      spread of contamination within the air mobility fleet, preserving as many aircraft as possible for
      unrestricted international flight. The EZ is an area (located at uncontaminated airfield) set aside to
      facilitate the exchange of uncontaminated (clean) cargo/passengers to a contaminated (dirty) air-
      frame, or visa versa, without cross-contamination. Additional information on the EZ is available
      through HQ AMC/A35.

10.4. Flight Operations.
   10.4.1. Mission Planning. Aircrews must be mentally prepared to face the dangers of CBRNE weap-
   ons. Flight/mission planning must be thorough. Aircraft commanders should emphasize ACDE wear,
166                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      crew coordination, CBRNE hazards and countermeasures, inflight diversion, plans for onload/offload
      in the event of a ground attack, and plans for the return leg in the event of aircraft contamination.
      Alternative scenario plans should also be considered in the event mission-oriented protective posture
      (MOPP) conditions change.
      10.4.2. Establishing the Threat Level. Aircrews should monitor command and control channels to
      ensure they receive the latest information concerning the destination's alert condition. Diversion of
      aircraft to alternate "clean" locations may be required, unless operational necessity otherwise dictates.
      The 18 AF TACC or theater C2 agency (normally through the controlling OPORD) will direct aircrew
      pre-exposure activities such as medical pre-treatment for chemical/biological exposure.
      10.4.3. Fuel Requirements. Extra fuel may be needed to compensate for altitude restrictions as the
      result of CB agent exposure. During purge periods, the aircraft will be unpressurized. Although the
      aircrew can use the aircraft oxygen systems, passengers wearing GCE cannot, thus restricting the air-
      craft cruise altitude and increasing fuel requirements accordingly.
      10.4.4. Oxygen Requirements. Operating a contaminated aircraft will increase oxygen requirements.
      Aircrew wear of ACDE will require use of the aircraft oxygen system to counter actual/suspected con-
      tamination. Using the 100 percent oxygen setting offers the greatest protection in a contaminated
      environment. Appropriate oxygen reservoir levels must be planned to meet higher consumption rates.
      Use the aircraft Dash 1 charts to calculate the required reservoir levels.
      10.4.5. Donning Equipment. Aircrew will don ACDE based on the alarm condition (See Airman’s
      Manual (AFMAN 10-100). Use the "buddy dressing" procedures, and refer to AMCVA 11-303, and
      AMCVA 11-304 to ensure proper wear. When wearing the ACDE, Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride
      auto injectors will be kept in the upper left ACDE pocket. If the integrated survival vest/body armor is
      worn, the Atropine and 2 PAM Chloride auto injectors may be kept in the lower right flight suit
      pocket. This standardized location will enable personnel to locate the medication should an individual
      be overcome by CWA poisoning. M-9 paper on the flight suit will facilitate detection of liquid chem-
      ical agents and ACCA processing. M-9 paper should be placed on the flight suit prior to entering the
      CBRNE threat area or when an alarm “yellow” or higher has been declared. When inbound to a
      CBRNE threat area, prior to descent, the aircraft commander will ensure crew and passengers don
      appropriate protective equipment IAW arrival destination's MOPP level and brief aircrew operations
      in the CBRNE threat area. As a minimum, this briefing will include: flight deck isolation, oxygen
      requirements, air conditioning system requirements, IPE requirements, ground operations, and MOPP
      levels. Aircrew members must determine if the wear of the integrated survival vest/body armor and
      LPUs will restrict dexterity and mobility to the point that it becomes a safety issue. If the aircrew
      deems the equipment to create a safety of flight concern, then the items may be pre-positioned
      (instead of worn) on the aircraft to be readily available to the aircrew.
      10.4.6. Communicating Down-line Support. Pass aircraft and cargo contamination information
      through command and control channels when inbound. This information will be used to determine if
      a diversion flight is required or decontamination teams are needed. Report the physical condition of
      any crew/passengers who are showing agent symptoms and whether they are wearing chemical
      defense ensembles.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            167


10.5. Ground Operations.
   10.5.1. Crew Rest Procedures. Operational necessity may require the aircrew to rest/fly in a contam-
   inated environment. If the mission is not being staged by another aircrew or pre-flight crews are not
   available, the aircrew may pre-flight, load, and secure the aircraft prior to entering crew rest. The
   departing aircrew will perform necessary crew preparations and pre-flight briefings. Then, they will
   report to the ACCA for processing with assistance from ALS personnel. If possible, aircrew transport
   should be provided in a covered vehicle. Aircrews should avoid pre-flighting the aircraft prior to
   departure to prevent contamination spread to them and/or the aircraft. As aircrews proceed to fly, they
   will require assistance from ground support personnel in removing their aircrew protective overcape
   and overboots prior to entering the aircraft.
   10.5.2. Onload and Offload Considerations. Extreme care must be exercised to prevent contamina-
   tion spread to the aircraft interior during ground operations, particularly to the flight deck area.
   Reduce the number of personnel entering the aircraft. Contaminated engine covers, safety pins and
   chocks will not be placed in the aircraft unless sealed in clean plastic bags and properly marked IAW
   technical order requirements. Aircrew members entering the aircraft will remove plastic overboots
   and overcape portions of the aircrew ensemble and ensure flight/mobility bags are free of contami-
   nants and placed in clean plastic bags. Prior to entering the aircraft all personnel should implement
   boot wash/decontamination procedures. Aircrew exiting aircraft into a contaminated environment will
   don plastic overboots and overcape prior to leaving the aircraft.
   10.5.3. Communications. Conducting on/offloading operations, while wearing the complete ACDE,
   complicates communications capability. Use the mini-amplifier/speaker or the aircraft public address
   system and augment with flashlight and hand signals, as required.
   10.5.4. Airlift of Retrograde Cargo. Only CRITICAL retrograde cargo will be moved from a contam-
   inated to an uncontaminated airbase. Critical requirements are pre-designated in theater war plans.
   Onload cargo will be protected prior to and while being transported to the aircraft. If contaminated,
   protective cover(s) will be removed/replaced just prior to placing the cargo on the aircraft. It is the
   user's responsibility to decontaminate cargo for air shipment. The airlift of contaminated or formerly
   contaminated cargo requires the approval of the senior transportation commander.
   10.5.5. Passenger/Patients. A path should be decontaminated between the aircraft and the ground
   transportation vehicle to reduce interior contamination when loading/unloading passengers/patients.
   Normally, externally contaminated patients and those infected with contagious biological agents will
   not be transported onboard AMC or AMC-procured aircraft. The AMC/CC is the waiver authority to
   this policy. NOTE: An altitude below 10,000 feet is recommended due to AECM use of the ground
   chemical mask.
   10.5.6. Physiological Factors. Aircraft commanders must be very sensitive to the problems resulting
   from physical exertion while wearing ACDE. The aircraft commander should consider factors such as
   ground time, temperature and remaining mission requirements when determining on/offload capabili-
   ties. Individuals involved should be closely monitored for adverse physiological effects.
   10.5.7. Work Degradation Factors. Work timetables need to be adjusted to minimize thermal stress
   caused by wearing the ACDE. Aircrews must weigh all factors when performing in-flight and ground
   duties. The following are degradation factors for wearing full GCE, and may also be used to represent
   the Task Time Multipliers for the ACDE. To estimate how much time it takes to perform a task or
   operation, (1) take the Task Time Multiplier (Table 10.1.) for the appropriate Work Rate and ambient
168                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      air temperature and (2) multiply it by the time it normally takes to perform the task. For example,
      given a heavy work rate and an air temperature of 70F, the crewmember should expect a normal one
      hour task to take 2.1 hours while wearing ACDE. A more extensive discussion of this subject is found
      in AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection and Attack Actions.

Table 10.1. Task Time Multipliers.
Work Rate           Temperature
                    20-49 F         50-84 F        85-100 F
                    -6 to 9 C       10 to 28 C     29 to 38 C
Light               1.2             1.4            1.5
Moderate            1.3             1.4            3.0
Heavy               1.7             2.1            5.0

      10.5.8. Outbound with Actual/Suspected Chemical Contamination. Once airborne with actual/sus-
      pected vapor contamination, the aircraft must be purged for 2 hours using Smoke and Fume Elimina-
      tion procedures. To ensure no liquid contamination exists, a close inspection of aircrew, passenger
      ensembles, and cargo will be conducted using M-8 and M-9 detection paper. Detection paper only
      detects certain liquid agents and will not detect vapor hazards. Above the shoulder ACDE should only
      be removed if there is absolutely no vapor hazard. Be advised that residual contamination (below the
      detectable levels of currently fielded detection equipment) may be harmful in an enclosed space. The
      aircrew must take every precaution to prevent spreading of liquid contaminants, especially on the
      flight deck area. The best course is to identify actual/suspected contamination, avoid those areas for
      the remainder of the flight, and keep the cargo compartments cool. If an aircrew member or passenger
      has been in contact with liquid contaminants, all personnel aboard the aircraft will stay in full ACDE/
      GCE until processed through their respective contamination control area (CCA). Upon arrival, the
      contaminated aircraft will be parked in an isolated area and cordoned to protect unsuspecting ground
      personnel.
      10.5.9. Documenting Aircraft Contamination. When it is suspected or known that an aerospace vehi-
      cle or piece of equipment has been contaminated with a radiological, biological or chemical contami-
      nant, a Red X and detailed description will be entered in the AFTO Form 781, and an annotation will
      be made in historical records for the lifecycle of the equipment.
      10.5.10. 10-Foot Rule. The 10-foot rule was developed in order to provide guidance for protecting
      personnel using or handling contaminated resources (such as pallets) or working in locations with
      materials that might retain a residual chemical. The 10-foot rule embodies a safety factor that goes
      beyond current OSD guidance (which allows removal of IPE whenever detectors no longer detect a
      chemical agent vapor hazard). There are two phases associated with the 10-foot rule.
         10.5.10.1. Initial Phase. During the initial phase, personnel will remain in MOPP 4 whenever they
         stay within 10 feet of the contaminated equipment for more than a few seconds. This MOPP level
         provides personnel the maximum protection from the chemical agent as it transitions from a con-
         tact and vapor hazard to a vapor hazard only.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                 169


        10.5.10.2. Follow-on Phase. In the follow-on phase, personnel will use gloves (i.e. leather, rub-
        ber, cloth, etc.) when operating on or handling the contaminated equipment. Although a contact
        hazard is unlikely, relatively small amounts of the agent may still be present. The use of gloves
        will ensure that unnecessary bare skin contact with agent residue is avoided.
        10.5.10.3. Table 10.2. shows estimated times associated with initial and follow-on phases of the
        10-foot rule. To simplify response processes, commanders may choose to use the worst case sce-
        nario as the foundation for all 10-foot rule actions, i.e., 24 hours for the initial phase and all peri-
        ods of time greater than 24 hours for the follow-on phase.

Table 10.2. Ten-Foot Rule Time Standards (Source: AFMAN 10-2602).

                                                 Chapter 11

                                    NAVIGATIONAL PROCEDURES

11.1. Flight Planning:
      11.1.1. Normally, mission planning is accomplished and verified while still in a flight planning facil-
      ity/base operations and then electronically transferred to the aircraft mission computer. Use the latest
      weather, description of the load, landing zone/drop zone, and waypoint description information for
      this planning.
      11.1.2. Prior to filing a flight plan, verify computer products and overprinted flight planning forms
      with current charts and FLIP, as well as NOTAMs, organized track messages, etc. If a computer flight
      plan is not available, complete flight planning and print an AFMSS flight plan or other approved form
      for in-flight use as a navigation and fuel management log.
      11.1.3. Sources for obtaining IRU PPOS coordinates will be in the following priority:
         11.1.3.1. GPS PPOS IAW flight manual.
         11.1.3.2. FLIP/Jeppesen Airfield diagrams or MAJCOM approved parking spot handouts.
         11.1.3.3. DoD FLIP En Route Supplement.
         11.1.3.4. Best available chart.

11.2. Flight Plan/Data Verification.
      11.2.1. Computer Flight Plan (CFP) Use. CFPs are the official sources of performance, navigation,
      and climatic data, including en route wind information. If stand-alone computer based plans are used,
      each mission segment should utilize best wind data available. Use only MAJCOM validated CFPs.
         11.2.1.1. Use CFPs to the maximum extent practical. Flight crews may manually compute flight
         plans. The PIC has final responsibility for flight plan accuracy and diplomatic clearance compli-
         ance.
         11.2.1.2. Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure. Pass
         any flight plan discrepancies to the C2 flight planning office. On flight-managed sorties, promptly
         notify the flight manager of any flight plan discrepancies, to ensure the correct route of flight is
         filed with air traffic control. Identify inaccurate CFP winds to TACC/XOCZF if the average wind
         for a route segment exceeds either 30° error in direction or 25 knots in speed.

11.3. En Route:
      11.3.1. Use all available FLIP en route charts, and prior to departures and arrivals, terrain charts, to
      ensure navigational accuracy and terrain clearance. Periodically crosscheck navigation solution (i.e.,
      MC FOM, GPS ERR).
      11.3.2. After loading the flight plan, both pilots will use the ND CHART format in conjunction with
      the DEFINE/REVIEW WAYPOINT pages to insure the proper coordinates were loaded for all points
      in the flight plan, especially the destination.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               171


   11.3.3. If a revised clearance is received, revise the flight plan in the mission computer and review the
   new course.
   11.3.4. Low-level Navigation. When the flight plan and navigation databases are properly loaded into
   the mission computer, the aircraft map Navigation Display (ND) and the MCD flight plan become the
   primary sources of navigation information for tactical low-level missions.

11.4. Low-Level Navigation. Threat and emission control requirements permitting, use all available aids
(e.g. mission computer data, navigational aid fixes, map reading) to remain position oriented.
   11.4.1. While aircraft systems provide a self-contained adverse weather, day/night, worldwide navi-
   gation capability, pilots assume ultimate responsibility for en route navigation, terrain avoidance, and
   time control. During low level operations, attention should be focused outside the aircraft, emphasiz-
   ing threat detection and situational awareness. Limit duties that distract attention from outside the air-
   craft to mission essential items only.
   11.4.2. A navigation display (ND) map format should be displayed on at least one MFD at all times.
   11.4.3. Time of Arrival (TOA) control is primarily accomplished by airspeed adjustments. If neces-
   sary and appropriate to the situation, use planned alternate legs to gain or lose time, use timing trian-
   gles, fly inside or outside course line (within mission computer route parameters), or use time control
   holding patterns.
   11.4.4. Means of Navigation.
       11.4.4.1. The mission computer navigation solution, backed-up with map reading, is the primary
       means of navigation on VFR low level routes. If conditions permit, ground-based navigational
       aids can be used as additional information sources.
       11.4.4.2. The mission computer is the primary means of route navigation in IMC. If conditions
       permit, onboard radar, ground-based radar, and/or bearing/distance fixes should be used as back-
       ups.
   11.4.5. Flight at low altitude can be an effective defensive tactic; however, never fly lower than the
   altitude dictated by the threat or mission. Navigation and objective area identification become increas-
   ingly difficult when threat avoidance requires low ingress/egress altitudes, operations at night, or
   operations during marginal weather conditions.
   11.4.6. Low level modified contour flight is flown with momentary deviations above and below the
   base altitude for smoothness of flight. The radar altimeter used by the pilot flying will be operational
   and the radar altimeter altitude reference marker will be set to 50 feet below base contour altitude.
   11.4.7. During IMC or night operations, maintain en route altitude by using the best available baro-
   metric altimeter setting and radar altimeter information. If reported barometric settings are unavail-
   able, use GPS barometric settings (found on the MC APPROACH PAGE). When the next leg (or
   segment) altitude is higher than the leg (or segment) being flown, cross the waypoint at the highest
   altitude. If the next leg (or segment) altitude is lower than the leg (or segment) being flown, descend
   when past the waypoint.
172                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


11.5. Post Flight.
      11.5.1. For legs in which suspected navigational error, procedural deviation, or other abnormality
      have occurred, download and retain a copy of the M-PLAN and mission HISTORY diskette and all
      pertinent forms including, but not limited to DD Form 175, DD Form 175-1, DD Form 1801, CFP,
      charts, and navigation log. Units will maintain all operational mission data on file (hard disk, diskette
      file, paper copy, oceanic plotting chart, etc.) for 120 days.
      11.5.2. For suspected malfunctions or off-DZ drops, record AIRDROP RECALL information before
      leaving the aircraft.

11.6. Mission Computer Directed Approaches.
      11.6.1. The C-17 mission computer directed approach, using the MC APPROACH page of the mis-
      sion computer, does not ensure obstacle clearance. It only mathematically derives a final approach
      course and glide path from pilot input data.
      11.6.2. AFJMAN 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)
      establishes the following planning and flight procedures.

NOTES:
Using these procedures does not imply these procedures will comply with all TERPS criteria. Approaches
into rapidly sloping terrain, or where planning documents have significant errors will still pose potential
flight hazards. Thorough planning and precision flying is a must.
Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 7 for techniques on programming Mission Computer approaches.

11.7. Restrictions on Mission Computer Directed Approaches.
NOTE: C-17 Mission computer approach procedures are intended to be used only in contingency situa-
tions when no other published approach procedure is available. Specific authorization from MAJCOM/
A3/DO (HQ AMC/A3) is required before performing these procedures in IMC. All crews are authorized
to use these procedures for training in VFR conditions IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 3.
      11.7.1. C-17 crews are not authorized to fly RNAV approaches.
      11.7.2. If a published non-precision (VOR, NDB, TACAN, etc.) approach exists, the crew may pro-
      gram the MC to mirror the published approach. You may use MC guidance to back-up the ground
      NAVAIDs. In the event the ground navigation aids become unreliable, the crew is not authorized to
      continue the approach procedure using MC guidance.
      11.7.3. In a contingency, the crew will be provided an approved (TERPS’ed) mission computer
      approach procedure. All data required to program the approach in the mission computer will be
      included on the approach procedure. This will include any high-precision waypoints, weather mini-
      mums, and missed approach instructions required to safely execute the approach. Use the following
      procedures when authorized to execute a MC approach.
         11.7.3.1. Mission computer FOM of 3 or better is required to fly the approach.
         11.7.3.2. The PNF will confirm that the MC FOM is 3 or better prior to departing the IAF, and
         again prior to sequencing the FAF.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             173


      11.7.3.3. The PNF will monitor the approach on the MFD map display from the IAF until VMC
      with the runway in sight with the rings set at 1 nm. If the aircraft symbol deviates from the
      magenta line by more than 1/2 nm, as displayed on the MFD map display, the PF will execute the
      missed approach, unless the runway is in sight.
      11.7.3.4. It is highly recommended that the approach be flown with the autopilot coupled until
      VMC.
      11.7.3.5. If “DEGRADED NAV ACC” or “INSUFF NAV ACC” is displayed on the WAP during
      the approach, execute the missed approach, unless the runway is in sight.
      11.7.3.6. Weather minima will be no lower than 600-2.
      11.7.3.7. All of the waypoints required to fly the approach and missed approach must exist in the
      current navigation database. If the waypoints are not in the permanent navigation database, then
      unit tactics will provide a disc with the required waypoints to be loaded into the custom navigation
      database. Aircrew will not manually enter or alter the latitude and longitude coordinates for any
      portion of the approach, or missed approach.
      11.7.3.8. Enter all of the waypoints for the approach up to and including the FAF in the primary
      flight plan.
      11.7.3.9. Enter all of the waypoints for the missed approach, starting with the missed approach
      point (MAP), in the secondary flight plan. Special attention should be paid to whether each way-
      point is an “over fly” or “under fly”. The MAP is usually an “over fly” waypoint.
      11.7.3.10. Both pilots will review the entire procedure in the mission computer, verifying both the
      coordinates and the MFD map display for accuracy, prior to commencing the approach/departure.
      If any portion does not agree with the published procedure, the approach/departure will not be
      flown.
   11.7.4. If no published approach exists, develop training approaches IAW paragraphs 11.8. and 11.9.

11.8. Mission Computer Approach Planning Guidance.
   11.8.1. Straight-in approaches:
      11.8.1.1. Ensure the runway is properly defined in either the permanent or custom airfield data-
      base.
      11.8.1.2. Minima (DH/MDA) will be 500 feet above the highest man-made obstacle or terrain
      feature/spot elevation, or 400 feet plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain con-
      tour whichever is highest, within three nautical miles from the FAF to the MAP.
      11.8.1.3. Determine the final approach course (note any difference from runway azimuth).
      11.8.1.4. Draw a corridor 3 NM each side of the final approach course.
      11.8.1.5. Plot an IAF, 15 NM from the touchdown zone, along the final approach course.
      11.8.1.6. Plot a FAF, 5 NM from the touchdown zone, along the final approach course.
      11.8.1.7. Plot the MAP.
      11.8.1.8. Determine the controlling obstacle from the FAF to the MAP.

         11.8.1.9. Determine the preliminary DH.
         11.8.1.10. Using Chapter 16 and AFTTP 3-3.35A criteria, determine the ingress altitude from
         the IAF to FAF. Use this, or the highest traffic pattern altitude the weather or threat will allow as
         the GS INTCP ALT.
         11.8.1.11. At the aircraft, crosscheck predicted MC APPR PATH with the GS INTCP ALT and
         ensure that the FAF distance is 5 NM or less from the touchdown zone. If not, use the MC FAF
         distance and determine if a new DH is required.
         11.8.1.12. Use the predicted times and MC slowdown points for time control. See AFTTP
         3-3.35A, table 7.2 for slowdown planning.
         11.8.1.13. Plan the missed approach.
      11.8.2. Circling approaches:
         11.8.2.1. Determine the final approach course (note any difference from runway azimuth).
             11.8.2.1.1. Determine the geographic center of the airport. Plan the circling maneuver based
             on airfield restrictions, a threat, etc. Determine a level off point no earlier than 2.5 NM from
             the center of the airport, along the final course inbound. Plan to be at circling minima at this
             point. Use the airport coordinates as the MAP.
             11.8.2.1.2. Minima (MDA) will be 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 5 NM of the
             geographic center of the airport, or 600 feet above the airport elevation, whichever is higher.
         11.8.2.2. Draw a 5 NM (radius) circle around the geographic center of the airport.
         11.8.2.3. Plot an IAF, 15 NM from the airport, along the final approach course.
         11.8.2.4. Plot a FAF, 5 NM from the airport, along the final approach course.
         11.8.2.5. The airport is the MAP.
         11.8.2.6. Determine the controlling obstacle within the 5NM circle.
         11.8.2.7. Determine the MDA.
         11.8.2.8. Using Chapter 16 and AFTTP 3-3.35A, determine the ingress altitude from the IAF to
         FAF. Use this, or the highest traffic pattern altitude the weather or threat will allow as the GS
         INTCP ALT.
         11.8.2.9. Plot a level off point 2.5 NM from the airport, along the final approach course. Using
         500 feet/NM (no wind) from the level off point to the GS INTCP ALT, confirm the FAF distance
         is 5 NM or less from the touchdown zone. If not, compute a new FAF distance (new radius) and
         determine if a new MDA is required.
         11.8.2.10. Plan the circling maneuver.
         11.8.2.11. Use the predicted times and MC slowdown points for time control. For manual
         slow-downs from 300 KCAS, using SBK 2, slow down approximately 10 NM from the FAF (4
         minutes ETE). For a pop-up from 300 AGL to 1500 AGL, plan 6 NM (2.5 minutes ETE). See
         AFTTP 3-3.35A, table 7.2 for slowdown planning.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                        175


11.9. Planning the Missed Approach Segment of Mission Computer Approaches.
   11.9.1. Determine the missed approach point.
   11.9.2. Determine the missed approach course, and develop a waypoint to fly to 5 NM from the geo-
   graphic center of the airport.
   11.9.3. Determine the altitude required at this first waypoint using Chapter 16 and AFTTP 3-3.35A
   low level criteria, MEA or MOCA if applicable, or an ATC required altitude, whichever is higher.
   11.9.4. Using 250 feet/NM ensures this altitude can be obtained with one engine inoperative.
   11.9.5. At the aircraft, crosscheck coordinates, courses and distances to ensure accuracy.

                                                 Chapter 12

                            AIRCREW MAINTENANCE SUPPORT TASKS

12.1. General. This chapter contains aircrew procedures not contained in the flight manual, other por-
tions of this AFI, or other publications.

12.2. Responsibilities. Aircrew may assist the normal maintenance function when critical contingency
tasking dictate their use, provided this action does not impact crew duty and crew rest limits specified in
Chapter 3 of this AFI.

12.3. Authority to Clear a Red X. Pilots are not normally authorized to clear a Red X. If a situation is
encountered where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are not available to
clear it, the PIC may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home station MXG/CC or desig-
nated representative, in accordance with TO 00-20-1. Other crew members are not authorized to clear a
Red X. EXCEPTION: The PIC may clear Red Xs for engine covers, pitot covers, gear pins and SPR
drains when qualified maintenance personnel are not available, unless prohibited by the home station
MXG/CC or OG/CC.
      12.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Clearing Red X Symbols. 60 MXG authorizes the PIC to clear Red X
      symbols on their airplane at enroute stations when qualified maintenance personnel are not available.
      The enroute maintenance personnel or crew chief accomplishing the work should sign the "Corrected
      By" block and the PIC should sign off the "Inspected By" block and initial the symbol. This authority
      is limited to those items listed in the exception to AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, paragraph 12.3. Clearance
      of any other Red X entry will require approval from the 60 MXG/CC or designated alternate. Use call
      back procedures through Travis Command Post.

12.4. Refueling/Defueling.
      12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform refueling
      duties. Crewmembers will normally make a AFTO Form 781 red diagonal entry rather than draining
      the SPR sumps. Aircrews will only refuel in cases when maintenance support is not readily available
      and the mission would be delayed. Crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams at en
      route stops.
         12.4.1.1. Avoid refueling with JP-8+100 while transiting airfields with JP-8+100 capabilities.
         AMC aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100, except in emergency conditions. All
         JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a clean JP-8 capability to support transient aircraft. If
         inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs, de-fuel the aircraft prior to flight, and make an AFTO
         Form 781 entry stating “CAUTION: Aircraft refueled using JP-8+100, preventative measures
         must be taken when de-fueling.”
      12.4.2. Refer to TO 1C-17A-1 and TO 1C-17A-2-12JG-28-1. For normal refueling, two qualified
      personnel are required. If aircrew refueling is required at a base with AMC support, the PIC will sub-
      mit an AMC Form 54, describing the circumstances. Only special operations qualified aircrews are
      authorized to hot refuel/defuel.
      12.4.3. Concurrent Servicing. Concurrent ground operations (simultaneous refueling or de-fueling
      while cargo or maintenance operations are being performed) are authorized in accordance with TO
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               177


   00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. Aircrews performing Dash-1
   preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must have cooperation and close
   coordination with the Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS). Crewmembers may act as CSS. The
   CSS will remain in continuous intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the entire
   servicing operation.
       12.4.3.1. Movement into or within the safe area must be under control of the CSS. Individuals
       must properly ground themselves before boarding the aircraft or handling fuel servicing equip-
       ment. Concurrent servicing, loading, and maintenance must be conducted according to TO
       00-25-172 and current checklists, which will be reviewed before concurrent operations. Current
       checklist procedures take precedence over TO 00-25-172 procedures.
       12.4.3.2. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       12.4.3.3. Winching of rolling stock and non-spark producing (i.e. wooden) pallets is authorized.
       Driving vehicles equipped with spark arresters is authorized during fuel servicing. When loading
       vehicles without spark arresters, the vehicles must be either completely inside the cargo compart-
       ment, or outside of the established fuel servicing safety zone, before fuel servicing lines can be
       pressurized.
       EXCEPTION: Diesel and turbo-charged (without waste gates) gasoline-powered vehicles can be
       on-loaded or off-loaded without having to stop fuel flow.
       EXCEPTION: Passengers are prohibited in the cargo compartment during winching.
   12.4.4. The following guidance will be used for fuel servicing (refuel) operations only:
       12.4.4.1. Passengers are not allowed on board unless expressly directed by MAJCOM/A3/DO,
       DIRMOBFOR, or in combat. (EXCEPTION: For AE see Chapter 20) One crewmember is
       required to monitor the passenger compartment when passengers are on board.
       12.4.4.2. Electric and electronic equipment may be left on provided it does not radiate energy; but
       it must not be turned on or off during refueling.
           12.4.4.2.1. TACAN, Radar Altimeters, and HF radios must be turned off.
           12.4.4.2.2. Radar may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned-off.
           12.4.4.2.3. IFF SIF may be in standby but, if time permits, should be turned-off.

12.5. Maintenance Monitor Panel.
   12.5.1. Aircrews will not erase any fault unless specifically directed by maintenance.
   12.5.2. COMP FANS will be selected to operate the OBIGGS compressor fans when any crewmem-
   ber needs to go beneath the cargo floor. The upper ON legend is illuminated when the switch is
   depressed, the lower FANS legend will illuminate when both fans are open. When selected closed, the
   OPEN light will extinguish when both fans are off, then the ON light will go out.

12.6. Aircraft Recovery Away from Main Operating Base (MOB). When an aircraft will land at a
base other than the MOB, a crew chief should accompany the aircraft. The PIC is responsible for ensuring
the aircraft is turned to meet subsequent mission taskings. If qualified maintenance specialists are unavail-
able, the aircrew is responsible for turning the aircraft to meet subsequent mission taskings.
178                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      12.6.1. Recovery items the aircrew may be responsible for include, but are not limited to, the follow-
      ing:
         12.6.1.1. Parking and receiving.
         12.6.1.2. Aircraft servicing.
         12.6.1.3. Supervision of minor maintenance within local capability.
         12.6.1.4. Minor configuration changes to meet mission tasking.
         12.6.1.5. Securing the aircraft before entering crew rest.
         12.6.1.6. Coordinating aircraft security requirements.
         12.6.1.7. AFTO 781-series forms maintenance.
      12.6.2. In all cases where aircrews must service the without qualified maintenance specialist assis-
      tance, comply with procedures in this chapter.
      12.6.3. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In those instances
      where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash symbol in the AFTO
      Form 781A, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document, updating current status
      and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that reflects that the applicable maintenance inspection
      (i.e. pre-flight, thru-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue.

12.7. Aircraft Servicing Requirements. When adequate maintenance support is not available, the air-
crew may need to perform certain maintenance tasks. Use the job guides (JG) in Table 12.1. If aircrew
servicing is required at a base with AMC support, the PIC will submit an AMC Form 54 describing the
circumstances.
NOTE: Aircrews should consult a qualified maintenance facility when questions/concerns arise as to
performing any maintenance task.

   12.7.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews will not attempt to refuel without direct step-by-step reference
   to TO 1C-17A-2-12JG-28-1, Servicing Fuel Job Guide, located in the aircraft TO box. Aircrews will
   be familiar with information contained in TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
   Grounding/Bonding. Items of particular note contained in this technical order include: Fire protection
   equipment requirements (Table 3.1.), fuel servicing supervisor duties (paragraph 3.5.), APU restric-
   tions (paragraph 4.5.), and chief servicing supervisor duties (paragraph 5.3.).

12.8. Ground Inspections. Aircrews are not qualified to accomplish the required ground inspections. In
those instances where maintenance personnel are not available, the aircrew will enter a red dash symbol
in the AFTO Form 781A, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance Document, updating cur-
rent status and enter a red dash symbol and a discrepancy that reflects that the applicable maintenance
inspection (i.e. pre-flight, thru-flight, basic post-flight) is overdue. Reference TO 00-20-1/AMC1.
12.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Ram Air Turbine (RAT) Check Procedures.
   12.9.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrew are authorized to perform the RAT extension check in accor-
   dance with the Approach checklist portion of the Pilot-Copilot Check Flight Procedures in TO
   1C-17A-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual. A copy of this TO is
   available from DOV or OGV. The following additional restrictions apply:
   12.9.2. (Added-TRAVIS) A RAT flight check requires a current and qualified instructor pilot on the
   aircraft.
180                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      12.9.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Do not flight check the RAT when landing crosswinds exceed 15 knots or
      landing gross weight exceeds 400,000 pounds. The RAT will be extended just prior to the last landing
      of the sortie—Do not conduct touch-and-go landings after extending the RAT.
12.10. (Added-TRAVIS) AFTO Form 781 Procedures.
      12.10.1. (Added-TRAVIS) If ground time during a full stop/taxi back exceeds 0.1 hour (six min-
      utes), a landing time will be entered on the AFTO Form 781 and a new line started for a subsequent
      takeoff.
      12.10.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission Numbers and Symbols.
         12.10.2.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Mission symbol information changes frequently. If launched from
         alert status, recut while off station, and/or not given a mission symbol, use the 60/349 OG C-17
         Loadmaster’s Supplemental Airland Information guide. You must have a valid 12-digit mission
         number to determine your three-digit mission symbol. Query command and control for this
         12-digit mission number when recut. If you are unable to compute a mission symbol, call 60 OSS/
         OSO for further guidance.
         12.10.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Be aware the mission number and mission symbol on the flight
         authorization is normally for the first leg only. A common mistake is to use the same mission
         information for positioning, execution and depositioning legs. PICs will ensure the AFTO Form
         781 is filled out correctly and completely. Expanded guidance is located in the Loadmaster Guide.

                                                Chapter 13

                     CARGO AND PASSENGER HANDLING PROCEDURES

13.1. General. The loadmaster coordinates loading or offloading with air terminal operations or shipping
agencies; plans loads; and supervises loading or offloading operations. Performs preflight and post flight
of aircraft and systems, and computes aircraft weight and balance. Provides for safety and comfort of pas-
sengers and troops, and security of cargo, mail, and baggage during flight. If airdrop qualified, prepares
and rigs equipment for airdrop, and participates in the aerial delivery of equipment, supplies, and person-
nel.
   13.1.1. Multiple Loadmaster CRM. Although the C-17 was designed to a one loadmaster require-
   ment, situations will arise when more than one will be on board the aircraft. To ensure good CRM, the
   primary loadmaster will assume overall responsibility for completion of all checklists and ensure no
   confusion exists about what duties have been accomplished.

13.2. Responsibilities of Aircraft Loading.
   13.2.1. AMC Designated Stations.
       13.2.1.1. Air freight personnel are responsible for selecting cargo and mail for airlift, promptly
       completing documentation, palletizing cargo, load planning, computing load distribution, and
       moving cargo to and from the aircraft to meet scheduled departure. They will advise the loadmas-
       ter of destination, size, weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) before starting load-
       ing operations to permit proper positioning. They will also coordinate traffic activities affecting
       loading and offloading and assign sufficient air freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air
       freight personnel are responsible for safe positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to
       or from the aircraft cargo door, ramp, or ramp toes. Under supervision of the loadmaster, air
       freight personnel prepare the aircraft for loading, stow loading/tiedown equipment if the aircraft is
       not to be reloaded, physically load the aircraft and tiedown cargo and equipment, and release
       tie-down and physically offload cargo.
       13.2.1.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight, load planning; preparation of DD
       Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical; certifying load
       plans; operating aircraft equipment; supervising and directing loading and offloading operations;
       and cargo tiedown. He or she coordinates with the loading crew supervisor to verify cargo against
       manifests. The loadmaster supervises loading operations and is responsible for safe movement of
       cargo into and out of the aircraft. The loadmaster will notify the PIC, command post, or terminal
       operations officer if loading personnel are injured or cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft struc-
       ture is damaged during loading or offloading. The loadmaster will brief the PIC on any hazardous
       cargo and cargo jettisonability prior to engine start.
       13.2.1.3. Loads planned by qualified load planners will be accepted by the aircraft loadmaster and
       loaded aboard the aircraft as planned, unless the load or any portion of it will compromise flight
       safety or does not comply with applicable aircraft technical orders or USAF and MAJCOM publi-
       cations. If cargo is refused or rearranged for these reasons, forward all applicable information,
       including a copy of the load plan, to MAJCOM standardization and evaluation through standard-
       ization channels. AMC personnel attach an AMC Form 54.
182                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


         EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster may deviate from load plans to facilitate ease of onload or
         offload of cargo, accommodate additional passengers, and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft recon-
         figuration without submitting documentation. The aircraft loadmaster must take into consideration
         the next station’s cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in proper weight
         and balance limits.
         13.2.1.4. The loadmaster is the on-scene expert for load planning and accepting cargo for airlift.
         Some loads are not specifically detailed in applicable directives and require the loadmaster to use
         his or her best judgment, based on training, experience, and knowledge, to determine the best and
         safest method of loading the cargo. When difficulties arise, they should seek advice of other per-
         sonnel (i.e., available loadmasters and squadron, group, wing, NAF, or MAJCOM standardization
         personnel).
             13.2.1.4.1. Non-standard cargo/equipment not contained in the aircraft loading manual (TO
             1C-17A-9) requires certification for air shipment. The shipper will provide a copy of the certi-
             fication to the loadmaster prior to loading. If the certification letter with loading instructions/
             requirements is not provided to the loadmaster, the cargo will not be loaded. Contact Air
             Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA) or ASC/ENFC at Wright Patterson AFB,
             OH, voicemail (937) 255-2330/2547 or HQ AMC/A37V for questions concerning cargo certi-
             fication.
         13.2.1.5. IAW with ATTLA memo, dated 7 May 2002, certification memos prior to 1993 are val-
         idated to include blanket airlift approval for C-17 airlift. This approval applies to cargo previously
         certified on C-130/C-141 aircraft and for those applications previously certified on C-5 aircraft
         that do not violate the limitations in TO 1C-17A-9 loading manual. The aircraft loadmaster is the
         final authority in determining the validity of certifications on C-17 aircraft. If the loadmaster
         determines the cargo is incompatible with aircraft dimensions/ limitations or additional steps/spe-
         cial procedures are required to enable a safe onload, a Cargo On/Off Loading Validation Work-
         sheet following the procedures in paragraph 13.12. will be required. State the reason for rejection
         or comments and recommendations that aided in a safe on/offload. Forward worksheet to HQ
         AMC/A37V.
      13.2.2. At locations without AMC air terminal or traffic personnel, the shipper assumes responsibili-
      ties as described in paragraph 13.2.1.1. and provides sufficient qualified personnel and material han-
      dling equipment for loading or offloading. Loadmaster’s responsibilities and authority are the same as
      described in paragraph 13.2.1.2. and 13.2.1.3..
      13.2.3. During joint airborne air transportability training (JA/ATT), special assignment airlift mission
      (SAAM), USAF mobility, and contingency missions, the loadmaster can accept DD Form 2133, Joint
      Airlift Inspection Record, as a valid pre-inspection of equipment being offered for air shipment.
      This form, validated by two joint inspection signatures (user and transporting force), may be used in
      lieu of the applicable portions of the TO 1C-17ACL-2. The DD Form 2133 will not be used to docu-
      ment preparation of hazardous materials. This will be accomplished using the Shipper's Declaration
      for Dangerous Goods.

13.3. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. No part of the cargo load will extend over the edge of the
walkway. Equipment such as spare tires, mirrors, etc., protruding from rolling stock may extend over the
walkway. Netted palletized cargo will not extend beyond the vertical stacking line of the pallet unless spe-
cifically authorized in the loading manual or load certification letter or when authorized for oversized
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                183


cargo pallets used as a mobility platform. Dunnage may be required to raise the oversized cargo above the
pallet to provide restraint rail clearance.
NOTE: All passenger hand-carried items must be of a size to fit under the seat and must not obstruct the
safety aisle. Any items that do not fit under a seat or obstruct an aisle way will be stowed with checked
baggage and secured for flight.
   13.3.1. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo or is secured with straps, a 30-inch space
   will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward litter, occupied seat or nuclear cargo.
   When the cargo, either palletized or non-palletized, is secured with chains, the 30-inch spacing is not
   required.
   EXCEPTION: Maintain 30 inch spacing on Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) missions, when carrying
   litters patients.

13.4. Pre-mission Duties.
   13.4.1. Cargo Missions.
       13.4.1.1. Aircraft loadmasters in coordination with aerial port personnel establish loading times.
       Loading times that differ from the normal pre-departure sequence will be established, with PIC
       coordination, before the loadmaster enters crew rest. Loading time is governed by the type of load
       and complexity of loading procedures (bulk, palletized, etc.) not by port saturation or management
       of aerial port workload levels. When reporting for duty, the loadmaster checks in with the air ter-
       minal operation center (ATOC) or other designated location to obtain load breakdown and assist
       in load planning as required.
           13.4.1.1.1. Duty Loadmaster Operations. Duty loadmasters are used as a means of flow con-
           trol at stations with limited aerial port personnel and/or when units are deployed as part of an
           Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS) or tactical/contingency operation. Duty loadmasters do
           not relieve the primary aircrew loadmaster of their duties. Duty loadmasters ensure items
           loaded on aircraft do not exceed aircraft limitations, and time permitting flight restraint will be
           applied to all cargo. Duty loadmasters will accomplish an Interior Safety Inspection, Basic
           Aircraft Pre-flight and all appropriate loading preparation checklists prior to conducting load-
           ing operations. After completion of aircraft loading, duty loadmasters will accomplish the
           BEFORE LEAVING AIRCRAFT Checklist unless maintenance personnel remain at the air-
           craft to monitor operating aircraft systems. Primary aircrew loadmaster(s) will complete all
           pre-departure checklists to include the AFTER LOADING GENERAL Checklist.
           13.4.1.1.2. Phase II Loading Operations. Phase II is an aerial port loading program directly
           managed and supervised by air transportation personnel. It provides port units the flexibility to
           determine the best time to load or off-load aircraft when aircrew support is not available. The
           intent of the program is to allow aerial port management the ability to evenly distribute port
           workloads. It will not serve as an aircrew enhancement or alleviate the loadmaster’s responsi-
           bility to on/off load aircraft. Phase II on/off load operations are not authorized for:
              13.4.1.1.2.1. In transit aircraft with ground times less than 3+15 minutes
              13.4.1.1.2.2. Loads requiring use of the aircraft winch
              13.4.1.1.2.3. Wheeled equipment/rolling stock that exceeds 30,000 pounds
184                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


                 13.4.1.1.2.4. Aerial Delivery missions
                 13.4.1.1.2.5. Specific loads contained in TO 1C-17A-9, Sec VI, unless identified by an
                 asterisk (*) (section VI F only)
         13.4.1.2. Proper cargo documentation must accompany each load. A consolidated statement
         (manifest) will be delivered to the aircraft prior to departure unless one is not available due to a
         lack or failure of the manifest processing equipment. In this case, a cargo listing or floppy disks
         containing manifest information must accompany the load.
         13.4.1.3. Make every effort to exchange tiedown equipment on a one-for-one basis. If this is not
         possible, annotate the AF IMT 4069, Tiedown Equipment Checklist. At non-AMC stations,
         463L pallets will normally be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.
      13.4.2. Passenger Missions. Maximize seat availability on all missions. It may be necessary for crews
      to perform passenger service functions at stations that do not have this capability. These functions
      include manifesting, anti-hijacking processing, and ensuring visa/passport requirements are met. Do
      not hesitate to contact TACC/XOGX, Aerial Port Control Center; DSN 779-0350/0355, commercial
      618-229-0350/0355, if any questions arise such as to who may travel to specific locations or passport/
      visa requirements. Aircraft operating within other MAJCOMs which have operational command and
      control over that aircraft will contact the appropriate AMOCC for specific details. File a copy of the
      passenger manifest with the most responsible on-scene agency if there is no base operations, or other
      agency responsible for filing the manifest.
         13.4.2.1. Manifesting. Passenger service or base operations personnel manifest passengers at
         locations with an AMC passenger processing activity.
             13.4.2.1.1. The PIC and loadmaster are responsible to ensure all passengers are properly man-
             ifested. Loadmasters will brief passengers IAW TO 1C-17A-1 and should provide each pas-
             senger Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 11-300, Passenger Safety Card.
             13.4.2.1.2. At locations without an AMC passenger processing activity, aircrew will manifest
             all passengers using DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, and leave a copy of the manifest
             with the flight plan. If not filed with the flight plan, annotate the location of the manifest on the
             flight plan IAW AFI 11-202V3.
             13.4.2.1.3. When the aircrew accomplishes manifesting, anti-hijack-processing will also be
             completed by the aircrew IAW AFI 13-207 (FOUO).
         13.4.2.2. Ensure all food items are removed from the aircraft by fleet and returned to the in-flight
         kitchen if an extended delay occurs. Ensure that a copy of AF IMT 129, Tally In-Out, is received
         from fleet to relieve the loadmaster of meal accountability.
         13.4.2.3. Complimentary snacks and beverages are authorized on Transportation Working Capi-
         tal Fund (TWCF) funded missions (including ANG and AFRC flown missions) for passenger con-
         sumption only. Complimentary snacks are not authorized on JA/ATT, Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)
         exercises, or SAAM missions. The squadron or port operations officer will ensure snacks and bev-
         erages are placed on board when departing AMC stations. When departing from other stations and
         no snacks or beverages are to be placed onboard, the loadmaster may obtain required snacks and
         beverages from the local in-flight kitchen. Direct the in-flight kitchen to bill the accounting and
         finance office at the aircraft's home station. Record all unused snacks and beverages on AF IMT
         129 and return to the in-flight kitchen for turn-in credit.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             185


      13.4.2.4. Ensure the auxiliary power unit is shut down before boarding passengers unless ade-
      quate ear protection is provided. A passenger service representative or crew member will assist
      passengers at the bottom of the steps, and the loadmaster will assist in seating passengers.
          13.4.2.4.1. Passenger Operation of Emergency Exits. Prior to each flight, loadmaster(s) will
          formulate a passenger emergency egress plan. Different cargo configurations will dictate pro-
          cedures to be used. Only English-speaking, physically able adults (age 15 and older) will be
          seated next to an emergency exit. Loadmaster will brief those passengers seated next to troop
          door(s) or the forward emergency escape hatch on proper operation and to open the exit when
          directed. The intent of this briefing is to inform those passengers seated next to emergency
          exits of their duties and responsibilities in assisting the loadmaster(s)/crew during passenger/
          troop emergency egress
      13.4.2.5. When children under the age of two are accepted as passengers, their sponsor has the
      option to either hold the child or place him or her in a Department of Transportation-approved
      infant car seats (ICS). Although the use of ICS for children processed through AMC-owned or
      controlled terminals (including gateways) is no longer mandatory, all passengers (duty and space
      A), regardless of age, are required to be assigned their own seat. This policy will provide an infant
      and their sponsor with a dedicated seat allowing the use of an ICS seat at the sponsor’s discretion;
      this mirrors current FAA (commercial) standards. The FAA has banned the use of booster seats,
      harnesses, and vest child restraints.
          13.4.2.5.1. Passengers may hand-carry their ICS. If used, these seats will be secured to a seat
          using the seat belt. Adults will not hold infant seats during any phase of flight.
          13.4.2.5.2. If the mission aircraft is equipped with forward facing "airline style” seats, secure
          the seat in the same manner as in an automobile. However, if the aircraft is configured with
          side-facing seats, aircrew must ensure the ICS is adequately secured. The design of the side-
          wall seatbelt makes it difficult to remove enough slack to secure the ICS. When removing
          slack from the seatbelt ensure the buckle remains on one side or the other so that it can be eas-
          ily accessed for release. The PIC is the final authority for determining whether the ICS is ade-
          quately secured.
      13.4.2.6. Download the baggage of no-show passengers and those removed from a flight. In the
      case of SAAM or exercise missions at non-AMC locations, coordinate with tanker airlift control
      elements or deploying unit commanders to decide if downloading of baggage is necessary.

13.5. Passenger Handling.
   13.5.1. The loadmaster is key to good passenger relations. The following common sense rules should
   be observed:
      13.5.1.1. Address passengers by proper titles.
      13.5.1.2. Avoid arguments and controversial subjects, national or international politics, criticism
      of other personnel or organizations.
      13.5.1.3. Offer services or perform duties in a manner indicating a personal interest and willing-
      ness to help.
186                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      13.5.2. Comments by the loadmaster and the manner in which they are made often determine passen-
      ger attitudes about the flight. Always remember that passengers are individuals; address them collec-
      tively only when making announcements.
      13.5.3. In-flight Procedures.
         13.5.3.1. Passengers may move about the cabin after reaching cruise altitude; however, judgment
         must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at any one time. Encour-
         age passengers to remain seated with their seat belts fastened. Due to concern for their safety, pas-
         sengers are not allowed to lounge or sleep under or on cargo or baggage.
         13.5.3.2. Make frequent checks on the following:
             13.5.3.2.1. Cabin temperature.
             13.5.3.2.2. Passengers with small children.
             13.5.3.2.3. Cleanliness of the cabin and lavatories.
         13.5.3.3. Do not allow passengers to tamper with emergency equipment. Passengers will not be
         permitted access to checked baggage.
         13.5.3.4. On long flights, particularly during hours of darkness, use all possible means to make
         passengers comfortable. Dim and extinguish unnecessary compartment lights.
         13.5.3.5. Passengers may visit the flight deck only when approved by the PIC. Use good judg-
         ment when requesting this authority.
      13.5.4. Meal Service.
         13.5.4.1. Meals are served at normal hours when practical, based on the local time at point of
         departure. Avoid waking passengers to offer meals. Ask the PIC about expected flight conditions
         prior to meal preparation.
         13.5.4.2. Passengers having a boarding pass, AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket, showing a
         meal was ordered are served meals in the following sequence:
             13.5.4.2.1. Small children requiring assistance.
             13.5.4.2.2. Distinguished Visitors (DV).
             13.5.4.2.3. All other passengers.
         13.5.4.3. Use the following procedures for box lunches:
             13.5.4.3.1. After takeoff, distribute box lunches to passengers who boarded at the previous
             station. This lessens confusion when flight segments are short and passengers board at subse-
             quent stations.
             13.5.4.3.2. Ensure each passenger receives the meal ordered by verifying the passenger's
             AMC Form 148, Boarding/Pass Ticket.
         13.5.4.4. Do not serve liquids or hot food during turbulence.
         13.5.4.5. Turn in all meals unfit for consumption to the first in-flight kitchen. If in radio contact
         with the issuing station, relay aircraft tail number, mission identifier, number of spoiled meals (by
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                187


       menu), issuing organization, and in the case of frozen meals, the manufacturing agency, and man-
       ufacturer's lot number.
       13.5.4.6. When prepared meals have not been furnished to passengers, the loadmaster will anno-
       tate the individual's boarding pass to reflect reimbursement is authorized. Inform passengers they
       may receive refunds at the next station or the originating or destination terminal.

13.6. Over-Packed Meal Procedures.
   13.6.1. Sign for over-packed in-flight meals and supplements delivered to aircraft. These meals have
   been inventoried and annotated showing the total number of meals in each container. Do not open
   containers for inventory.
   13.6.2. Obtain sufficient blank copies of AMC Form 305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers
   13.6.3. At the onload station, contact the troop commander or other individual responsible for the
   mission. The unit or user is responsible for collecting for the meals before the onload and for turning
   the money over to the loadmaster with two separate listings. One listing will contain the names of
   those not on separate rations who are authorized to receive a government meal at no charge. The other
   list will contain names of those on separate rations and who pay for their meals. Both listings must be
   certified by the troop commander or individual responsible for the mission. The loadmaster will count
   the money to ensure the total is correct and issue a receipt (DD Form 1081, Statement of Agent
   Officer’s Account) to the user.
   13.6.4. At en route, remain overnight, or terminating stations, turn in the money and both listings to
   the flight kitchen. If a flight kitchen refuses to accept the money or meals, have the PIC report the inci-
   dent on AMC Form 54, Aircraft Commander's Report on Services/Facilities. (See Chapter 8 for
   instructions.) Retain the money or meals and turn them in to the next available AMC flight kitchen.
   When a crew change occurs and the money or meals are transferred to the outbound loadmaster, the
   inbound loadmaster will retain the signed receipt as proof of money or meals transfer.

13.7. En Route and Post Flight Duties.
   13.7.1. At stations where a crew change is made and loading or offloading is required, the inbound
   loadmaster is responsible for offloading the aircraft. The outbound loadmaster is responsible for plan-
   ning and loading the outbound load. When no crew change occurs, the inbound loadmaster is respon-
   sible for onloading or offloading cargo.
   13.7.2. At crew stage points, brief relief personnel about passenger and aircraft equipment, any miss-
   ing items, the location of through cargo, mail and baggage, and any information pertinent to through
   passengers. Point out cargo requiring special consideration (hazardous material, perishables, etc.).
   13.7.3. Assist passengers to deplane. If BLUE BARKS, DVs, COIN ASSIST, or couriers are aboard,
   the loadmaster will inform the protocol or traffic representative respectively.

13.8. Loaded Weapons. Weapons are considered loaded if a magazine or clip is installed in the weapon.
This applies even though the clip or magazine is empty.
   13.8.1. Personnel who will engage an enemy force immediately on arrival (actual combat) may carry
   basic combat loads on their person. Weapons will remain clear with magazines or clips removed until
   immediately prior to exiting the aircraft. The troop commander will coordinate with the loadmaster
188                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      prior to directing personnel to load any weapons. This applies to airborne assaults and airland mis-
      sions.
      13.8.2. Personnel who will not immediately engage an enemy force will store basic ammunition loads
      in a centralized location for redistribution on arrival at the objective. Magazines or clips will not be
      inserted into weapons.

13.9. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for this airplane according to TO 1-1B-50,
Weight and Balance, and AFI 11-2C-17V3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration/Mission Planning. The unit
possessing the airplane maintains the primary weight and balance handbook containing the current air-
plane status and provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each airplane. Enclose the
supplemental handbook in a wear-resistant binder (preferably metal), stenciled "Weight and Balance"
with the airplane model and complete serial number on the cover or spine.
      13.9.1. The supplemental handbook will include TO 1C-17A-5-2, AFI 11-2C-17V3 Addenda A, suf-
      ficient copies of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F – Transport/Tactical, to
      complete the mission and a certified copy of the current DD Form 365-3, Chart C-Basic Weight and
      Balance Record. Chart C will include the airplane's basic weight, basic moment, and center of grav-
      ity.
      13.9.2. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the airplane will maintain the required
      documents.
         13.9.2.1. Ensure a sufficient amount printer paper is onboard to complete the mission.
         13.9.2.2. The loadmaster will turn in the original DD Form 365-4 to be filed at the departure air-
         field and maintain a physical or electronic copy for the duration of the flight.

13.10. Cargo Validation Onloading and Offloading Procedures and Format. To assist in the cargo
validation process, a cargo validation onloading and offloading format is provided in this chapter. After
completion, send through standardization channels to HQ AMC/A37V. Use the following format when
tasked to validate a new loading procedure or when encountering any cargo you feel requires special or
specific onloading, offloading or tiedown procedures not currently listed in TO 1C-17A-9.
      13.10.1. General Loading Data:
         13.10.1.1. Nomenclature of item. Give military or civilian name, national stock number (NSN),
         and a brief description of the item, i.e., dump truck, medical van, etc.
         13.10.1.2. Dimensions (in inches). Length, width, and height. Rough drawing or picture of the
         unit, pointing out critical dimensions, projections, overhangs, etc.
         13.10.1.3. Weight (in pounds). Gross weight; individual axle weight; or data plate weight if pos-
         sible.
      13.10.2. Number of loading crew personnel and loadmasters required to onload or offload cargo and
      their position to observe clearances, if required.
      13.10.3. Equipment and Material Requirements. Special equipment and material required to onload
      and offload cargo, i.e., cargo winch, prime mover, shoring requirements.
      13.10.4. Aircraft Configuration Required.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                189


   13.10.5. Preparation of Cargo for Loading. Components that must be removed or reconfigured to
   onload and offload cargo, i.e., helicopter struts, exhaust stacks, cabs, etc
   13.10.6. Loading Procedures.
   13.10.7. Location of Tiedown Points.
   13.10.8. Offloading Procedures.
   13.10.9. Comments.

13.11. Emergency Airlift of Personnel.

13.12. Rucksacks. The following procedures apply to loading of rucksacks.
   13.12.1. In all cases, rucksacks will be loaded on the same aircraft as the individual.
   13.12.2. Transported units must ensure that adequate space is provided on the load plan and aircraft
   to ensure all personnel have an unobstructed path to evacuate the aircraft during an emergency.
   13.12.3. During administrative deployments, rucksacks may be loaded on deploying vehicles, pallet-
   ized, or floor loaded. Placing rucksacks on the aircraft floor may increase loading and offloading
   times. Also, this method may require more space and reduce the number of personnel or equipment
   airlifted.
   13.12.4. During tactical deployments into a FOB/OB, rucksacks not loaded on vehicles will be car-
   ried by the individual onto the aircraft. Normally, floor space will be allocated on the aircraft load plan
   for floor loading rucksacks.
       13.12.4.1. When a flight is planned for a short duration, the following procedures apply:
          13.12.4.1.1. The troops may wear the rucksacks in the seat provided the seats are placed in the
          paratroop configuration.
          13.12.4.1.2. All troops must have quick release straps on their rucksacks.
          13.12.4.1.3. Troops will be briefed to leave their rucksacks on the seat if an emergency evac-
          uation is necessary.
       13.12.4.2. The following procedures apply to transporting hazardous materials in rucksacks.
          13.12.4.2.1. Personnel will only be permitted to carry their basic combat load or individual
          issue of hazardous material when they will engage an enemy force immediately upon arrival.
          Personnel may retain small arms ammunition (cartridge for weapons, DOT 1.4) and nuclear,
          biological, and chemical equipment as long as it is retained in a carrier (i.e., bandoleers,
          pouches, bags). Weapons will remain clear until the aircraft has landed or as directed by the
          loadmaster.
          13.12.4.2.2. Munitions and other hazardous materials placed in rucksacks, field packs, or
          other authorized containers, removed from their shipping container, must be adequately pro-
          tected from accidental functioning. For airland troops and airdrop troops who are not rigged
          prior to takeoff, all carriers will be consolidated in one central location on the aircraft (as
          directed by the loadmaster) and distributed to personnel after landing. Paratroopers rigged
          prior to takeoff may retain individual carriers containing hazardous materials.

         13.12.4.2.3. The troop commander or load team chief will brief the loadmaster concerning the
         individual issue of hazardous materials. The loadmaster will brief the PIC.
         13.12.4.2.4. Hazardous materials identified for sustainment must be prepared and certified
         according to AFJMAN 24-204.

                                          FUEL PLANNING

14.1. General. Fuel Plan IAW this chapter and TO 1C-17A-1-2. Additional fuel planning considerations
can be found in AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 6.

14.2. Fuel Planning Profiles.
   14.2.1. AMC CFP Fuel Planning Profile. Using the AMC CFP, AMC aircraft plan to be overhead the
   destination/Begin Descent Point with fuel to proceed to the alternate, holding at the alternate, and
   descent/approach and landing fuel. Normally, the divert profile is based on Long Range Cruise (LRC)
   speed at 10,000 feet for alternates 200 NM air distance or less, FL310 or 330 for alternates beyond
   200 NM. Holding fuel is based on endurance holding at 10,000 feet for 45 minutes, or 20,000 feet for
   1+15 at the overhead alternate gross weight. If a visibility only approach is planned, additional fuel is
   added to compensate for the climb to 10,000 feet. Approach and landing fuel is planned only once.
   14.2.2. C-17 Mission Computer Profile. The C-17 mission computer plans a complete climb, cruise,
   descent and approach and landing based on the pilot inserted ROUTE DATA and PRFM factors. This
   fuel is “En route” fuel. The “Alternate” fuel is computed from destination to alternate as defined in TO
   1C-17A-1-2.
   14.2.3. The mission computer will be used to determine final fuel requirements.

14.3. Fuel Conservation.
   14.3.1. Mission planners and PICs will ensure that fuel in excess of required ramp fuel load (RRFL)
   is kept to an absolute minimum. If actual ramp fuel exceeds RRFL by more than 10%, the PIC will
   notify the controlling agency and request defueling assistance. During contingencies or exercises in
   which ferrying fuel is operationally desired, the OPORD or OPLAN may authorize excess fuel.
   14.3.2. Aircrews may conserve fuel using the following options:
       14.3.2.1. Delay engine start.
       14.3.2.2. Load to an aft CG.
       14.3.2.3. Select the most expeditious taxi route.
       14.3.2.4. Cruise at optimum altitudes at Long Range Cruise (LRC).
       14.3.2.5. Plan an en route descent profile.
       14.3.2.6. Delay configuration when possible (do not alter flight manual procedures).

14.4. General Fuel Planning Considerations.
   14.4.1. Fuel Loads. Final servicing will be delayed until accurate fuel requirements are known. Stan-
   dard ramp fuel loads may be used.
   14.4.2. Planned Landing Fuel. Plan to land at destination with 16,000 pounds, minimum. Normally,
   this does not require additional fuel added to the flight plan.
192                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      14.4.3. For formation flights, plan using the most restrictive aircraft (i.e., heaviest aircraft for altitude
      restriction, or any other applicable restriction). Select formation on the CFG/OPER page.
      14.4.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Fuel Conservation: All aircrew members shall make every effort to con-
      serve fuel. Refer to AMCPAM 11-3 as well as the Travis Fuel Conservation Guide for techniques to
      minimize fuel consumption.

14.5. Air Refueling (A/R) Fuel Planning.
      14.5.1. Computer flight plans are available which incorporate the unique mission requirements of air
      refueling missions. The CFP system contains aircraft air refueling performance characteristics, which
      enable it to prepare a fuel computation. Items and terms unique to the A/R CFP are explained below.
          14.5.1.1. Air refueling information block:
              14.5.1.1.1. Departure date/time - Required takeoff time to meet the ARCT.
              14.5.1.1.2. Departure/destination - Departure and destination ICAOs.
              14.5.1.1.3. Alternate - Primary alternate used to compute flight plan.
              14.5.1.1.4. Ramp GW - Total ramp GW (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.1.5. Ramp fuel - Required ramp fuel load (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.1.6. Payload - Total cargo/passenger weight (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.1.7. Operational weight – Pre-stored aircraft operating weight. Should be 276.5 or
              282.5.
              14.5.1.1.8. ARCT-1/KC-135 Offload - ARCT, type of tanker used, and the fuel offload.
              Tanker can be a KC-135 or KC-10.
          14.5.1.2. The column headings in lines three and four which differ from standard CFPs are listed
          below.
              14.5.1.2.1. ETA/OW - Estimated time of arrival at each checkpoint based on required takeoff
              time and over water checkpoint time.
              14.5.1.2.2. GWT - Aircraft GW at each checkpoint (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.2.3. FLREM - Fuel remaining at each checkpoint (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.2.4. ONLD - Fuel offloaded by tanker (thousands of pounds).
              14.5.1.2.5. TDR - Total distance remaining
          14.5.1.3. The body of the computer flight plan contains the ARIP, ARCP, BINGO, and exit point
          for the appropriate air refueling track. In addition to the waypoints and coordinates for the route of
          flight, the CFP contains the routing from the BINGO point to the primary air refueling alternate.
          (The MC profile assumes a BINGO point 150 NM from the ARCP). A separate fuel analysis is
          provided for each mission segment, departure to ARCP, ARCP to exit, and exit to destination.
      14.5.2. In-flight Fuel Planning. For single and multiple A/R, PICs will compute recovery fuel
      requirements, and required on-load requirements. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 6 for tech-
      niques in making these computations.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                   193


14.6. Tactical Fuel Planning.
   14.6.1. For a tactical mission, compute fuel required beginning from the final destination to deter-
   mine appropriate gross weights and stored fuels. Ensure low level time and ground operations are
   accounted for.

14.7. C-17 Optimum Fuel Planning.
   14.7.1. The amount of fuel consumed during a heavy airlift mission is greatly influenced by
   wind-optimized routing, cruise altitude, cruise airspeed, excess fuel, and takeoff and climb out profile.
       14.7.1.1. Wind-Optimized Routing. The AMC Computer Flight Plan (CFP) System automatically
       provides aircrews a wind-optimized routing for each mission. After verifying valid times, payload
       accuracy, wind forecasts, etc. the CFP route of flight is generally assumed to be the most fuel effi-
       cient for the altitude wind conditions.
       14.7.1.2. Cruise Altitude. For the C-17, higher is not always better in terms of fuel. The optimum
       cruise altitude is actually 2,000 to 4,000 feet below the maximum cruise ceiling. In fact, fuel effi-
       ciency is always higher 2,000 to 6,000 feet below the maximum cruise ceiling than at the maxi-
       mum cruise ceiling because the C-17s large engine fan is more efficient at altitudes lower than
       maximum. Attempt to cruise at optimum altitudes, not maximum, for the appropriate aircraft gross
       weight. The mission computer (MC) does not provide optimum altitude for the current gross
       weight. It only provides a value for maximum cruise ceiling and assumes cruise at maximum alti-
       tudes if automatic step-climbs are enabled in the Route Data page. Consequently, optimum cruise
       altitude must be manually determined. Suggested methods for determining altitudes:
           14.7.1.2.1. As a rule-of-thumb 35,000 feet is the optimal altitude for 430K; subtract/add 2,000
           feet for every 50K increase/decrease.
           14.7.1.2.2. Use MC Progress Page 2 or Performance Pages to determine maximum altitude;
           the optimum altitude is approximately 3,000 feet below this value.
               14.7.1.2.2.1. If Cruise Performance page shows a Long-Range Cruise (LRC) speed of
               .75M, optimum altitude is 2,000 higher than the current altitude; if LRC speed is .74M,
               then optimum altitude is 4,000 feet higher.
           14.7.1.2.3. If “held down” after flight and fuel planning for optimum altitudes, additional fuel
           consumption will be minimal up to 4,000 feet below the optimum altitude filed. Consider the
           following:
           14.7.1.2.4. Request a Mach change and fly the Mach number corresponding to the LRC speed
           on the MC Cruise Performance Page 1. Not reducing Mach speed as gross weight decreases
           imposes substantial and unnecessary fuel penalties over long periods of time.
           14.7.1.2.5. En route time will not change substantially from the CFP since TAS will be higher
           at the same Mach at the lower altitude.
       14.7.1.3. Cruise Speed. Maximum Range Cruise (MRC) speed is the speed that will attain the
       maximum miles per unit of fuel at a given gross weight and altitude. MRC can be determined by
       referencing the specific range charts in Part 5 of TO 1C-17A-1-1 (Cruise Chapter). The MRC
       point is located at the apex of each specific range parabola. If, and only if, the aircraft is at the opti-
       mum cruise altitude for the gross weight, then MRC speed is approximately .74M. For example, at
194                                           AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      FL290 and a gross weight of 400K, MRC is .67M. In this situation, flying .74M would be very
      fuel inefficient. Long-Range Cruise (LRC) speed is the speed where 1% of fuel range is sacrificed
      to obtain a 4-6% speed increase/time advantage over MRC. LRC is provided on the Cruise Perfor-
      mance page of the MC and is intended for use on most missions. It can also be determined by ref-
      erencing the specific range charts in TO 1C-17A-1-1. If the aircraft is at the optimum altitude for
      the gross weight, LRC speed will equal approximately .76M. Winds may have a significant effect
      on LRC speed. The MC-computed LRC speed and TO 1C-17A-1-1 LRC charts assume no wind
      conditions. A good rule-of-thumb is to increase LRC speed by .02M for every 100 knots of head-
      wind and decrease LRC speed by .02M for every 100 knots of tailwind. For example, with a
      150-knot headwind, LRC speed should be adjusted from .76M to .79M. In nearly every case, the
      fuel difference between .74M and LRC will be negligible (1%) but the en route time difference
      will be significant (4-6%). At optimum altitude, LRC speed is approximately 440 KTAS (enter
      this number for the TAS on the DD Form 175 or 1801).
      14.7.1.4. Selection of the alternate airfield is also an important factor in fuel conservation. In most
      cases, fuel plan to the closest suitable alternate to your destination. An obvious exception is situa-
      tions requiring two-alternate flight plan filing. The decision to fuel plan to the closest alternate
      should be based on common sense and good judgment after a careful review of weather condi-
      tions, NOTAMs, fuel and NAVAID availability at the alternate airfield, load bearing capacity, etc.
      The important point is to not arbitrarily select distant alternates to "hide" fuel but rather to have
      good rationale and reason for the alternate you select for fuel planning purposes. If fuel planning
      to an alternate very close to your destination (e.g., Shaw AFB for Charleston AFB) don't forget to
      check the Progress Page 1 to ensure the predicted fuel at destination exceeds 16,000 pounds (per
      14.4.2.). If necessary, enter identified extra fuel into the fuel plan page.
      14.7.1.5. When appropriate, enter identified extra fuel into the fuel plan page. Table 14.1. lists
      appropriate fuel penalties for conditions.

                                              AIR REFUELING

15.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for aircrews to air refuel the C-17 and is in addition to
procedures in the flight manual, and air refueling manual.

15.2. A/R Limitations. The following limitations apply
      15.2.1. Tanker Autopilot. Tanker pilots will notify receiver pilots when any axis of the autopilot is
      not used. If the tanker copilot is required to fly autopilot-off for training, unqualified receiver pilots
      will not fly the aircraft (N/A FTU). Tanker pilots will notify the receiver when copilot autopilot-off
      training is conducted and receive confirmation that the receiver pilot flying the aircraft is qualified.
      15.2.2. A/R Without Tanker Disconnect Capability. Without tanker disconnect capability means the
      boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. A/R will not be conducted after a loss of
      tanker disconnect capability.
      EXCEPTION 1: Fuel emergency situation.
      EXCEPTION 2: Contingency missions, JCS alert, ORI or CORI, Prime Nuclear Airlift Force
      (PNAF) support missions under normal conditions when the refueling is essential for home base
      recovery, or for any mission when authorized.
NOTE: When conducting A/R without tanker disconnect capability, limit contacts to the minimum num-
ber necessary to complete mission requirements. Do not accomplish boom limit demonstrations, or prac-
tice emergency separations while in the contact position.
      15.2.3. Manual Boom Latching (MBL) (also referred to as Emergency Boom Latching (EBL), Over-
      ride Boom Latching (OBL) and amplifier override). This is an emergency procedure. Normal tanker
      disconnect capability and automatic disconnect limits are inoperative. Use of this procedure must be
      authorized in the mission directive.
NOTE: The boom operator and receiver pilot will coordinate all actions as required by applicable direc-
tives and checklists when making A/R contacts using emergency boom latching procedures.
      15.2.4. Reverse A/R procedures will be accomplished for operational necessity only.
      15.2.5. Emergency Separations/Breakaways. Follow procedures in IAW TO 1-1C-1-35. When sepa-
      ration between receiver and tanker has been effected, the receiver pilot advises the tanker "WELL
      CLEAR" and states altitude passing. When the situation has stabilized, coordinate clearance back to
      precontact. Restrict all emergency separations/breakaways to 500’ below individual tanker’s altitude.
      15.2.6. Practice Emergency Separations:
         15.2.6.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation, coordination
         between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination will
         include when the separation will occur and who will give the command of execution.
         15.2.6.2. Prior to initiating practice emergency separations from the contact position, the receiver
         will ensure their A/R system is not in the override mode.
NOTE: Practice emergency separations will terminate no lower than 500’ below tanker altitude.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                197


   15.2.7. Receiver A/R Training for Unqualified Receiver Pilots. (This includes copilots, aircraft com-
   mander upgrade candidates and aircraft commanders refueling from the right seat.) In-flight training
   will be accomplished under direct IP supervision. The following procedures apply:
       15.2.7.1. The receiver pilot will inform and receive acknowledgment from the tanker. The boom
       operator at the controls will be qualified for the applicable category receiver. (This restriction does
       not apply during FTU training provided the student boom operator is under direct instructor super-
       vision.)
       15.2.7.2. For receiver pilot initial qualification or requalification, the receiver instructor / exam-
       iner pilot will be in one of the pilot seats with immediate access to the controls through all phases
       of the refueling from pre-contact until post air refueling.
   15.2.8. If a change of pilot control is made, the receiver aircraft will move back to at least the
   pre-contact position except for immediate assumption of control by the instructor pilot.
   15.2.9. If a receiver seat change takes place, move back to at least 100 feet in trail of the tanker and to
   a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the tanker until the seat change is
   complete.
   15.2.10. When conducting A/R behind a KC-135, tanker disconnect capability will be demonstrated
   by a boom operator initiated disconnect before conducting a limit demonstration or a practice emer-
   gency separation from the contact position.
   15.2.11. Weather Limitations.
       15.2.11.1. Turbulence: Do not launch if severe turbulence is forecast on the refueling track. Ter-
       minate refueling if moderate turbulence is encountered.
       15.2.11.2. Visibility: Do not close from 1 NM range (2 NM for receiver or tanker formations)
       unless you have visual contact with the tankers. Discontinue refueling if in-flight visibility is
       insufficient to continue safe refueling operations.
       15.2.11.3. A/R alternate airfields must meet the criteria of AFI 11-202, V3 for alternate airports.
   15.2.12. NVG Use During A/R. Pilots may use NVGs during air refueling rendezvous to acquire the
   tanker but must remove goggles NLT one nautical mile from the tanker.

15.3. Communications Failure. Aircraft experiencing two-way communications failure during the con-
duct of A/R shall continue flight in accordance with the following procedures:
   15.3.1. Squawk code 7600 for at least 2 minutes before exiting the track or anchor.
   15.3.2. Aircraft that have not received altitude instructions beyond the exit point shall exit the track or
   anchor at the lowest altitude specified in the clearance for the refueling portion of the flight and pro-
   ceed in accordance with "Procedures for Two Way Radio Failure IFR-VFR" set forth in DOD Flight
   Information Handbook.

15.4. Operational Reporting. Air refueling command and control reporting will be in accordance with
Chapter 2 of this instruction.

15.5. MARSA Applicability for Aerial Refueling. MARSA begins between the tanker and receiver
when the tanker advises ATC that it is accepting MARSA. MARSA is not an ICAO recognized term. If in
198                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


doubt as to what separation is provided by ATC, or what separation the aircrew is responsible for, query
the tanker and/or controlling agency.
      15.5.1. If MARSA has not been accepted by the tanker before the receiver reaches the air refueling
      initial point (ARIP), the receiver may be required to hold at the ARIP.
      15.5.2. Once the rendezvous is completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made with the
      tanker concurrence with MARSA remaining in effect.
      15.5.3. Upon completion of the rendezvous, receiver aircraft will remain within 3 miles of the tanker
      until MARSA is terminated.
      15.5.4. MARSA ends when normal separation standards are established, ATC accepts control at end
      of refueling and ATC advises MARSA is terminated.

15.6. Altitude Reservations. An ALTRV is authorization by a central altitude reservation function
(CARF, EUCARF, PACMARF, CARU) or the appropriate ARTCC/CERAP under certain circumstances,
for airspace utilization under prescribed conditions. Air refueling on operational missions often utilizes an
ALTRV under these conditions. ALTRVs may include all, a portion, or portions of the intended route of
flight. Request and approval format can be found in FAA 7610.4J.
      15.6.1. PICs will ensure ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. ALTRV status may
      be verified through the appropriate 18 AF TACC cell.
      15.6.2. Aircraft must depart within the assigned AVANA (ALTRV Void if Aircraft Not Airborne)
      time for the purpose of providing separation between altitude reservations. Normal AVANA will be 1
      hour. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time, coordinate with the C2 authority as soon
      as possible. Rescheduling will normally be in 24-hour increments after the original schedule.
      15.6.3. Aircraft on an ALTRV must operate within the altitude, time, and areas specified in the
      approval. An ALTRV APVL authorizes the aircraft to climb or descend as specified. Controllers are
      not required to issue a climb or descent clearance for the various flight segments. They may, however,
      request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude change.
      15.6.4. In a non-radar environment, the aircraft shall advise ATC if actual fix timing will be more
      than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate.
      15.6.5. File flight plans (1801 or DD175) containing ALTRVs IAW FLIP GP. Include the name of
      the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals do not eliminate
      the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans.

15.7. Receiver Aircraft Commander Responsibilities.
      15.7.1. Receiver aircraft shall squawk normal when separation from the tanker is greater than 3 miles.
      15.7.2. Receiver aircraft will maintain two-way radio contact with ATC until cleared to the refueling
      block altitude, established in that block, and cleared to the A/R frequency by ATC.
      15.7.3. Pilots are reminded that oceanic clearances and an acknowledged readback are required for all
      flights within North Atlantic (NAT) controlled airspace. References for oceanic clearance procedures
      are FLIP Area Planning (AP)/2 and the NAT Minimum Navigation Performance Specification
      (MNPS) Manual.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             199


      15.7.3.1. Receiver pilots will not rely on the tanker to obtain and readback oceanic clearance. To
      the maximum extent possible, receiver pilots should obtain their own, individual clearance from
      the oceanic control authority of the airspace in which they intend to operate, prior to entering oce-
      anic airspace. Pilots will request oceanic clearance prior to oceanic entry point IAW procedures
      established in AP/2 and NAT MNPS Manual. Consider obtaining clearance and providing read-
      back prior to rendezvous and air refueling.
      15.7.3.2. Tanker aircraft will not accomplish clearance readback for receiver aircraft. Receiver
      ACs are responsible for ensuring that oceanic clearance is always readback to the controlling
      authority by a member of their crew, and acknowledged by the oceanic controlling authority, prior
      to entering oceanic airspace.

15.8. Tanker Aircraft Commander Responsibilities. Tanker ACs are responsible for:
   15.8.1. Remaining within the protected lateral, longitudinal, and vertical airspace of the refueling
   track or anchor including orbit patterns.
   15.8.2. Notifying the appropriate ATC facility of all altitudes vacated and not anticipated for further
   use by refueling aircraft. Such altitudes shall not be reoccupied without further ATC clearance.
   15.8.3. Receiver navigation, regardless of the number of tankers or receivers, after rendezvous com-
   pletion through completion of refueling operations (A/R and MARSA have been terminated) except
   when under control responsibility of a military radar facility while in an anchor area.
   15.8.4. Maintaining communications with the appropriate ATC facility. All communications during
   refueling operations, including those concerning the receivers, shall be between the ATC facility or
   military radar unit and tanker. To the extent practical, receivers shall establish communications with
   the tanker prior to or when departing the ARIP on the specified A/R frequency. The tanker shall
   assume position reporting responsibility for the receivers upon rendezvous completion.
   15.8.5. Coordinating altitude and route clearance:
      15.8.5.1. From the ATC facility for receivers and tanker at least 5 minutes prior to refueling com-
      pletion except when both aircraft are operating on an approved altitude reservation (ALTRV).
      15.8.5.2. Through the radar controller when operating in refueling anchors with military ground
      radar. At least 5 minutes prior to completing refueling operations, the military radar facility shall
      forward requests to the assigned ATC facility and subsequently relay ATC clearances for the
      tanker and receiver aircraft from the ATC facility.
      15.8.5.3. Tanker aircrews should not normally obtain oceanic clearances for receiver aircraft
      intending to operate in NAT oceanic airspace. This is a receiver AC responsibility.
      15.8.5.4. Tanker aircrews will not readback receiver aircraft oceanic clearance. This is a receiver
      AC responsibility.
   15.8.6. Vertically positioning aircraft prior to reaching the planned exit point, to facilitate the safe
   and efficient transfer of separation responsibility from the military, under the provisions of MARSA,
   to the ATC facility on completion of refueling operations. Vertical separation of receivers and tankers
   shall be accomplished within the assigned altitudes.

      15.8.7. Providing each receiver, upon request, with the aircraft's position at the completion of refuel-
      ing operations. Additional information concerning amendments or changes to the receiver's ATC
      clearance shall also be provided as appropriate.
      15.8.8. Coordinating all refueling formation operations to ensure all aircraft are in proper post air
      refueling formation prior to cell breakup. Prior to terminating air refueling, the lead tanker will con-
      firm all aircraft in the formation are in proper post air refueling position with required lateral/vertical
      separation.

15.9. ATC Clearance. A/R operations are normally conducted on tracks or anchor areas published in
DOD FLIP. Operational considerations may require A/R outside published areas or within an ALTRV.
The tanker aircraft commander shall receive specific ATC clearance from the appropriate ATC facility for
the following:
      15.9.1. Entry to/exit from assigned aerial refueling altitude block (except on an approved ALTRV).
      15.9.2. Altitudes requested for tanker and receiver aircraft upon completion of air refueling.
      15.9.3. Routing for each aircraft or formation flight when exiting the refueling track prior to or
      beyond the exit point, or different from the flight plan routing.
      15.9.4. Extending the refueling operations beyond the track or anchor exit point due to adverse
      winds, mission requirements, etc.
      15.9.5. Use of altitudes in excess of those for which specific clearance has been granted (i.e., tobog-
      ganing).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            201


                                              Chapter 16

                                  COMBAT MISSION PLANNING

16.1. General. This chapter provides general combat mission planning guidance for planners and air-
crews, standardizing procedures for planning, briefing, and reviewing all missions. Planners and aircrews
should reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for additional mission planning guidance.
   16.1.1. Pilots require one full day of planning for any missions employing NVGs in the low-level
   environment.
   16.1.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Local Training Missions. 60 AMW crews will meet NLT the working day
   prior to mission execution to accomplish mission planning. It is highly recommended that 349 AMW
   crews meet NLT the working day prior to mission execution, however as a minimum the PIC will
   accomplish mission planning prior to mission execution following a through review of crew require-
   ments. Loadmasters are highly encouraged to attend mission planning; squadrons may direct atten-
   dance. If unable to attend, the loadmaster will coordinate training requirements with the aircraft
   commander prior to mission planning. The mission commander/PIC will release the crew(s) when
   planning is complete. 60/349 AMW crews will coordinate all air refueling scheduling/use through 60
   OSS/OSO. 60/349 AMW crews will coordinate ALZ scheduling at KMWH through the use of AMT
   (Air Movement Table) during mission planning. Ensure that pertinent information is inputted into
   AMT by 1100 the day prior to the sortie.
   16.1.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Operational and Off-Station Training Missions. PICs will review mission
   tasking (Form 59) and ensure sufficient planning and coordination is accomplished prior to entering
   pre-mission crew rest to complete any assigned mission regardless of complexity.

16.2. Assault Landing Zones (ALZ). Assault landing zone operations are conducted to introduce or
evacuate personnel and/or equipment to or from hostile, denied, or unsecured territory. As a general rule,
DZ selection considerations also apply to ALZ selection. Aircraft performance limitations will be taken
into account when selecting an ALZ location. Landing zone size, lighting patterns, and composition crite-
ria are contained in AFI 13-217.
NOTE: OG/CC is the approval authority for the use of semi-prepared landing zones on missions within
the U.S. to include Alaska and Hawaii. MAJCOM A3/DO approval is required in all other instances. Ref-
erence AMCI 11-208 for coordination process.
   16.2.1. Plan approaches to the ALZ IAW AFTTP 3-3.35A and the airfield identification procedures
   published in the OPORD or SPINS. Brief any deviations from approaches described in AFTTP
   3-3.35A. Where multiple options are available, select the approach which best minimizes exposure to
   the threat while still allowing a high probability of landing on the first approach. Remain unpredict-
   able. If no published approach exists, mission computer approaches, when approved, may be built and
   flown IAW Chapter 11 of this instruction.
NOTE: The PIC must ensure landing TOLD data reflects the possibility for a landing at the end of the
zone, and any planned delay in braking due to heated brakes (subtract landing/safety zone distances from
runway available to ensure adequate runway exists for rollout).
   16.2.2. (Added-TRAVIS) If the mission computer provides ground roll versus landing distance data
   for the selected runway, the runway must be marked in accordance with AFI 13-217 and assault pro-
202                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      cedures must be executed (i.e.; touching down in the specified touchdown zone and using TO
      1C-17A-1 Assault Landing procedures).
      16.2.3. (Added-TRAVIS) ALZ landings may be accomplished with one or more thrust reversers
      pinned or brakes capped provided the MC TOLD provide adequate ground roll distance. Pilots will
      ensure the MC non-standard TOLD pages reflect the proper aircraft configuration.
      16.2.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Do not use assault landing zone procedures at airfields without crash/fire
      rescue or uncontrolled airfields. This does not preclude aircrews from flying full flap approaches at
      these airfields.

16.3. Route Planning. To the maximum extent possible, crews should follow guidance listed in AFTTP
3-3.35A, chapter 4.
      16.3.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Military Training Route (MTR) Procedures. See FLIP AP/1B.
         16.3.1.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Tactical Route Review/Approval. Coordinate with Wing Tactics
         prior to planning random low-level routes. Low-level routes will be planned to make maximum
         use of established MTRs. All planned low-level routes, local and off-station, not published in
         FLIP AP/1B, will be drawn on a sectional aeronautical chart (PFPS product suffices as long as all
         Airspace, SUAS, and MTRs are depicted) and approved by Wing Tactics personnel NLT one duty
         day prior to mission departure. Missions that require ALTRVs and (or) a flimsy will have
         low-level routes submitted to Wing Tactics NLT three duty days prior to mission departure. A
         copy of the chart and computer generated Flight Logs will be given to and maintained by Wing
         Tactics when the route is approved. These routes will be flown as approved. If significant changes
         are required, the random low-level will be re-coordinated or cancelled.

16.4. Low Level Altitude Restrictions. Low level altitudes will depend upon conditions such as terrain,
threat, the necessity to avoid detection, and equipment limitations. The following minimum altitudes are
established for MAF airlift operations. FLIP/ICAO procedures, training considerations, terrain, or opera-
tional directives may dictate higher altitudes.
WARNING: Aeronautical charts do not depict man-made obstacles less than 200 feet AGL or a change
in terrain until it exceeds the chart contour interval. The worst situation would occur if a 199-foot tower
sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour. For a TPC (1:500,000) with a contour
interval of 500-feet, this results in an uncharted obstacle existing 698 feet above charted terrain. Addition-
ally, the highest spot elevation on any given leg may not be the highest terrain as in the case of gradually
rising elevations. Planners will ensure accurate terrain analysis by evaluating both spot elevations and the
highest contour level. Refer to Figure 16.1., Inherent Chart Errors.
CAUTION: Some charts may depict terrain and obstacle altitudes in meters versus feet (e.g. JOG and
TLM charts in some areas of the world).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                   203


Figure 16.1. Inherent Chart Errors.




   16.4.1. Day VMC En Route. Plan a minimum of 500 feet AGL (300 feet AGL on approved routes)
   modified contour altitude above the terrain using visual references, HUD, and radar altimeter.
   16.4.2. Night VMC En Route. Plan en route legs at an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest
   obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart
   contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NMs of
   route centerline to include the aircraft turn radius over each turn point (10 NMs outside of the U.S.). If
   the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the
   turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is lower, do not initiate descent until after the turn point. Legs
   may be segmented to allow flight closer to the ground. Once the obstruction is visually identified and
   the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower. See
   Figure 16.2.

NOTES:
     1. A MC FOM of 5 or better is required in order to fly lower than MSA at night.
       2. Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, may reduce night en route altitudes. If the route
          has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with the
          lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.
204                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


Figure 16.2. Night VMC En Route Altitude.




      16.4.3. NVG En route. Plan en route legs at an indicated altitude of 500 feet above the highest spot
      terrain elevation, or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain con-
      tour, whichever is higher, within 3 NM on centerline. Three miles prior to the charted man made
      obstacle, within 3 NM of centerline, the aircrew must visually identify the obstacle. If the obstacle is
      not identified by 3 NM, climb to attain an altitude 500’ above the obstacle. If the altitude for the next
      leg is higher than the current leg altitude, complete the climb prior to the turn point. If the altitude for
      the next leg is lower than the current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turn point. Legs may be
      divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain differential or threats in
      order to allow flight closer to the terrain. Once the controlling obstacle or terrain feature is visually
      identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segmented alti-
      tude.

NOTES:
     1. A MC FOM of 5 or better is required in order to fly lower than MSA at night.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                205


       2. Planning a route on a JOG chart, if available, may reduce night en route altitudes. If the route
          has been planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with the
          lower altitudes when flying with reference to a TPC.
   16.4.4. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides additional ter-
   rain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption of low-level operations
   (route orientation and aircraft malfunctions or when either pilot will leave the seat during low-level
   operations, etc). An MSA will be computed for each leg or route segment or entire low level route.
   The MSA is 1000 feet above the highest obstruction within 5 NMs of route centerline.
   16.4.5. Minimum IFR En Route Altitude. Compute Minimum IFR En Route Altitude by adding 1000
   feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain as defined in AIM, paragraph 5-6-5, ADIZ Boundaries and
   Designated Mountainous Areas) above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain
   feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NMs of route centerline (10 NMs outside the US). This altitude
   should be rounded off to the next higher 100-foot increment. If the altitude for the next leg is higher
   than the current leg altitude, climbs will be completed before the turn point. If the altitude for the next
   leg is lower, do not initiate descent until after the turn point.
       16.4.5.1. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military Training Routes
       (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be computed leg minimum IFR En Route Altitude unless a
       higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B. The min IFR altitude may be above the top of the MTR
       leg altitude. In this case, the aircraft will slow to 250 KCAS or less, contact ATC and coordinate
       an alternate clearance.
       EXCEPTION: After thorough route planning by the crew and approval from the wing tactics
       office and OG/CC, aircraft may fly the top of the block on an MTR when that altitude is less than
       min IFR en route altitude. For multiple use local MTRs, OGV will issue local approval and restric-
       tions in their unit supplement to this instruction.
   16.4.6. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC terrain clearance
   during emergency situations that require leaving the low level structure. Several ESAs may be com-
   puted for route segments transiting significant terrain differentials or a single ESA may be computed
   for the entire low level route. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to
   the elevation of the highest obstruction to flight within 22 NMs of planned route centerline.

NOTES:
     1. Climbing to ESA may put the aircraft or formation in a controlled (i.e., IFR) altitude structure
        requiring coordination with Air Traffic Control agencies.
       2. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under International Standard Atmo-
          spheric (ISA) conditions. Any deviation from these standard conditions will result in errone-
          ous readings on the altimeter. This error becomes important when considering obstacle
          clearances in temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft’s altitude is below the figure
          indicated by the altimeter. Refer to the Flight Information Handbook to determine correction.

16.5. Peacetime Route Restrictions. In addition to restrictions in AFI 11-202V3, specific country or
theater of operations publications, and FLIP area planning, routes should not be planned or flown:
206                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      16.5.1. With less than 1 NM separation (3 NMs when in excess of 250 KCAS) when below 2000 feet
      AGL from known sensitive environmental (i.e., hospitals, fish hatcheries, large poultry complexes,
      recreation areas, institutions, etc).
      16.5.2. With less than 3 NMs separation from prohibited airspace.
      16.5.3. With less than 3 NMs separation from nuclear power plants.
      16.5.4. Through restricted airspace, except transition or termination in such areas where the planning
      unit is a primary using agency or has approval of the controlling agency.
      16.5.5. In weather conditions less than those specified in this instruction and AFI 11-202V3.
      16.5.6. Below 1000 feet AGL within a 2000 feet radius over cities or towns shown as magenta shaded
      areas on 1:500,000 (TPC) scale charts.
      16.5.7. Over or through active live fire or impact areas that may not be specifically designated as pro-
      hibited or restricted areas.
      16.5.8. Below 500 feet AGL unless:
         16.5.8.1. Host nation rules specifically allow such VFR operations.
         16.5.8.2. Routes or training areas have been environmentally assessed and surveyed for 300-foot
         AGL operations. This restriction does not apply to one-time-use routes. Consult FLIP AP/1B for
         published Military Training Route restrictions.

16.6. Navigation Chart Preparation. Mission planners will construct a master chart for mission brief-
ings and aircrew reference. Planners may construct the chart using computerized mission planning sys-
tems if available. Sectional charts depict controlled airspace. Low-level navigation charts will be
annotated with any added, deleted, or changed information in the most recent CHUM or supplement. In
no case will CHUM coverage be less than 22 NMs either side of the entire planned route of flight. Crews
may trim charts to no less than 10 NMs after establishing the ESA. Color copies, if available, of a master
chart reduce the probability of missing or misplotted data on aircrew charts.
CAUTION: 1:50,000 and smaller scale maps do not depict aeronautical information, may not show
man-made obstacles, and are rarely updated through the CHUM.
      16.6.1. Chart Annotation. Individual chart annotations should have, as a minimum, turnpoints, IP,
      DZ, course line, course data, CHUM data and date, ESA and chart series/date. Reference AFTTP
      3-3.35A for common chart annotations.
      16.6.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircrews should analyze the objective (runway or ALZ) by using all
      available resources (e.g.; current CHUM'd chart, satellite imagery, ASRR) to identify terrain and
      other hazards within 10 NM of the arrival airfield.

16.7. Aircrew Flimsy. Aircrew flimsies are a standardized collection of essential operational informa-
tion required by aircrews to complete mission planning, conduct route study, fly the mission, and comply
with post-mission ground procedures and debriefing requirements.

16.8. Route Study. Crew route study is mandatory before accomplishing flight in the low level environ-
ment. An intensive review of the ingress, objective area, and egress routing by the entire crew leads to
effective crew coordination and safe mission execution. Aircraft turns planned into higher terrain, critical
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               207


obstacles that do not meet three-engine climb performance, terrain analysis, threat locations, terrain mask-
ing, and tactics will be discussed. Special emphasis should be placed on the run-in and objective area for
the locations of visual and radar features that will assist in proper identification. The importance of route
study cannot be overemphasized.

16.9. Tactical Aircrew Coordination. Effective crew coordination is crucial to the success of any
flight, especially during tactical operations, and will be discussed prior to executing the mission. During
the route study and/or the mission briefing is a convenient time for the entire aircrew to discuss specific
responsibilities during each phase of the mission. Assigning specific in-flight duties, such as who is going
to fly the aircraft and who is going to operate airdrop switches, and who is going to scan for threats, will
help to reduce confusion during execution. While there is no clear cut definition of crew coordination, the
concept deals with the ability of the aircrew to handle a rapidly changing environment and successfully
perform the task at hand. This requires maintaining a high level of situational awareness through the cross
flow of information between various crew positions. Information should be relevant, accurate, complete,
timely, and concise, particularly for the objective area and threat reaction maneuvers. Crew coordination
discussions should also encompass individual technique, limitations, emergency procedures, and previous
lessons learned.

16.10. Airlift Support Forces Coordination. Ensure coordination is complete with airlift and support-
ing forces. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for applicable briefing items.

16.11. Briefings.
   16.11.1. Mission Planning Pre-Brief. The purpose of the mission planning pre-brief is to familiarize
   all crewmembers with the general aspects of the mission. The group or squadron commander, combat
   support group staff specialists, all crewmembers of each participating crew, and other personnel con-
   cerned with the mission should attend. The mission planning pre-briefing may include all information
   pertinent to the mission and eliminate the need for later specialized briefings. In cases where highly
   specialized information or techniques require additional explanation or review (such as formation pro-
   cedures), schedule a specialized briefing. During the briefing, indicate what preparation has been
   accomplished and what is yet to be accomplished. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A for guidance in con-
   ducting the briefing.
   16.11.2. Pre-Deployment Briefing. Prior to deployments, the operations officer, mission commander,
   or designated representative should assemble the crew and brief the description and purpose of the
   mission, tentative itinerary, aircraft configuration, special equipment, fuel load, clothing required,
   anticipated housing and messing facilities, sufficient money to defray individual’s anticipated
   expenses, personal equipment/field equipment requirements, special clearance requirements, and fly-
   ing safety.
   16.11.3. Tactical Mission Briefing. This briefing is required if applicable items are not briefed in the
   Joint Mission Briefing/Mission Briefing. A mission briefing for participating pilots, loadmasters, and
   other personnel as directed by the mission commander, is required prior to all low-level and formation
   missions. Brief applicable items in sufficient detail to ensure a clear understanding of mission objec-
   tives and procedures. The PIC is responsible for ensuring all crewmembers are briefed on applicable
   mission items (reference AFTTP 3-3.35A).

      16.11.4. Specialist Briefing. Conduct specialist briefings to detail operating procedures or special
      interest items. The mission commander determines the requirement for this briefing. When appropri-
      ate, hold specialist briefings at the completion of the Tactical Mission Briefing for pilots, loadmasters,
      aeromedical personnel, jumpmasters, landing zone control officers, STT, and DZST personnel.
      16.11.5. Serial Lead Briefing. The serial leader will assemble the pilots participating in the serial to
      cover any changes or additions arising after the formal mission briefing. Only applicable items need
      to be briefed. Conduct this briefing as appropriate, to allow sufficient time to complete necessary air-
      craft inspections and jumpmaster, loadmaster, or parachutist briefings before station time.
      16.11.6. Other Briefings. In addition to the briefings above, mission participants will also conduct
      briefings as required in Section 6.12. of this AFI. These include C2 Center Briefing, Aircraft Com-
      mander Briefing, Specialized Briefings (Airdrop, Air Refueling, Load Briefing, etc.), Weather Brief-
      ing, Intelligence Briefing and Hazardous Materials Briefing.

16.12. Mission Debriefings. Hold immediately after the mission if practical. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A
for suggested items to include in the debrief.
      16.12.1. For formation flights, a post-mission debrief should be conducted by the mission com-
      mander or formation leader.

                                               Chapter 17

                      MISSION EMPLOYMENT/TACTICAL PROCEDURES

17.1. General.
   17.1.1. Each unit will have a tactics ground training program tailored to the unit’s wartime taskings.
   Tactics and intelligence staff should join forces in this area to ensure success. Using a building block
   approach, the ground tactical training program forms the base of the unit’s tactics program. Each
   unit’s tactics ground training program may be different because of the differences between unit mis-
   sion taskings, however, the overall objectives should be the same.
   17.1.2. Crews will follow guidance in AFTTP 3-3.35A when performing tactical arrivals and depar-
   tures, or when operating into locations with a hostile threat environment, except as noted in this chap-
   ter. Brief any deviations from guidance provided in AFTTP 3-3.35A.
   17.1.3. Crews should be prepared to adjust their mission plan based on en route mission updates. In a
   potential threat situation, crewmembers will understand their limitations and those of their equipment.
   Since the procedures contained in this instruction and AFTTP 3-3.35A are not all encompassing, air-
   crews are expected to use good judgment, innovation, and sound airmanship to successfully accom-
   plish the mission.

17.2. Tactical Checklists. Combat Entry and Combat Exit checklists will be executed at the appropriate
times/locations for airdrop and tactical airland missions.
   17.2.1. All primary crewmembers will be on interphone from the Combat Entry checklist until com-
   pletion of the Combat Exit checklist, unless crew duties require otherwise. If a pilot needs to leave the
   seat or go off interphone, initiate a climb to an appropriate altitude.
   17.2.2. Personnel performing duties required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during airdrop,
   low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective headgear. All other personnel in the
   cargo compartment will be seated with seat belts fastened.

17.3. Energy Management. Performance data will be carefully considered and energy management is
essential when planning low level operations. This is particularly necessary in mountainous terrain, at
heavy gross weights, at high pressure altitudes, and/or with less than full engine power capability.
Aggressive maneuvering, even at relatively high airspeeds, can place the aircraft into an approach-to-stall
condition or require a go-around. Abrupt control inputs and/or uncoordinated flight should be avoided.
These inputs are particularly hard on the airframe; and, in some instances, may increase airframe struc-
tural loading beyond design limits, possibly resulting in structural failure. Knowledge of factors that can
lead to Pilot Induced Oscillations (PIO) during the landing phase is critical. It does no good to avoid the
threat successfully only to exceed aircraft and/or pilot capabilities during the approach and landing phase.
WARNING: Uncoordinated flight reduces stall margins and can cause an abrupt departure from con-
trolled flight. Uncoordinated flight increases airframe structural loading and should be avoided unless an
actual threat exists.
210                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


17.4. Tactical Descents. If necessary, reverse engine idle thrust and speed brakes can be used to obtain
rapid descents from high altitudes. Initial descent rates of over 12,000 fpm may be achieved. Use of the
flight director for guidance is recommended.
      17.4.1. Follow procedures in TO 1C-17A-1.
      17.4.2. Initially, the PF smoothly lowers the nose to approximately 15 degrees nose low and then fol-
      lows the pitch bar to maintain desired speed, and follows the roll bar for lateral navigation guidance.
      17.4.3. Stow thrust reversers and speed brakes prior to leveling off. Select and establish desired en
      route airspeed.
      17.4.4. Formation tactical descents are limited to 3-ship formations and a minimum of 6,000’ spacing
      between aircraft.

17.5. NVG Visual Approaches. When flying NVG visual approaches, intercept final no later than 1.5
miles from the approach end of the runway, and intercept target approach path angle at no lower than 500
AGL. The first pilot to acquire the landing zone will state Pilot/Copilot has the LZ. The next pilot to
acquire the zone will announce Pilot/Copilot has the LZ at (state clock position). The clock position will
be verbally acknowledged/confirmed by the other pilot.

17.6. Ground Operations. This paragraph outlines procedures to follow when conducting specific
ground operations at forward operating locations. Maneuvering in confined areas, reverse taxi operations,
performing engine running onloads and offloads, and combat offloads all require a high degree of crew
coordination. A thorough briefing and prior preparation are essential to quick and safe operations. Appro-
priate ground personnel and subsequent aircrews should be briefed on any hazards encountered during
takeoff or landing (e.g., dust, winds, hostile activity).
      17.6.1. NVG Lighting During Ground Operations. Operating landing lights with IR lens covers/fil-
      ters for more than 5 minutes on the ground will cause damage to the lights/filters.
      17.6.2. NVG Taxi/Backing. Pilots may taxi using NVGs on airfields without lights (blacked out) or
      equipped with overt or covert lights. If taxiing or accomplishing ground ops on blacked out taxiways/
      runways/ramps, the Aircraft Commander will ensure aircraft or environmental lighting provides for
      clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edge. Comply with all taxi restrictions in Chapter 5 and the
      ASRR. The LM may provide the pilot with directions to taxi the aircraft while using NVGs.
      17.6.3. Engine Running Onload and Offload (ERO) Procedures.
WARNING: Do not onload or offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp/door at the same
time unless both doors are directly supervised by a C-17A qualified crewmember. Paratroop doors will
not be used.
WARNING: If a combat offload is to be accomplished before offloading vehicles, do not remove
restraint until after the combat offload is completed.
         17.6.3.1. Vehicle parking brakes will not be released until all restraint is removed and cleared by
         the loadmaster.
         17.6.3.2. Personnel to be offloaded will be briefed to secure baggage aboard vehicles (if applica-
         ble).
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               211


       17.6.3.3. Vehicles and all personnel exiting via the ramp will proceed directly aft of the aircraft at
       least 25 feet before turning and at least 200 feet before stopping.
       17.6.3.4. After the aircraft has slowed to taxi speed, the loadmaster may remove all tiedowns
       except one forward and one aft. After ensuring the ramp toes are in the appropriate position, open
       the cargo door, and lower the ramp to an approximate horizontal position.
       17.6.3.5. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations using briefed signals. Other
       qualified loadmasters (CRG, aerial port) may perform these duties; however, the crew’s primary
       loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. Passengers will be escorted by a crew-
       member, CRG, Aerial Port, or airfield control (i.e., STT, DACG) personnel when enplaning or
       deplaning. Deplane passengers before removing cargo and enplane after loading cargo unless
       cargo size and location dictates otherwise.
       17.6.3.6. Load Data. If cargo/passenger onload information can be obtained prior to landing/
       onload, complete the DD Form 365-4 for the subsequent sortie. The loadmaster may use the load
       plan total weight and load center of balance (CB) for entry on the DD Form 365-4 provided these
       procedures are followed:
       17.6.3.7. The load plan data will be checked by a qualified load plan validator (i.e. aircraft load-
       master, CRG loadmaster, aerial port specialist, or any individual who has completed the AMC
       Affiliation Program Airlift Planners Course).
NOTE: If downloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie.
CAUTION: The stabilizer struts will be stowed and the ramp raised to at least the horizontal position
prior to taxi.
       17.6.3.8. Crew Entrance Door ERO Procedures. The PIC may approve the offload or onload of
       personnel and small cargo through the crew entrance door. In this instance, the throttles may be
       positioned to idle or reverse idle. Deplane the loadmaster to assure safety of deplaning/enplaning
       of personnel.
       17.6.3.9. Reduced Lighting EROs. Reduced light EROs must be accomplished with red/NVIS
       (overt) lighting in the cargo compartment sufficient to permit MHE drivers to see marshaller’s sig-
       nals and safely position MHE. NVGs will not be used for positioning MHE for on/off-loading
       operations. Dimming rheostat will be set to minimum amount of lighting to accomplish LMs
       duties. LMs may use NVGs to maintain situational awareness of the load team behind the aircraft
       before and after actual loading.
   17.6.4. Combat Offload Procedures. On operational missions, the controlling MAJCOM/A3/DO (or
   DIRMOBFOR for chopped assets) may authorize combat offloads when conditions warrant. OG/CC
   may approve combat offloads on training missions following a thorough risk assessment.
WARNING: Many explosive items have specific "drop" criteria that, if exceeded, render the item useless
or dangerous to the user. With the exception of small arms ammunition (Hazard Class/Division 1.4),
explosives and munitions shall not be combat offloaded without approval of MAJCOM/A3/DO.
EXCEPTION: Explosives and munitions rigged for airdrop may be combat offloaded without MAJ-
COM/A3/DO approval.
CAUTION: Excessively rough, sharply undulating or battle damaged surfaces may cause damage to the
aircraft during combat offload operations. Reducing forward taxi speed on these surfaces will reduce air-
212                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


craft oscillation. The PIC will ensure the offload area will permit the offload operation to be conducted
without damage to the aircraft.
CAUTION: The PIC is ultimately responsible for ensuring the area in front and behind the aircraft is
clear during the operation. The loadmaster will ensure the area behind the aircraft is well clear of anything
which may be damaged due to engine exhaust blast.
CAUTION: To combat offload, a surface of at least 1,000 feet is required; however, 1,500 feet is desired
to provide a margin of safety.
         17.6.4.1. Ensure the crew rest window to the cargo compartment is clear of obstructions for com-
         bat offload operations.
         17.6.4.2. If ground personnel are present, the loadmaster will make contact with the individuals to
         ensure no one disrupts the operation. After the area is clear and secure, the loadmaster positions
         for the offload.
         17.6.4.3. All combat offloads will be accomplished from the forward loadmaster station.
NOTE: If combat offloading to an empty aircraft, a DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent
sortie.
         17.6.4.4. NVG Combat Offloads. Pilots and loadmasters may accomplish Combat Offloads on
         NVGs at airfield light levels down to and including blacked out, provided aircraft or airfield light-
         ing permit clear definition of taxiway/runway/ramp edges. Cargo compartment lighting will be set
         at minimum level to perform loadmaster duties safely.

17.7. Emergency Airlift of Personnel. Use these procedures for emergency airlift of personnel from
areas faced with enemy siege or hostile fire; or use these when directed by the controlling component
commander, MAJCOM/A3/DO or DIRMOBFOR. Airlift of this nature will normally be accomplished
without the use of individual seats, seat belts, or litter stanchions. Passengers will be seated on the cargo
floor/ramp. The number of personnel will vary depending on size and the number of tiedown straps on
board the aircraft. An estimate of 200 personnel on the main floor and 25 on the ramp can be used for
planning purposes. Personnel may be loaded in groups of 12 to 16 (depending on size).
The following procedures will apply:
      17.7.1. All Rails and roller conveyors will be stowed. Four ramp toes install in the high position.
      17.7.2. When available, mattresses or other cushioning material may be used for seating.
      17.7.3. Troops, passengers, and ambulatory patients will be seated facing forward on the cargo floor,
      sidewall seats, or ramp.
         17.7.3.1. Attach the hook end of tiedown straps to tiedown rings in A and G rows. Position per-
         sonnel laterally between attached straps. After personnel are seated, route straps laterally across
         their legs and secure ratchet end of straps to the tiedown ring in D row. Be cautious of making
         strap to tight to restrict blood circulation in the legs of passengers.
      17.7.4. Secure baggage on the ramp when excess baggage and cargo secured on the cargo floor (or a
      pallet) may decrease the number of troops, passengers, and patients proportionately.
      17.7.5. The maximum altitude for emergency airlift will not exceed FL250.
      17.7.6. For airlift of patients, see Chapter 20 of this instruction.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             213


17.8. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft Defensive Systems.
   17.8.1. (Added-TRAVIS) Units will not transport built-up flares (magazines containing flares with
   squib installed). Only the aircraft's defensive system dispensers can contain built-up flares. Transport
   spare flares as hazardous cargo and process for Air Shipment in accordance with AFJMAN 24-204.
   17.8.2. (Added-TRAVIS) Halon, carbon dioxide, or water-type fire extinguishers will not be used on
   fires involving pyrotechnics or magnesium incendiaries due to the risk of explosions.
   17.8.3. (Added-TRAVIS) Prior to arrival with a flare loaded aircraft, notify the local C2 that the air-
   craft is equipped with flares. Parking restrictions vary from base to base; coordinate with local C2 to
   ensure aircraft equipped with flares are parked in the appropriate spot. If flares were dispensed, taxi
   clear of the runway, deplane a crewmember, and check for a hung flare. If a hung flare is discovered
   follow procedures in this section.
   17.8.4. (Added-TRAVIS) Upon arrival at home station, flares are normally downloaded immedi-
   ately. Maintenance will annotate the flare download requirement in the aircraft forms.
   17.8.5. (Added-TRAVIS) Aircraft that are configured with flares for subsequent missions may be
   used for local training sorties.
17.9. (Added-TRAVIS) Flight Deck Armor. During missions not requiring armor, pieces that restrict
seat movement may be removed and will be properly restrained.

                                         AIRCRAFT FORMATION

18.1. General. Aircrews will follow formation procedures in AFTTP 3-3.35A, Chapter 5, except as out-
lined below.

18.2. Weather Minimums.
      18.2.1. Takeoff. Takeoff minimums are no lower than 200 foot ceiling and one-half mile visibility
      (RVR 24). If the departure ceiling or visibility is below published approach minimums, the formation
      may takeoff if the requirements for a departure alternate (in accordance with Chapter 6 of these
      instructions) are met.
         18.2.1.1. NVG Formation Departures. Weather minimums for NVG formation departures for
         crewmembers who are non-current and/or unqualified is 1500/3. Current and qualified NVG air-
         crews may fly NVG departures with weather down to 600/2 (OG/CC or equivalent may approve
         down to 300/1). Crews must give careful consideration to potential hazards during the critical
         phase of flight. Other weather limitations are IAW this instruction and AFI 11-202V3. NVGs have
         inherent limitations which can further be reduced by poor weather conditions. Crews will consider
         weather conditions, moon illumination and position, sky glow at dawn and dusk, cultural lighting,
         and weapon/expendable effects when planning NVG operations.
      18.2.2. Landing. Formation landing minimums are the published minimums for the airport.

18.3. Taxi Interval. Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length. Lead may increase taxi interval if cir-
cumstances dictate.

18.4. Inadvertent Weather Penetration. If a formation inadvertently enters clouds and/or areas of poor
visibility while operating VFR, flight lead’s primary concern is to extricate the formation from the
weather while providing safe aircraft separation and terrain clearance. Wingmen should immediately
notify lead of deteriorating visual conditions. The following procedures apply to formations operating
VFR.
      18.4.1. Inadvertent Weather Penetration With SKE. Immediately upon penetrating the weather, for-
      mation lead will announce, “XXXX Flight, execute inadvertent weather penetration procedures with
      SKE now, base altitude XXX, base heading XXX, base airspeed XXX. Acknowledge.” The formation
      climbs to a base altitude at or above the route/segment ESA. Element wingmen initiate climb, select
      SKE, set cross-track to 1,000 feet left or right, as appropriate, and continue climb to the base altitude
      on the base heading at base airspeed at 1,000 FPM while maintaining SKE separation. When level at
      the base altitude, the leader commands the section to assume IFR interval. At this command, number
      2 and 3 aircraft of each element reduce airspeed 20-knots and drift back until they establish intervals
      of 4,000 and 8,000-feet, respectively, then reset the appropriate cross-track distance. If visual condi-
      tions can not be reestablished, lead will contact the appropriate ATC, declare an emergency, and
      request the necessary airspace clearance or individual clearances.
      18.4.2. Inadvertent Weather Penetration Without SKE. Immediately upon penetrating the weather,
      formation lead will announce, “XXXX Flight, execute inadvertent weather penetration procedures
      without SKE now, base altitude XXX, base heading XXX, base airspeed XXX. Acknowledge.” The
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                 215


   formation climbs to a base altitude at or above the ESA for the route or segment. Climb at base speed
   and 1,000 feet per minute. After the element wingmen establish a 1,000 feet per minute climb, they
   will use 30 degrees of bank to turn to a heading 30 degrees right or left, respectively, from the base
   heading. Maintain this divergent heading for one minute (2 minutes from slowdown to escape for air-
   drop missions) before resuming base heading. The use of TCAS, Air-to-Air TACAN or weather skin
   paint will aid in maintaining separation from other formation members. The last element of the forma-
   tion will occupy the base altitude; preceding elements will stack at 1,000-foot intervals, with the first
   element occupying the highest altitude. Do not change the base heading while in IMC. If visual con-
   ditions can not be reestablished, lead will contact the appropriate ATC, declare an emergency if
   needed, and request the necessary airspace clearance or individual clearances.
   EXCEPTION: If executing inadvertent weather penetration without SKE in a personnel echelon
   geometry, #2 will turn 20 degrees off base heading away from the lead airplane using 20 degrees of
   bank. #3 will turn 30 degrees off base heading in the same direction away from lead as #2 using 30
   degrees of bank. Each wingman will maintain a divergent heading for 2 minutes then turn back to base
   heading.
WARNING: For formation geometries other than visual in-trail, terrain clearance requirements and air-
space restrictions may require modified procedures. Inadvertent weather penetration in mountainous ter-
rain using the above procedures may be hazardous. Mission planners and flight leads should thoroughly
brief the procedures that best suit the situation.
NOTE: The above procedures are for emergency use and do not constitute authority to violate AFI
11-202V3, or Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Exercising these procedures under actual weather
conditions may constitute a violation subject to appropriate action by USAF and FAA. Individual aircraft
should remain VFR if there is sufficient warning to take evasive action. Flight leads will take all practical
measures to avoid entering controlled airspace without clearance. Level off initially at VFR cruise altitude
to minimize conflict with IFR traffic until an IFR clearance is obtained.
NOTE: Lead may level the formation below the ESA for the route provided sustained VMC is encoun-
tered and terrain clearance is assured.
   18.4.3. Lead is responsible for calling the inadvertent weather penetration and maintaining formation
   clearance/integrity at all times. Inadvertent weather penetration cannot be written for each individual
   situation. It is therefore critical for lead to keep track of his wingman at all times, and be directive if a
   standard inadvertent weather penetration doesn’t fit the exact condition of the formation.

18.5. Departure Airborne Aborts.
   18.5.1. Aircraft aborting during assembly will execute the briefed emergency procedures, hold clear
   of departing traffic, maintain VMC if possible, notify lead, and contact the appropriate controlling
   agency. If possible, the aborting aircraft will remain clear until a landing can be made without inter-
   fering with the remainder of the departing formation.

18.6. Formation Recoveries.
   18.6.1. Formation Landings. All aircraft land on the runway centerline with the same flap detent set-
   ting, and use reverse thrust and brakes as briefed. Continue to the end of the runway (or briefed turn-
   off) without stopping in any position that would prevent succeeding aircraft from clearing the runway.
216                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


WARNING: Aircraft will not perform touch-and-go landings or planned go around after touchdown
maneuvers out of formation recoveries.
      18.6.2. Visual Recoveries. The desired landing interval is 60 seconds (45 seconds minimum). Con-
      sider extending the interval for icy runway conditions, short/narrow runways, or other adverse condi-
      tions.
      18.6.3. SKE Recoveries. Desired aircraft interval upon landing is 12,000 feet, 10,000 feet minimum.
         18.6.3.1. Do not fly 45/180 ground tracks or course reversal maneuvers.

18.7. Rendezvous. See AFTTP 3-1.35 Attachment 7 (UNCLASSIFIED) paragraph 7.4. Serial leads may
brief alternate rejoin procedures as dictated by the individual situation. The following procedures can be
used in the event that special procedures as not pre-briefed. These procedures are intended to join multiple
sections into one formation. Each section will converge on a briefed geographic point or radio fix that is
referred to as the Start Rendezvous Point (SRP). Each section will use a different SKE frequency, arriving
at the SRP two minutes apart with a minimum altitude separation of 1,000 feet. (The rendezvous track
should be at least 50 NM long for two sections, and adjusted by planners for more than two sections.)
      18.7.1. Aircrew Procedures. The first section decreases airspeed to 250 KCAS two minutes past the
      SRP. The last aircraft in the first section will be Master for the rendezvous. The rejoining section(s)
      flies the same track as the first section and executes a chase-type rendezvous. When the rejoining sec-
      tion is approaching position based on TCAS, A/A TACAN, WX radar, or other means, section lead
      will direct a change to the first section’s SKE frequency and master slot IAW flight manual proce-
      dures. If the rejoining section is unable to maintain formation position visually, they must obtain alti-
      tude separation within the section prior to changing SKE frequency and master slot. Follower aircraft
      will stack up 500' above section lead. For example, the first section is at 13,000 and the second section
      arrives at the SRP at 14,000 but is unable to establish visual formation procedures. Rejoining section
      lead will maintain 14,000 and coordinate with ATC for a block altitude. Follower aircraft will climb
      to 14,500, 15,000, 15,500… before they switch SKE frequency and master slot. When all SKE sys-
      tems are synchronized, section lead will positively identify the last aircraft of the preceding section
      and continue to close to en route spacing. The joining section slows to 250 KCAS as necessary to sta-
      bilize in position. Serial lead will be positively identified with SKE and an FCI check will be accom-
      plished prior to flying co-altitude in IMC. After established in the proper position, the second section
      descends to the formation altitude on section lead's FCI signal.
      18.7.2. Ensure aircraft do not have duplicate slot numbers. Join only one section to the formation at a
      time.

18.8. Formation Air Refueling Procedures.
      18.8.1. Briefing. The lead pilot briefs all PICs within the receiver cell. This briefing will be in suffi-
      cient detail to cover all phases of cell operations. Reference AFTTP 3-3.35A, chapter 5 for additional
      information.
      18.8.2. Aircraft will have operable SKE and radar systems for formation air refueling flights. It is the
      intent of this chapter that these systems be fully operational during FAR operations. However, when
      operational mission requirements dictate, this decision will be left to the mission commander.
      18.8.3. SKE will be left on throughout refueling.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              217


   18.8.4. A 180 degree turn on track with multiple receivers will be accomplished with all receivers
   established in a single in-line formation with 1000 feet vertical separation between the receivers and
   the lowest tanker and at least two nautical miles in-trail of the lead tanker.
NOTE: Transitioning to an in-line formation behind T1 will be initiated with all receivers in their respec-
tive post A/R positions.
   EXCEPTION: For 3-on-1 or 2-on-1 only, with prior permission from the tanker, a receiver in contact
   may remain in the contact position during the turn. The other receivers will maintain the current alti-
   tude and move from either awaiting A/R or post A/R to the in-trail position for the duration of the 180
   degree turn. The in trail aircraft will return to either awaiting A/R or post A/R, whichever is appropri-
   ate, once the course reversal is complete (tanker is wings level, less than 30 degree intercept heading
   to track). Before maneuvering, the receiver in the contact/pre-contact position will remain in the con-
   tact/pre-contact position until the other receiver is reestablished in the awaiting A/R or post A/R posi-
   tion.
   18.8.5. Emergency Actions:
       18.8.5.1. Breakaway. Follow procedures in IAW TO 1-1C-1-35. When separation between
       receiver and tanker has been effected, the receiver pilot advises the tanker "WELL CLEAR" and
       states altitude passing. When the situation has stabilized, coordinate clearance back to precontact.
       Restrict all breakaways to 500’ below individual tanker’s altitude.

                                                Chapter 19

                                                AIRDROP

19.1. General. Aircrews will follow guidance in TO 1C-17A-1-4 and AFTTP 3-3.35A for airdrop proce-
dures, except as noted in this chapter, and Chapter 18.
NOTE: Unless used in conjunction with drop execution, avoid use of the word GREEN after the Slow-
down Checklist and until completion of the Post Drop checklist. "GREEN LIGHT" will be seen or heard
by the loadmaster for all drops.
      19.1.1. NVG Airdrop Procedures. Qualified NVG airdrop pilots are authorized to perform normal
      night operations IAW this chapter and Chapter 16 and Chapter 18 of this regulation. Airdrops may
      be accomplished on drop zones lit IAW AFI 13-217 lighting patterns (covert and overt) while wearing
      NVGs, to include unmarked drop zones.
         19.1.1.1. Loadmasters will use NVGs during airdrops if the mission dictates. Loadmasters are
         authorized to perform equipment airdrops with minimum lighting. Use NVGs as necessary to
         assist with operations and keep cargo area lighting to a minimum. During static line personnel
         operations, use of NVGs in the cargo compartment is not authorized; however, use of NVGs on
         the flight deck is authorized.
         19.1.1.2. Cargo Compartment Lighting. After the Combat Entry Checklist, all cargo compartment
         lighting will be switched to red/NVIS lights. Blacked out (no-light) operations in the cargo com-
         partment are not authorized. Loadmasters will carefully consider cargo compartment lighting
         intensity prior to opening ramp and door to minimize interference with formation wingmen’s
         NVG vision.

19.2. Airdrop Equipment.
      19.2.1. Airdrop Kits. The loadmaster will maintain an airdrop kit and will ensure enough equipment
      is included to satisfy load or mission requirements. Minimum contents of the airdrop kit will include
      cloth-backed pressure sensitive tape, 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord, type III nylon cord, # 5 cord, and
      inch cotton webbing.
      19.2.2. Safety Equipment.
         19.2.2.1. Personnel performing duties required to be mobile in the cargo compartment during air-
         drop, low level operations, or threat environments will wear protective headgear (except personnel
         performing water jumps). All other personnel in the cargo compartment will be seated with seat
         belts fastened. During paratroop missions, loadmasters will lower their helmet visor before open-
         ing the troop doors and keep them lowered until the troop doors are closed.
         19.2.2.2. All occupants of the cargo compartment will either wear a parachute or an attached
         restraint harness, or be seated with a seat belt fastened before a troop door and/or the cargo door
         and ramp is opened. When a troop door(s) or the door/ramp is open and the aircraft is below 800
         feet AGL or above 14,000 feet MSL, loadmaster(s) will wear a restraint harness when performing
         airdrop duties. For operations over water, when parachute(s) are required, LPU(s) will be worn.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                219


       EXCEPTION For static line jumps, static lines are attached to anchor cables before troop door(s)
       are opened. Jumpers exiting on subsequent passes may stand and hook up with door(s) opened if
       they are forward of FS 1027.
           19.2.2.2.1. The restraint harness will be fitted and adjusted prior to flight. The lifeline will be
           18 feet 6 inches long. After the lifeline has been adjusted, disconnect the hook, roll and secure
           the lifeline, and stow on the restraint harness.
WARNING: Except for an actual contingency, towed trooper, or emergency that threatens the surviv-
ability of the aircraft and crew, the restraint harness will not be disconnected or lengthened to a point that
would allow the loadmaster to fall outside the aircraft.
           19.2.2.2.2. Prior to opening troop door(s) and/or the ramp/door in-flight (or for airdrops that
           require the loadmaster to be positioned at the aft loadmaster station), attach the restraint har-
           ness at FS 1188 and adjust the life line as follows:
               19.2.2.2.2.1. Troop door airdrop operations: Adjust to allow mobility only to the troop
               door(s) and air deflector controls.
               19.2.2.2.2.2. Cargo Door and airdrop operation: Adjust to allow mobility to FS 1403.
       19.2.2.3. Three additional parachutes, not including those required for aircrew, will be aboard the
       aircraft for training missions performing personnel airdrops. Two will be available for Army
       safety personnel use. User safety personnel will provide their own parachutes for contingency
       missions.

19.3. Airdrop Load Information.
   19.3.1. The loadmaster will complete the Joint Airdrop Inspection Records (applicable DD Form
   1748) before takeoff and verify the accuracy of cargo and troop documentation (see AFI 11-231,
   Computed Air Release Point Procedures, and AFJI 13-210, for specifics). The loadmaster will reject
   loads with inaccurate or unavailable weights, or loads hazardous to flight. If inflight rigging is
   required, the loadmaster will use the applicable DD Form 1748 as a checklist to ensure all items are
   completed.
NOTE: Equipment not rigged IAW 13C-series TOs or Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) 350
series manuals, requires a waiver from MAJCOM tactics.
       19.3.1.1. If airdrop loads and airland cargo are carried at the same time, refer to the restrictions
       listed in Table 19.1. These restrictions are designed to prevent airland loads from interfering with
       airdrop rigging equipment.

NOTES:
             1. Personnel airdrops may be performed with only one troop door configured for airdrop.
             2. Personnel seated adjacent to heavy equipment platforms/CDS containers will have an
                operational seat belt. Ensure all floor loaded rucksacks are secured.
             3. Combination airdrop of heavy equipment and CDS will not be accomplished on the same
                aircraft.
WARNING: Static line personnel airdrops over the ramp are prohibited.
      19.3.2. Identification of Airdrop Items. It may be necessary to identify items that are not dropped or
      land off the DZ in unsecured areas. Identify supplies or equipment by the following class numbering
      system:
         19.3.2.1. Class I - Subsistence.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                              221


      19.3.2.2. Class II - Individual equipment.
      19.3.2.3. Class III - POL.
      19.3.2.4. Class IV - Construction materials.
      19.3.2.5. Class V - Ammunition (include the type).
      19.3.2.6. Class VI - Personal demand items.
      19.3.2.7. Class VII - Major end items. (Vehicles, Howitzers, etc.)
      19.3.2.8. Class VIII - Medical supplies.
      19.3.2.9. Class IX - Repair parts.
      19.3.2.10. Class X - Non-military programs. (i.e. agricultural supplies).
      19.3.2.11. Red - ammunition and weapons.
      19.3.2.12. Blue - fuel and lubricants.
      19.3.2.13. Green - rations and water.
      19.3.2.14. Yellow - communications equipment.
      19.3.2.15. White (or red cross on white background)- medical supplies.
      19.3.2.16. Black and white stripes - mail.

19.4. Required Figures of Merit (FOMs).
   19.4.1. In IMC, lead requires a MC FOM of 3 or better to descend from minimum IFR en route alti-
   tude to IMC drop altitude. IMC airdrop requires a MC FOM of 3 or better to drop using MC guidance.
   For SKE airdrops, the wingmen may descend to IMC drop altitude and drop off the SKE timer regard-
   less of MC FOM. Aircrews are authorized to complete airdrops with a FOM greater than 3 provided
   they can visually ensure the load will land on the DZ.

19.5. Notice To Airmen Requirements.
   19.5.1. Airdrop Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). For the airdrop portion of all SKE missions in uncon-
   trolled airspace, the mission command unit will comply with the current Federal Aviation Administra-
   tion (FAA) Exemption 4371. A Letter of Agreement between local ATC and the military is required
   when operating under this exemption. Also, provide a NOTAM to the FAA Flight Service Station
   nearest the objective area at least 48 hours in advance of the intended activity, regardless of actual or
   forecast weather. NOTAM information will include:
      19.5.1.1. Name of the nearest city or town and state.
      19.5.1.2. Date and time period of intended activity.
      19.5.1.3. Number and type of aircraft.
      19.5.1.4. Altitudes.
      19.5.1.5. IFR Drop Corridor Ingress and Egress points of the route segment expressed in radial
      and DME from a VORTAC.
222                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


19.6. IMC Drop Altitude. Plan minimum IMC drop altitude at 500 feet above the highest obstruction to
flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet plus one contour interval above
the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3 nautical miles either side of the run-in
centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point or as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.
WARNING: Drop zone surveys do not assure terrain and obstruction clearance. The responsibility is
incumbent upon planners and aircrew through thorough mission planning and chart updating.
NOTE: Altitudes on DZ run-in may be segmented to allow for lowest possible run-in/drop altitude. Once
the limiting obstruction (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation) is visually identified and
the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may descend to the next segment altitude, if lower.

19.7. IMC Drop Profile. See Figure 19.1.

Figure 19.1. IMC Drop Profile.




      19.7.1. IFR Drop Corridor. Defined in FAR Exemption 4371, the IFR Drop Corridor is the corridor
      where aircraft may operate below IFR en route altitude. The beginning of the corridor, the IFR Drop
      Corridor Ingress Point, is a maximum of 40 miles from the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point
      (co-located with the DZ Exit Point). Plan segmented corridor altitudes not lower than 500 feet above
      the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 feet
      plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is higher, within 3
      nautical miles of centerline.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               223


  19.7.2. DZ Entry Point. A fixed point in the IFR Drop Corridor where an aircraft or formation may
  safely begin descent from IFR en route altitude or a segmented altitude to IMC drop altitude. Forma-
  tion descent will not begin until the last aircraft is at or past the DZ entry point.
  19.7.3. Earliest Descent Point (EDP). Earliest point in the IFR Drop Corridor where the formation
  lead may descend the entire formation to IMC drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance for the
  entire formation. Computed by subtracting formation length (e.g., a 4-ship is 2 NMs long) from the
  computed DZ entry point. A minimum of 6 NM stabilization point is recommended in IMC.
  19.7.4. IMC Stabilization Point. The point after the DZ entry point where the lead aircraft will plan to
  be stabilized at IMC drop altitude and airspeed (normally 6NM from the PI).
  19.7.5. Latest Descent Point (LDP). Latest possible point in the IFR corridor where formation lead
  may begin descent to IMC drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance for the entire formation.
  This is the latest point that ensures all aircraft in the formation are stabilized on altitude and airspeed.
  19.7.6. DZ Exit Point. A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline where each aircraft will
  be at minimum IFR en route altitude. Calculate the exit point based upon three-engine performance at
  airdrop gross weight. This point will be a minimum of 4 NMs track distance from the trailing edge of
  the DZ. Also referred to as the IFR Drop Corridor Egress Point.
224                                            AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


Table 19.2. IMC Drop Profile Calculation.
A DZ Exit Point. Compute this distance as 1 minute at 160 KCAS + climb at        Write Here
  1000 FPM or as briefed (no greater than 3 engine climb performance). Climb
  at least 500 FPM or as required by terrain/obstructions. Cannot be less than 4
  NM.
      Example: (160 KCAS/60 min/hr)+(160 KCAS/60 min/hr x 500ft/1000 VVI) =
      2.7 + (2.7 x .5) = 4.1 NM
B DZ Length (Total DZ Length-Leading edge to PI Distance/2025 yd/NM)
      Example: (1688-550)/2025 = .6 NM
C IFR Drop Corridor Entry Point. Computed by subtracting distances A and
  B above from 40 NM.
      Example: (40 NM - A - B) 40 - 4.1 - .6 = 35.3 NM
D IMC Stabilization Point. Recommended at least 6 NM from the PI, the
  mission commander may extend this distance.
      Example: 6 NM
E Slowdown from 160 KCAS to Drop Speed.
      Example 160 to 145 KCAS = .7 NM (See attached slowdown distance table)
F     Descent from IFR en route to IFR drop altitude.
      Example Descent from 2000’ to 1000’ MSL = 2.7 NM (@ 160 GS and 1000
      FPM see attached distance table)
G Formation Length (3-ship elements, no ghosts)
      2-ship .7 NM 3-ship 1.3 NM 4-ship 2.0 NM
             5-ship 2.6 NM 6-ship 3.3 NM
      Example: 3-ship 1.3 NM
H DZ Entry Point. To extract this distance compute the slowdown point for the
  last aircraft and subtract the initial deceleration distance, or add D + E + F+G
  above.
      Example (D+E+F+G) 6 + .7 +2.7 +1.3= 10.7 NM
      Verify the result is not greater than the IFR Drop Corridor Entry Point.
I     Minimum IFR Drop Altitude.
      Example: 716 +500 = 1216’
J     Planned Drop Altitude. Highest point on DZ plus AGL drop altitude. Will
      not be less than IFR Drop Altitude.
      Example: 289 + 800 = 1089’ (use higher of min IFR and planned drop alt) =
      1216’ (Min IFR) (Not Shown)
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                          225


K Initial Slowdown Distance. Distance needed to slow from en route airspeed
  to 160 KCAS* (see attached table)
    Example 240 KCAS to 160 KCAS = 4.7
L Slowdown Distance. Total distance from initial slowdown to PI. Item K +
  Item F + Item E + Item D
    Example (from 240 KCAS to drop airspeed, 2000’ to 1216’) 4.7 + 2.7 +.7 + 6
    = 14.1 NM

NOTES:
A: 1 Min @ 160 + Climb to IFR Alt @ 1000 fpm (Table 19.2. A).
B: DZ Length = (Total DZ Length - Leading Edge to PI).
C: 40 - (A+B).
D: IMC Stabilization Point.
E: Slow from 160 to Drop Speed (Table 19.2. C).
F: Descent to Drop Altitude (Table 19.2. B).
G: Formation Length.
H: DZ Entry Point (D+E+F+G).
I: IFR Drop Altitude.
J: Planned Drop Altitude (No Lower than IFR Drop Altitude).
K: Initial Slowdown Distance (Table 19.2. A).
L: Slowdown Distance (Items K + F + E + D).
The C-17 mission computer calculates slowdown based on a deceleration of .05 G. To calculate this dis-
tance use the following formula:
(GS1 - GS2) * (GS1 + GS2)
          6825
Where GS1 = Starting Ground Speed and GS2 = Ending Ground Speed e.g., 240 kts starting speed with
160 kts ending speed. See Table 19.2., Table 16.5., Table 16.6. for the values already computed.
For time computations, as a rule of thumb, the C-17 slows at approximately 1 knot per second. 6,825 feet
is an example shown for 3-ship SKE 800’ AGL LVAD at North Field.

19.8. Dual Row. Rigging for the 463L training pallets will be IAW the approved AMC interim rigging
guide. Only AF aerial delivery units are authorized to rig using this guide. This will be an interim guide
until appropriate rigging FM/TOs are released.
      19.8.1. Minimum drop zone requirements for unilateral dual row training loads. The minimum sized
      drop zone for unilateral training loads is 1600 yds x 400 yds. Increase the minimum sized DZ for
      night, IMC and formation IAW AFI 13-217 for heavy equipment factors. PI placement will be 300
      yards (day or night) from the leading edge of the drop zone for AF unilateral training drops of 463L
      pallets using either the 2 or 3 pallet configuration.

19.9. High Altitude Airdrop Operations.
      19.9.1. Reference TO 1C-17A-1-4 for pre-breathing requirements and restrictions. Reference AFTTP
      3-3.35A chapter 8 for additional information.
            19.9.1.1. Maintain cabin pressure at or below 10,000 feet until the Pre-Slowdown Checklist (time
            for check may have to be adjusted) and until pre-breathing is complete. De-pressurization will not
            exceed 3,000 feet per minute. Slower rates are recommended if time allows. Ensure zero pressure
            differential before clearing doors to be opened.
            19.9.1.2. Physiological Technician (PT) Requirements. PTs will support high altitude airdrop
            missions whenever requested by the mission frag order, the aircrew, or the user. A minimum of 2
            PTs will be on all airdrops conducted at 18,000 feet MSL or above, or if a waiver is granted to
            exceed exposure limitations of AFTTP 3-3.35A Table 8.3
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             229


   19.9.2. The mission computer determines the HARP for all high altitude drops. A two-stage model is
   used to calculate wind drift for HARP airdrops. The total wind drift is obtained by adding the drift
   encountered in the free fall/high velocity stage to that from the high drag/deployed stage. Drift due to
   wind is calculated as the product of the average wind and the total time of fall divided by a constant
   for each stage. The HARP uses ballistic wind and deployed wind. Both values must be calculated and
   entered by the pilot. For high altitude drops above FL200, where wind direction can vary greatly from
   the surface to drop altitude, a vectorial average should be used in lieu of a simple arithmetic average.
   Small errors in wind calculations can produce very large errors in drop accuracy. A vectorial average
   will correctly cancel opposing wind velocities (i.e., 90 vs. 270 deg), and give greater weight to direc-
   tions with stronger winds. A vectorial average can be performed using a scientific calculator (or lap-
   top computer) via the following method:


S1*cosine D1       S1*sine D1             S1 = wind speed at altitude #1
S2*cosine D2       S2*sine D2             D1 = wind direction at altitude #1
      ↓                  ↓                X = average of all cosine values
S8*cosine D8       S8*sine D8             Y = average of all sine values
      ↓                  ↓

X=Avg of above Y= Avg of above

α = arctangent (     )



Average Speed =


Average wind direction = 90 – α (for negative X); 270 – a (for positive X)
NOTE: If using Microsoft Excel for trigonometry functions, convert all angles from degrees to radians.
Tab data is adequate for Sine/Cosine functions, but inadequate for Arctangent functions.
NOTE: The symbol for arctangent on most calculators is Tan-1.

19.10. En Route. Pilots are ultimately responsible for en route navigation and time control. Time control
to the objective area should be accomplished primarily by varying airspeed with secondary methods of
flying alternate legs, cutting corners, or extending legs.
   19.10.1. Loadmasters will make a visual inspection of the cargo compartment prior to the initiation of
   the Pre-Slowdown Checklist to ensure that nothing has fallen between or aft of the airdrop load(s) as
   a result of takeoff or evasive maneuvering. A visual inspection of each extraction system, to include
   the security of recovery parachutes, will also be accomplished.

      19.10.2. All primary crewmembers will be in their respective crew positions and on interphone from
      the combat entry point until completion of the combat exit checklist unless crew duties require other-
      wise. Warnings and advisories are normally provided to the aircrew by the mission computer.
      19.10.3. Normally, depart the IP on course, using a drift-corrected heading to the CARP. If the threat
      situation dictates, terrain masking procedures may be required until stabilized on drop altitude.
         19.10.3.1. In IMC, do not initiate descent from the minimum IFR en route altitude to IMC drop
         altitude until all aircraft in the element are inside the DZ entry point, on course, with element
         lead’s position positively known.
      19.10.4. The slowdown through escape sequence is depicted in Figure 19.2. A slowdown maneuver
      executed late in the run-in sequence can reduce the time an aircraft is vulnerable at a slow airspeed
      and high altitude in a hostile environment. However, accomplish slowdowns early enough to ensure
      safe drop execution.

NOTE: For a descending slowdown, descend at 160 KCAS with half flaps. When reaching drop altitude,
select final flaps and slow to drop airspeed.

19.11. Navigation to the CARP. Accurately positioning the aircraft to the release point is the most crit-
ical phase of the airdrop mission. The primary method for navigating to the CARP is using a MC-calcu-
232                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


lated release solution updated with GPS. Alternate methods (using radar beacons, SKE, GRADS, VIRS,
pilot-directed visual releases) are available, provided ground forces are willing to accept less airdrop
accuracy.
      19.11.1. The mission computer determines the release point based on desired point of impact, desired
      airspeed/altitude, payload and parachute information, and atmospheric data entered for the airdrop.
      The computed location is then provided to the flight plan. For active flight plan airdrops, warning cues
      are normally controlled according to the Time To Go (TTG) indicated on the Airdrop Progress Page.
      Inside of one minute, the warning cues are controlled according to the TTG indicated by the selected
      airdrop timer. The PF is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is positioned at the release point at green
      light and for maintaining drift-corrected track through red light. The PNF is responsible for ensuring
      a count down to green light, the green light call, and the red light call are given.
      19.11.2. Crew coordination is of the utmost importance to ensure all advisories and checklists are
      completed, proper DZ line-up is maintained, the point-of-impact (PI) is identified (if VMC), and time
      over target (TOT) is within established tolerances.

19.12. GPS Airdrop. GPS airdrops rely on high precision coordinates to accurately position the aircraft
at the CARP and is the preferred method for C-17 airdrop. GPS airdrop accuracy is not affected by night
or IMC conditions. When visual references are available, crews will ensure the airdrop load will impact
the DZ or call a no drop. A preflight drop box will be computed and updated on the route as needed. Dur-
ing the "slowdown checklist", the following items must be confirmed if planning to drop in IMC:
      19.12.1. At least one GPS receiver will be updating with no "RAIM alert" messages present.
      19.12.2. No "degraded NAV ACC" messages will be present.

19.13. Pilot-Initiated Airdrops. Non SOLL-II crews require MAJCOM/A3/DO approval before accom-
plishing actual pilot directed airdrops or GRADS.
EXCEPTION: Pilot directed airdrops may be accomplished for training on dry passes only.

Section 20A—General Information

20.1. Mission.
   20.1.1. This chapter applies to C-17 aircrews, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrews and all management
   levels concerned with operations of the C-17 aircraft. All operators involved in Aeromedical Evacua-
   tion missions on C-17 aircraft will use this AFI.
   20.1.2. C-17 aircraft may be used for AE transport of ill or injured DoD members and their depen-
   dents. These AE missions may be directed at any time by C2 agencies. AE personnel will utilize the
   procedures in applicable AFI/H 11-XXX and 41-XXX series, in conjunction with this publication, to
   accomplish the AE mission.

Section 20B—AE Command and Control

20.2. Operational Control and Reporting of Aeromedical Evacuation Forces.
   20.2.1. HQ AMC is lead command for Aeromedical Evacuation. HQ AMC Directorate of Operations
   (AMC/A3) is the executive agent for operational AE missions.
   20.2.2. Command and control of Aeromedical Evacuation missions is the same as other airlift mis-
   sions.
   20.2.3. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the safety of the flight crew, and all patients and passen-
   gers. The Medical Crew Director (MCD) is responsible for providing medical care to the patients. In
   matters concerning flight safety, decisions of the PIC are final; in matters of patient care, decisions of
   the MCD are final.
   20.2.4. The MCD will advise the PIC on patient's condition or use of medical equipment which may
   affect aircraft operations.
   20.2.5. HQ AMC Command Surgeon (AMC/SG) is responsible for providing clinical standards and
   procedures concerning the treatment of patients in-flight.
   20.2.6. The Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Officer (AEOO), if available, is responsible for
   supervising flight line execution of AE missions. The MCD is directly responsible for the safety and
   medical well being of patients on the aircraft and coordinates enplaning and deplaning procedures
   with the AEOO and supporting agencies.

20.3. Alerting Procedures.
   20.3.1. At all locations AMC C2 agency will alert the PIC who will alert the MCD. The MCD will
   alert the medical crew. The goal is to link the primary aircraft commander, local AMC C2 agency and
   MCD before mission execution.
   20.3.2. When the AE crew is staged separate from the front-end crew, the MCD will contact AMC
   local C2 agency and establish alert, show time, etc. with the C2 agency. The MCD will make every
   effort to communicate with the front-end crew any mission irregularities prior to crew rest. Utilize
234                                              AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      local AMC C2 agency to leave messages for non-emergency. Crew rest will be based on scheduled
      launch time. Do not violate crew rest.
      20.3.3. The local AMC C2 agency will provide PIC/MCD AE mission information when he/she
      checks on mission status. Local C2 agency will be the link between the AE crews and the PIC, thus
      permitting mission status updates to both parties without interruption of crew rest.
      20.3.4. AE mission requirements can change depending on clinical status of patient(s) and aircraft
      availability. There will be occasions when aircraft cannot depart (i.e. MX problems) or emergency
      patient movement that may separate an AE crew from the front-end crew. The MCD is responsible for
      communicating these changes with the PIC and local AMC C2 agency to de-conflict problems.

20.4. Pilot In Command Responsibilities.
      20.4.1. Establish communication link with the MCD during pre-mission planning and throughout the
      mission.
      20.4.2. Brief AE crew on the mission, flight plan, flight profile, and current threat (as applicable).
      20.4.3. The PIC will fully integrate front-end and Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM)
      into single crew through the entire mission to include en route transportation, dining, billeting, etc.
      20.4.4. Coordinate with MCD and C2 agencies/FM for cabin altitude/flight restrictions based on
      patient requirements.
      20.4.5. For missions with combined cargo and patients, coordinate with the MCD for loading, posi-
      tioning, egress considerations.
      20.4.6. Comply with hazardous cargo/passenger restrictions in AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement.
      20.4.7. Advise AECMs of intentions to start engines, taxi, itinerary changes, in-flight difficulties, and
      additional responsibilities of the flight crew.
      20.4.8. Transmit load messages and radio transmissions to tasking AE C2 agency as requested by the
      MCD.
      20.4.9. Brief the MCD on additional responsibilities of the flight crew.

20.5. Loadmaster Responsibilities.
      20.5.1. Assist the AE crew with aircraft systems.
      20.5.2. Coordinate emergency evacuation plan with the MCD.
      20.5.3. Operate aircraft systems, i.e., doors, ramps, emergency exits, etc.
      20.5.4. Assist the AE crew as necessary, providing such assistance does not interfere with primary
      duties.
      20.5.5. Operate galley and prepare food and beverages for food service provided to patients by
      AECMs.
      20.5.6. Assist with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                               235


20.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Responsibilities.
   20.6.1. Responsible for patient clinical care activities including loading, positioning, and off-loading.
   20.6.2. Assist Loadmaster/maintenance crew with aircraft configuration for AE operations.
   20.6.3. Install and remove medical equipment/supplies.
   20.6.4. Assist the Loadmaster with observation and care of passengers when it does not interfere with
   primary duties.
   20.6.5. The MCD or designated AECM should be on aircraft inter-phone (headset) for all phases of
   flight, and will be on aircraft inter-phone during critical phases of flight to include take-off and land-
   ing.

Section 20C—Aeromedical Evacuation Airlift Operations

20.7. Ground Operations.
   20.7.1. Engines should be shut down during enplaning and deplaning of patients. EXCEPTION:
   ERO procedures as outlined in paragraph 20.14.

20.8. Refueling Operations.
   20.8.1. Refueling normally begins after deplaning patients are off the aircraft and prior to enplaning
   that station's patients. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor (CSS) shall ensure aircrew mem-
   bers and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent Servicing (CS) per AFI 32-2001, The Fire Pro-
   tection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and TO 00-25-172.
   20.8.2. CS may be accomplished with patients onboard provided:
   20.8.3. The CSS coordinates with all personnel involved prior to beginning concurrent operations.
   20.8.4. Prior to starting concurrent servicing, the total number of patients, passengers, and crew on
   board the aircraft will be given to the fire department.
   20.8.5. Loading ramps/stairs are in place for immediate use and exits (excluding the overhead escape
   hatches) are opened for egress.
   20.8.6. At least two AECMs (one must be a Flight Nurse [FN]) remain onboard to observe patients
   and assist patients in the event of an egress.
   20.8.7. If cabin lights, electrical power to operate medical equipment and aircraft interphone are
   operating prior to refueling, use may be continued during servicing operations. Only those systems,
   switches or electrical circuits needed to operate equipment to sustain life, may be turned on and used
   during refueling.
   20.8.8. Patients and passengers will not enter or exit the aircraft during servicing. Crewmembers may
   enter or exit the aircraft only when performing essential duties associated with the concurrent servic-
   ing operation.
   20.8.9. Activities around the aircraft will be kept to a minimum during the refueling process. Onload/
   offload patient and passenger baggage prior to or after refueling.
   20.8.10. Do not use the on board toilet facilities during servicing.
236                                               AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      20.8.11. When the aircrew is at the aircraft, the PIC is responsible for all aspects of aircraft operations
      and shall inform the CSS how aircrew members will participate in passenger evacuation/safety.

20.9. Aircraft Configuration.
      20.9.1. On designated ARM and operational AE missions, configure the aircraft during pre-flight, per
      TO 1C-17A-9 and AFI 11-2C-17V3, Addenda A.
      20.9.2. Roller conveyers will be stowed, unless required for comfort/baggage pallets. Rollers on the
      ramp will be stowed during patient onloading and offloading operations.
      20.9.3. Enplaning litter patients through the crew entrance door is authorized.
      20.9.4. The Patient Support Pallet (PSP) is a pallet-based system of seat and litter accommodation.
      The PSP is authorized for use on the C-17.
      20.9.5. The PSP will be transported to the aircraft by aerial port personnel, positioned and secured on
      the aircraft by the Loadmaster and configured by the AE crew.
      20.9.6. Loading the patient support pallet, medical equipment, and airline seats should be accom-
      plished before the flight crew leaves the aircraft or prior to the crew entering Crew Rest.
      20.9.7. PSP configuration will be determined by patient requirements. Each seat has storage capacity
      for required prepositioned life support (EPOS and life vest).
      20.9.8. Extenders and spacers will be used with the PSP(s) to mitigate trip hazards created by uneven
      surfaces between the PSP(s) and/or the C-17 integral stanchions.
      20.9.9. Slight forward-aft pallet movement may occur as the pallet shifts against the pallet lock. To
      prevent this occurrence, secure the PSP with a cargo tie-down strap.
      20.9.10. Therapeutic oxygen is an integral system on the C-17 aircraft.
      20.9.11. In the event of an emergency, patients and passengers will use the Passenger Oxygen Kit
      (POK) or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS).
      20.9.12. AECMs will have an oxygen source available. AECMs normally use an MA-1 portable oxy-
      gen bottle, or equivalent. EPOS or EEBDs can be used as an alternate oxygen source if the preplanned
      flight level is below FL 350. NOTE: If a pressure demand regulator is used, the oxygen supply will be
      turned off when the personal oxygen equipment is removed.
      20.9.13. Do not secure aircraft or medical equipment adjacent to an emergency exit in a manner that
      will prevent or impede egress.
      20.9.14. Life Preservers. Use the Adult/Child life preserver for patients.

20.10. Passengers and Cargo.
      20.10.1. The PIC, with the concurrence of the MCD, will ensure maximum aircraft utilization for
      passengers and cargo. Passenger restrictions based upon patient considerations will be identified when
      seats are released. The PIC will advise the appropriate C2 agency of the number seats available for
      passengers.
      20.10.2. Cargo and passengers may be carried with patients unless a clear detriment to the health and
      well being of the patient or passengers can be demonstrated. The decision will be made by the MCD,
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                            237


   considering the need for maximum utilization of the aircraft. Conflicts will be referred to the respec-
   tive tasking AE command element for a decision. Litters will be positioned forward of cargo pallets.
   EXCEPTION: If cargo is in place, and the PIC and MCD agree, patients may be transported aft of the
   cargo. The MCD and Loadmaster will ensure patient egress is not affected by mixed cargo/patient
   loads.
   20.10.3. Cargo will not be bumped except in unusual/abnormal cases, and only after the MCD has
   coordinated with the PIC and notified the tasking AE command element.
   20.10.4. Do not move ambulatory patients to litters in order to provide seating for additional patients
   or passengers.
   20.10.5. For patient comfort and to permit inflight rest for patients use the following for missions
   over 4 hours in duration:
      20.10.5.1. .Minimum of 2 litters must be available for ambulatory patients.
      20.10.5.2. One seat must be reserved for every 3 litter patients.
   20.10.6. An emergency litter will be set up on all AE missions.
   20.10.7. Patient Therapeutic Liquid Oxygen (PT LOX) may be transported for positioning and depo-
   sitioning of Operational/contingency support AE Missions.
   20.10.8. A maximum of 25 PT LOX serviced units may be transported simultaneously without
   Hazmat certification. Processing through aerial port is not required. If shipping more than six PT LOX
   containers as cargo, do not cover the containers with plastic. This will prevent potential accumulation
   of high oxygen concentration levels. WARNING: Ensure the cargo floor is free from any oil or petro-
   leum products.
   20.10.9. Hazardous cargo will not normally be transported aboard AE missions.
   20.10.10. AE Movement of Contaminated/Contagious Personnel. Potentially contaminated patients
   must be decontaminated before entering the AE system. However, in extreme circumstances, the
   AMC/CC is the policy waiver authority for movement of contaminated/contagious casualties/person-
   nel. If a waiver is approved, AMC will provide the capability to move a small number of contami-
   nated/contagious casualties (a combination of approximately 50, with a maximum of 20 contagious
   personnel). AMC will equip AE crew operating in designated high-threat areas with the required
   equipment/supplies to carry out this mission.

20.11. Crash/Fire/Rescue.
   20.11.1. Aircraft carrying patient(s) will be provided CFR protection per TO 00-25-172. Stand-by
   CFR vehicle is not necessary during normal operations however, a CFR vehicle will be available upon
   request. The flight crew will coordinate CFR requirements.
   20.11.2. At non-AMC bases, non-U.S. military bases, and civilian airfields, the controlling agency
   will coordinate the CFR coverage, as necessary. The request for CFR vehicle coverage may be denied.
   This will not prevent refueling operations from occurring.
238                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


20.12. AE Call Sign/Use of Priority Clearance.
      20.12.1. AIREVAC Priority. The PIC may request AIREVAC priority for preferential ATC handling
      if a delay will affect a patient’s well being. Aircraft commanders will request priority handling if AE
      missions are experiencing long delays during takeoff or landing phases, which will affect a patient’s
      condition.

20.13. Not Used.

Section 20D—Contingency Operations

20.14. ERO Procedures.
      20.14.1. ERO procedures are outlined in AFI11-2AE Volume 3. ERO procedures for loading patients
      are authorized for contingency operations or when AE mission requirements dictate minimum ground
      time. ERO procedures can be practiced/trained during ARMs, joint training operations, exercises, etc.
      EROs will not be used in a noncontingency environment unless mission essential.
      20.14.2. The loadmaster will be positioned on the left side, at the foot of the ramp and on headset dur-
      ing actual onload procedures.
      20.14.3. When litter patients are wearing personal gear (i.e. web belts, canteen, helmets, flak vests,
      etc.) and situation requires/permits, remove personal gear from patients and secure on ramp or in a
      designated area.

20.15. Floor Loading Procedures.
      20.15.1. Floor loading of patients is authorized for all contingency operations when a time critical
      environment exists (i.e. non-secure landing zones, areas faced with enemy siege/hostile fire, humani-
      tarian reasons, etc.), and minimum ground time is essential. Floor loading procedures can be prac-
      ticed/trained during aeromedical readiness missions, joint training operations, exercises, etc. The
      cargo/ramp floor will be configured with all rollers stowed (cargo permitting). Reference AFI 11-2AE
      Volume 3 for specific floor loading procedures.
      20.15.2. Maximum altitude for floor loaded patients is flight level 350.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                239

                            EMERGENCY NUCLEAR AIRLIFT (ENAF)

Section 21A—Mission Preparation

21.1. Emergency Nuclear Airlift. Airlift of nuclear weapons may be tasked at any time. The amount of
preparation and assistance required depends entirely on the length of time AMC has to move the weapons.
NOTE: Use of these procedures requires SECDEF approval.

21.2. Conduct of Operations. Crews will be briefed on and receive detailed instructions from a specific
OPLAN or mission directive. If there is a conflict between this regulation and the instructions in an
OPLAN or mission directive, use the OPLAN or mission directive.

21.3. Emergency Nuclear Airlift Standards. In an emergency, the objective is to move the weapons
safely in a short time. Crews are expected to use sound judgment and common sense in what may be a tur-
bulent or tense environment. Comply with as many of the nuclear weapons system safety rules in AFI
11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations, as possible. Pay particular attention to the following areas:
   21.3.1. Nuclear weapons will be handled safely. The most immediate hazard is the high explosive
   that can be set off by shock or heat in most nuclear weapons. Use standard aircraft TO 1C-17A-1-9
   loading procedures. Keep the loading controlled and orderly at all times. Load or handle only one item
   or pallet at a time. Crews may ask shipper or receiver personnel to help, but the overall aircraft loading
   responsibility still belongs to the aircrew. Time permitting, crews should refer to TO 1C-17A-16-1 or
   TO 1C-17A-16-2, section I, II, III, or IV for specific instructions that could help crews during onload
   or offload. Step-by-step use of the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is not necessary.
   21.3.2. Load plan: See AF Form 4114, C-17A Nuclear Floor Plan Worksheet.
       21.3.2.1. If crews are required to move the maximum number of one type of weapon, section VI
       of the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is the best guide to determine where to position the weapons. Use the
       maximum tested figure.
       21.3.2.2. For mixed loads (more than one type of weapon), base the load plan on how many
       weapons can be properly restrained using TO 1C-17A-1-9 criteria. Do not allow weapons to touch
       each other when tied down.
       21.3.2.3. Crews may use the TO 1C-17A-1-9 to compute shoring requirements or section VI of
       the TO 1C-17A-16-1, which shows parking and rolling shoring requirements for each weapon.
       For winching operations, the TO 1C-17A-16-1 is a good guide for positioning approach shoring.
   21.3.3. Use standard TO 1C-17A-1-9 restraint criteria. Crews may use the tiedown patterns in the TO
   1C-17A 16-1, which may exceed TO 1C-17A-1-9 criteria. The tiedown patterns will aid crews in floor
   planning a maximum tested load.
   21.3.4. The route of flight will not violate restrictions in the classified United States Air Force Special
   Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG). Overflying a foreign country with nuclear weapons is an
   extremely sensitive issue, even in an emergency airlift. Comply with the SWOG at all times. If crews
   don’t have access to the SWOG, request a route of flight that complies with the SWOG through com-
   mand and control center (C2 agency) channels. The C2 agency will ensure the route of flight is pro-
240                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      vided to the aircrew by the most expeditious means available. If no route of flight is provided, fly
      normal air traffic control (ATC) routings to the destination. Do not divulge the nature of cargo to any
      enroute ATC facility or country to obtain a specific clearance.
      21.3.5. United States military custody of nuclear weapons is required. Normally, the copilot is the
      courier and maintains custody of the nuclear cargo for the flight. Under certain conditions, the shipper
      may furnish United States military couriers who will retain custody of the weapons in flight.

21.4. Aircrew Selection. All C-17 active duty aircrews may be used for ENAF. Time permitting, AMC
will use a sliding scale of options, which may be one or more of the following:
      21.4.1. Assign Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) loadmasters and/or pilots so as to have one or the
      other on each aircraft.
      21.4.2. Place PNAF pilot and loadmaster teams at the onload bases to assist with the loading and
      flight planning.
      21.4.3. Use non-PNAF crews in a prepared OPLAN scenario with planned, organized loads.
      21.4.4. Use non-PNAF crews in a short notice, bare-base environment with little or no advance prep-
      aration or assistance.
      21.4.5. Use ARC crews with Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) approval.

21.5. Aircrew Requirements.
      21.5.1. Crew complement will be according to the OPLAN or specific mission directive. If not spec-
      ified, use a normal crew complement (basic crew, only one LM required).
      21.5.2. The crew will be armed IAW AFI 11-299.
      21.5.3. If crews are tasked for a mission that has a higher security classification than personnel secu-
      rity clearance, crews will be authorized emergency access to enough information to complete the mis-
      sion. Approval authority rests with a general officer, wing commander, or wing commander
      equivalent and cannot be delegated.

21.6. Aircrew Briefings.
      21.6.1. Crews should be briefed on the following:
         21.6.1.1. Purpose of the mission.
         21.6.1.2. Classification of the mission, cargo, and locations.
         21.6.1.3. Itinerary, including confirmation of prior coordination for hazardous material as
         required by instrument flight rule (IFR) supplement and alternate airfields.
         21.6.1.4. Cargo. TO 11N-20-11 line numbers should be included. Obtain line numbers from the
         fire department prior to loading. TO 11N-20-11 is a classified technical order that assigns an
         unclassified line number to each nuclear weapon.
         21.6.1.5. "No lone zone," two-person concept, and security requirements.
         21.6.1.6. Personnel authorized to sign for nuclear weapons at the destination.
         21.6.1.7. Current intelligence, including threat analysis.
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                                 241


       21.6.1.8. SWOG route of flight restrictions.
       21.6.1.9. Airborne intercept (SWOG).
       21.6.1.10. Jettisoning (SWOG).
       21.6.1.11. Command Disable System (CDS) procedures.
       21.6.1.12. Emergency procedures outlined in paragraph 21.10.

Section 21B—Mission Execution

21.7. General. Use these procedures in addition to the normal operating procedures in the rest of this reg-
ulation.
   21.7.1. Flight Plans. Enter "hazardous cargo" and the mission number in the "other information" sec-
   tion of the flight plan. If crews are carrying inert weapons, trainers, or other items that could be mis-
   taken for actual weapons by crash or rescue personnel in an emergency, enter "inert devices and the
   mission number.
   21.7.2. Radio Calls:
       21.7.2.1. Departure (onload) base. Before commencing the onload, tell the tower to notify the fire
       department the onload is commencing. Prior to engine start, give the controlling agency (ground
       or tower) the parking location and approximate engine start time and announce there is hazardous
       cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is standing by the aircraft for engine start.
       21.7.2.2. Enroute to offload base. At least 30 minutes prior to landing, contact one of the follow-
       ing (in this order): command post, base operations, or control tower. Pass mission number and ver-
       ify that the hazardous cargo information has been received. If the arrival base does not have
       hazardous cargo information, request the following be relayed immediately to the crash or fire
       protection agency and other support agencies as appropriate:
           21.7.2.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
           21.7.2.2.2. Estimated time of arrival (ETA).
           21.7.2.2.3. Department of Transportation (DOT) explosives hazard class or division (nor-
           mally 1.1).
           21.7.2.2.4. Net explosive weight (NEW).
           21.7.2.2.5. Line numbers from TO 11N-20-11 if requested. Obtain line numbers from the
           base fire department or shipper personnel prior to commencing upload at the onload location.
           21.7.2.2.6. A request for isolated parking and security forces to meet the aircraft.

21.8. Custody of Nuclear Cargo. Appoint a commissioned officer to be the courier officer (a copilot or
third pilot is the preferred option). The courier officer is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety,
and delivery of nuclear weapons to authorized receivers.
   21.8.1. Before accepting and loading nuclear weapons, the shipper briefs the crew (at least the PIC,
   courier officer, and primary LM) on the nature and hazards of the cargo. If anyone on the crew does
   not receive the briefing, the PIC will ensure they are briefed the appropriate information before the
   flight. Ask the shipper to point out any specifics issues the crews may need to know when handling the
242                                             AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006


      weapons (i.e. tiedown points, forklift stirrups, command disable system (CDS) procedures, etc). The
      specific procedures in sections II, III, and IV to the TO 1C-17A-16 can also provide helpful informa-
      tion on how to load specific weapons.
      21.8.2. Time permitting, the courier and LM will inspect the cargo before accepting custody. The
      courier should have the shipper verify the integrity of a weapon case and replace any broken seals.
      Crews may be held responsible for damage at the receiving end if crews accept a damaged weapon
      without documentation. Document damage or broken seals on the DD Form 1911, Materiel Courier
      Receipt, prior to signing for the weapon.
      21.8.3. The courier accepts custody of the weapon by signing the DD Form 1911 provided by the
      shipper. Use this form to transfer cargo custody to replacement couriers.
      21.8.4. Release custody of the cargo only to a replacement courier or someone authorized to sign for
      nuclear material. Authorized receivers are identified by the shipper, by message, or through the AMC
      command and control system.
      21.8.5. Time permitting, refer any questions through the 18 AF TACC Command Center to TACC/
      XOON for resolution.

21.9. Security Procedures. The host base is responsible for providing security for the aircraft and the
nuclear cargo. The courier officer (who has custody of the weapons) is the final authority on security mat-
ters; however, crews should follow the advice and procedures of the host security force as much as possi-
ble. If the situation is serious and crews will load and depart quickly, use judgment and dispense with the
formalities. Prior to takeoff, the PIC will ensure through the 18 AF TACC Command Center that security
support is acknowledged for all stations being transited that day.
      21.9.1. Home Station. Time permitting, conduct a thorough visual search of the aircraft for unautho-
      rized explosives or stowaways. Use a bomb detection dog if available. If time is critical, do not delay
      the mission to "sanitize" the aircraft.
      21.9.2. Onload Base. The host base should set up a restricted area, normally with ropes and stan-
      chions, around the aircraft.
         21.9.2.1. Entry Control. Use one entry point to maintain strict control of entry into the area. The
         entry controller will have a roster of all personnel allowed to enter. Use a copy of the flight orders
         for the aircrew. Instruct the entry controller to coordinate with the aircrew courier before allowing
         anyone into the area. EXCEPTION: Allow the weapons convoy to enter the restricted area with-
         out delay.
         21.9.2.2. "No lone zone." Do not allow anyone to be alone in the restricted area or aircraft when
         nuclear weapons are present (either inside the area or aircraft). The purpose of a "no lone zone" is
         to prevent any one person from tampering with a nuclear weapon. The easiest way to enforce a "no
         lone zone" is to always be in pairs inside the restricted area (for example, two aircrew members,
         two shippers, or one aircrew member and one shipper).
      21.9.3. In-flight. Maintain the two-person concept throughout the flight. Do not allow anyone to be
      alone in the cargo compartment, crew rest area, or flight deck.
      21.9.4. Arrival at En Route Base. As soon as the engines are shut down, deploy sufficient armed
      crewmembers around the aircraft to control access to the aircraft. Until the host base security force is
      established, the only personnel authorized near the aircraft are aircrew members and those support
AFI11-2C-17V3_TRAVISAFB_I 20 DECEMBER 2006                                                             243


   personnel necessary to install landing gear pins, ground power, and wheel chocks. Monitor these peo-
   ple at all times. Keep doors closed and be prepared for an immediate departure until the host base
   establishes security.

21.10. Emergency Procedures.
   21.10.1. Security Emergencies. If confronted with a hostile force, crews may use deadly force to pro-
   tect nuclear cargo. To the maximum extent possible crews will resist any attempt by a hostile force to
   capture a nuclear weapon. Consider any attack on an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a
   hijacking attempt, as an attack against the nuclear weapons. The presence of hostages shall not deter
   the taking of immediate, decisive, and effective action, including the use of deadly force, to prevent
   unauthorized access to, removal of, or to recover a nuclear weapon. If a crew comes under attack, take
   the following actions:
      21.10.1.1. Make an immediate takeoff, with the cargo if possible.
      21.10.1.2. If the attack occurs during onloading or offloading, load the weapons as fast as possi-
      ble, even if improper procedures will be used. Ensure effective cargo restraint and take off imme-
      diately.
      21.10.1.3. Some weapons have a CDS that internally destroys the capability of a weapon to
      achieve a significant nuclear yield. The CDS will be used when capture of a weapon is imminent.
      21.10.1.4. Aircrews will not use emergency destruct procedures on nuclear weapons. Emergency
      destruction of weapons by shaped charges requires SECDEF approval and will be accomplished
      by qualified personnel who have the capability to receive, authenticate, and carry out emergency
      destruct orders. When two properly identified shipper or receiver personnel concurrently request
      custody of the cargo for emergency destruct purposes, release the cargo using appropriate custody
      transfer procedures.
   21.10.2. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The LM will identify which cargo is and is not jettisonable
   according to the TO 1C-17A-1. In an emergency, the PIC bears a moral obligation to jettison cargo or
   crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Use the CDS, if applicable, prior to jettison-
   ing or crash-landing. Record the coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe the jettison restrictions
   in the SWOG.
   21.10.3. Landing in Foreign Countries. Be prudent and keep things very low key. If confronted with
   demands to board or inspect the aircraft, refer to the status of United States military aircraft in the
   DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), which states: United States military aircraft are sovereign
   instrumentalities. When cleared to overfly or land in a foreign territory, it is United States policy to
   assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and immunities which customarily are
   accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the con-
   trary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including
   customs and safety inspection); or other exercise or jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft,
   personnel, equipment, or cargo on board. Air Force aircraft commanders will not authorize search,
   seizure, inspection, or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except
   by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically, but
   firmly, refuse any requests to board or inspect, and get help through any available United States chan-
   nel. Flash priority is authorized.

21.11. Maintenance on Aircraft Loaded with Nuclear Cargo.
      21.11.1. Maintenance on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons will not violate safety rules nor-
      mally used with aircraft loaded with conventional explosives. Ensure all maintenance and servicing is
      completed prior to loading nuclear weapons on the aircraft. Do not allow the following maintenance
      to be performed on an aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons:
         21.11.1.1. Use of flame producing or uncontrolled heat-producing items that could increase the
         possibility of a fire .
         21.11.1.2. Repairs on the fuel system, cell, and tank or other maintenance where significant fuel
         spills are likely to result from disconnected lines, ruptured components, etc.
         21.11.1.3. Aircraft will not be jacked. The temporary lifting of one set of landing gear for minor
         maintenance (integral jacking) is not considered jacking.
         21.11.1.4. Do not concurrently refuel, defuel, or service oxygen while loading or offloading
         nuclear weapons. Ensure a fire truck standing by at the aircraft during refueling, defueling, or oxy-
         gen servicing of a nuclear laden aircraft.
      21.11.2. Any maintenance performed on an aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo will be monitored by
      the loadmaster, copilot or crew chief.
