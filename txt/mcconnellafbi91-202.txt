  6.3. AF IMT 2047 coordination.
     6.3.1. Prior to coordinating AF IMT 2047 for new or updated facilities, set up a meeting
     with WSM, Base Fire Department, Security Forces Resource Protection, and MASO. It
     is highly recommended this meeting be attended by all agencies at one time.
        6.3.1.1. Licenses should be developed and coordinated by the unit ADWSR.
        6.3.1.2. Meetings are not required for license renewals provided no requirements
        have changed in terms of the facility, mission, or HC/D of explosives.
     6.3.2. ADWSRs should pre-coordinate AF IMT 2047 with the Wing Weapons Safety
     Staff prior to obtaining commander’s signature and requesting outside agency
     coordination.
        6.3.2.1. Pre-coordinate AF IMT 2047 via electronic means or hand delivery.
     6.3.3. Coordinate final draft of the AF IMT 2047 with Base Fire Department, Security
     Forces Resource Protection, and MASO.
        6.3.3.1. The MASO or designated representative will validate the following
        information in section II:
            6.3.3.1.1. Block C: Nomenclature and NSN or FSC/DODIC. The MASO, or
            designated representative, will ensure that if suitable substitute stock numbers are
            issued to the custodial account(s) at the time of license coordination, asterisks (*)
            are placed at the beginning of the NSN or FSC/DODIC for each affected line
            item.
            6.3.3.1.2. Block D: Authorized quantity. Authorized quantity is defined as
            allocated limits established by the most current Detail Logistics Allocation Report
            (DLAR) and operational limits established by the Unit Munitions Custodian,
            ADWSR and WSM. The MASO’s primary concern is that licensed quantities do
            not exceed most current DLAR allocated quantities. The MASO, or designated
            representative, will validate that quantities stored at the licensed facility do not
            exceed validated quantities on the new license prior to coordinating with
            signature.
     6.3.4. Once all coordination is obtained, coordinate with WSM for final approval.
     6.3.5. Once WSM approval is obtained, keep original copy of AF IMT 2047 posted on
     storage locker or room and file one copy in Tab 2 of the unit weapons safety program
     management book.
     6.3.6. AF IMT 2047 are valid as long as there’s a bonified, valid requirement; however,
     WSM may dictate re-submittal of licenses as a means of re-certification or re-validation.
     6.3.7. Renew licenses each time a hazard class, type, or quantity of explosives changes.
     Review each license at least annually for continued requirement and applicability.
     Licenses shall be immediately revoked when the requirement no longer exists or
     explosive safety standards are not met.

                  7.1.4.2.1.7. Ensure explosive compatibility requirements are met.
8. Explosive Site Planning.
   8.1. Explosive Site Plans (ESP) are required for permanent explosive storage facilities,
   operating locations, vehicle holding areas, and aircraft parking locations. These are facilities
   or locations that do not meet the definition of an ELF. ESPs are produced by the 184 IW and
   22 ARW Wing Weapons Safety Staffs and are coordinated through the appropriate Base
   Civil Engineer, other appropriate base agencies and the Wing Commander(s). ESPs can take
   up to 18 months before final NAF and MAJCOM, Air Force Safety Center (AFSC), and DoD
   Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) approval is obtained. Concise information and timely
   planning through unit ADWSRs are key elements in keeping this process within minimal
   timeframes.
       8.1.1. All facilities and locations that require new ESPs must be approved by the
       appropriate wing’s Facilities Management Board and/or Real Estate Working Group prior
       to ESP submittal.
       8.1.2. Expend only limited Air Force funds on a project requiring an ESP prior to final
       approval by the DDESB. All funds spent on designing a Potential Explosive Site or
       Exposed Site facility prior to DDESB approval may be placed at risk if proper explosives
       safety standards are not followed. The investment could be lost if site plan approval is
       contingent on changes or new facility requirements that were not considered or
       adequately addressed during the ESP preparation and review processes.
       8.1.3. New ESPs are required for (not all inclusive):
          8.1.3.1. New construction of explosive-related facilities.
          8.1.3.2. Modification of existing facilities with established ESPs.
          8.1.3.3. Encroachment into existing explosive clear zone arcs.
          8.1.3.4. Purchase of manufactured explosive storage magazines.
          8.1.3.5. New combat aircraft explosive load configurations.
          8.1.3.6. Vehicle holding areas.
       8.1.4. ADWSRs should be prepared to provide the 184 IW or 22 ARW Wing Weapons
       Safety Staff(s) with the following minimal information:
          8.1.4.1. Location.
          8.1.4.2. Justification and relationship to mission (Required for ESP Transmittal
          Letter).
          8.1.4.3. Type and quantity of explosives to be stored.
          8.1.4.4. Maximum Net Explosive Weight (NEW) required by mission.

      8.1.5. ADWSRs must contact appropriate Wing Weapons Safety Staff as soon as the
      need for the ESP is known. ADWSRs, in coordination with the WSM, shall schedule a
      meeting with the MASO, SFS Resource Protection, Civil Engineering Operations and
      other appropriate and affected agencies.
      8.1.6. Do not utilize facilities or locations for explosive storage or operations until
      approval has been granted at the appropriate HHQ-level. Contact 22 ARW Wing
      Weapons Safety Staff for further clarification.
9. Pre-Task Safety Briefings.
   9.1. Pre-task Safety Briefings will be given to all personnel who will be involved in
   explosive handling or transport operations (See Attachment 7). EXCEPTION: Not required
   for Security Forces personnel during shift change (guard mount) involved in issue or turn-in
   of small arms basic loads for normal base security details and emergency response/security
   detail personnel issued small arms basic loads for commensurate duties.
   9.2. Personnel who work with explosives will be trained IAW AFI 91-202, Chapter 10, and
   be qualified in the tasks to be performed. They must understand all safety standards,
   requirements, and precautions that apply to the operation. The supervisor/crew chief/team
   chief must be knowledgeable of all hazards involved in the operation, convey emergency
   procedures to workers and visitors, and maintain strict housekeeping standards. The
   supervisor must also know what steps to take when abnormal conditions arise. The
   supervisor/crew chief/team chief is responsible for ensuring complete and accurate safety
   briefings are performed and that workers understand them.
   9.3. Pre-task safety briefings will contain the following as a minimum:
      9.3.1. Scope and description of explosive operation to be performed.
      9.3.2. Explosive operating limits (maximum amount of explosives to be involved based
      on munitions cardinal rule).
      9.3.3. Personnel Limits and visitors [―X‖ - Supervisors, ―X‖ - Workers, ―X‖ - Casuals].
          9.3.3.1. Operations will be halted when casuals approach. Crew chief will ascertain
          casuals’ requirements, grant or deny entry, and provide casual personnel with safety
          brief. Crew chief will determine whether to commence with operation in presence of
          casual personnel.
          9.3.3.2. Operations will be halted when visitors approach. Crew chief will ascertain
          visitor requirements, grant or deny entry, and provide visitor personnel with a safety
          brief. Operations will remain halted until visitors depart to a safe separation distance.

       Assessment Matrix from AFPAM 90-902 included on the example in attachment 8.
26                                      MCCONNELLAFBI91-202 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


         10.2.2.8. RECOMMENDED CONTROL MEASURES: Include control measures
         that will be put into place to eliminate or mitigate hazards and risks. Pay particular
         attention to redundant control measures to keep live ammo out of the ―play area‖ and
         include identification measures for those individuals required to carry live
         ammunition. Include required PPE for all participants as it relates to use of
         explosives. It is mandatory to address ―PAUSEX‖ and ― Knock-it-off‖ processes for
         force-on-force exercises involving blank ammunition.
         10.2.2.9. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES: As a minimum, include the following:
             10.2.2.9.1. Explosive Incident/Mishap.
             10.2.2.9.2. Fire.
             10.2.2.9.3. Dud procedures. AFMAN 91-201 requires mandatory inclusion of
             Ground Burst Simulator (GBS) and smoke grenade dud procedures in all exercise
             and training event risk assessments.
             10.2.2.9.4. PAUSEX/Knock-it-off.
             10.2.2.9.5. Injury.
             10.2.2.9.6. Severe weather.
         10.2.2.10. TEAM CHIEF ASSESSMENT: The Team Chief will provide an overall
         Risk Assessment for the event in terms of low, medium, high, or extremely high for
         their unit responsible commander.
         10.2.2.11. Include statements that describe coordination with all affected agencies
         and base media advertisements to advise base populous when required. Coordination
         with affected agencies should begin NLT than 30 days prior to the event. Also
         address use of warning signs and cordons where appropriate.
         10.2.2.12. Include provisions for collecting, accounting for, and turn-in of spent
         brass.
         10.2.2.13. Address issues that will void risk assessment and indicate POC for

         10.2.2.14. Exercise and training risk assessments will be coordinated through the
         WSM and then approved and signed by responsible unit commander. Coordinate risk
         assessments IAW unit coordination procedures NLT 15 days prior to event start date.
             10.2.2.14.1. It is highly recommended that the team chief pre-coordinate risk
             assessments through the Wing Weapons Safety Staff prior to beginning formal
             coordination. This measure can drastically reduce planning and coordination
             timelines by identifying weapon safety issues in the early planning processes.
  10.3. Explosive storage, handling, and transportation for exercise and training events will be
  conducted IAW with AFMAN 91-201, this Instruction, and unit OIs. The following
  additional items are required for these unique events.

MCCONNELLAFBI91-202 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        27


      minimum, those items listed in attachment 7 of this Instruction, appropriate control
      measures, and the emergency procedures listed in the exercise/training risk assessment.
      10.3.2. Munitions may be stored in ELFs authorized to support that specific event no
      earlier than one duty day prior to and one duty day following the training and/or exercise
      event. Schedule munitions pick-ups and turn-ins IAW munitions squadron directives and
      procedures.
      10.3.3. Unit ADWSRs and exercise team chief’s will ensure procedures for clean-up and
      accounting of expended brass and other training munitions are included in exercise and
      training plans.
          10.3.3.1. Expended munitions and residues will be considered as live munitions and
          handled IAW live munitions handling requirements for the duration of the event until
          turned into the MSA.
      10.3.4. Exercise team chiefs are responsible for ensuring that individuals who function
      exercise munitions are trained and qualified by EOD. Qualification is indicated by
      current AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency.
      10.3.5. Use of Low Speed Vehicles (LSV) for movement of explosives within exercise
      play areas must be approved in writing by the WSM.
