1. General.
     1.1. Mission readiness is a condition which requires continuous measurement of unit
     capability at all levels. The key to readiness is training and demonstrated performance
     during exercise scenarios that provide feedback to commanders on the health of their
     programs. The Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) plays a vital role in training and exercise
     development by designing, conducting and evaluating scenarios that test and measure the
     capabilities of an organization to perform their wartime tasks and mission duties.
2. EET Composition.
     2.1. The EET is comprised of an EET Chief and EET members from each group, squadron,
     Wing Staff Agency (WSA), Geographically Separate Unit (GSU) and other organization
     assigned to or a tenant unit of the 39 ABW.
        2.1.1. The EET Chief is traditionally the Chief, Wing Plans and Readiness, or as
        assigned by the 39th Air Base Wing Commander (39 ABW/CC).
        2.1.2. Commanders and WSA Chiefs will appoint a primary and at least one alternate
        EET member for their organization using the format posted to the 39 ABW/XP
        SharePoint page (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/39ABW/XP/default.aspx).
     2.2. EET members must not be within six months of their Date Estimated Return from
     Overseas (DEROS) at the time of appointment without approval from the EET Chief.
     2.3. EET members will have a SECRET security clearance as a minimum, as verified by
     their Unit Security Managers.
     2.4. Commanders and WSA Chiefs will replace EET members and update their appointment
     letter no later than 30 days prior to an EET member departing Incirlik AB or its assigned
     GSUs.
3. EET Training.
     3.1. Appointed EET members must have a thorough knowledge of all applicable guidance
     which governs the areas they are responsible for evaluating. Commanders and WSA Chiefs
     will ensure EET members are current in all job related training in addition to the
     requirements listed in AFI 10-2501, Table 6-1 and local EET orientation provided by 39

 4                                                         INCIRLIKABI10-2502 17 MAY 2011


5. Exercise Planning.
     5.1. A top priority of every exercise is to validate lessons were learned and improvements
     implemented based on findings from previous exercises. Based on the results, EET will
     make recommendations for closing findings from previous exercises to the 39 ABW/CC or
     39th Air Base Wing Vice Commander (39 ABW/CV). EET members will review the
     previous list of findings for their unit and ensure those items are specifically re-evaluated and
     reported on.
     5.2. EET members will be prepared to report on all findings to the EET Chief and identify if
     a discrepancy re-occurred or should be recommended for closure (if a previous finding).
     EET members will also recommend fix actions for each new or recurring discrepancy
     discovered.
     5.3. EET members will meet with their Commanders or WSA Chiefs prior to every exercise
     to identify specific unit objectives. These objectives will be presented to the EET Chief in a
     timely manner for consideration into the exercise scenario.
     5.4. The EET Chief will maintain oversight of the wing exercise program to prevent exercise
     stagnation and ensure units stress themselves appropriately.
     5.5. The EET Chief will coordinate to include and integrate GSUs in exercises whenever
     possible.
        5.5.1. Due to the amount of personnel at the GSUs and the high turnover rate, 39
        ABW/XP will focus on exercises that meet the desires of the GSU commanders, for
        example, Natural Disaster and Non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) exercises.
        5.5.2. 39 ABW/XP will initially conduct table top exercises for the GSUs to allow
        personnel the proper training which in turn will allow them to practice the procedures
        during their own in-house training/exercises.
        5.5.3. When the GSU commanders are satisfied with their in-house training/exercises, 39
        ABW/XP will work with the GSU EET members in developing exercises to the max
        extent possible, scheduled at the same time as 39 ABW exercises, which will test the
        GSUs on their ability to conduct operations during different exercises/scenarios.
        5.5.4. If the GSU exercises are not being conducted at the same time as 39 ABW
        exercises, EET personnel will make every attempt to go temporary duty (TDY) to the
        GSUs to help conduct and evaluate the exercises.
     5.6. The EET Chief will ensure the 39 ABW/CC intent is met for every exercise to include
     providing the appropriate focus involving any special areas of interest.
6. Scenario Development.
     6.1. The EET Chief will solicit inputs from functional areas such as Weather, Intel and
     ATFP to provide background information and establish realistic, locally based conditions for
     the exercise environment. This information will be provided through briefings, exercise
     Special Instructions (SPINS) or any other means which disseminates the information to wing
     personnel.
        6.1.1. Initial exercise planning meetings will be held at least 30 days prior to Start of
        Exercise (STARTEX) when conditions permit.
INCIRLIKABI10-2502 17 MAY 2011                                                                5


      6.1.2. Exercise SPINS will be provided to wing personnel at least one week prior to
      STARTEX when conditions permit.
   6.2. Exercise injects will be developed to drive participants to meet pre-identified exercise
   objectives. EET members can contact 39 ABW/XP for the approved inject format.
   6.3. A Master Schedule of Events Listing (MSEL) will be developed and distributed by
   39 ABW/XP to all applicable EET members. The MSEL will incorporate all required
   injects, assign which EET office primary responsibility (OPR) is responsible for issuing it
   and provide an estimated timeline for how the scenario will unfold.
      6.3.1. The MSEL is released to EET members and exercise trusted agents only. Trusted
      agents are those personnel deemed essential to assist with exercise scenarios who are not
      assigned to EET.
7. Exercise Evaluation.
   7.1. EET members will wear EET badges, provided by 39 ABW/XP, at all times while
   evaluating. Additionally, it is recommended that all EET members wear an orange reflective
   vest when performing evaluation duties outdoors to reduce confusion on the part of the
   exercise players.
   7.2. EET members will wear the same protective equipment as all exercise players.
   However, they are authorized to delay donning equipment in order to evaluate exercise
   participants performance. Additionally, they are not required to don their gas mask while
   performing evaluation duties.
   7.3. EET members will maintain a non-confrontational and professional posture at all times
   during evaluation.
   7.4. EET members will be afforded entry/exit into all areas necessary for evaluation (i.e.
   freedom of movement), barring any real-world security concerns, regardless of current
   exercise Force Protection Condition (FPCON) or shelter-in-place restrictions. EET members
   will comply with all posted entry requirements (i.e. surrendering cell phones, radios, etc…).
   7.5. EET members will ensure they stay tuned-in to the exercise scenario to ensure they
   don’t miss an evaluation opportunity due to an accelerated exercise schedule. The EET
   Chief will make notifications for significant timeline adjustments, delays, or accelerations.
   7.6. The standard simulations and deviations as prescribed in AFI 90-201_USAFESUP in
   addition to the most recent simulation and deviation request submitted and approved by HHQ
   inspection teams will be used unless otherwise directed by 39 ABW/CC or his delegated
   authority. Any additional simulation or deviation must be requested and approved in writing
   by the EET Chief or 39 ABW/CV.
8. Documentation.
   8.1. EET members will document exercise results using the template provided by 39
   ABW/XP, and provide feedback to the EET Chief by the suspense date. All fields of the
   template will be filled out. EET members will provide finding descriptions, detailed
   accounts of the event, and recommended fix actions such that the OPR assigned to remedy
   the discrepancy can fully comprehend the issue to be resolved.
6                                                        INCIRLIKABI10-2502 17 MAY 2011


    8.2. EET members will substantiate findings with source documentation, including
    paragraph number and designate severity as Critical, Significant/Major or Minor IAW AFI
    90-201 and other published HHQ guidance.
    8.3. EET members will brief their respective Commanders or WSA Chiefs prior to
    submission to the EET Chief. However, during this initial validation process, EET members
    need to be conscious that findings discovered during wing level exercises may not be simply
    ―internal issues.‖ All raw data should be presented to the EET Chief, along with any
    Commander or WSA Chief comments, so a final determination involving extenuating
    circumstances can be adjudicated accordingly.
    8.4. The EET Chief will compile unit results into a wing briefing and present the results to
    the 39 ABW/CC and all other inspected Commanders and WSA Chiefs. This briefing may
    take the form of a ―hotwash‖ which will present the exercise scenario, its objectives, and any
    findings / recommendations validated during the wing level exercise, to include
    recommendations for closure of previous findings and identifying any findings still left open.
    8.5. The EET Chief will distribute the wing briefing to all Commanders and WSA Chiefs.
    8.6. The EET Chief will ensure all Significant, Critical and Major Findings are entered into
    the Wing Inspection Program (WIP) after exercise termination unless otherwise directed by
    the 39 ABW/CC. Minor findings will not be entered into the WIP and are the sole
    responsibility of the unit commander for tracking and closure.
    8.7. Commanders and WSA Chiefs will utilize the WIP to track findings to closure by
    identifying corrective actions taken and their success in minimizing any recurring
    discrepancies (as re-evaluated by EET members during subsequent exercises).
       8.7.1. Commanders and WSA Chiefs will appoint OPRs to address their discrepancies.
       8.7.2. All corrective actions will focus on curtailing the root cause of the discrepancy,
       and thus be specific and sustainable in order to identify permanent solutions.
       8.7.3. All corrective actions taken will be documented in the ―Corrective Actions Taken‖
       field in a format conducive for HHQ reporting.
    8.8. Findings will be routed through the WIP to the 39 ABW/CV for closure (Attachment
    2).
    8.9. The EET Chief will maintain the MSEL and wing brief for historical purposes.
