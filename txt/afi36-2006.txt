SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This change implements Air Force policy to ensure all new officers commissioned to the active duty list
(ADL) receive “Regular appointments” and “Reserve officers” on the ADL transition to an all Regular
force. This is pursuant to the authority given under section 501 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2005. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the previous edi-
tion.

Section A—AF Form 133, Oath of Office (Military Personnel)

1. Appointment as Regular Officer. Effective 1 May 2005, all officers commissioned to the Air Force
on or after 1 May 2005 will receive Regular appointments at the time they enter Extended Active Duty on
the ADL, regardless of method or source of commission. This paragraph also applies to students of the
University of Health Sciences upon their entry on extended active duty.
2                                                                      AFI36-2006 21 NOVEMBER 2002


2. Taking the Oath. Individuals being appointed or commissioned in the Regular Air Force, Reserve of
the Air Force, or US Air Force (Temporary) must execute AF Form 133 when they accept the appoint-
ment.
    2.1. ROTC graduates and Direct Accessions will still be commissioned as Reserve officers. They do
    not receive a Regular appointment until placed on the ADL.
    2.2. Individuals who received Reserve appointments for the purpose of extended active duty on the
    ADL, and are appointed Regular Air Force upon placement on the ADL, will not execute a new AF
    Form 133 for the Regular Air Force appointment.

3. Administering the Oath. Persons being appointed or commissioned in the Air Force may take the
oath before a:
    3.1. Civil official authorized by law to administer oaths.
    3.2. Commissioned officer of any component of any Armed Force of the United States (includes
    Reserve components), whether on active duty or retired. (This includes commissioned warrant offic-
    ers of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.)
    3.3. Warrant officer serving on active duty as an adjutant, assistant adjutant, acting adjutant, or per-
    sonnel adjutant of a command.

4. Authenticating the Oath. Instructions printed on AF Form 133 tell how to authenticate the Oath and
to return it to the headquarters tendering the commission.
    4.1. Air Force officer’s oaths of office should be taken before:
       4.1.1. A civil officer authorized by the laws of the United States or local municipal law to admin-
       ister oaths.
           4.1.1.1. If a civil official administers the oath, it must bear the official seal of the person
           administering it. If the official does not use a seal, his/her capacity to administer oaths must be
           certified to under seal by a clerk of court or other proper local official.
           4.1.1.2. If a notary administers the oath, the expiration date of his or her commission must be
           included (if required by the State concerned) and the AF Form 133 must bear the notorial seal
           or indicia.
       4.1.2. A commissioned officer of any U. S. Armed Force component, including Reserves,
       whether active duty or retired (includes commissioned Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast
       Guard warrant officers);
       4.1.3. A warrant officer who is serving on active duty as an adjutant, assistant adjutant, acting
       adjutant, or personnel adjutant. (Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard warrant officer W-1,
       receive their appointment by warrant and are not eligible to administer the oath unless serving on
       active duty as adjutants as listed above.) Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard chief warrant
       officers (CWO), W-2 through W-5, are appointed in those grades by commission and are autho-
       rized to administer oaths. Army CWOs appointed on or after 8 May 1986 receive their appoint-
       ment by commission and are authorized to administer oaths. Before 8 May 1986, they received
       their appointment by warrant and are not eligible to administer oaths unless they were later
       granted a CWO appointment by commission or are serving on active duty as an adjutant as listed
AFI36-2006 21 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                           3


       above. Retired Air Force warrant officers received their appointment by warrant and are not

ment or a corrected DD Form 1AF directly or through the servicing MPF:
