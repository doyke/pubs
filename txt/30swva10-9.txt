                                                              BOMB THREATS
STEPS TO TAKE
• Initiate AF Form 440, located by your phone, ask every question and follow all the steps
• Do not hang up the phone, it will make it easier to trace the call
• Call 911 on a different line or if using a cell phone call 606-3911
• STAY ON THE LINE until the dispatcher gives you the okay to leave. Responding forces need
you to give the necessary information for their response
• Do not change the environment. Leave lights on if they were on, or leave them off if they were
off. Do not use electrical devices (radios, cell phones, etc.)
• Evacuate the facility (Designated by the facility evacuation plan). Ensure the evacuation point
is not in close proximity to the facility.
ENSURE the evacuation point is free from
objects (cars, trash containers, etc.) in case a
secondary device has been placed or hidden
• All pertinent personnel (911 caller, recipient of
bomb threat) need to meet the responding forces
once on scene with AF Form 440 information and
answer any question they may have in order to
effectively diffuse the situation.

  Dial 911 or L.E. Desk (606-3911)
