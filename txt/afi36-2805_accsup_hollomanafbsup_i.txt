                                           Chapter 1

   GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIAL TROPHIES AND AWARDS

1.1. Nominating Procedures. Commanders at all levels actively advertise the nomination
procedures for trophies and awards. Commanders verify achievements and nominate those
qualified for appropriate awards. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders, vice commanders, or
executive directors indorse nominations on their personnel. When nominating persons or units
assigned to other commands, commanders acquire by letter, the coordination of the commander
or vice commander of the owning MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. Submit nominations to HQ
AFPC/DPPPRS, with the parent MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commander's coordination.
1.2. Air Force-level Awards. Air Force functional activities or private organizations establish
Air Force-level awards. The designated OPR and HQ USAF/DPXPQ approve implementing
instructions. Notify HQ USAF/DPXPQ when the award is terminated.
   1.2.1.    The experts in a given function will manage functional awards. Functional
   managers will ensure nomination write-ups are limited to two pages, using the Air Force
   Form 1206, Nomination for Award. Exceptions to this requirement must be approved by
   HQ USAF/DPX. Functional areas requiring the use of base visits to determine award
   winners will limit such visits to one visit per base per award.
1.3. Wartime Guidance. Programs governed by this instruction will continue during conflicts
below the level of declared war. In the event of a national emergency declared by Congress or
the President of the United States, programs sponsored by Headquarters (HQ) USAF may be
suspended. The Air Force will suspend administrative support for programs sponsored by
private organizations.
1.4. Establishing Special Trophies and Awards Programs. Commanders at any level may
establish special trophies and awards programs to recognize military and civilian members and
units or organizations. Include such recognition programs in appropriate base supplements.
   1.4.1.      Awards may be named in honor of living or deceased Air Force military members
   and Department of the Air Force (DAF) civilians who had honorable records and made
   significant contributions to the Air Force or to the functional area in which the award is being
   established. Consider individuals of prominence or those whose careers or actions were
   important and meaningful to the function in which the award will be established.
   Thoroughly review the career and personal history of the individual to ensure the individual
   is worthy of such honor before naming an award in their honor. When establishing an award,
   the designated award OPR or manager will send a letter, signed by the appropriate
   commander or vice commander, to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS notifying of the establishment of the
   award. Include the award and criteria in an appropriate supplement or instruction. Process
   all supplements and instructions in accordance with AFI 37-160V1, The Air Force
   Publications and Forms Management Programs – Developing and Processing Publications.
   Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring and maintaining the integrity of special
   trophies and awards programs. All awards named for individuals will be established only in
   accordance with this instruction. The requirements of this instruction are mandatory when
   considering memorial-type awards.         List what sources were reviewed to perform the
6                    AFI36-2805_ACCSUP_HOLLOMANAFBSUP_I 4 SEPTEMBER 2009


    background check and that verification has been made that no derogatory information was
    found on the individual which would preclude naming an award in their honor.
    1.4.2.    Possible sources to review when determining individuals' suitability for
    memorialization are:
       1.4.2.1.      Military personnel records (retired or deceased military members), which
       are located at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), Air Force Reference
       Branch, 9700 Page Boulevard, St. Louis MO 63132-5100.
       1.4.2.2.       Civilian personnel records (retired or deceased DAF civilians), which are
       located at the National Archives and Records Administration, NPRC (Civilian Personnel
       Records), 111 Winnebago Street, St. Louis MO 63118.
       1.4.2.3.        Public libraries for archived newspaper articles.
       1.4.2.4.        Local newspapers.
       1.4.2.5.        Local courthouse records.
       1.4.2.6.        Local Air Force Office of Special Investigations or Security Police.
       1.4.2.7.        Interview family, friends, acquaintances, and coworkers.
    1.4.3.     Do not duplicate existing trophies and awards programs in either name or criteria.
    (Recognizing an achievement or accomplishment in performance reports or a citation to
    accompany an award is not considered duplication or dual recognition.) Award elements will
    not duplicate elements of existing formal award programs. Refer to AFI 65-601, volume 1,
    USAF Budget Guidance and Procedures, for further guidance regarding funding for award
    elements. Awards must be of nominal value. Awards may not be redeemable for cash,
    merchandise, or services. The cost of awards will be commensurate with the significance of
    the achievement being recognized.
    1.4.4.   A one-time unique trophy or award may be given to an individual or unit whose
    achievements make a significant contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of the Air
    Force.
    1.4.5.       (Added-ACC) On-The-Spot Recognition and Appreciation Awards. It is
    important to recognize military and civilian personnel who, by dedicated individual effort,
    facilitate successful accomplishment of a particular program, function, or mission. This type
    of program provides senior leadership with an informal means to show special recognition of,
    and appreciation for, a job well done. Coins, trophies, plaques, pens, emblems, certificates, or
    similar items are appropriate forms of recognition.
    1.4.5. (HOLLOMANAFB) Wing coins or similar items provide a means for on-the-spot
    recognition to boost morale and serve as appropriate mementos for distinguished visitors.
    The 49 FW Commander (49 FW/CC) determines which individuals will receive a wing coin
    or similar item. Groups can submit a request for this type of recognition on a 3x5 card or
    email to the wing command section. These requests need to be concise and to the point.
       1.4.5.1.      (Added-ACC) The following Air Combat Command personnel are

       1.4.5.1.1.        (Added-ACC) No other individuals or positions are authorized to
       use appropriated funds to supplement AFI 36 series awards regulations to create their
       own On-the-Spot Recognition and Appreciation Awards Program. If other
       commanders or individuals desire to award coins, they must do so at their own
       expense or by using self-generated funds (e.g., unit activity, morale, snack, etc.
       funds).
    1.4.5.2.        (Added-ACC) Appropriated funds may be used to purchase coins,
    plaques, pens, or similar items if they are used as a form of recognition as stated in
    paragraph 1.4.5 (Added). If appropriated funds are used, these items are only to be used
    to recognize exceptional mission accomplishment. They will not be used as mementos or
    gifts (including going away gifts), nor should they be issued simply for being assigned to
    an organization. (Refer to AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds, to use funds to
    purchase mementos/gifts.)
       1.4.5.2.1.         (Added-ACC) If appropriated funds are used to purchase On-The-
       Spot Recognition and Appreciation Awards, the award must be modest and not
       wasteful or extravagant.
       1.4.5.2.2.        (Added-ACC) When using appropriated funds, organizational
       coins will not be personalized by stamping the presenter‟s name on the coin or by
       adding them after the coin is cast. The coins are to be presented as cast from the die
       without further embellishment (i.e. presenter‟s name engraved). They are
       organizational coins, not personalized mementos. Use only the organization and the
       position of the presenter (e.g., Commander 509BW Whiteman AFB MO).
       Personalized coins create frozen stock (waste) when personnel change and require an
       additional expenditure to recast. (EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 65-601, the Air Combat
       Command Commander is authorized to personalize coins.)

3.4. 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year (12 OAY) Award. Established by the Air Force,
this program recognizes 12 enlisted members in a range of grades representing a cross section of
career fields. The AFA honors the 12 OAY and their spouses at its annual convention in
Washington DC each year. HQ AFPC/DPPP sends a message outlining nomination procedures
to the MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs each year. Send nominations to HQ AFPC/DPPPRS by 30
April.
   3.4.1.     There are three categories of competition:    Airman (airman through senior
   airman); NCO (sergeant and technical sergeant); and Senior NCO (master sergeant through
   chief master sergeant).
   3.4.2.     Base nominations only on achievements that occurred during the current calendar
   year. For example, the nominees' achievements for the 1998 program should cite
   achievements occurring from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 1997. Since nominees
   are representatives of the Air Force enlisted force, they must also stand the test of a "whole
   life/whole career" scrutiny, although the observation period for the award is 1 year.
   3.4.3.      All nominees must sign a statement of intent agreeing if selected as a MAJCOM,
   FOA, or DRU nominee, they will obtain the required retainability in order to compete at Air
   Force level. All nominees who meet the Air Force selection board must have sufficient
   retainability so that, if selected as a 12 OAY, they can serve on the AFA Enlisted Advisory
   Council for a 12-month period which commences the month of their induction (September)
   as a 12 OAY. For example, the 1998 12 OAY serve from September 1998 through
   September 1999. Therefore, the 1998 MAJCOM and DRU nominees would need
   retainability through 30 September 1999. The annual HQ AFPC/DPP nomination message
   outlines procedures to follow to obtain retainability for those MAJCOM and DRU nominees
   who do not have sufficient retainability. Contact AFPC Personnel Procurement Division,
   Reenlistment Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE), for assistance regarding retainability. Failure on
   the part of the MAJCOM or DRU to meet retainability requirements on their nominee will
   result in the nominee being withdrawn from the Air Force-level competition. If an individual
   is not selected as a 12 OAY, cancel the extension.
   3.4.4.     Send statement of intent, signed and dated by the nominee, which includes the
   following statements verbatim:
       3.4.4.1.      “I have not applied for a commissioning program and, if selected as a 12
       OAY, will not apply for a commissioning program at any time during my tenure as a 12
       OAY.”
       3.4.4.2.        “If selected as a 12 OAY, I agree to serve in the capacity as an enlisted
       ambassador representing and assisting the Air Force in enlisted recruiting and retention
       efforts and matters. I understand I may be called upon by my MAJCOM commander and
       MAJCOM/CCC to publicize and promote „the Air Force way of life‟ and attend events or
       other venues deemed appropriate which may positively impact upon recruiting and
       retention.”
       3.4.4.3.        “I attest that the facts I have provided for this nomination are true and
       correct to the best of my knowledge.”
   3.4.5.  If the MAJCOM or DRU will not submit nominations, send a letter or message to
   HQ AFPC/DPPPRS advising of this.

        Form 1206 for both pages. Nominations should include specific facts, achievements, and
        examples showing the individuals are exceptional. Achievements should distinguish the
        member from his or her peers. Nominations must include the following areas and cite

              significant leadership accomplishments and how well the member performed
              assigned primary and additional duties. Define the scope and level of responsibilities
              and the impact on the mission and unit. Include any new initiatives or techniques
              developed by the member that positively impacted the unit and/or the mission.
              Include results of Air Force, MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force-level inspections and/or
              evaluations. Include awards received; e.g., NCO of the Quarter, Maintenance
              Professional of the Year, and so forth.
              3.4.6.2.2.          Significant Self-Improvement. Show how the member developed
              or improved skills related to primary duties; e.g., formal training, Career

3.4.4.2. “If selected as a 12 OAY, I agree to serve in the capacity as an enlisted ambassador
representing and assisting the Air Force in enlisted recruiting and retention efforts and matters. I

3.4.11.1. If unit funds are insufficient to fund travel, MAJCOMs will provide any additional
funding to the units to cover travel or other related expenses involving the 12 OAY in regard to
public appearances and so forth on behalf of recruiting and retention matters.
3.4.11.2. MAJCOM/CCCs will maintain records of all travel (cost, where the trips were taken,

retention. They will report these statistics to the CMSAF quarterly.
