This instruction implements AFPD 65-6, Budget. It provides budget and accounting procedures for those
cases in which AFMC organizations provide reimbursable or non reimbursable materiel or services to
DOD and non-DOD agencies, non-US government organizations, commercial organizations, and foreign
governments. This instruction does not include procedures for AFMC organizations that operate under the
Defense Working Capital Fund.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision aligns the instruction with AFPD 65-6. The entire instruction has revised, updated and com-
bined provisions of superseded AFMCI 65-603, 26 May 1995. The DFAS field organization's names and
regulation references have been changed to reflect the transition of DFAS from Operating Locations to
Field Sites and the renumbering and renaming of DFAS, Air Force and AFMC regulations and instruc-
tions.

Section 1A—Terms

1.1. Abbreviation and Terms. Attachment 1 lists the abbreviations and terms used in this instruction.

Section 1B—General

1.2. Introduction to Appropriation Reimbursements for O&M, RDT&E and Procurement Funds.
The importance of managing reimbursable programs can not be over emphasized. Failure to record or
realize reimbursable earnings to match obligations incurred to fill customer orders will result in a decrease
to your direct program (para 1.20.), where you have authority to retain the earnings and not deposit them
in Miscellaneous Receipts of the Treasury. Also, any recorded revenues not identified to obligations are
excess earnings and will be deposited to miscellaneous receipts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3302(b).
This can also have an adverse effect on your direct programs if the excess earnings are due to failure to
use a sales code on an obligation.
   1.2.1. Various government agencies are authorized to enter into transactions with each other when so
   doing is determined to be in the best interest of the government. Support to other activities is autho-
   rized in AFI 65-601. Vol 1.
   1.2.2. Support agreements and transactions are completed between AFMC and other major com-
   mands (MAJCOM), DOD, and non-DOD agencies, foreign governments, and commercial concerns.
   AFMC usually provides support, materiel, and services on a reimbursable basis. The amounts col-
   lected, however, must be deposited in the Miscellaneous Receipts of the Treasury unless authority
   (such as 10 U.S.C. 2681, 10 U.S.C. 2563, 31 U.S.C. 1535, or 41 U.S.C. 23) exists to credit the appro-
   priation used to fund the work.
   1.2.3. Activities providing support must specify the requirements in their budget estimates and finan-
   cial plans. The Financial Services Office (FSO) or DFAS Field Site records unfilled orders (UFO)
   when reimbursable orders are received, records filled orders uncollected (FOU) when materiel and
   services are provided, and records filled orders collected (FOC) when collections are received.
   RDT&E activities and 3400 funded bases utilizing cost accounting systems will record each reim-
   bursement order with a unique control serial number (CSN) in the General Accounting and Finance
   System (GAFS).
   1.2.4. All appropriation reimbursements are accounted for in the General Accounting and Finance
   System (GAFS) and included in the Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS:
   SAF-FM(M)7801-DE (DFAS-DE 7010.1-R).
   1.2.5. The use of intra-appropriation reimbursement procedures is authorized for funds made avail-
   able to AFMC (operating agency code (OAC) 47) in appropriations 57*3400 and 57*3600. Air Force
   accountable stations must use sales code (SC) 39 for processing these reimbursements when the
   appropriation charged and the appropriation credited are identical as to appropriation and fiscal year
   (FY).
   1.2.6. Figure 1.1. provides the checklist for recording reimbursable actions under various conditions.
6                                                                 AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


    1.2.7. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) authorizes using automatic apportionment of
    reimbursement for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M), AF appropriation (57*3400, Fund Code
    30). The field level budget or FSO offices load reimbursements as they are earned. (No target is given
    to the MAJCOM or base budget office.) References to reimbursable budget authority (RBA) apply to
    RDT&E and procurement funds. Reimbursements to O&M (3400) are managed under automatic
    apportionment procedures. These procedures do not authorize retention of reimbursed amounts. There
    must be separate authority for crediting the appropriation used to perform the work.

Section 1C—Organization Responsibilities

1.3. Budget Office Responsibilities. The local budget office will complete the following tasks to iden-
tify all reimbursements and to make sure related transactions are reported accurately:
    1.3.1. Submit RBA requirements in the budget estimates and financial plans.
    1.3.2. Distribute RBAs and direct budget authorization (DBA) by budget programs and SC, where
    applicable.
    1.3.3. Monitor the status of the reimbursable program.
       1.3.3.1. For RDT&E and procurement funds, request adjustment to RBA and DBA as required.
       1.3.3.2. For O&M (3400), MAJCOMs/FOAs may exceed target amounts without SAF/FMBO's
       prior approval. But, MAJCOMs/FOAs must explain deviations from targets to SAF/FMBO in
       writing when they're apparent. When SAF/FMBO approves and issues revised reimbursement tar-
       gets to MAJCOMs/FOAs, apply standard reimbursement policies and procedures.
    1.3.4. Provide the FSO anticipated reimbursement amounts that equal RBA received for inclusion in
    the GAFS. Ensure reimbursement amounts included in GAFS agree with reimbursement amounts
    loaded in the applicable cost accounting systems.
    1.3.5. Guide the staff on reimbursable policy.
    1.3.6. Review each support agreement when it is being coordinated. Prepare an annex (when
    required) that lists all areas of support and identify each item as reimbursable or nonreimbursable. See
    AFI 25-201 for additional guidance.
    1.3.7. Provide the DFAS Field Site an AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement
    Document (constituting a reimbursable order) quarterly, annually, or as required for all locally gener-
    ated reimbursements (FT J and M) using organizational Commercial Service. Ensure FT J and M are
    recorded with the applicable CSN for RDT&E activities and 3400 funded bases that use cost account-
    ing systems.
    1.3.8. Assign the appropriate reimbursable budget program activity code (BPAC) and record the CSN
    as applicable when a 3600 appropriation reimbursable order is received. Use sale codes for O&M and
    appropriate BPACs only for RDT&E and procurement funds
    1.3.9. Provide BPACs and case identifiers on budget authorization (BA) releases for foreign military
    sales (FMS) and the Military Assistance Program (MAP).
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             7


1.4. Accounting and Finance Responsibilities. The DFAS Field Site or Financial Services Office
(FSO), as applicable, will complete the following tasks to identify all reimbursements and to make sure
related transactions are reported accurately:
   1.4.1. Maintain a complete file of all agreements, contracts engineering service projects (ESP),
   project orders, military interdepartmental purchase requests (MIPR), purchase requests (PR), etc., that
   authorize issue or sale of Air Force resources on a reimbursable basis. Ensure the authority for the
   agreement is on the documents, or it will be assumed to be an Economy Act order (except AF Forms
   185).
   1.4.2. Verify that all required support shown in a support agreement is correctly identified. If support
   is not identified, notify the appropriate financial office immediately.
   1.4.3. Send each functional activity (such as civil engineering, supply, and transportation) that pro-
   vides reimbursable support a record of its reimbursable transactions.
   1.4.4. Maintain records according to DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, and Receivable
   Transactions at Base Level, Section 5 for appropriation refund and reimbursement transactions.
   1.4.5. Establish local controls and coordinate with all submitting activities to make sure that docu-
   mentation reflecting orders on hand and services and materiel delivered (filled and earned) is received
   and recorded promptly in the GAFS and applicable cost accounting systems. Ensure reimbursement
   amounts included in GAFS agree with reimbursement amounts loaded in applicable cost accounting
   systems. Ensure the documentation is recorded in GAFS and applicable cost accounting systems with
   CSN identification when applicable for RDT&E activities and 3400 funded bases, using cost account-
   ing systems and reimbursement amounts included in GAFS. Also ensure the documentation agrees
   with reimbursement amounts loaded in applicable cost accounting systems
   1.4.6. Make sure appropriation reimbursement shown in the RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report are
   correct. Report balances must be edited according to RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE checklist. (Figure
   1.1.).
   1.4.7. Make sure anticipated reimbursements (the dollar amount of reimbursement estimated to be
   realized during the life of the appropriation) in fund type (FT) J or M records equal RBA in FT A, C,
   or L records. RBA is the authority to record anticipated reimbursements, not total orders accepted.
   RBA by itself does not authorize retention of the collected reimbursed amounts. There must be
   authority to credit the appropriation used for the work. (See para. 1.2.2.) For O&M funds: organiza-
   tions utilizing cost accounting systems must follow these procedures. However, for other organiza-
   tions, the sum of the direct program and reimbursable program can be recorded in the "L" record.
   1.4.8. Prepare and distribute SF 1080, Voucher for Transfers between Appropriations and/or
   Funds, or other billings. Process billings by the end of the month after the month of delivery. Process
   both sides of the SF 1080 (collections for-self and payment for-others) for all customers within the Air
   Force. Use these same procedures for DOD and non-DOD agencies, provided a bilateral agreement
   exists. If there is no bilateral agreement, then send invoice. For advance payments from nongovern-
   ment organizations, see paragraph 1.17.3.4. and DFAS Interim Guidance, Administrative Control Of
   Appropriations.
   1.4.9. Age accounts receivable on a monthly basis (para 1.28.).
   1.4.10. Follow up on all accounts receivable according to DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct,
   Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level to ensure prompt collection.
8                                                                 AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


    1.4.11. Review the orders-accepted file periodically to ensure orders are recorded correctly.
    1.4.12. Follow-up on delinquent orders with budget, the initiator, or the performing activity as
    required. See paragraph 1.18. for procedures for working without an order.
    1.4.13. Document and transfer delinquent accounts receivable for collection according to DFAS-DE
    Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level,
    table 29-1. When payment (full or partial) is received or the charge is adjusted after it has been trans-
    ferred, the billing office will notify DFAS/Field Site by message. The message will include the
    invoice number (or other identification of the delinquent case file) and the amount of the collection or
    adjustment. If MINIMIZE is imposed, wait for it to be lifted.
    1.4.14. Use Figure 1.1., Accounts Receivable Checklist, at least quarterly.
    1.4.15. Assist in preparing the funding annex to support agreements to determine the type of billing
    and support documentation that will be required or provided.
    1.4.16. Use appropriate Operating Instructions (OIs) from DOD, Air Force, AFMC, and local and
    system user guides to determine job order costs and to support all reimbursements processed by activ-
    ities required to operate a cost system.

1.5. Purchase Request (PR) and Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) Control
Responsibilities. The control and coordination of PRs and MIPRs will be assigned to an appropriate
office at each facility per AFMCI 23-102. To help with MIPR procedures/processes, HQ AFMC/PK
developed a MIPR toolkit located at
https://www.afmc-mil.wpafb.af.mil/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkv/mipr.htm. Each facility office will ensure the
following tasks are performed to identify and process all reimbursements and ensure they are reported
promptly and accurately.
    1.5.1. After accepting a reimbursable MIPR or amendment, coordinate with the budget office to
    determine if RBA is available (if not using automatic apportionment) and send a copy of the reimburs-
    able MIPR or amendment to the FSO and budget office according to AFMCPD 23-1 and AFMCI
    23-102.
    1.5.2. Send the FSO/DFAS documents that show excess funds or other adjustments to MIPRs funded
    on a reimbursable basis so corresponding adjustments can be made to UFOs.
    1.5.3. Mark all forms, including incoming MIPRs, that are to be treated as project orders clearly by
    inclusion of a statement such as “This order is placed in accordance with the provisions of 41 U.S.C.
    23, as implemented by Department of Defense regulation.” per DoD 7000.14R, Vol 11A, Chapter 2 .
    1.5.4. Send the project order to the designated acceptance or functional manager for action.

1.6. Cost Office Responsibilities. The Cost Accounting Office has the overall responsibility to ensure
that a compliant cost accounting system is in place and that it functions in accordance with DOD
7000-14R, Financial Management Regulation. At locations utilizing the Job Order Cost Accounting Sys-
tem II (JOCAS II), the cost accounting function includes not only members of the Cost Accounting Office
(CAO), but the JOCAS System Administrator (JSA) and the applicable Organizational Focal Points as
well. It is the duty of the Chief of the Cost Accounting Office to coordinate all required functions within
the cost accounting arena among all required participants (See Attachment 2). The Chief of Cost
Accounting is responsible to ensure that the provisions of applicable business practices are incorporated
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                            9


within the established cost accounting framework provided by JOCAS II. Maintenance of JOCAS II,
including System Master Tables, scheduling and processing schedules, interfaces from other standard sys-
tems, corrections of data errors, consolidation processing, billing and journal vouchering generation from
within the JOCAS II are all responsibilities of the local Cost Accounting Office. In order to properly
maintain the system, it is necessary that the CAO obtain varied support from other accounting functions,
budget offices and other financial management functions on an as required basis. Although the data
related to a specific Job Order Number (JON) and data related to a specific Reimbursable Order Number
(RON) are often the prime responsibility of specifically identified JON and RON Managers external to
the CAO, it is imperative that the proper funding relationships between reimbursable JONs and their asso-
ciated RONs be maintained. Periodic reviews of these relationships are the responsibility of the CAO.
Specific system operating guidance may be found in the JOCAS II ‘User Manual’, ‘JSA Manual’ and
other Operating Instructions. The CAO must ensure that all requirements of pertinent documentation are
incorporated into the local business practices of JOCAS II operations. The CAO is also responsible to
ensure that proper training is provided to new users and those with expanded roles within the system.
Although most training is performed locally, central training courses may be available on a periodic basis
to assist in this function.

1.7. Support Agreement OPR Responsibilities. The support agreement OPR/coordinator will make
sure the supporting FSO and budget office have reviewed all agreements to ensure the reimbursement
aspects are adequately identified and covered before authentication. For intracommand support, follow
procedures for support agreements outlined in AFMCI 65-601. The support agreement OPR will send the
FSO and budget office copies of authenticated (signed) support agreements.

1.8. Performing Activity Responsibilities. Activities performing reimbursable work will complete the
following tasks to identify all reimbursement and to make sure related transactions are reported accu-
rately:
   1.8.1. Ensure the budget office and FSO have copies of reimbursable orders. These orders include
   project orders, MIPRs accepted as project orders, PRs, National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
   tion (NASA) Defense PRs, work orders, and AF Form 406. Send the FSO a copy of the commander's
   or comptroller's approval and AF Form 406 when reimbursable work is started before receipt of a
   reimbursable order or reimbursable work continues in excess of a reimbursable order. Use of AF Form
   406 is described in Attachment 1.
   1.8.2. Identify reimbursable transactions and process necessary data or documentation for the FSO.
   Briefly describe the work that was done, its monetary value, and the activity supported
   1.8.3. Send the FSO copies of orders received from tenant organization or off-base customers that
   request services, supplies, or equipment (but not normal host-tenant supply support processed through
   the supply system)
   1.8.4. Make sure that accounting and finance and cost accounting records are complete for reimburs-
   able support provided and identified by CSN where applicable.
   1.8.5. Make sure that when the performing activity is a tenant and AFMC is a host, the tenant notifies
   the host if it does work for another activity that would result in a reimbursement.
   1.8.6. Function as a control point for accepting orders for in-house technical effort and for managing
   work the ordering activity requests.
10                                                                  AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


     1.8.7. Optionally, assign a Functional Area Agreement Coordinator who provides and reviews the
     specific terms and provisions relating to their functional area and assists the cost and budget offices as
     necessary to assure accurate charges.

Section 1D—Guidance

1.9. RBA Procedures. After initial funding authority is sent to HQ AFMC by SAF/FMB, send requests
through channels to HQ AFMC/FMA for initial and additional RBA if not using automatic apportion-
ment. (This procedure assumes that you have authority to retain the funds used for the work.)
     1.9.1. Research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) (3600) RBA is controlled by HQ AFMC
     at the total appropriation level, citing BPAC 690000. As valid orders are received, the budget office,
     with the assistance from the FSO, will load the RBA to appropriate BPACs (for example, 696999,
     699999, 69620C, 69420C) for recording and reporting. When citing funds, refer to figure 1.3, BPAC
     Coding Structure. All BPACs must be approved by HQ AFMC/FMA before initial use. The FSO/
     DFAS must record commitments, obligations, and expenditures under the appropriate 6 digit BPAC,
     not at the BPAC 690000 level. The FSO will send the local budget office a status report for BPAC
     690000.
     1.9.2. Procurement RBA funds, issued by HQ AFMC under OAC 47 for procurement appropriations
     57*3010, (BPAC 180000), 57*3011 (BPAC 360000), 57*3020 (BPAC 280000), and 57*3080 (BPAC
     870000), will be accounted for, reported, billed, and collected by AFMC activities. Establish CP
     accounts receivable records (UFO, FOU, FOC) in FT J records, along with the applicable reimburs-
     able BPACs 995000, 996000, and 997000 (AIR FORCE DATA DICTIONARY (AFDD)), and report
     them monthly in the RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report to DFAS-DE no later than the fifth working
     day following the end of each month..
     1.9.3. Operation and Maintenance (O&M), appropriation 57*3400 (fund code 30) has been autho-
     rized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for automatic apportionment of reimburse-
     ments. SAF/FMBO has authority to automatically increase the OMB apportionment up to the planned
     amount of anticipated reimbursements expected to be received during the current year of execution at
     the departmental level.
     1.9.4. HQ AFMC controls only the total RBA provided to a specific AFMC activity at the appropria-
     tion level if automatic apportionment is not in effect. With automatic apportionment for appropriation
     3400, the local budget offices load reimbursements as they are earned. (No target is given to the MAJ-
     COM or base budget office.) For MIPRs, orders, and agreements that the performing agency must for-
     mally accept, the sum of the unfilled plus filled orders must equal the sum of the amounts shown on
     the latest amendment or basic order. Do not decrease the amount of a customer's UFO until formal
     documentation is received from the customer, except at end of year (EOY). See DFAS-DE 7220.1-R
     for year-end closing procedures. Based on the 30 September RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE report, RBA
     will be reduced to the amount of reimbursement realized (obligated unfilled, FOU, and FOC).

1.10. Citing DBA or RBA (for RDT&E and Procurement funds only). Cite RBA for accomplish-
ment of project orders (DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11a, Chapter 2) and other approved reimbursable orders.
Make every effort to cite RBA initially on reimbursable transactions, such as travel orders, purchase
orders, and contracts. Three exceptions are: payrolls, reimbursable costs identified by the Interim Work
Information Management System (IWIMS) and Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES), and vehicle
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                            11


integrated management system (VIMS) costs. Payroll costs must be funded initially from DBA. Charges
to reimbursable customers identified by ACES and VIMS must be funded from DBA, since they are inter-
faced into the GAFS and the ACES Schedule of Reimbursements and Refunds or Job Order Cost
Accounting System (JOCAS) - related extracts do not identify the appropriations used to initially finance
the service or materiel provided. When DBA is cited, the transfer of accrued expenditures (identified as
reimbursable) from the direct program to the reimbursable program must be recorded before preparing
month-end reports. Estimates are described in paragraph 1.16., and must be recorded when actual accruals
are not known. See paragraph 1.19. for DBA-to-RBA transfer limitations.

1.11. Orders extending Over Several FYs. OUSD Memo, “Accounting Policy Changes for Customer
Orders Funded by Multiple Year Appropriations (COFMYA)”, 21 Aug 96 rescinded authority to roll for-
ward unobligated customer orders to follow-on fiscal years. AFMC will footnote their annual statements
with the information required by OUSD. Footnotes will continue until a new process is implemented.
Orders received in the current year, amending an existing prior year order, will still be recorded as a UFO
against the current-year RBA. For new orders received in the current year, cite the current-year RBA.
Record earnings in the normal manner and associate them with applicable obligations. Account for reim-
bursements collected under the appropriation credited when reimbursements were earned. If collections
exceed savings due to advances, see paragraph 1.17.3.4. Earnings and collections will be associated with
obligations. In other words, reimbursable obligations incurred in a given FY will be supported by earnings
and collections credited in the same FY. Funding rules and practices vary with different appropriations.
AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter 5, provides guidance for each appropriation. At the end of the FY, handle
the unfilled portion of the order in the accounting records according Section E to Chapter 3, Paragraph
C3.3, Fiscal Year End Accounting Actions.

1.12. Service Performed In-House:
   1.12.1. AFMCI 65-602 provides reimbursement and pricing guidance defining responsibilities and
   procedures for budgeting, funding and reporting RDT&E support costs at AFMC test centers and
   AFRL. This instruction describes funding relationships between AFMC program and project manag-
   ers and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD)-designated (T&E) activities and the relationship
   between R&D customers with AFRL.
   1.12.2. DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 2 establishes policy and procedures for all Air Force
   activities in issuing and accepting AF Form 185, Project Order. AF Form 185 is a specific order to
   manufacture materials, supplies, and equipment, to do other work or service, placed with and accepted
   by a separately managed and financed government -owned and operated organization. AF Form 185
   is a reimbursable order that is issued by the requiring organization (user-buyer) to the performing
   organization (performer) to support the in-house technical effort.
   1.12.3. Program or project mission funds are used to reimburse the support funds for work effort asso-
   ciated with orders requiring in-house effort. Reimburse T&E activities from user program or project
   mission funds for direct costs and other applicable costs. AFMCI 65-601 defines reimbursable costs.
   Charge reimbursable costs of FMS according to DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 15. Bill other reimbursable
   charges according to individual support agreements, for example, those with NASA and the 30th and
   45th Space Wings. Still other non-US government activities, but not FMS transactions, may be billed
   for user charges according to DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 4.
12                                                               AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


     1.12.4. Program introduction (PI) and statement of capability (SOC) documentation (or the equiva-
     lent) are prepared to support advance planning work on an order for in-house technical support. The
     requesting activity prepares the PI document and identifies the work that will be requested. The per-
     forming activity prepares the SOC and estimates what the work will cost. An AFMC Form 607, Bud-
     get Estimate Agreement (Cost of Test and Evaluation (T&E) Support or Other In-House
     Technical Effort) may be used for providing a documented cost estimate. It will be signed by both the
     performing and ordering activity authorized representatives, as noted on the form. Send copies of
     reimbursable orders resulting from PI and SOC documents to the local budget office and the FSO.

1.13. Supplier-Receiver Support
     1.13.1. DODI 4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental and Interagency Support, and AFPD 25-2,
     Support Agreements, provide policies and guidance for interservice support and support between
     DOD components and between DOD components and other federal agencies. Support is documented
     by completing DD Form 1144, Support Agreement.
     1.13.2. AFMCI 65-601 provides guidance for formulating intracommand support. When an intracom-
     mand organization requires above standard support, use DD Form 1144 to document the required sup-
     port and reimbursement required.
     1.13.3. For details on support policy and procedures in general, see AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter
     7. For details on specific functional areas, see the applicable functional prescribing directives.
     1.13.4. Support for government contractors requires specific authorizing provision in the contract
     (see para 5.3.).
     1.13.5. International Agreements are prepared under AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding, Record-
     ing and Maintaining International Agreements.
     1.13.6. NASA obtains support through departmental agreement developed according to policy and
     instructions from higher authority and subsequent implementing instructions from HQ AFMC (see
     para 4.1.).

1.14. Support Performed by Contract:
     1.14.1. Customers may submit orders for materiel and services that will not be performed in-house.
     The support they request may be provided under separate contract with a commercial contractor or it
     may be combined into contracts for AFMC requirements.
     1.14.2. When contract support is provided on a reimbursable basis (rather than by direct citation),
     copies of the request and acceptance are sent to the FSO and budget office. They are recorded as
     UFOs and are used as documentation to establish accounts receivable.

1.15. Awarding an RBA-Funded Contract Before Receipt of Orders. (Applicable to federal govern-
ment agencies only). At the start of the FY, AFMC activities frequently award contracts that are funded
entirely or in part with RBA funds. Thus, RBA obligations exceed total orders received. When this
occurs, the commander or, as designated by the commander, the comptroller or comparable official of the
performing activity will send the FSO an AF Form 406, MORD, for the difference between the orders
received and the RBA obligation. This AF Form 406 will be valid for 120 days, without a DBA obligation
having to be recorded, and may be extended for an additional 60 days by the commander. If valid orders
are not received within this time period, the RBA obligations will be transferred to the performer's DBA
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                              13


funds as explained in paragraph 1.20.. The commander's (or comptroller's) AF Form 406 will support a
single Fund Type J (reimbursement) record with a UFO equal to the amount of the AF Form 406. Record
performance in the absence of an order against this AF Form 406-supported J record but do not bill or col-
lect reimbursements. As reimbursable orders are received, reduce the AF Form 406-supported J record
and establish a separate J record for each order. Once an order is received, bill or collect any FOU balance.

1.16. Recording Estimates of DBA-Funded Reimbursements. The budget office or organizational
focal point will record an estimate of monthly earned reimbursements (for accruals or whenever required)
on a letter to FSO who will then process the estimate using a journal voucher, debiting RBA and crediting
DBA. In no case should the estimate exceed total reimbursement expenditure level. For any given month,
calculate this estimate by averaging the actual earnings of the three preceding months, plus or minus any
known deviations. For example, calculate estimated earnings for January by totaling the actual earnings of
October, November, and December, dividing by three, and adjusting for any known significant changes in
January. Record the estimate of the monthly earned reimbursement in Air Force element of expense/
investment code (EEIC) 599 or record the reimbursements by individual EEIC as a credit accrual (balance
ID U) in the DBA account and as a debit accrual in the RBA account. Record an earned (filled) reimburse-
ment accounts receivable (FT J or M) for like amount under the appropriate SCs. Use of local responsibil-
ity center/cost center (RC/CC) is optional. Record the estimates monthly and keep them on the books until
the actual earning for the month (normally the following month) are recorded. When recording actual
earnings, use the detail Air Force EEIC and reverse the applicable monthly estimate. Follow up on EOY
estimates aggressively so the process can be completed by 30 November, unless circumstances make this
impossible. If any of these transactions result in reimbursable obligations exceeding a reimbursable order,
comply with paragraph 1.20.. For O&M funds: organizations utilizing cost systems with O&M funding
must follow these procedures. However, for other organizations, estimated earnings can be recorded in the
"M" record against the reimbursable order as a filled uncollected transaction (FOU). If an FOU is estab-
lished in the "M" record, no "L" record transaction is required.

1.17. When To Record Reimbursement:
   1.17.1. Anticipated Reimbursements. Record anticipated reimbursements in the same amount as the
   estimated RBA projection developed by the budget office. If orders accepted exceed the amount of
   RBA loaded, immediately increase the RBA to reflect the increase in orders accepted and anticipated
   reimbursements.
   1.17.2. Recording Levels of UFOs:
       1.17.2.1. Record locally generated support quarterly or annually with the amount of support
       expected to be provided. The budget office will provide an AF Form 406 for this amount, based on
       the annual financial plan (para 1.3.7.).
       1.17.2.2. Record commander or comptroller emergency approvals as AF Forms 406 are received.
       1.17.2.3. Record customer orders as they are received and for the amounts accepted. When orders
       prepared within existing directives require resources beyond 30 September, they require special
       consideration. Any order accepted under the authority of the Economy Act will have any unobli-
       gated (unearned) amounts returned to the ordering activity. Therefore, you must work closely with
       the ordering activity to return the funds as soon as possible so the activity can utilize those funds.
       1.17.2.4. Record UFOs as follows:
14                                                                AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


            1.17.2.4.1. 57*3600, *3010, *3011, *3020, *3080. Record the amounts of UFOs in FT J
            records with the SC and reimbursable order number.
            1.17.2.4.2. 57*3400. Update FT M records at the RC/CC code, EEIC, SC, and reimbursable
            order number level necessary to maintain fund control. The FSO and budget offices will deter-
            mine the level.
     1.17.3. Filled Customer Orders:
        1.17.3.1. Record filled customer orders upon receiving documentation that materiel was delivered
        to the customer or services were performed. If the FSO uses self-reimbursement procedures,
        record as a filled customer order collected. When self-reimbursement procedures are not used,
        record as a filled customer order uncollected.
        1.17.3.2. Upon receiving orders and subsequently placing them on contract, evidence of contrac-
        tor performance or partial payments made for costs incurred is justification to record a filled order
        and bill the customer.
        1.17.3.3. At the close of an accounting period, when it is known that costs have been incurred or
        orders have been filled but documentation is not available, document and record estimated earn-
        ings as filled customer order uncollected and adjust the estimate when actual earnings are docu-
        mented. See paragraph 1.16. for documenting estimates of DBA-funded reimbursements.
        1.17.3.4. Advance payments do not meet the criteria of a filled order because there is no evidence
        showing services or materiel were delivered. When an advanced payment is received, enter the
        advance as UFO, using the appropriate vendor code and a positive FOC and a negative FOU,
        using type vendor codes 1, 2, 3, or 6 as applicable. As performance occurs, reduce the amount in
        UFO and increase FOU using the applicable vendor code. When performance is complete (deliv-
        ery or service), reverse the posted vendor code and record an FOC using the applicable vendor
        code. If additional collection or refund is due, take appropriate action at this time (see DFAS-DE
        7077.2-M).
        1.17.3.5. Making progress payments to a contractor does not usually mean the order should be
        recorded as filled. Record the order as filled when the progress payments have been recouped and
        the end item has been delivered. However, if the customer desires, the service or agency, on an
        individual basis, can be billed for progress payments. In this instance, record a filled order when
        the progress payment is made and bill the customer accordingly. However, do not identify the
        progress billings with 9940 in FT J. For FMS filled customer order procedures, see DOD
        7000.14-R, Chapter 15.
     1.17.4. Recording Collections. Record upon processing the collection side of the SF 1080 or receipt
     of payment.
     1.17.5. Disposition of Collection. When appropriate, credit amounts collected for services or materiel
     provided on a reimbursable basis to the appropriation that incurred the original costs. Excess collec-
     tions will be returned to the customer or deposited to a Miscellaneous Receipt Account of the Trea-
     sury. See figure 1.2 additional information.

1.18. Beginning Work or Continuing Work Without an Order or Amendment. (Applicable to fed-
eral government agencies only) Except in an emergency, reimbursable work will not be started before
an order is known to exist and reimbursable work will not continue against an existing order when there
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             15


is a lack of customer funds. A telephone call or e-mail to the performing activity with the customer num-
ber, date funded amount, and name of authorizing official is acceptable. In an emergency, the performing
activity commander or, at the commander's designation, the comptroller or comparable official may
approve starting work in the absence of an order or continuing work in excess of customer funds. A copy
of the approval document and an AF Form 406 will be sent to the FSO. The AF Form 406 will be valid for
120 days without a DBA obligation being recorded; the AF Form 406 may be extended by the commander
for 60 days. If valid orders or amendments are not received within this period, RBA obligations will be
transferred to the performer's DBA funds as explained in paragraph 1.20. The FSO will follow up with the
acceptance officer to ensure receipt of the order or amendment. Performance in emergencies will be
recorded as FOU and will not be billed until an order or amendment is received. When performance on an
order is 75 percent completed, the customer shall be notified by the performing activity if additional funds
will be required to finalize the order.

1.19. Transferring Accrued Expenditures from DBA to RBA.
   1.19.1. 57*3600 Appropriation. If reimbursable obligations are initially funded with DBA funds,
   record estimates monthly and record adjustments as soon as they are identified. This identification and
   transfer is necessary to release direct funds for financing AFMC assigned missions. Transfer accrued
   expenditures from the applicable DBA to the related RBA BPAC only to the extent reimbursable
   orders or the commander's or comptroller's approved UFOs are available. Make transfers by using OF
   1017-G, Journal Voucher, and support them according to DFAS-DE 7010.1-R. Record these amounts
   as filled customer funds in the FT J or M records to the extent customer funds or the commander's or
   comptroller's approvals are available. If sufficient customer funds are not available to cover the reim-
   bursable effort, the excess will be recorded as an FOU against an approved AF Form 406 and no bill
   will be rendered until the order or amendment is received.
   1.19.2. 57*3400 Appropriation. If reimbursable obligations are initially funded with DBA funds,
   record estimates monthly and record adjustments as soon as they are identified. This identification and
   transfer is necessary to release direct funds for financing AFMC assigned missions. Transfer accrued
   expenditures from the applicable DBA FT "L" record to the related sales coded FT "L" record to
   record RBA only to the extent reimbursable orders or the commander's or comptroller's approved
   UFOs are available. Make transfers by using OF 1017-G, Journal Voucher, and support them accord-
   ing to DFAS-DE 7010.1-R. Record these amounts as filled customer funds in the FT J or M records to
   the extent customer funds or the commander's or comptroller's approvals are available. If sufficient
   customer funds are not available to cover the reimbursable effort, the excess will be recorded as an
   FOU against an approved AF Form 406 and no bill will be rendered until the order or amendment is
   received. Organizations utilizing cost systems must follow these procedures. However, other organi-
   zations may elect not to record the FT "L" record transactions.

1.20. When Reimbursable Accrued Expenditures Exceed Order or Approval. When DBA-funded
actual performance exceeds the amount of the customer's order plus the level of the commander's or
comptroller's approval, DBA-funded performance will not be transferred to RBA. When initially charged
to RBA, performance in excess of the customer order and the commander's or comptroller's approval will
be transferred to the performer's DBA immediately. Ensure sufficient DBA is available to cover the
chargeback. These procedures also apply when the commander's or comptroller's approval expires with-
out receipt of a customer order or amendment. Organizations utilizing cost systems with O&M funding
must follow the procedures in paragraph 1.20.1.1. paragraph 1.20.1.2., and paragraph 1.20.1.3.. However,
16                                                               AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


other organizations may elect to let the FT "L" record obligation remain in DBA until a valid bill is pro-
cessed. If this is elected, the organization must follow the procedures in paragraph 1.20.1.4..
     1.20.1. For 3400-funded reimbursements:
        1.20.1.1. Reduce FOU and unfilled customer orders in applicable RC/CC and EEIC in FT M and
        sales code.
        1.20.1.2. Reduce reimbursable obligations in applicable RC/CC and EEIC in FT L and sales code.
        1.20.1.3. Establish obligations in the amount reduced in (para.1.20.1.2.) as a charge to RC/CC
        XX1099 and EEIC 599.99 in FT L. If reimbursable obligations are civilian pay costs, then charge
        these to RC/CC XX 1099 and EEICs 39X.
        1.20.1.4. Reduce RBA, FOU, and UFO in applicable RC/CC and EEIC in FT M and SC. This
        action automatically increases the DBA obligation.
     1.20.2. For 3600, 3010, 3011, 3020, and 3080 funded reimbursements:
        1.20.2.1. Establish a credit obligation record in FT A or C RBA records using applicable BPAC
        (Figure 1.3) and EEIC 599.99 for the amount of the chargeback.
        1.20.2.2. Establish a positive obligation in FT A or C DBA record, using applicable PE/BPAC and
        EEIC 599.99 for the chargeback.
        1.20.2.3. Reduce applicable filled orders uncollected in FT J records by the amount of the charge-
        back. Remove the unfilled customer order balance from the FT J record.

1.21. Calculation of Labor. Charges for reimbursable work performed by AFMC field activities are fig-
ured as follows:
     1.21.1. Civilian Labor. Civilian labor is not reimbursable from Air Force customers except as fol-
     lows:
        1.21.1.1. T&E activities and AFRL operating under JOCAS II. Civilian labor (government
        employees) will consist of direct labor plus the civilian benefit acceleration rate to cover annual
        leave, holidays, sick leave, contributions for group life insurance, civil service retirement or
        FERS, social security, thrift savings plan, and health benefits. Overtime, holiday pay, and night
        differential are figured at the normal authorized rates without applying an acceleration factor.
        1.21.1.2. Activities not operating under JOCAS II comply with DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
        Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level and AFI 25-201.
        1.21.1.3. As an optional basis, when a laboratory is both the customer and the performer, labora-
        tory civilian pay may be treated as a refund between the management and support (M&S) direct
        BPACs and mission program direct BPACs. This will be done by charging EEIC 392RR in the
        M&S direct BPACs and charging the proper mission program direct BPACs. Costs first incurred
        in the M&S direct BPACs will be transferred on a refund basis from the M&S direct to the M&S
        reimbursable BPAC using the pertinent EEIC originally bearing the costs. All accounting records,
        to include the Civilian Manpower and Funding, RCS: DD-COMP(AR)1092, (DOD Budget Guid-
        ance Manual Reports) must reflect accurate civilian pay data for both direct and reimbursement
        obligations.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                            17


   1.21.2. Military Labor. Charges are billed at the military standard rates plus accelerations for leave,
   holiday, and other personnel cost factors as prescribed in DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, chapter 30. Standard
   Rates For Military Personnel Services. Military labor is not reimbursable from DOD users (DFAS
   Interim Guidance, Accounting for Commitments), but is reimbursable from all other users. These
   costs are provided to DOD customers for information only.

1.22. Accessorial Charges, Additive Surcharges and Discounts. If accessorial charges or other addi-
tional costs cause reimbursements to exceed expenditures in the reimbursable authority, make appropriate
adjustments between RBA and DBA. Use OF 1017-G to process these adjustments. Increase the expendi-
tures in the RBA records and decrease the expenditures in the DBA records.

1.23. Billing and Collecting. Bill the ordering activity promptly for reimbursement. Bills must be sent
on a scheduled basis (at least monthly) as costs are accrued, when the materiel is delivered, or when ser-
vice is performed. When recurring charges are involved, as with supplier/receiver support, prepare bill-
ings at least monthly, except as in paragraph 1.24.. Since billings are normally based on accruals, they
may need to be adjusted when actual costs are known. Orders must remain open until all related undeliv-
ered orders outstanding and accrued expenditures unpaid have been paid, or appropriate adjustments
made, and all earnings have been billed and collected. For billing procedures, see paragraph 4.1. and
paragraph 5.5.. Also refer to AFMCI 65-601, and AFMCI 65-602, and AFI 65-601, as applicable.

1.24. Billing Waivers:
   1.24.1. Suspend monthly reimbursement billings to an Air Force or other DoD component until they
   total $1,000 or more in the fiscal year. Then, bill that amount and subsequent amounts for the remain-
   der of the fiscal year. Prepare reimbursement vouchers at the end of succeeding monthly billing
   cycles, after the transaction's cumulative value met or exceeded $1,000 for the fiscal year. Billings
   may be accumulated until the amount totals $1,000, but not beyond the end of a FY. However, no later
   than the end of the fiscal year, all amounts of billings held in suspense for an Air Force or other DoD
   component must be billed even though the amount is less than $1,000. Notify the ordering agency of
   the waiver in writing. Amounts waived will remain in General Ledger Account 311. However,
   Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), Corps of Engineer Civil Work Revolving Fund and other
   DoD revolving fund transactions or support will not be waived but reimbursed regardless of amount
   involved. Support the billings with complete documentation of all sales. Record sales as filled orders.
   These provisions do not apply to consumable supplies issued to host base support units as covered in
   AFI 65-601, Volume 1. DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 3, Paragraph 030503, contains these
   procedures. Other exceptions to the $1,000 rule are class-B telephones, toll charges, tenant-peculiar
   communications, and contract field service support provided to NASA. Paragraph 4.1.2. contains spe-
   cific billing procedures for NASA. Also, for non-DoD U.S. Government activities, the billing organi-
   zation must bill all suspended amounts at the end of the year, even though the amount is less than
   $1,000. See AFI 65-601, Vol 1, paragraph 5.5.1.
   1.24.2. When funding reimbursable support, except subsistence, to two or more receivers (tenants)
   funded by the same parent organization under a single allotment of funds (or operating budget), con-
   sider them as an entity (single tenant of parent organization) for billing and waiver purposes. Send
   billings, except for subsistence, to the offices the tenant designates. When subsistence charges are
   billed to a different office than other support, consider the charges separately for waiver and billings
   purposes.
18                                                                AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


     1.24.3. For other rules concerning Air Force tenants, see AFI 65-601, Vol 1, paragraph 7.10.

1.25. Billing for Services. Requests received by AFMC activities for RDT&E services are either per-
formed in-house or placed on contract. When placed on contract, the contract usually provides that the
contractor will prepare written studies or research documents. AFMC will not postpone billing the order-
ing activity until receiving the research studies or reports, but will bill based on partial payments. Follow
this procedure only when other documents denoting delivery or performance are not used.

1.26. Supporting Documentation for Billings. To substantiate the SF 1080, T&E Activities and AFRL
will use the listings produced by the JOCAS II, identifying reimbursable costs incurred. Support all other
billings by using documentation prescribed in DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reim-
bursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level. When DFAS payment offices documentation is
required to support billings to customers, a request by contract number must be made to the paying activ-
ity when the contract is issued.

1.27. Special Billing Requirements:
     1.27.1. NASA Contract Field Service Support. Send billing to HQ NASA according to the current Air
     Force and NASA agreement. See paragraph 4.2.
     1.27.2. Defense Re-Utilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). Do not prepare billings for reim-
     bursable costs incurred in supporting DRMO activities (AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Chapter 10, Section D).
     These reimbursements are collected centrally at DFAS-DE.

1.28. Aging of Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable will be aged at least monthly. The base or
"zero" day for the aging schedule is the day a fully documented billing is sent to the debtor. If there is no
response within 30 days, send a follow-up letter. It is advisable to follow-up further, either personally or
by telephone. If accounts still remain unpaid, comply with DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct,
Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level, part five, when reporting to
DFAS-DE.

1.29. Documentation to Support Delinquent Accounts Receivable. W h e n s e n d i n g d e l i n q u e n t
accounts receivable to DFAS-DE for collection or disposition, include all applicable documents and cor-
respondence. Include memorandums that reflect telephone follow-up, pertinent discussions, and so on.
DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base
Level, Section five, gives a complete description of supporting documentation.

1.30. Unique Reimbursable Transaction Coding:
     1.30.1. Reimbursable transactions have unique coding. The coding applies to all funds authorized and
     issued for the appropriation symbols and BPACs listed in Table 1.1..
     1.30.2. The following coding instructions specify the information required in AF Form 1730, Trans-
     mittal Register Transcript, field 71-76:
        1.30.2.1. Grant Aid. The identification will consist of the program year (PY) in positions 71 and
        72 and the record control number (RCN) in positions 73 through 76 (for example, Y6AQ47 will
        be recorded Y6=PY 1976; AQ 47= RCN)
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             19


       1.30.2.2. FMS. The identification will consist of a blank(b) in position 71, the country geopoliti-
       cal code in positions 72 and 73, and the three-digit alpha master case identifier in positions 74
       through 76. The line item number will be recorded in the last three positions of field 26 (positions
       122-124).
       1.30.2.3. Other. The identification of all other reimbursable customer programs will consist of not
       more than six significant digits to identify the individual reimbursable order number.

1.31. Management Reports. Each AFMC funding activity will submit RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE
report for all funds identifies in OACs 36, 47, 53 and 58 to DFAS-DE.
   1.31.1. Responsible Subject Matter Area. Accounts Control area.
   1.31.2. Period Covered. Cumulative from inception.
   1.31.3. Report Concept, Format, and Due Dates. According to DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, chapter 32.

                                                  Chapter 2

                                SUPPORT TO AIR FORCE ACTIVITIES

2.1. Appropriated Funds from Other AFMC Receivers. The following policy and procedures apply
to support that is provided to AFMC units located on an AFMC base.
     2.1.1. Requirement for Support. Each AFMC center/base will establish a standard support level of
     service applicable/available to all AFMC intracommand activities they are supporting. The standard
     support level (nonreimbursable) facilities and service that one AFMC provider (host) provides to
     another AFMC receiver activity will be at the same level of quantity and quality as the host gives its
     own internal activities. Formal AFI 25-201 and AFMCI 65-601 DD Forms 1144, Support Agree-
     ments, are required whenever there is an exchange of manpower or funding resources, or whenever
     above standard support is requested from the receiver. Categories and levels of service will be defined
     as either standard or above standard support by AFMC activities. When support service is above stan-
     dard, an essential element in establishing support service agreement is the recognition and acceptance
     by the receiver of the services received and the cost associated with the supplier providing the service.
     Completion of a DD Form 1144 is required to substantiate this agreement. Procedures for completing
     DD Forms 1144 are contained in AFI 25-201.
     2.1.2. Funding of Support When neither the Supplier or Receiver are Defense Working Capital Fund
     (DWCF) Organizations. The supplier will provide a standard level of common support without reim-
     bursement for all non DWCF intracommand receivers. Nonreimbursable support consists of those
     functions that represent the level of support provided to all receivers of a particular service, designated
     by authority as the standard expectation. Standard support includes essential infrastructure functions
     (e.g. fire protection, base wide security police, personnel, comptroller, safety, legal, etc.) not directly
     associated to a program/activity's missions requirement, but nevertheless specifically required for
     AFMC activities to operate from a given location. Reimbursable support is a level of support service
     that exceeds the standard support service established by the supplier. These requirements can be either
     for a peculiar/unique type of service or for increased quantity or frequency of common services. Intra-
     command receivers will be responsible for funding above standard, peculiar, or unique support ser-
     vices.
     2.1.3. Funding for Support When Receiver is a DWCF activity. Usually, DWCF activities will be
     billed all costs (direct, indirect, general and administrative (G&A)) for all services provided by the
     supplier installation in accordance with DODI 4000.19 effective 1 Oct 93. (Note: Defense Commis-
     sary Agency (DECA) is the only exception) The host and DWCF activity will negotiate, document
     and maintain these reimbursable requirements in a support agreement. Support agreements with these
     activities must be completed and all support costs calculated and identified in the support agreement
     as reimbursable. If the AFMC receiver is part of DWCF, the receiver is required to reimburse total
     cost of all support to suppliers. DODI 4000.19 and AFI 25-201 provide guidance on allocating costs.
     A list of active DWCF business areas are listed in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 7.8.2.2. Base
     resources provided to DWCF activities are identified by the following program element codes:
        2.1.3.1. XXX56 - environmental compliance.
        2.1.3.2. XXX76 - minor construction projects less than $300,000.
        2.1.3.3. XXX78 - real property maintenance/repair.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             25


       2.1.3.4. XXX79 - real property services.
       2.1.3.5. XXX90 - audio-visual information services.
       2.1.3.6. XXX95 - base communications.
       2.1.3.7. XXX96 - base operations.

2.2. Appropriated Funds of Other Air Force Major Commands (Intraservice Relationships). T h e
following policy and procedures apply to supporting other Air Force MAJCOM receivers (tenants). Addi-
tional guidance is provided in AFI 25-201 and AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraphs 7.4 through 7.8.1.
   2.2.1. Requirements for Support. MAJCOMs will determine their own mission unique requirements.
   Upon request and within capability, AFMC suppliers will provide administrative and logistical sup-
   port to intraservice receivers consistent with AFI 25-201 and AFI 65-601. AFMC suppliers will
   administer funds made available by the receiver's parent command to support the receiver. All units on
   an installation receive standard support on an equal basis as defined by the base and applicable func-
   tional AFI's. The receiver establishes any unique capability required by the receiver, if such capability
   is not present or projected requirement of the supplier.
       2.2.1.1. The tenant receiver must tell the host supplier its requirements early enough to allow
       funding consideration during budget formulation. When the host isn't informed budget lead time
       away, the receiver may not "demand" funding from the host. If funds aren't available, the host sub-
       mits an unfunded requirement to its next higher headquarters for funding consideration. As a last
       resort, the tenant command may fund the specific unfunded tenant requirement.
       2.2.1.2. When a tenant receiver is on or near an AFMC activity that can support it, consolidate all
       support with the AFMC host supplier activity. Do not duplicate equipment and manpower when it
       would be more efficient and economical to consolidate functions.
       2.2.1.3. Support will be between AFMC supplier and other MAJCOM receivers will be docu-
       mented on DD Forms 1144 as prescribed in AFI 25-201.
       2.2.1.4. The supplier may not reduce or end the approved level of support in the current support
       agreement without a minimum of 180 calendar days written notice unless mutually agreed upon
       by both supplier and receiver. Likewise the receiver will provide the supplier with at least 180 cal-
       endar days written advance notice when reduction in support is expected.
   2.2.2. Funding of Support.
       2.2.2.1. The receiver command will budget and provide appropriate funds for the following tenant
       requirements:
       2.2.2.2. Civilian personnel costs.
       2.2.2.3. Travel costs for military and civilian assigned personnel.
       2.2.2.4. Purchase of expense materiel, supplies and equipment from DWCF Supply Management
       divisions and local procurement sources.
       2.2.2.5. Contractual services, except common services (i.e., trash hauling, snow removal)
       2.2.2.6. Intermediate in-house maintenance of aircraft, missiles and other equipment, only if the
       supplier activity does not have organic capability to perform maintenance or the receiver activity
       is organized to perform the maintenance as specified in AFI 25-201 and AFI 21-101.
26                                                                AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


        2.2.2.7. Vehicle maintenance for all vehicles owned or permanently dispatched by their organiza-
        tion.
        2.2.2.8. Maintenance of unique equipment required to meet the receiver's organizational mission.
        2.2.2.9. Contract Maintenance to include all mission support equipment, common support equip-
        ment, vehicles, and any other equipment that is the tenant's property, except the tenant's office
        machines and equipment, dormitory furniture and furnishings, and real property installed equip-
        ment (RPIE).
        2.2.2.10. Transportation for receiver's cargo movement chargeable to organization's O&M funds.
     2.2.3. AFMC Funding Responsibilities. AFMC will fund the following requirements for intraservice
     receivers:
        2.2.3.1. Intermediate-level maintenance of aircraft, missiles, and general-purpose vehicles not
        permanently dispatched to or owned by the receiver, ground power equipment, and so on, if the
        receiver does not have the organized capability. (Doesn't apply to work done at Air Logistics Cen-
        ters which is reimbursed by the receiver.)
        2.2.3.2. Real property maintenance activity (RPMA) projects for maintenance, repair, and minor
        construction of on-base facilities, whether work is performed in-house or by contract, except
        minor construction projects with a funded cost of over $2,000.
        2.2.3.3. Maintenance of RPIE for on-base facilities, whether done in-house or by contract.
        2.2.3.4. Expense materiel used by the supplier to maintain buildings and grounds the receiver
        occupies and to provide base support common to all personnel and organizations.
        2.2.3.5. Data processing equipment, including control panels in the receiver's activity, used
        mainly for common management support.
        2.2.3.6. Operating and maintaining receiver occupied off-base buildings, if the supplier leases and
        rents them for other base unit occupancy.
        2.2.3.7. Expense materiel (base/stock funded supplies) issued without reimbursement to those
        receivers on or near a base.
        2.2.3.8. Base procured investment equipment (BPIE) including rental, which the receiver needs to
        fulfill its approved equipment authorization. The supplier buys investment items locally using the
        3080 appropriation (BP 84XXXX) and rents investment items using its O&M type funds. At an
        RDT&E funded installation, 3600 funds rental of investment equipment for an O&M funded
        receiver. Exception: An RDT&E receiver funds both procurement and rental of investment equip-
        ment on a 3400 funded supplier base.
        2.2.3.9. Contract maintenance for all office machines and equipment, dormitory furnishings, and
        furniture.

   2.4.1. Requirement for Support. Receivers in this category may be units or activities assigned to
   AFMC bases.
       2.4.1.1. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Units. AFMC suppliers must ensure that Air
       Force Reserve and Air National Guard units receive the same level of support as other tenant units
       on their installation. This includes but is not limited to base level support services, annual tours,
       unit training assemblies, peacetime training, and weekend operations.
       2.4.1.2. AFMC suppliers should also apply funding guidance for rotational units, deployments,
       and JCS exercises to ANG and AFRES units assigned duties to support the active forces, other
       than for training. The command hosting the rotation, deployment, or JCS exercise will fund all
       costs, except civilian pay and TDY.

        nearest Air Force base responsible for logistic support. For further details, see AFI 65-601, Vol-
        ume 1, paragraph 7.33.
        2.4.2.3. AFI 10-2701 provides guidance for disposing of and accounting for Air Force supplies
        and equipment issued to Air Force liaison offices.
        2.4.2.4. The Air Force CAP liaison offices are responsible for:
            2.4.2.4.1. Requesting logistical support from AFMC activities.

     ment, budget and fund according to AFI 25-201. Exceptions are made when both Air Force and ANG
     units use a non-Air Force facility jointly. When there are support agreements, use normal accounting
     and billing procedures. The organization providing the support advises the FSO or DAO who is
     responsible for recording the accounts receivable and for collecting from the receiver. When provid-
     ing depot maintenance to ANG units, see procedures for calculating and reimbursing in AFI 65-601,
     Volume 1, Chapter 16.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                               29


                                                Chapter 3

                             SUPPORT TO OTHER DOD ACTIVITIES

3.1. Military Departments and Agencies. The support AFMC provides to other DOD agencies is
termed "interservice support." It is provided on a recurring or nonrecurring basis according to DODI
4000.19, Interservice, Interdepartmental, and Interagency Support. The reimbursement procedures in this
chapter also apply to Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). DODD 5134.10 describes
funding and assigning DARPA projects to AFMC activities.

3.2. Interservice Support Relationships:
   3.2.1. DOD agencies must often locate units on or near an AFMC base. Best use of interservice sup-
   port gives overall economies without impairing military effectiveness. When a DOD component or
   government agency's facility supports or houses a non-DWCF DOD component or government
   agency's activity, interservice support will be reimbursable as follows:
       3.2.1.1. DOD component receivers will reimburse the supplier according to AFI 65-601, Volume
       1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 7. Sometimes units or activities of one military
       department (receiver) reside on another military department's (supplier) installation. The host may
       provide facilities and services for the receiver unit after completing an Interservice Support
       Agreement. Based on these agreements, DoD installations also provide cross-servicing support to
       one service's units or activities next to or near another service's installation. See DoDI 4000.19 for
       guidance on support for joint use between the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Agencies.
       3.2.1.2. When performing administrative or logistic support, AFMC suppliers will complete DD
       Form 1144 to document Interservice Support Agreements between AFMC organizations and orga-
       nizations of other military services. DODI 4000.19 and AFI 25-201 define specific support and
       provide instructions for preparing these agreements.
       3.2.1.3. The AFMC supplier will act as the buying agency for materiel and as the performing
       agency for services as requested by the receiver activity. Requests are in the form of purchase
       requests, requisitions and cross-servicing orders. For budgeting and funding, cross-servicing
       divides into category one (reimbursable) and category two (direct cite).
           3.2.1.3.1. Under category one (reimbursable), Air Force activities act either as the ordering
           agency, procuring agency or performing agency. If it is the ordering agency, it must budget and
           fund for the cost of the items or services ordered. If it is the procuring or performing agency, it
           must budget on a reimbursable basis and fund the materiel or services for the ordering agency
           the same as for similar productions or services as for their own account.
           3.2.1.3.2. Under category two (direct cite), the contractor bills each ordering agency sepa-
           rately for articles delivered or services rendered, based on the ordering agency's instructions.
           But, when articles are delivered for storage to the procuring agency for the ordering agency's
           account, the agencies must make cross-disbursing arrangements so the procuring agency can
           pay vendor's invoices against funds cited by the ordering agency.
           3.2.1.3.3. Only orders placed under Section 601 of the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) are
           subject to deobligation as prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 1535 and implemented by DFAS-DE
30                                                                  AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


            Interim Guidance on Accounting for Obligations. Retain all other orders on the accounting
            records until liquidated, adjusted, or deobligated according to normal procedures.
            3.2.1.3.4. Issue project orders to a DoD agency only on a reimbursable basis. (Don't issue
            project orders to any activity that is responsible for furnishing the required materiel or services
            without reimbursement.)

3.3. Determining Cross-Servicing Charges. Base charges for cross-servicing on the following.
Depending on your agreement, apply more than one type of cross-servicing in one agreement.
     3.3.1. Use DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Reimbursable Operations Policy and Procedures to deter-
     mine reimbursable costs and amounts to collect for interservice support, unless another directive or
     instruction authorizes different reimbursements. Examples would be instructions governing major
     range and test facility bases, revolving fund (DWCF) operations, and foreign military sales. (Note:
     Reimbursable percentage rates for labor are implemented by DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct,
     Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level.)
     3.3.2. Compute charges for cross-servicing by activities operating an industrial fund cost accounting
     system according to Defense Business Operations Fund guidance and the business area's approved
     charter. DoD guidance on common service warehousing (that is, nonreimbursable) doesn't apply to
     industrial funds if they incur costs for services they provide.
     3.3.3. AFMC test centers must distinguish between administrative and logistic base support and T&E
     support. Base support functions are subject to reimbursable guidance in DODI 4000.19 and AFI
     25-201, while T&E support is subject to procedures in DODD 3200.11 and AFMCI 65-602.

3.4. Waiver for Reimbursement. When administrative and logistic support has been provided on a reim-
bursable basis, according to DD Form 1144, reimbursement may be waived and the support may be pro-
vided on a nonreimbursable basis when:
     3.4.1. The dollar value of support is less than $1,000 per year. However, charges for recurring-type
     support are accumulated to the end of the fiscal year and billed if the value totals $1,000 or more (see
     paragraph 1.24. for exceptions).
     3.4.2. There is no reasonable way to allocate the cost of support.
     3.4.3. The materiel transferred has been declared excess.

3.5. Interservice Support Funding:
     3.5.1. AFMC field activities will include in their budget estimates, financial plans and acquisition
     program provisions for:
        3.5.1.1. Nonreimbursable support provided to other DOD receivers.
        3.5.1.2. Estimate reimbursements for reimbursable support. This is based on known and fore-
        casted receiver requirements. These forecasted projections will be provided to the receiver for its
        budgetary use.
     3.5.2. Document funding arrangements clearly in DD Forms 1144 and establish responsibilities for
     reimbursement. When the AFMC activity acts as buying agent for another organization, and the items
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                               31


   are peculiar to that organization, cite the requiring organization's funds. However, it is HQ AFMC pol-
   icy to fund all item requisitions subject to consolidated purchases on reimbursable orders.
   3.5.3. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 7, identifies reimbursable
   and nonreimbursable support functions.
   3.5.4. Bill users for support costs that are reimbursable. Use SF 1080 to bill direct costs. Send a copy
   of the SF 1080 or documentation to support preparation of the SF 1080 to the DFAS Field Site. The
   Field Site will process the expenditure as a "for others" payment. The AFMC activity will send a copy
   of the form to the customer's program or project office showing both the amount of reimbursable
   direct costs and the total amount of the order including billings to date and balance remaining. Sup-
   porting data for users is specified in AFI 65-601, Volume 1.

3.6. Calculation of Charges. Charges for reimbursable work performed by AFMC field activities are
calculated for civilian labor according to paragraph 1.21.. Utilities provided on a reimbursement basis
are billed at cost. Warehouse services are provided generally on a common service nonreimbursable basis
between DOD components. However, ownership of warehousing facilities by some DLA components
may require reimbursement of storage charges for this service.

3.7. Joint Use of Facilities. When components of another DOD component use AFMC bases jointly,
responsibility for programming and funding the organization, construction, conversion alteration, modifi-
cation, or rehabilitation of required facilities and utilities, communication and transportation systems is as
follows:
   3.7.1. Facilities and Systems Financed from Military Construction Appropriations:
       3.7.1.1. Single-Use Facilities. The military department that requires the facility for its own use
       will fund the work involved.
       3.7.1.2. Joint-Use Facilities. HQ USAF or AFMC will fund the work involved.
       3.7.1.3. Utilities, Communications, and Transportation Systems. AFMC will fund when a
       receiver requires expanding or increasing the capacity of a system as prescribed in the AFMC
       base's master plan. When the systems are an integral part of any single-use facility and are
       required to connect with the main system, the military department requiring the facility will pro-
       vide the funds.
   3.7.2. Facilities and Systems Financed from Other Appropriations. The DOD receiver will finance
   the costs of initial repair, renovation, normal maintenance that has been deferred, and modification of
   existing facilities when the receiver requires them for its sole use and AFMC would not have other-
   wise performed the work.
   3.7.3. Maintenance of Facilities. The AFMC base supplier will finance structural maintenance and
   normal cyclical repair of existing facilities, including those assigned for the DOD component
   receiver's sole use. However, when the receiver finances and constructs new facilities, the service
   holding title to the property will be financially responsible for structural maintenance and cyclical
   repairs.

                                                 Chapter 4

                 SUPPORT TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES (NON-DOD)

4.1. Source of Authority. The Economy Act of 1932, Section 601 (Title 31 U.S.C. Sections 1535 and
1536), is the basis of authority for government agencies to provide/obtain services, supplies, and other
support from each other. The agencies provide support under separate agreements for orders between Air
Force activities and other United States government departments or agencies outside DoD. DoD activities
may enter into support agreements with non-DoD federal activities when the following criteria are met: (i)
the head of the major organizational unit ordering the support determines the funding is available to pay
for the support, (ii) it is in the best interests of the U.S. government, (iii) the DoD agency supplying the
activity is able to provide the support, (iv) the requested support cannot be provided conveniently or eco-
nomically by a commercial enterprise, and (v) the requested support does not conflict with any other
agency’s authority. Authority to negotiate these agreements below department or agency level, may be
delegated, although designees may not be lower than Senior Executive Service, Flag or General Officer
levels, per DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 3.
     4.1.1. When performing administrative or logistic support, AFMC suppliers will complete DD Form
     1144, to document Interagency Support Agreements between AFMC organizations and other Federal
     agencies. DODI 4000.19 defines specific support and provides procedures for preparing these agree-
     ments. Non-DOD receivers pay the pro-rata share for standard base support services received. They
     reimburse the supplier for direct, indirect and general and administrative costs (including all incre-
     mental costs associated with providing support above standard levels).
     4.1.2. When performing research and development support at AFRL or test and evaluation support at
     AFMC test centers, procedures and documentation are defined in AFMCI 65-602. When performing
     base operating support at these facilities, document these services according to DOD Instruction
     4000.19.

4.2. Support Provided to NASA. It is Air Force policy, to the extent compatible with its primary mis-
sion, to make its resources available to NASA on a reimbursable basis. Reimbursements must confirm to
DOD/NASA reimbursable agreements located on NASA web site: http://www.sti.nasa.gov/codeid/.
Many of these MOAs and Interagency agreements with NASA and Air Force are at AFRL, AFFTC and
AAC. The specific Air Force/NASA agreements are listed at:
http://www.sti.nasa.gov/codeid/afpage.htm.

4.3. Support and Funding. The support agreement must identify categories of support provided and
method of funding agreed upon. Unless departmental agreements provide otherwise, reimbursable
charges for materiel, work or services are determined as follows:
     4.3.1. Civilian labor is charged according to paragraph 1.21.1..
     4.3.2. Military labor charges are billed at standard rates according to DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, Chapter
     33.
     4.3.3. To determine charges for direct materiel, supplies, and equipment, see DOD 7000.14-R, Vol
     11B; AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as appropriate.
     4.3.4. When utilities are provided as a separate and distinct reimbursement, bill them at cost.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                            33


   4.3.5. Activities operating on an working capital-type cost accounting system will include direct
   labor, direct materiel, and overhead.
      4.3.5.1. Compute working capital fund charges according to Defense Working Capital Fund guid-
      ance and the business area's approved charter.
      4.3.5.2. Unless otherwise provided for in departmental agreements, determine charges for mate-
      riel, work, services and overhead according to DOD 7000.14-R, Vol 11B.
   4.3.6. When support is provided by contract, reimbursement is limited to contract costs incurred.
   4.3.7. Bill non-DOD federal government users for all direct costs attributable to providing the goods
   or services regardless of whether the servicing agency’s expenditures are increased. Actual costs also
   include indirect costs (overhead) to the extent they have significant relationship to providing goods
   and services and benefit the requesting agency. Administrative overhead is part of actual costs under
   the Economy Act. Recover these charges when you provide services to non-DoD agencies. New
   agreements will follow this reimbursement policy.
   4.3.8. Bill users for reimbursable support costs on SF 1080. Send a copy of the SF 1080 or documen-
   tation to support preparation of the SF 1080 to the DFAS Field Site. The AFMC activity will send a
   copy of the SF 1080 to the customer's program or project office showing the amount of reimbursable
   direct costs and the total amount of the orders, billings to date and remaining balance. Supporting data
   is specified in AFI 65-601, Volume 1. DoD activities usually suspend reimbursement, except for sup-
   port provided by working capital funds, when the accumulated value of services, materiel, and sup-
   plies furnished a government agency is less than $1,000 during a fiscal year. But, you must obtain
   reimbursement for these smaller amounts from working capital funds. Also, suspended amounts must
   be billed at the end of the fiscal year for non-DoD U.S government activities. (See para. 1.24..)

4.4. Methods of Funding Economy Act Orders.
   4.4.1. Reimbursement Method. By agreement, the performing agency finances the order using its
   own funds and is reimbursed later by the ordering agency. The ordering agency pays the performing
   agency upon completing the order or progressively as the order is completed. Usually, the parties
   complete these financial transactions by using SF 1080 or GSA Form 789. See DFAS-DE Interim
   Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level for billing
   and collection procedures.
   4.4.2. Direct Citation Method. Use this method when it's more feasible and more economical than the
   reimbursement method.
   4.4.3. Advance Payment Method. By agreement, the performing agency requires payment in advance
   from the ordering agency. The performing agency submits an SF 1080 bill to the ordering activity that
   makes the advance payment. The performing agency deposits the advance payment in a Consolidated
   Working Fund or a Working Capital Fund which it then uses to accomplish the Economy Act order.
   4.4.4. Transfer Appropriation Method. By agreement, the ordering agency transfers its funds to the
   performing agency to finance Economy Act orders, usually for construction and major procurement.
   Departmental level only (HQ USAF, etc.) uses this method. HQ USAF processes an SF 1151, Non
   Expenditure Transfer Authorization, through the Treasury Department. Under this method, the Air
   Force maintains the appropriation symbol from which funds were transferred, prefixed by the per-
   forming agency's symbol.
34                                                                AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


4.5. Executing Economy Act Orders. To the maximum extent possible, Air Force activities will finance
Economy Act orders received from or issued to government agencies outside the DoD using the direct
citation or the reimbursement method.
     4.5.1. In exceptional cases, if orders cannot be financed using these methods, advise SAF/FMBM
     through AFMC channels. List the pertinent facts and explain why you can't finance the Economy Act
     order using these methods. SAF/FMB will determine the financing method and advise AFMC.
     4.5.2. The method you use to finance Economy Act orders issued to another government agency
     depends mainly on the policies of that agency. But, other government agencies presently furnishing
     goods or services to the Air Force have agreed to use the reimbursement method of financing, if pos-
     sible, except agencies listed in paragraph 4.5.3. and paragraph 4.5.4..
     4.5.3. Use advance payment to finance all Economy Act orders issued to these agencies:
     - Library of Congress.
     - Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior.
     - Geological Survey, Department of the Interior.
     - Office of Geography, Department of the Interior.
     - Bureau of Census, Department of Commerce.
     - National Bureau of Standards, Department of Commerce.
     - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
     - National Technical Information Service, Department of Commerce.
     - Government Printing Office.
     - Transportation Systems Division, Department of Transportation.
     4.5.4. SAF/FMB uses the transfer appropriation method to finance Economy Act orders issued by HQ
     USAF to the Bureau of Public Roads, Department of Transportation, to construct access roads. HQ
     USAF will transfer the funds.
     4.5.5. Obtain HQ USAF approval prior to making advance payments to agencies other than those
     indicated in paragraph 4.5.3.. If another agency requests an advance payment, forward the request
     through your MAJCOM to SAF/FMBM, Washington DC 20330-1130, for approval.
     4.5.6. Don't authorize or make advance payments from Air Force annual appropriations that exceed
     the estimated cost of goods or services to be furnished by the performing agency during the fiscal year
     (FY) in which you make the advance payment.
     4.5.7. The Air Force activity that makes an advance payment to agencies indicated in paragraph
     4.5.3. above, or any others specifically approved by SAF/FMB, must complete and monitor all aspects
     of the advance payment. For advance payments made from Air Force appropriation accounts, you
     must require the performing agency to:
        4.5.7.1. Return estimated 30 September unobligated balances by 15 August of the FY in which
        you make the advance payment.
        4.5.7.2. Return unexpended balances upon completing the Economy Act order.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                           35


   4.5.8. In many instances, other government agencies who furnish goods or services to the Air Force
   operate on limited financial resources. Therefore, you must pay bills from these agencies promptly.
   Also, you must bill other government agencies promptly for goods or services the Air Force provides.

4.6. Economy Act Order Procedures:
   4.6.1. The ordering Air Force activity may make advance payments of Air Force funds for orders
   issued to agencies listed in paragraph 4.5.3. without further recourse to HQ USAF. Follow proce-
   dures in DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transac-
   tions at Base Level.
   4.6.2. HQ USAF makes the appropriation transfer to the Department of Transportation (paragraph
   4.5.4.) and any others specifically approved by HQ USAF.
   4.6.3. In all other cases when other agencies don't agree to finance Air Force orders by the reimburse-
   ment or direct cite method, the ordering Air Force activity will submit, through command channels, a
   request for HQ USAF determination and approval of financing arrangements. Send the request to
   SAF/FMBM, Washington DC 20330-1130. Include:
       4.6.3.1. A statement that the performing agency won't accept and finance the Economy Act order
       by the reimbursement or direct cite method.
       4.6.3.2. A copy of the order sent to the performing agency, which must include a statement of pur-
       pose or nature of work, estimate of cost and time required to complete the work.
       4.6.3.3. A statement from the Air Force command that funds are available within existing alloca-
       tions and that the requirement is included in the approved program, indicating appropriation, pro-
       gram year, and budget program.
       4.6.3.4. Other pertinent data to enable HQ USAF to evaluate the request.
   4.6.4. After receiving this information, HQ USAF will negotiate with the departmental headquarters
   of the performing agency to determine the financing method. If these negotiations result in the reim-
   bursement method, direct cite method, or advance payment method, HQ USAF will return the case to
   the Air Force activity for processing. If the transfer appropriation method is agreed upon, HQ USAF
   will:
       4.6.4.1. Withdraw funds from the Air Force command or operating agency by issuing revised
       budget authorization and allocation documents or operating budget authority.
       4.6.4.2. Transfer Air Force funds to the performing agency by the transfer appropriation method.
       4.6.4.3. Notify the Air Force activity, through command channels, when the above actions are
       completed.

4.7. Agencies Supported. The Air Force support for the following agencies must comply with particular
statutory provisions, special regulations, or special arrangements. Support agreements are documented by
an agreement or memorandum of understanding, one copy of which is sent to HQ AFMC/XPX.
   4.7.1. National Bureau of Standards. Air Force installations placing work order requests with that
   agency will finance them on an SF 1080 advance reimbursement basis. Conduct the negotiations and
   process the SF 1080 at installation level.
36                                                                 AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


     4.7.2. United States Postal Service (USPS). Unless specifically approved by SAF/AAI, AFMC instal-
     lations may not use "Postage and Fees Paid" indicia in place of metering.

4.8. Transactions with GSA for Leased Facilities:
     4.8.1. The Air Force enters into and pays for leases ending in a current fiscal year, renewable from
     year-to-year at the option of the government, provided language to this effect is in the DoD Appropri-
     ations Act for that fiscal year. AFI 32-9001 has procedures for acquiring and funding leased facilities.
     4.8.2. The General Services Administration (GSA) may make communications services in leased
     facilities available on a reimbursement basis in certain locations where office buildings are large
     enough to warrant joint-use switchboard and teletype facilities. Contact the local GSA office to obtain
     information on specific locations. Compute charges for communications according to GSA Circulars
     No. 42 and 93.

4.9. Air Transportation Provided to Nondefense Agencies:
     4.9.1. Guidance on furnishing air transportation for nondefense personnel and cargo is in DoD Regu-
     lation 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility.
     4.9.2. Procedures for processing and collecting charges for reimbursable nondefense traffic trans-
     ported on DoD aircraft other than Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transportation Working Capital
     Fund (TWCF) are in AFJI 24-503, Revenue Traffic Transported on DoD Aircraft other than Airlift
     Service Industrial Fund. AMC determines reimbursement for traffic furnished by AMC (TWCF) air-
     craft.

4.10. Use of Air Force Research and Test Facilities.
     4.10.1. Overview. This section prescribes funding procedures for using Air Force research and test
     facilities. See AFMCI 65-602 for budget and funding responsibilities for AFRL. See DODD 3200.11,
     AFI 99-101 and AFMCI 65-602 for guidance on major ranges and test facilities. The guidance in this
     section applies to non-DOD federal government agency users.
     4.10.2. Budgeting and Funding for AFRL:
        4.10.2.1. AFMC budgets and funds for the costs to develop, operate, and maintain AFRL in sup-
        port of assigned development programs and associated test workload.
        4.10.2.2. The users of AFRL, budget and fund for reimbursable costs incurred by AFMC in sup-
        porting user workloads. United States government agencies, other than DoD components, reim-
        burse performing AFRL for all direct and indirect costs.
        4.10.2.3. Direct costs are those expenses that can reasonably, economically, and consistently be
        immediately and directly identified to a customer (user) program or project and are documented
        on a job order. Direct costs may derive from contractor support or work performed in-house.
        Direct costs subject to reimbursement normally include, but are not necessarily limited to:
            4.10.2.3.1. Military labor costed at standard rates. (Note: Military labor is not reimbursable
            from DoD users).
            4.10.2.3.2. Civilian labor costs including the costs of related personnel benefits.
            4.10.2.3.3. Materiel, supplies, and utilities.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                             37


           4.10.2.3.4. Equipment and its maintenance and repair due to usage. Installation of equipment
           and its removal, if it has no further base or factory use after the job order is completed.
           4.10.2.3.5. Miscellaneous contractual services, including T&E activity operation and mainte-
           nance contractual services.
           4.10.2.3.6. Printing, photos, and reproduction.
           4.10.2.3.7. Maintenance and depot level reparable costs of test support aircraft and ground
           support equipment to include a pro rata share of depot level maintenance.
           4.10.2.3.8. Travel and per diem to support customer user programs, after acceptance of a job
           order.
           4.10.2.3.9. Transportation and cost of supplies and equipment or other material identified as
           direct costs.
           4.10.2.3.10. Civil engineering work requirements established by a customer.
           4.10.2.3.11. Facility operations when the entire facility is dedicated to a specific user.
           4.10.2.3.12. Real property leases dedicated to a customer program.
           4.10.2.3.13. Automated data processing (ADPE) support, including prorated rental and main-
           tenance charges, billed to customers through product service rates.
           4.10.2.3.14. Additional communications, special electric power, or similar requirements.
       4.10.2.4. Where mutual benefit exists and joint participation is desirable, share total direct costs
       in direct ratio to the amount of benefit received by each participant, subject to negotiation between
       the laboratory and the user on a case-by-case basis.

4.11. Funding Responsibilities for Designated Major Ranges and Test Facilities.
   4.11.1. The Secretary of Defense, per DODD 3200.11, designated the following AFMC activities as
   DoD Major Ranges and Test Facility Base (MRTFB):
       4.11.1.1. Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB.
       4.11.1.2. Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB (also has management responsi-
       bility over the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) at Hill AFB).
       4.11.1.3. 46 Test Wing, Eglin AFB (also has management responsibility over the 46th Test Group
       at Holloman AFB).
   4.11.2. Non-DoD federal agencies will be billed direct costs, as defined in paragraph 4.10.2.3.,
   including military labor, plus those indirect costs determined appropriate by the MRTFB commander
   not to exceed rates charged commercial customers.

4.12. Funding Rules for Ordering Information Technology Services from GSA:
   4.12.1. In 1996, Congress passed into law the Information Technology Management Reform Act
   (ITMRA). This Act established a new class of interagency orders for services and redefined the rules
   of engagement for funding information technology (IT) programs. As a result of ITMRA, GSA estab-
   lished the Federal Systems Integration and Management Center (FEDSIM) and the Federal Computer
   Acquisition Center (FEDCAC) to provide contract services to DoD and other government agencies.
38                                                                 AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


     Agency funds received by GSA are obligated against the IT Fund, which is a revolving fund, pursuant
     to 40 U.S.C. 757. While most orders for supplies and services placed with government activities come
     under the rules of the Economy Act, the Economy Act requirements are not applicable for acquisition
     through GSA’s FEDSIM, FEDCAC, and similar programs that are funded on a reimbursement basis
     through the IT Fund and approved by OMB.
     4.12.2. Interagency orders for goods and services under ITMRA are not subject to the fiscal year
     restrictions contained in the Economy Act. The funds are obligated for a bona fide need of the order-
     ing agency at the time the funding document is forwarded to GSA. These funds are available for the
     entire period of performance, even if such performance crosses fiscal years.
     4.12.3. Funds, which an ordering agency obligates, must be the right appropriation applicable to the
     services requested from GSA (e.g. 3400 for O&M services or supplies, 3080 for investment items
     over $250K, 3600 for RDT&E requirements). These funds must be available for obligation by the
     requiring agency, must be cited on a funding document ( i.e. MIPR) signed by both parties, and must
     cover the cost of the funding agency’s bona fide current need for goods and services.
     4.12.4. In subsequent years, the ordering agency must continue to have a need for the requirements
     described in the funding document. GSA may use an agency’s funds obligated to the IT Fund for any
     purpose within the scope of the interagency task order that serves as the funding document. Uncom-
     mited funds remaining from any project may be used for a second project, provided the second project
     is within the scope of the interagency task order. However, the task order must be a bona fide need of
     the agency at the time the order was placed. Once a new fiscal year begins, no new tasks may be
     placed against funds provided in the prior year.
     4.12.5. If no further need for the requirement exists or the requirements are not within scope of the
     original order, any remaining uncommitted funds must be deobligated from the IT Fund. The uncom-
     mitted balance of any ordering agency’s funds remaining in the IT Fund shall be transferred to the
     general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.
     4.12.6. In summary, the legislation which created the IT Fund is independent authority for inter-
     agency procurement and avoids the deobligation requirement of the Economy Act for incomplete or
     unperformed orders. An order for a specific product or nonseverable service must accompany the
     advance of funds. The fact that the ordering agency is not compelled to deobligate advanced funds at
     the end of the fiscal year due to incomplete performance does not provide authority to bank money for
     requirements of a later fiscal year. Without a definite requirement, identified to GSA, before the end
     of the fiscal year, the money can’t be used. Any suggestion that IMTRA enables an agency to avoid
     the legal standard for a timely initial obligation of appropriations is erroneous. Any customer deposits
     made to the IT Fund in excess of actual requirements to fill timely orders shall be transferred to the
     general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. This means that the ordering agency will not
     get the money back, and the Air Force will have lost budget authority in an expired year account that
     could otherwise have been used to cover price adjustments and change orders.

                   SUPPORT TO NON-FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

5.1. User Charges. It is DOD policy not to compete with available commercial facilities in providing
special services or in the sale or lease of property to private parties or agencies outside the Federal Gov-
ernment. However, when a service or sale is made that conveys special benefits to recipients, above and
beyond those accruing to the public at large, a reasonable charge shall be made to each identifiable recip-
ient, except as otherwise authorized by the Secretary of Defense. Guidance and procedures are defined in
DODI 7230.7. State and local government agencies and United States domestic commercial users (except
at DOD MRTFB facilities) reimburse performing AFMC activities for all direct and indirect costs
incurred, including military labor and full user charges according to DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chap-
ter 4..

5.2. Use of Air Force Research and Test Facilities. The Air Force maintains and operates a variety of
unique facilities to meet its research and testing needs. The capabilities of these facilities can also accom-
modate many needs of the other services and non-DOD agencies. Many of these facilities cannot be dupli-
cated economically by other agencies, government or private. Frequently, commercial institutions ask to
use Air Force facilities to test and evaluate their products or techniques. See AFMCI 65-602 for budget
and funding responsibilities for AFRL. See DODD 3200.11, AFI 99-101 and AFMCI 65-602 for guidance
on major ranges and test facilities. The following guidance applies to state and local government agencies
and US domestic commercial users.
   5.2.1. Budgeting and Funding for AFRL:
       5.2.1.1. AFMC budgets and funds for the costs to develop, operate, and maintain AFRL in sup-
       port of assigned development programs and associated test workload.
       5.2.1.2. The users of AFRL, budget and fund for reimbursable costs incurred by AFMC in sup-
       porting user workloads according to the following criteria.
       5.2.1.3. State and local government agencies and United States domestic commercial users reim-
       burse performing AFRL for all direct and indirect costs incurred, including military labor and full
       user charges according to DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 4.
       5.2.1.4. Direct costs are those expenses that can reasonably, economically, and consistently be
       immediately and directly identified to a customer (user) program or project and are documented
       on a job order. Direct costs may derive from contractor support or work performed in-house.
       Direct costs subject to reimbursement are listed in paragraph 4.10.2.3..
       5.2.1.5. Where mutual benefit exists and joint participation is desirable, share total direct costs in
       direct ratio to the amount of benefit received by each participant, subject to negotiation between
       the laboratory and the user on a case-by-case basis.
       5.2.1.6. Under 10 U.S.C. Section 2539b with prior approval of DOD and under limited conditions
       persons or entities may be charged only direct costs for test services performed at government lab-
       oratory facilities.
       5.2.1.7. Contractors using government furnished support under a Cooperative Research and
       Development Agreement (CRADA) will reimburse costs in accordance with the negotiated terms
       of the CRADA. (See Attachment 2, paragraph A2.8.) It is discretionary whether a CRADA will
40                                                                AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


        include payment to a Federal laboratory for the resources provided, given that other benefits real-
        ized by the government may be adequate consideration to support the agreement. In those CRA-
        DAs where payment provisions are included, DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 4 provides
        guidance on developing an equitable and uniform system of user charges for special services and
        for leasing property to persons or organization outside DoD and outside the federal government.
        This is applicable to determining charges and fees for Government services, facilities and property
        funished under a CRADA.
     5.2.2. Funding Responsibilities for Designated Major Ranges and Test Facilities. The Secretary of
     Defense designated AFMC activities as DoD major ranges and test facilities (see paragraph 4.11.1..).
        5.2.2.1. State and local government agencies reimburse for full costs, including indirect and over-
        head costs and military labor at accelerated standard rates, except when an existing formal agree-
        ment provides otherwise. These users must pay full costs when their use of the range or facility is
        sponsored by a federal government agency or when a federal government agency acts as such
        user's agent. Commercial users will be billed for all direct costs that are associated with the test
        and evaluation activities conducted by the commercial entity under the contract in accordance
        with the DoD implementation of 10 U.S.C. 2681.
        5.2.2.2. In addition, the DoD implementation of 10 U.S.C. 2681, allows the commanders of
        MRTFBs to include a provision that requires the commercial entity to reimburse for such indirect
        costs related to the use of the installation.
        5.2.2.3. Neither military retirement, unfunded civilian retirement, asset capitalization, nor depre-
        ciation shall be charged to the commercial customer. However, the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2681
        do not apply to the following:
            5.2.2.3.1. Commercial space launch activity at the 30th and 45th Space Wings will be priced
            under provisions of the Commercial Launch Act of 1984 (amended in 1988 and 1991).
            5.2.2.3.2. Foreign military sales (FMS)-foreign governments will be billed full cost, unless a
            government agreement is in force (treaty, FMS agreement, or other negotiated agreement).
            Reimbursable orders will indicate if the test effort is in support of FMS. Commercial users will
            meet the requirements of the requirements in Support of Nongovernment Test and Evaluation.
            The provisions of the Federal Technology Transfer Act or other domestic technology transfer
            acts may apply.
        5.2.2.4. Direct costs are costs that can be reasonably, economically, and consistently identified
        immediately and directly to a final cost objective, whether they are derived from in-house or con-
        tractor support. "Immediately" and "directly" mean at the time the expense is incurred. Direct
        costs are limited to those costs funded from the activity's operating program.
        5.2.2.5. Satisfy these criteria before using standard rates: (Note: "standard rates" are computed
        cost rates that are set up for products and services and used to determine charges to the job order.
        By definition, standard rates are a proration of direct costs across the base to which they are
        applied. They are average costs that can be used in estimating and charging, and the use of such
        rates is encouraged.
            5.2.2.5.1. The rates must be applicable to the product or service. Costs of products and ser-
            vices, that drastically change, or volume that cannot be easily identified, won't be considered
            for standard rate computation.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                              41


          5.2.2.5.2. Major range and test facilities must use an approved accounting system or proce-
          dure to accumulate historical standard rate data providing for an audit trail.
          5.2.2.5.3. Major range and test facilities must validate standard rates at least quarterly. Adjust
          the rate if a rate cannot be validated within plus or minus five percent. If at the end of the year
          the variance remains above or below the five percent tolerance limit, the variance is consid-
          ered material. If the variance is material, charge or refund, as applicable, the customer the
          amount of the variance.
   5.2.3. Payment and Billings. For commercial customers and organizations outside the Federal Gov-
   ernment, charges and fees will be collected in advance in all cases. See DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A,
   Chapter 4. For research and T&E support, use SF 1080 to bill government agencies direct costs. Use
   AF Form 819, Invoice or Claim to bill commercial concerns. For AFMC users, the T&E activity will
   complete both sides of the SF 1080 billing document (billing and collecting) and the DFAS will pro-
   cess the expenditure as a "for others" payment. The AFMC activity will send a copy of the SF 1080 to
   the customer's program or project office, showing the amount of reimbursable direct cost and the total
   amount of the order, billings to date, and remaining balance. Within AFMC, only minimum backup
   support data is needed to accompany the form. For non-AFMC users, the supporting data will be as
   specified in DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 2.

5.3. Base Support Services Provided to AFMC Contractors.
   5.3.1. Authority. If the requirement for base support is identified in the Request for Proposal or sub-
   sequently requested by the contractor and approved by the Contracting Officer, it must be formally
   documented in a base support clause of the contract. AFI 25-201, paragraph 1.6 provides additional
   guidance on support to contractors. AFMC suppliers will not support contractors unless provided a
   copy of the contract that authorizes the support.
   5.3.2. Funding of Support. To support an RDT&E, O&M or systems contract requiring contractors to
   perform services at AFMC bases, the AFMC supplier will support the AFMC contractor with base
   support funds. The AFMC supplier will also support a contractor that has a contract with another
   AFMC activity provided support is documented in the contract. The sponsoring AFMC activity that
   let the contract makes their funds available to the AFMC supplier to support the contractor.
   5.3.3. Billing Requirements.
      5.3.3.1. Use SF 1080 to recoup the supplier activity costs of supporting a contractor. The billing
      must specify the contract number and specific AFMC program (system, subsystem, project, job
      order number, etc.) Send the funding organization any supporting documentation it requires.
      5.3.3.2. The Project Officer or administrative contracting officer (ACO) must include the follow-
      ing certification on the SF 1080:" I certify that the above services and/or materiel were furnished
      by the AFMC base in response to the requirement of contract(s) number(s)______." At least
      monthly, the AFMC base will bill the AFMC funding activity for the services or materiel it fur-
      nished the contractor, processing the SF 1080 as a "for others" transaction. The AFMC base may
      waive costs if the provisions of DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Direct, Refund, Reimbursement,
      and Receivable Transactions at Base Level apply.
      5.3.3.3. If a contractor has more than one contract, prorate the support to individual contracts. If
      support cannot be identified to a particular contract, charge it to the contract receiving the major
      benefit. Similarly, contract relating to multiple programs may also be prorated to individual pro-
42                                                                    AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


        grams or charged to the program receiving the major benefit. However, the AFMC supplier must
        identify the program supported so it can determine which line item to charge.
        5.3.3.4. If government furnished materiel is authorized and made available to the contractor, use
        the guidelines in DOD 4000.25-M, Military Standard Requisiting and Issue Procedures (MIL-
        STRIP).

5.4. Site Activation Task Force Contractors.
     5.4.1. Authority to Furnish Support. It is AFMC policy to support contractors doing weapon systems
     site activation activities (including construction, installation and checkout, and related activities) for
     system programmed to enter the operational inventory, without reimbursement according to the terms
     and conditions of the contract. AFMC gives contractors all items of aerospace ground equipment
     (AGE), weapon systems spares, and spare parts required for site activation support, as well as civil
     engineering support. The base support agreement must list all support and services to be provided to
     the contractor.
     5.4.2. Funding of Support. HQ AFMC funds the appropriate product center for acquisition manage-
     ment through normal budget procedures, for all support it gives site activation contractors. In turn, the
     product center makes the funds available to the AFMC base by using a reimbursable order. Charges
     for reimbursable services performed by AFMC field activities are calculated as follows:
        5.4.2.1. Civilian labor charges are calculated according to paragraph 1.21..
        5.4.2.2. Military labor charges are billed at standard rates according to DFAS-DE 7010.1-R,
        Chapter 33.
     5.4.3. Type of Support Furnished. AFMC normally gives the following support for site activation
     without reimbursement.
        5.4.3.1. Government-furnished property for site activation support and storage and handling, as
        required. This included AGE, weapon systems spares, and spare parts.
        5.4.3.2. Administration.
        5.4.3.3. Local disposition of authorized residual site activation support materiel.
        5.4.3.4. Fire, security, utilities and maintenance support.
        5.4.3.5. Transportation services.
        5.4.3.6. Supply.
        5.4.3.7. Communications.
        5.4.3.8. Calibration (PMEL Services).
        5.4.3.9. Building and grounds, including lease of commercial property, if necessary.
        5.4.3.10. Messing facilities.
        5.4.3.11. Analytical laboratory service.
        5.4.3.12. Photographs.
        5.4.3.13. Custodial services.
AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003                                                                          43


      5.4.3.14. Equipment.

5.5. Other MAJCOM or Government Agency Contractors.
   5.5.1. Requirement for Support. An AFMC activity supplier may provide base support to a contractor
   under the terms of a contract, that is funded by another command or government agency. The AFMC
   supplier base is not reimbursed through the contractor but directly from the command or government
   agency responsible for contract.
      5.5.1.1. Apply the guidance in paragraph 2.2.2. (for receiver command funding responsibility)
      and paragraph 2.2.3.. (for AFMC supplier responsibility) when the receiver (host) command fur-
      nishes an on-base contractor logistical support under a non-AFMC (tenant)-funded contract. The
      command that must accomplish the contract will reimburse or refund the supplier base using the
      same funds cited in the basic contract, but not through the contractor.
      5.5.1.2. Finance the cost of repairing, modifying, or constructing buildings used by a contractor
      on government-owned or leased land from the appropriations available for such purposes. Charge
      the command that must accomplish the contract. (That is, from O&M, RDT&E, or military con-
      struction.) Exception: Don't apply this guidance to contract field teams doing on-site maintenance
      under AFMC maintenance (DWCF), or O&M-funded contracts. The local base supply officer pro-
      vides materiel support to these activities as prescribed by AFMAN 23-110.
   5.5.2. Authority for Support. AFMC will not support contractors unless it has a copy of the contract
   or other appropriate document authorizing such services.
   5.5.3. Funding for Support. The AFMC base budgets for anticipated support to government contrac-
   tors and get RBA funds accordingly. The sponsoring/contracting command or agency provides the
   AFMC supplier activity with a reimbursable order to fund reimbursable services provided. After sup-
   port has been provided, the parent command or agency reimburses the appropriation that incurred the
   cost initially.
   5.5.4. Special Billing Requirement.
      5.5.4.1. The AFMC supplier base will send a copy of the SF 1080 or documentation to support
      preparation of the SF 1080 to their host DFAS Field Office. DFAS will bill the DFAS cited in the
      contract, not more often than monthly. See paragraph 1.24. for waiver under certain conditions.
      5.5.4.2. Use SF 1080, with supporting documentation to get reimbursement. The project officer or
      ACO must include the following certification: "I certify that the above services and/or supplies
      were furnished in response to the requirements of contract number ______." This certification is
      required in addition to standard documentation.
      5.5.4.3. Management must ensure that the government is reimbursed for the full value of all mate-
      riel and services provided to nongovernment agencies. This includes direct costs (including mili-
      tary), indirect costs (including military), overhead costs (including military), supplies, materiel
      and user charges. (DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 4).

5.6. Miscellaneous Commercial-Type Activities.
   5.6.1. Requirement for Support. For commercial-type activities operated on or near bases for the con-
   venience of the base itself. Support is generally provided by the base on a nonreimbursable basis
   except as indicated below in paragraphs 5.6.2.1. through 5.6.2.4. These activities include banking

     facilities, credit unions, branches of schools and colleges, and joint airline military transportation
     offices.
     5.6.2. Funding of Support. The AFMC supplier base budgets and funds for these activities, as well as,
     for the normal base support it furnishes to non AFMC base occupants. However if these activities
     require reimbursable support, include requirement for RBA in the annual financial plan. Since these
     facilities are operated for the convenience of the base and base personnel, the following principles
     apply:
        5.6.2.1. The Air Force provides space and logistical support for banking facilities and negotiates
        a lease for reimbursement according to AFI 32-9007.
        5.6.2.2. Credit unions using military real property and space must reimburse the Air Force for all
        services such as telephone, lines, long distance toll calls, space alterations, air conditioning, heat,
        and lights per DFAS-DE 7220.1-R. However, credit unions do not reimburse for any janitorial ser-
        vices, fixtures, and maintenance they receive.
        5.6.2.3. Elementary school and branches of colleges are supported from appropriated funds.
        Transportation to and from elementary school is provided, without reimbursement, to school
        attendees. Transportation to and from branches of colleges is at the expense of the college student.
        5.6.2.4. The Scheduled Airlines Traffic Office is usually established for the convenience of the
        base according to AFRs 75-4 and 75-8. The commercial ticket agency part of the office (as distin-
        guished from the transportation officer or agent) is provided space and facilities, without cost, for
        the sponsoring airline agency. The ticket agency pays for special communication lines to the air-
        port and airlines.

5.7. Support of Civil Authorities in Airplane Hijacking Emergencies.
     5.7.1. Funding Guidance. It is DoD guidance to commit military resources in a support capacity to
     other federal agencies in connection with airplane hijacking emergencies. Follow this guidance:
        5.7.1.1. Reimbursement is required for expenses incident to chase aircraft.
        5.7.1.2. Cost of other support, including use of transport aircraft, helicopters, flares, parachutes,
        and communication equipment is also on a reimbursable basis. This includes cost of repairing or
        reconditioning nonconsumable equipment that may be returned.
        5.7.1.3. Use MAJCOM or installation level ESP codes to identify these costs.
        5.7.1.4. Bill the agencies requesting the service according to DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on
        Direct, Refund, Reimbursement, and Receivable Transactions at Base Level.

                             SUPPORT TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

6.1. FMS Procedures. The following procedure applies to reimbursable services and materiel provided
to foreign governments. The International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976
(Public Law 90-629, as amended) authorizes sales of defense articles and services to friendly foreign
countries and international organizations. DOD 7000.14-R, DOD Financial Management Regulation
(FMR), Volume 15, Security Assistance Policy and Procedures, Chapter 7, explains the appropriation
reimbursement policies and procedures that apply to the Security Assistance Program, including Foreign
Military Sales (FMS), the Military Assistance Program (MAP), and the International Military Education
and Training Program (IMETP). DOD FMR tells which appropriations to reimburse from the FMS Trust
Fund (97-11x8242) for costs associated with FMS orders.

6.2. Recording Reimbursements. Table 6.1. shows how to record FMS reimbursable transactions. For-
eign government will be billed full cost, unless a government agreement is in force (treaty, foreign mili-
tary sales (FMS) agreement, or other negotiated agreement) For FMS effort performed, cite reimbursable
FMS funds (FC 4E) and include the country code and FMS master case and line item on the project order
to alert the T&E centers that overhead costs associated with support are applicable and must be recovered.
Charges for reimbursable work performed by AFMC field activities are calculated as follows:
   6.2.1. Civilian labor charges are calculated according to DOD 7000.14-R, DOD FMR, Volume 15,
   Chapter 7.
   6.2.2. Military labor charges are billed at composite standard rates per DOD 7000.14-R, Chapter 7,
   Volume 15, Chapter 7.

6.3. FMS Billing Requirements. Management must make sure the federal government is responsible for
the full value of all materiel and services provided to foreign governments. This includes direct costs,
indirect costs, overhead costs, all military costs (direct, indirect, and overhead), supplies, materiel and
user charges (DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 11A, Chapter 4). The acceleration rates to use when billing for-
eign governments are provided by OUS(C) Office of the under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) in an
annual letter. Billings are prepared on SF 1080. In reimbursing the appropriations cited in para 6.1. use
the latest procedures in DOD 7000.14-R, DOD FMR, Volume 15, Chapter 7.

6.4. FMS waivers. Those FMS countries funded by Military Assistance Program (MAP) or Non-Repay-
able FMS credit are not charged for military pay or entitlements.

6.5. Asset Use Charge. Due to Fair Pricing Legislation, asset use charges are no longer chargeable to
FMS transactions.

Terms
Above Standard Support—The level of support service that exceeds the standard support services
established by the supplier. These services are typically those services required by an activity to achieve
its specific mission objectives in a more efficient, or cost effective manner and can be established as
directly attributed or benefiting the requester. These requirements can be either for a peculiar/unique type
of service or for increased quantity or frequency of common service(s). In many cases, above standard
support services will be acquired through a center/base supplier for reasons of efficiency, timeliness,
economies of scale, or due to established suppliers.
Accessorial Costs—Certain expenses (for example, packing, crating, and second destination
transportation) incident to issues, sales, or transfers of material.
Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES)—The collection of Oracle-based applications, which
replaced WIMS, that support various Air Force CE activities. It focuses on improving business processes
through a transition of these systems into a single logical database supporting the full range of operational
and contingency responsibilities. Mandatory CE automated information management systems include
Interim Work Information Management System (IWIMS), ACES Real Property Module, ACES Project
Management Module, ACES Housing (including Facilities Management) Module and ACES Fire
Department Module
AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document—In this instruction, AF Form
406 is a document authorizing the establishment of unfilled customer orders in accounting and finance
records. It is used as a customer order between the ordering and performing activity and when the
ordering and performing activity are under the same commander. It supports both the establishment of the
unfilled order and the obligation of DBA. It is also used instead of an actual customer order when
performance must begin before receipt of an actual customer order or when performance exceeds a
customer's order and an amendment has not been received. In either case, the AF Form 406 must be
approved by the activity commander or, at the commander's designation, the comptroller or comparable
official and follow-up action must be initiated to obtain the actual customer order or amendment. If the
actual customer order or amendment is not received within 120 days, the AF Form 406 must be extended
50                                                               AFMCI65-603 18 DECEMBER 2003


by the commander for 60 additional days. If AF Form 406 is canceled, then appropriate obligation
adjustments must be made between RBA and DBA and related earnings must be eliminated.
Anticipated Reimbursements—The dollar amount of reimbursement estimated to be realized during the
life of the appropriation. On command reimbursement reports, anticipated reimbursements received are
applicable to each fiscal or program year. This amount must agree with the amount of the RBA received.

the installation or base commander.
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) —An agreement, as defined by 15
U.S.C. Section 3710 a (d)(1), under which “the Government, through its laboratories, may provide
personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property and other resources with or without
reimbursement.”
Direct Budget Authority (DBA)—Authority to incur obligations and expenses for operating facilities,
purchasing of materiel, etc., in direct support of unit missions and for which reimbursement is not

government (other than military) with or without reimbursement. See DoD Instruction 4000.19.
Interservice Support—Action by one military service or element to provide logistics and administrative
support to another military service or element.
Intrafund Reimbursement—Reimbursement for materiel, work, or service, provided by one operating
agency or activity to another, when both parties to the transaction are financed by the same appropriation.
Intrafund reimbursements will be treated in the same manner as interfund reimbursements.
A2.15. Intraservice Support—Action of one military service or element to provide logistics and
administrative support to another military command, group or element of the same military service.
Support includes an Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard unit or activity that occupies the
facilities of, or receives support from, another Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard unit.

in the allotment ledger as reductions in disbursements.
Reimbursable Budget Authority (RBA)—Describes funds provided for incurring obligations for the
performance of customer support for which orders have been received.
Reimbursable Order/Customer Order—As used in this instruction, reimbursable orders and customer
orders refer to a variety of documents initiated by a requester and received by a performer that represent
valid obligations in the accounting records of the performer. The term also includes advance payments
received from commercial customers. Some forms that represent orders are DD Forms 448, Military
Interdepartment Purchase Request, AF Forms 185, Purchase Request, AF Forms 406, Miscellaneous
Obligation Reimbursement Document (where DBA funds have been obligated.)

appropriations. These reimbursements apply to transactions involving sale of supplies or services where
appropriations charged and the appropriation credited are identical as to appropriation and fiscal year. Use
is restricted only where transactions will be accounted for and reported as appropriation reimbursements
rather than refunds. Air Staff approval provided per SAF/FMBM message 261604Z May 92.
Reimbursements Realized—Firm authorized agreements or orders received and accepted that have been
recorded in accounting records of the supplying or performing agency.

of facilities, and other functions performed for the receiver activity by the supplier activity. Excludes
supplies and materials issued directly to the receiver activity to perform their mission.
Supplier/Supplier Activity—A unit or activity that has management control of AFMC facilities or
resources, and provides services to another unit or activity, referred to as a receiver. The term host has
been replaced/updated with the term supplier or supplier activity throughout this instruction.
Status of Funds Data Base Transmission, RCS: SAF-FM(M)7801-DE—T h i s r e p o r t p r o v i d e s a
monthly cumulative financial status of reimbursement transactions by appropriation, fiscal year, and data
elements of budget authority, allotment, obligations, commitments and expenditures. This data is
provided from a single data base extract that is forwarded from the DAO or DFAS Field Site to DFAS-DE
by the fifth working day following the end of each month. This report data updates higher level data bases
at both major commands and DFAS-DE.
Standard Support—The level of support provided to all receivers of a particular service designated by
authority as the standard expectation. Standard support is understood to be sufficiently flexible to permit
acceptable levels of receiver satisfaction, as determined through standard quality measures, but not
enough to permit abuse by either the supplier or receiver. All units on an installation receive standard
support on an equal basis as defined by the base and applicable functional AFI's. For example, standard
support encompasses common services provided in support of many or all programs at a Center versus
specified, peculiar, or unique services directly associated with the needs of an individual program.
Standard support services are categorized as indirect costs or typically considered "open the door" costs of
base or a center's operations and are essential infrastructure functions (e.g. fire protection, base wide
security police, personnel, comptroller, safety, legal, etc.) not directly associated to a program/activity's
mission requirement, but nevertheless specifically required for AFMC activities to operate from a given
location.
Unfilled Order—Order received for which services have not been performed or materiel not delivered. It
also includes support to be provided activities under support agreements.
