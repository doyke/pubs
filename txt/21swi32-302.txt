1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to define procedures for conducting EIIBs. EIIBs
are conducted to investigate environmental incidents, distribute ―lessons learned‖ and prevent
recurrence. This instruction does not override international treaties or agreements.
2. Applicability.
     2.1. This instruction applies to 21 SW installations at Cape Cod AFS MA, Cavalier AFS
     ND, Clear AFS AK, Cheyenne Mountain AFB CO and Thule AB GL.
     2.2. Natural disasters or other unexplained phenomenon directly causing environmental
     incidents do not generally require EIIB investigations. If however, the cleanup is poorly
     managed, a preventative system fails, or mitigation is not properly accomplished, an EIIB
     may be required.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. The AFSPC Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Council (ESOH) Council
     Chair, AFSPC/CV:
        3.1.1. Appoints Category 1 EIIB members, as required and provides for their temporary
        duty (TDY) funding.
        3.1.2. Reviews status of all open Category 1 EIIBs on a quarterly basis.
        3.1.3. Serves as the approval authority for closing Category 1 EIIBs.

     wing policies and procedures to prevent similar occurrences.
     3.3.5. Ensures all organizations affected by the incident coordinate on Category 2 reports
     to AFSPC.
     3.3.6. In concert with Public Affairs (PA), Judge Advocate (JA) and Environmental

  3.4. The 21 SW/JA and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) must jointly clear the
  incident site and data as described below. JA must also provide a briefing for all EIIB
  members prior to their beginning the EIIB process. This briefing will:
     3.4.1. Provide members with basic training on investigative techniques.
     3.4.2. Explain that the purpose of the investigation is to prevent recurrence and
     information provided is not privileged.
     3.4.3. Normally it is unnecessary for interviewees to be informed of their rights under
     Article 31 UCMJ or the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. However, if suspicion of
     criminal activity arises, the interviewer should notify 21 SW/JA and AFOSI.
  3.5. Public Affairs (PA) shall employ AFI 35-101 in the spirit of the DOD principle of
  ―maximum disclosure/minimum delay‖ philosophy. As such PA shall:

   5.2. For Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 incidents, the Wing Commander notifies
   AFSPC via OPREP-3, IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, as soon as possible, but
   certainly within 24 hours of occurrence. Notify HQ AFSPC/A7AQ, via phone and email,
   immediately upon release of that message.        For all other categories, notify HQ
   AFSPC/A7AQ as soon as possible, but certainly within the next duty day. (Note: The
   ―clock‖ starts when the incident is confirmed or when the base receives the formal
   enforcement action. Delay in notifications does not delay suspense’s but delays for legal
   clearances do.)
6. Investigation Participants.
   6.1. Category 1. The AFSPC/CV appoints a board within seven days of receiving the wing
   commander’s message. Members of the board are pulled from a standing roster of qualified
   personnel such as, HQ AFSPC personnel, wing vice commanders, environmental flight
   chiefs, etc. The board will be composed as follows:
       6.1.1. A wing vice commander from an unaffected installation (board chair).
       6.1.2. A senior command environmental quality manager (technical expertise and liaison
       between AFSPC and EIIB).
       6.1.3. Two environmental flight chiefs from unaffected installations (base level
       perspective/technical expertise).
       6.1.4. HQ AFSPC functional experts, as needed.
   6.2. Category 2. The Wing Commander of the affected installation appoints the board
   within seven days of determining incident category. The board will be composed as follows:
 8                                                           21SWI32-302 20 DECEMBER 2010


        6.2.1. A group commander (unaffected by the incident).
        6.2.2. Natural Resources Flight Chief (preferably).
        6.2.3. Other functional experts as needed to assist the board (if the installation doesn’t
        have sufficient expertise, request it from another installation or HQ AFSPC).
     6.3. Category 3. The Installation Commander of the affected installation appoints an
     Investigating Officer (IO) within three days of determining incident category. The IO should
     be a field grade officer or civilian equivalent from an organization other than the organization
     primarily responsible for the incident. For instance, if Environmental Management fails to
     properly report to the state, they should not be the investigating organization.
     6.4. Category 4. The Installation Commander of the affected installation appoints an IO
     within three days of determining incident category.
     6.5. Personnel serving as board members or IOs must be detailed to the investigation until
     the report is complete. Supervisors of personnel appointed as an IO or board member shall
     ensure their subordinates make the investigation their primary duty until the report is
     completed. The installation Environmental Management Office will naturally be tasked to
     support the investigation and must support as needed.
7. The Investigation
     7.1. Legal Clearance. Obtain written clearance from wing JA/OSI, via 21 CES/ CEAN, for
     all Categories within specified timeframe.
        7.1.1. The intent of the legal clearance is to: 1) determine whether criminal activity or
        intent was a factor in the incident; and, 2) preserve evidence for potential criminal
        proceedings.
        7.1.2. The EIIB investigation may not proceed until legal clearance is obtained. Special
        care must be taken to safeguard all records for the JA/OSI review. The joint JA/OSI
        review shall proceed immediately after notification and be completed as soon as possible-
        normally with 24 hours when there is no indication of criminal activity.
        7.1.3. Once the EIIB investigation begins, if at any time the investigators become aware
        of criminal activity related to the incident, the EIIB shall immediately cease so that
        another legal clearance can be obtained.
     7.2. The investigation begins three days after: The board is appointed for Categories 1 and
     2, the IO is appointed for Category 3, or the Installation Commander determines the need for
     an investigation. The investigation cannot begin until legal clearance is obtained; thus, a
     delay in legal clearance will cause a delay in beginning the investigation.
     7.3. Focus of the Investigation. The board must reconstruct the sequence of events leading
     to the incident and consider all the facts before drawing a conclusion on the causes or
     contributing factors in an environmental incident. The board must also interview all affected
     personnel especially those involved in the incident and those who’s training and experience
     qualify them as experts.
        7.3.1. Examine the site, if applicable. Use photographs to record actual conditions.
        Photographs have proven invaluable, especially when weather later obscures the site of
21SWI32-302 20 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    9


      site conditions change. Photographs are also helpful during subsequent briefings or
      report preparation.
      7.3.2. Examine all physical evidence and documentation. Environmental incident
      investigations have inherent priorities over other activities and investigators may
      impound Air Force material and documents relevant to the investigation. Consider
      personal safety, securing of hazardous materials and mission essential activities while
      preserving evidence. Investigators should keep evidentiary material only as long as
      needed to complete the investigation and prepare the report or briefing.
   7.4. If personnel are brought in to assist with Category 2, 3, or 4 investigations, the wing
   commander shall fund TDY expenses. The Wing Commander shall also fund any laboratory
   testing or other expenses that may be required.
   7.5. Categories 1 and 2 boards and Category 3 IOs have 21-calendar days to complete the
   incident investigation and report after the investigation begins. Category 4 IOs have 14
   calendar days to complete the investigation and report after the beginning the investigation.
   7.6. All requests for extensions to the investigation timelines must be approved in advance
   by HQ AFSPC/A7AQ, via 21 CES/ CEAN.
8. The Report.
   8.1. All incident reports must be factual and complete. They will include a narrative
   description of the incident, conclusions of the IO or board and proposed wording for the
   NOTAM. See Attachment 1 for an outline of an EIIB report and Attachment 2 for an
   example NOTAM. Sketches and photographs should be included, as appropriate. Using
   evidence and professional judgment, determine direct root causes, indirect or contributing
   factors and the overall environment leading to the incident (use EIIB Root Cause Analysis
   Instructions at Attachment 3, Environmental Incident Root Causes at Attachment 4, and
   Root Cause Analysis Worksheet found at Attachment 5).
   8.2. Category 1: The Chairman of the Board briefs the investigation results to AFSPC/CV.
   The affected installation wing commander shall be present for the briefing, as are the HQ
   AFSPC/A7 and other affected directors on the AFSPC staff. Boards have 21 days from
   commencement of the board to prepare the report and briefing.
   8.3. Category 2: The appointed board prepares the report and submits it through the wing
   commander to HQ AFSPC/A7A. Reports must be received within 21 days of the board’s
   commencement.
   8.4. Category 3: The investigating officer completes the report within 7 days after the
   investigation is completed. The wing commander forwards the report to HQ AFSPC/A7A
   within 7 days of its completion. Reports must be received with 21 days of the investigation
   commencement. Summary report and NOTAM should not exceed three pages.
   8.5. Category 4: In the case of an enforcement action, a draft response to the enforcement
   action and a NOTAM are forwarded to HQ AFSPC/A7AQ, via 21 CES/ CEAN within 14
   days, or sooner if necessary, to respond to the regulator. In all other cases the investigation
   consists of a one page summary report or correspondence with regulator and NOTAM that
   are forwarded to HQ AFSPC/A7AQ within 14 days.
 10                                                     21SWI32-302 20 DECEMBER 2010


   8.6. All EIIB category reports will include an environmental NOTAM.            An example
   NOTAM is at Attachment 7.
   8.7. Incident Closure: Category 1 incidents are closed when AFSPC approves the wing
   commander’s corrective action plan. Category 2 incidents are closed when affected
   directorates at HQ AFPC/A7AQ have reviewed the report and NOTAM is released.
   Category 3 and 4 incidents close when HQ AFSPC/A7AQ accepts the report and NOTAM is
   released. (Note: Some incidents may not require a NOTAM release, HQ AFSPC/A7AQ will
   determine if required.)
   8.8. A copy of the report shall be sent to the wing commander and the unit commander(s) of
   the individual(s) involved. The report will be classified as FOUO, and will not be posted on
   the internet.
   8.9. All requests for extensions to the report timelines must be approved in advance by HQ
   AFSPC/A7AQ, via 21 CES/ CEAN.

SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL NOTAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM
ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD 01-04
1. THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND ACTION AS
NECESSARY. IF A SIMILAR CONDITION EXISTS AT YOUR BASE, WE RECOMMEND
YOU TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION.
2. AN AFSPC BASE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A CATEGORY III ENVIRONMENTAL
INCIDENT RESULTING FROM A SEWAGE SPILL CAUSED BY FAILURE OF A
SANITARY SEWER PIPE.
3. THE SINGLE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS FAILURE OF AN EXISTING
SEWAGE PIPE DUE TO AGE AND TYPE OF MATERIAL (CLAY) USED.
4. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE SPILL WERE:
   A. A CONTRACTOR INSTALLED A NEW STORMWATER DRAIN PIPE BULKHEAD
IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE FAILED SEWER PIPE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE
CONTRACTOR’S ACTIVITIES IN THIS IMMEDIATE AREA DISRUPTED PACKED SOIL
THAT HAD ENABLED THE AGED PIPES TO MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY. THE
COMPACTION OF THE SOIL AND THE ADDED WIEGHT OF THE NEW DRAIN PIPE
MAY HAVE FUTHER INCREASED THIS IMPACT. HOWEVER, IT IS CLEAR IN THE
DIGGING PERMIT THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE
PRESENCE OF THE SEWER PIPE.
   B. SEWAGE BLOCKAGE/BACK-UP PRIOR TO THE LEAK WAS CLEARED BY
―BLOWING OUT‖ THE PIPE—FORCEFULLY PUSHING A HIGH VOLUME OF WATER
THROUGH THE PIPE TO BREAK UP THE BLOCKAGE. THIS PROCEDURE COULD
HAVE DISRUPTED THE AGED PIPE’S INTEGRITY.
5. LESSONS LEARNED ARE:
   A. ENSURE ACCURATE MAPPING OF ALL UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE.
ACCURATE UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE MAPS WILL ENABLE
CONTRACTORS TO LOCATE BURIED LINES CLOSE TO JOB SITES.
   B. DEVELOP A SCHEDULE TO ACCOMPLISH THE REPLACEMENT OF THE
CURRENT CLAY SEWER PIPES ESPECIALLY AT HIGH USE AREAS.
6. THE POC FOR THIS NOTAM IS HQ AFSPC/A7CVC, DSN 692-7717/9812.

                     EIIB ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS

A3.1. Purpose. This procedure provides a method to identify conditions that allow
environmental incidents to occur. It also helps identify direct causes of the incident or finding,
contributing factors resulting in the incident or finding, and ultimately the root cause that, if
resolved, would eliminate the conditions allowing the incident or finding to recur. These
instructions intend to assist the environmental novice to perform a root cause analysis, and
provide sufficient guidance such that analyses of similar incidents or findings by different people
will have the same result.
   A3.1.1. Root cause analysis enables the command to:
       A3.1.1.1. Understand the sequence of events that led to an incident or finding.
       A3.1.1.2. See the differences between actual conditions and desired conditions.
       A3.1.1.3. Know the root cause, contributing factors and direct cause of an incident or
       finding.
       A3.1.1.4. Provide a target at which to direct corrective actions and prevent recurrence.
   A3.1.2. This procedure shall be used to analyze the root cause of:
       A3.1.2.1. Substance releases (such as POL spills).
       A3.1.2.2. The receipt of a regulatory enforcement action.
A3.2. Definitions.
   A3.2.1. Contributing Factor. A factor that, if corrected, would not prevent the primary
   effect, but is important enough to be recognized as needing corrective action to improve the
   quality of the process or product.
   A3.2.2. Finding. A perceived non-compliant situation discovered during an Environmental,
   Safety and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and Management Program
   (ESOHCAMP) audit which, if not resolved, could lead to a regulatory enforcement action.
   A3.2.3. Incident. Any violation of local, state, federal, or host nation environmental
   standard, including any permit violations or releases above the reportable quantity.
   A3.2.4. Primary Effect. The incident or finding that the root cause allowed to occur and
   which will be prevented if the root cause is resolved.
   A3.2.5. Root Cause Analysis. The systematic process used to identify the most basic reason
   for an incident or finding which, if corrected, will prevent occurrence or recurrence.
   A3.2.6. Root Cause. The most basic reason for an incident or finding which, if corrected,
   will prevent recurrence. To be valid the root cause must:
       A3.2.6.1. Prevent recurrence when corrected.
       A3.2.6.2. Be within HQ AFSPC control.
       A3.2.6.3. Allow other objectives to be met (e.g., remain in operation).

  A3.2.7. Systemic Factors. Those interdependent activities or elements that interact in an
  orderly arrangement, one in relation to the other, to facilitate the desired performance of a
  major activity or organization.

Brief description of conditions at time of incident or finding:




Primary Effect       Description of incident or finding that the root cause analysis will prevent
                     from occurring or recurring. Identify the governing regulation or statute, if
                     applicable (i.e., improper labeling on hazardous waste drums).


Direct Cause         Explain exactly what action or condition resulted in an EIIB incident or
                     ESOHC finding (i.e., labels on hazardous waste drums were faded and
                     illegible).


Contributing         What factors led to the conditions described above? What allowed the
Factors              direct cause condition? (I.e., accumulation point manager allowed drum
                     labels to become sun bleached; were exposed to elements because there
                     was no covered storage available.)



Root Cause           Identify a basic root cause behind each contributing factor. Ask ―Why‖
                     repeatedly until cause can be broken down to basics. Refer to the outline
                     and categorize each from root cause listing.

A7.1. This Attachment is a NOTAM example:
SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL NOTAM LESSONS LEARNED FROM
ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD (EIIB)

1. THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT LESSONS LEARNED IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR
INFORMATION AND ACTION AS NECESSARY. IF A SIMILAR CONDITION EXISTS
AT YOUR FACILITY, WE RECOMMEND YOUR STAFF TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO
PREVENT POSSIBLE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. MAJOR COMMANDS ARE
REQUESTED TO RETRANSMIT THIS MESSAGE TO SUBORDINATE UNITS.

2. AN AFSPC BASE RECEIVED TWO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR DEFICIENCIES
IN PESTICIDE AND HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT. THE DEFICIENCIES
WERE:

A. FAILURE TO USE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DURING PESTICIDE
APPLICATION. APPLICATOR DID NOT WEAR GLOVES AS SPECIFIED ON THE
PESTICIDE LABEL.

B. INCOMPLETE PESTICIDE APPLICATION RECORDS. THE RECORDS WERE
MISSING APPLICATOR NAME AND PESTICIDE EPA REGISTRATION NUMBER.

C. FAILURE TO USE APPROVED SANITIZER AT FOOD SERVICE FACILITY. THE
INSTALLATION WAS USING AN UN-REGISTERED BLEACH PRODUCT AS A
SANITIZER.

D. FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE LENGTH OF ACCUMULATION TIME FOR
UNIVERSAL WASTE LAMPS. PERSONNEL LEFT OFF THE DAY OF THE MONTH ON
THE LABEL ON A BOX OF UNIVERSAL WASTE LAMPS IN ONE FACILITY. IN
ANOTHER FACILITY, PERSONNEL HAD REPLACED DAMAGED LABELS ON A BOX
OF UNIVERSAL WASTE LAMPS BUT FAILED TO MARK THE ACCUMULATION
START DATE ON THE NEW LABEL.

E. EXCEEDING THE ONE YEAR LIMIT FOR UNIVERSAL WASTE ACCUMULATION.
A CONTAINER OF UNIVERSAL WATE BATTERIES WAS INDAVERTANTLY LEFT
BEHIND AFTER A WASTE SHIPMENT EXCEEDING THE ONE YEAR TIME LIMIT.

F. EXCEEDING THE 55 GALLON ACCUMULATION LIMIT AT A SATELLITE
ACCUMULATION AREA. AN 85-GALLON CONTAINER AND A 30 GALLON
CONTAINER OF HAZARDOUS WASTES WERE STORED IN A SINGLE SATELLITE
ACCUMULATION AREA.

G. FAILURE TO LABEL HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTAINERS WITH AN
ACCUMULATION START DATE. THE FACILITY WAS INCORRECTLY MANAGING
PARTIALLY EMPTY AEROSOL CANS AS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INSTEAD OF
HAZARDOUS WASTES AND DID NOT LABEL THE CONTAINER PROPERLY.

H. FALIURE TO LABEL HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTAINERS WITH THE WORDS
―HAZARDOUS WASTE.‖ THE FACILITY WAS INCORRECTLY MANAGING
PARTIALLY EMPTY AEROSOL CANS AS HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INSTEAD OF
HAZARDOUS WASTES AND DID NOT LABEL THE CONTAINER PROPERLY.

I. FAILURE TO PROVIDE LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTION NOTIFICATIONS. THE
FACILITY WAS INCORRECTLY MANAGING PARTIALLY EMPTY AEROSOL CANS AS
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INSTEAD OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND DID NOT
COMPLETE THE REQUIRED LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTION NOTIFICATIONS.

J. FAILURE TO KEEP CONTAINERS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE CLOSED. THE
FACILITY WAS INCORRECTLY MANAGING PARTIALLY EMPTY AEROSOL CANS AS
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND DID NOT CLOSE THE CONTAINER.

3. THE ROOT CAUSES WERE IMPROPER USE OF PROCEDURES, INSUFFICIENT
TRAINING FOR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE PROGRAM MANAGER, AND
INADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES.

4. LESSONS LEARNED

A. ENSURE PERSONNEL ARE PROPERLY TRAINED FOR DUTIES ASSIGNED TO
THEM.

B. ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY BY INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL DUTIES IN
POSITIONS DESCRIPTION AND CONTRACTS.

C. CONDUCT ROUTINE INSPECTIONS OF ALL HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
LOCATIONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE.
D. DEVELOP WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH REGULATORS TO ENSURE GOOD
COMMUNICATION AND AVOID MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
